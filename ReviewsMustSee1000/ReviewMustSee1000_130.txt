		<fullReview>Just saw this film at a cinema near to my home in Wuhan China.I rated it very high because it is the first film in the last three years which can tell a story so smoothly. After the first Hollywood movie The Fugitive(lead actor Harrison Ford) was admitted in my country, the Chinese films changed forever by the affections of Hollywood movies. But the Chinese film makers did not know how to tell a story in the Hollywood way. Especially the film makers wanted to make BIG movie (the movie making cost high) to gain the high profit in the market, but in the same time they seemed like they forget how to tell a good story. But Chinese audience is very tolerable, they watch they comment and they despise. After all these years' BIG films' bombing, I watched a good story telling film, why should I not be satisfied?Disscusing this film in the technique way is not the important thing. All this years the BIG films all packed by the advanced techniques, but inside is a garbage.(sorry for the rude word, I can not say a better word for my poor English)Somebody (maybe a lot of foreign people) may want to watch more KongFu in Chinese films. But what I want to say is KongFu is not the only part of Chinese Culture, in fact it never was the major part of Chinese Culture in the past three thousand years. I can say it because I know our country and her history. The relationship and interaction of characters is the major part of film . This film is based on a novel Thunder Storm by Chao Yu in 40s of 20th century, and the background is changed to about 9th century.For the solid story by Chao Yu, the film is brilliant. And the success of this film is also a victory of Chinese writers. It proved that the real good novel can live all the time.Thank you for read this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw this AMAZING film tonight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of seeing this film with special personal appearances by Zhang Yimou and Gong Li... I have to say I was blown away by it! I was not expecting a story with such depth...The cinematography, the art direction, and the sheer enormity of the visuals were staggering. Great sword work... exquisite wire sequences... and HUGE battles - but all done with an intensity that's stunning. And even more, the acting was superb - Chow Yung Fat is a master, and his scenes together with Gong Li are beautifully emotional. Gong Li is more beautiful than ever in a role that demands huge range from the first scene and never lets up... She does her best work ever! I have nothing but praise for this film. I can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great dramatic acting within stunning visual jewel box</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not sure what some of the critics and spoilers of the COTGF story were expecting... I agree with the comparisons of Shakespearan tragedies and royal family intrigues, and the reference to dysfunctional families and meltdowns. Actually, I was thinking a lot about the Lion in Winter transported in a Chinese setting. In the English drama, the King simply has the Queen imprisoned for her political rebellion. In this movie, the Emperor decides to slowly poison the Empress because of her affair with his oldest son. Both lead characters have their reasons for sticking to their planned course of action. Also, I was reminded about the Borgias and some of the other Italian, French and Greek royal dramas when emotions get totally out of hand. Why do some viewers say that emotions are over the top or that the females are too scantily clad? This movie shows that Chinese characters can have very powerful human emotions: sexual attraction,lust, filial love, greed, ambition... just like any other people in the world.And yes, the Chinese Imperial Palace is displayed on an extravagantly grand scale just because it is possible to do it only in China! China has more people than any other country and can afford the larger than life scenes in opulent settings.The Emperor is at first shown as a kind father who wants to maintain a harmonious balance of family and state. Ultimately, we find out that he is a hypocritical megalomaniac who obliterated his first wife's family in his bid to become Emperor and will not allow anyone to cross his will in his kingdom. Interestingly, even for a blood thirsty dictator, he has his soft spot, and that is his love for his first born son, who means well but appears rather weak of morals.The acting is very powerful: the epitome of Chinese acting is in the facial expressions within a restrained and mechanical setting (see Chinese opera) and both Gong Li and Cho Yung Fat do a great job in their roles. Watch the eyes and the hands... The occasional outbursts of real emotion when the character is pushed beyond its limits: see the Empress when she occasionally cannot help herself and tries to seduce the Crown Prince as a woman; see the Emperor when he toys with the Empress and shows her his kindness in prescribing herbal potions and her defiant reply makes him toss his arm in frustration; the final eruption of the despot when the youngest prince dares to rear up with hate...I wonder if any dysfunctional family that lives with a totally controlling father and experiences his insane fits of punishment can relate with the control and violence shown at the end. He tolerates the Empress because she is a princess and very decorative and the mother of his 2 younger sons, and he even tolerated silently her affair for a while, but he will not tolerate her efforts to usurp him publicly. I can predict that the Empress will die a slow and humiliating death unless she finds a way to kill herself first.What I picked up very clearly is the subtle form of psychological cruelty that underlies the Chinese concept of revenge. Many long-standing cultures understand this form of torture very well which goes above and beyond killing a person. Think about the movie Jean De La Florette where the protagonist is slowly killed by the grinding labor of finding non-existing water. It is the slowly grinding down of a person's will through day-in and day-out abuse. See the daily poisoning of the Empress under the guise of caring for her health. See the impossible ending offer to the rebellious prince to choose between killing his own mother with regular offering of the herbal potion versus death under his father's hand - the prince decides to end his life to get out of this insane set of situation. He actually succeeds in comparison to the eldest prince who tries suicide the previous evening and fails to slice his own throat.Yes, the Emperor is ultimately an evil man because he sacrifices all that he loves for his political ambition to be the boss, but he has his human dimensions: he is attracted as a man to the 2 women he loves most in his life, as seen in their rare intimate moments together and he loves the first son unconditionally... Personally, I think that the characters are very well developed because they are complex, obsessed and quite multi-dimensional in their basic human drives. They make sense within the constraints in which they are cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, moving drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a highly charged docudrama epic, instead of the gladiator/hero-ish action flick its marketing led people to believe. With that said, this is a very gripping film, almost to the point of eerie realism, for those of us who are familiar with ancient royal family politics. Betrayal, back-stabbing, assassination, adultery, family tragedy,... everything that could go wrong in the the royal court happened, and were woven in a way that made the complicated plot that much more involving. More than once, I felt real tangible emotions as events with each character/turning point deepens the tragedy. The one aspect I don't like was the intensity of this film... its almost like watching films the likes of Saving Private Ryan... more like a stressful experience than simple entertainment.However, if you go in expecting extravagant sword fights, kung-fu, battles, you are going to be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me and my girlfriend watched this in Guangzhou, China. It isn't exactly a feel-good movie..It's hard to describe what this film does, without spoiling the movie. And that structure is it's strength. Suffice to say, this is a very strongly woven movie, a movie where direction and production are the stars.And that is also "Curse of the golden flower"'s weakness. This is, after all, a movie. Moviegoers are used to seeing the full spectrum of a movie; varied scenery and ambiance, multiple stories, realistic characters, a realistic society portrait, and so on. Certainly, this movie has strong characters, but like the imperial court setting, they are puppets. They never change their directions, they are forced to play the drama. Most of the action happens on the same 3-4 scenes, with the same characters. Like an opera; stereotypic, but intensely dramatic and glorious.That said, this movie had an effect on me, and as mentioned, it is very well crafted. Without a doubt, it shows Yimou Zhang's skills in his profession, and I do recommend it. But don't expect a "movie" in the classical sense, expect Greek tragedy or opera-style drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just so beautiful to even look at...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zhang Yimou was a very highly regarded filmmaker 5 years ago, before I had ever heard of him. Then he earned a place in my heart by directing both Hero and House of Flying Daggers. With those last two I felt like I was in martial arts movie heaven, so I would instantly be interested in any other future films that could approach those two in scope, talent, and action. Curse of the Golden Flower focuses mostly on the first two of those three traits, but besides, anything starring Chow Yun-Fat will earn my attention like a bullet to the head. I do own The Corrupter after all.This is a film about a royal family, rather dysfunctional at that, in the 928 AD Tang Dynasty. Chow Yun-Fat is Emperor Ping, who from the way he handles his family and can anticipate any kind of attack or counterattack seems like quite the ruthless warlord. He has three sons: one is a teenager, who isn't given much regard but knows more than others think. The eldest of the three is the current crown prince, but doesn't seem to have any special talents, other than drawing the affections of the wrong women. The middle son is a great warrior and, of course, is now the favorite of the father. But these characters may be just pawns to Empress Phoenix (Gong Li), who is mother to the younger two brothers and step-mother to the eldest. Under normal circumstances she might be a great mother, wife, and Empress, but current circumstances, including a mystery illness, have forced her to take actions involving a secret plot to remove her husband from the throne.This is not the action movie some might expect, though there is enough near the end to earn the R rating. It's basically a family drama, though in a rather fascinating and different setting for such a story. As you'd expect with a royal family, appearances are everything. Anything out of the ordinary has to happen in secret. All the normal everyday stuff is almost mechanical in nature. Whether you see dozens of servants getting up in the morning, or preparing food, or planting flowers, it all occurs in such a fiercely coordinated fashion. It would have been such a hard life, either being a royal or supporting one, but it would be a miserable life if one couldn't take any pride in what they did.The filmmakers who designed and implemented all the sets and costumes should take a hell of a lot of pride in what they do. The family of this story, even while destroying themselves (and therefore their empire) from within, are living in the most lavish accommodations and outfits I've ever seen. I usually don't think much of costuming or set design, but I must say that after seeing Chow Yun-Fat's golden suit of armor, or anything Gong Li was in, or the design of their personal quarters, I really hope for some Oscar recognition. Perhaps the best I've ever seen in those areas.Overall though, a good film, and a definite must for any Chow Yun-Fat fan to seem him play such a great villain, as with Sammo Hung in Sha Po Lang. It kept me interested throughout, but nothing too surprising happened in regards to story. It basically all went how I imagined it would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old time family drama in a stunning, extravagant setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the millions of chrysanthemum flowers, ten thousand soldiers and three prominent male cast (Chow Yun Fatt, Jay Chou and Liu Ye), one thing will capture your attention. Make that two.Gong Li and her titillating assets have almost overshadowed everything else in the movie. While it may not be historically accurate for 10th Century Tang Dynasty palace females to dress so scantily, director Zhang Yimou obviously wants to make a stylistic statement right from the opening scene.His play with colours was apparent from Hero. Curse of the Golden Flowers presents a kaleidoscope in its grandeur palace setting and elaborate costumes. The final fighting scene lead by Prince Jai (Jay Chou playing Jay?) the prince with golden armored warriors trampling over chrysanthemum is nothing short of impressive.Jay Chou had a difficult time playing Prince Jai, which required more complexity than a cool rider in Initial D. While emotional scenes with Gong Li drew some laughter from the audience, his final scene was noteworthy and articulation has improved.Kudos goes to Chow Yun Fatt and Gong Li. Chow has improved on his accent tremendously (which was very strange in Crouching Tiger) and portrayed the Emperor with magnitude and hysterical outrage. Look out for the scene as the usually mild mannered Chow punishes his son with both rising temper and hair.While the film obviously banks on Gong Li's bosoms, they shouldn't distract audience from her exceptional acting. It may be over-the-top at times, but she shows that nobody else can play this vengeful and solitary empress better than her. At this moment, she is the queen of the Chinese cinema.The story of betrayal, illicit affairs, chilled relations and dysfunctional families may be run on the mill and overdone. Drawing parallels with The Banquet by Zhang Ziyi is inevitable. Both are about an obsessed empress who craves for a relationship with the prince (Interestingly, both well-known for playing gay roles) and demands for more power from the emperor.Curse of the Golden Flower is not just soap drama but a period epic to impress with colours, opulence and sheer indulgence.http://themovieclub.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Golden Victory for an Extraordinary Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many superlatives can be applied to CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER that it's difficult to assess the movie without sounding totally biased and over the top. Few films have achieved the level of sheer visual beauty as this one with its interior shots of Chinese palace walls and columns illuminated by glowing hues of gold, emerald, and ruby. Few also have managed to weave the threads of so many tangled tortured relationships into such a spellbinding masterpiece of tragedy.The seductive visual beauty of this film's set and costumes makes a powerful contrast to the deadly schemes and betrayals that motivate the leading characters, members of the Tang Dynasty (618-907 BC). Just as the viewer finds him- or herself starting to feel sorry for one character--for example the Empress who is being tortured by her husband, or the Emperor who has been scandalously betrayed by his wife--it turns out that nobody is 100 percent innocent, not even the youngest of the royal family's three sons. If there's one great exception to the royal family's collective guilt, it would be the second son, Prince Jai, played with nobility and charisma by Chinese pop star Jay Chou. Having proved himself on the battlefield as a worthy contender for the throne, Prince Jai returns home only to find himself agonizingly torn between loyalty to his mother and father. The sacrifice he makes in the end turns out to be the most brutal tragedy of all.Yun Fat Chow as the Emperor and Gong Li in the role of the Empress give incredible performances as a couple whose love has long died but who remain together for the sake of political convenience. Behind their beautiful clothes, lavish furnishings, and perfectly choreographed movements, the two calmly seek each others' destruction. Yun Fat Chow's and Li's performance are on par with that of the world's best Shakespearean actors and the story of CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER itself can be compared to a combination of "King Lear" and "Oedipus Rex." One begins to truly appreciate the challenges directors face when considering the titanic logistics director Zhang Yimou had to deal with in order to make this film. Imagine the precision of detail and control it took to go, as he does with the movie, from one scene of dozens of beautiful feudal-era women waking and preparing to work in the palace, to another later on of a thousand warriors in gold armor charging against another thousand warriors in metallic black. With its brilliant storyline, glorious production, and extraordinary performances, CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER stands as a major triumph of modern film-making.by Aberjhani, author of "The Bridge of Silver Wings"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent movie if you got your expectation right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is a commercial movie of period drama with some sort of martial arts in it. If you're looking for anything deeper, then it's not for you although the movie is loosely based on a masterpiece of play in China. That being said, I think it's actually a nice movie.Story: B The story line is nothing amazing but flows well although not devoid of a few confusions or loopholes. For the people who're not familiar with all the power struggle, backstabbing stories of Chinese royal families, some relationships and emotions may seem a bit too much. And it did actually get a bit overheated at certain point possibly for theatrical tensions. But overall, it made sense to me. My major complaint is that he could have cut out some of the side stories while allowing the major line to a fuller development.Acting: B+ This movie focuses on Gong Li and she's a good actress. So, yes, she did a great job even though I wish it could have been toned down a bit. Chow Yun-fat is also good but his role is not as rich as hers. Liu Ye (crown prince) is adequate for his role and the character also has a limited range. Jay Zhou (the second son)is not quite up to par with the others (after all, he's not a professional actor). But he got better in the end.Visuals: A- Actually, I wanted to give it a B+ but I awarded it a higher mark for being so daring. It does have tons of colors and shades in it. Most of time, they actually work out cool, at least for me. But I totally understand if someone finds it way over-the-top. I actually like the fact that ZYM used bright colors, only if he had used fewer kinds of them. Those fighting scenes didn't quite catch my attention not because they're no good. Actually they're proper and effective. But since I've seem so many martial arts movies, they did not bring any surprises to meOverall, it's an entertaining movie with an understandable story and believable characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cursed but Delightful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Curse of the Golden Flower" is probably the most lavish costume drama in history, equaling or outdoing director Zhang Yimou's other spectaculars, such as "Hero" and "House of Flying Daggers." It's a sea of gold, red, blue, silver, with Yee Chung Man's improbably luxurious costumes. Armies clash, warriors fly, the imperial family self-destructs, and the Shakespearean plotting, feuding, and killing never stops. Also, in a likely surprise to cultural historians, "Curse" establishes 10th century China as the time and place for the perfection of the push-up bra. Although heaving bosoms are present throughout the movie, the opening scene is unequalled in its discreet Playboy fantasy of legions of young women getting ready for the arrival of the Emperor. It's spectacular and outlandish-funny at the same time, prompting simultaneous leering and laughing. The flamboyant Later Tang Dynasty (923-936 AD) is the subject of Zhang's film, the royal family giving "dysfunctional" a bad name. The Emperor (Chow Yun Fat) is a majestic, but thoroughly evil man, who oversees the systematic poisoning of the Empress (Gong Li, back with Zhang, the director who made her a star years ago before the two parted ways). The Empress, who eventually engineers the meltdown of the entire court, carries on an affair with her stepson, the Crown Prince (Liu Ye) who, in turn, sleeps with the beauteous Chan (Li Man), both blissfully - but not for long - unaware that they are closely related. Prince Jai (Jay Chou, in a great performance) is the middle son, aspiring to become the Crown Prince and then the Emperor (not necessarily in that order); Prince Yu (Qin Junjie) is the youngest son, not well positioned for the succession, but keep your eyes on him - he may just have a surprise coming. This is just a fraction of the what's going on in the Imperial Palace, but Zhang's genius as a director is proved once again. He is telling this complex, even convoluted story in such straightforward manner that it can be followed easily. Zhang, who is in New York right now, directing a Tan Dun world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera (having done Puccini's "Turandot" in Beijing), is the most operatic of film directors, with an epic sweep, flamboyance, gripping drama. (Speaking of the Zhang-Tan Dun partnership, which gave "Hero" a magnificent soundtrack, it's a shame that the composer for "Curse" is Shigeru Umebayashi, whose music is smaltzy and unoriginal.) Zhang quotes an old Chinese saying, "Gold and jade on the outside, rot and decay on the inside," and "Curse" has it all, although the gold-and-jade surface is so ostentatiously brilliant that all that portentous stuff within lacks depth and believability. At some of the most dramatic moments, there is laughter in the audience: the fun is too much to bother with what's supposed to be hot and heavy, the intended drama turns into melodrama. But, again, the fun is great and nonstop; bosoms may well heave merrily in the seats as well as they do, dramatically, on the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much that glitters, little that's gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curse of the Golden Flower is a step up in budget from Zhang Yimou's Hero and House of Flying Daggers, but it's a step back in terms of drama: much that glitters, little that's gold. Set in a palace where everything is a spectacular and highly regimented ritual done on an epic scale, whether it is servants dressing by the hundreds or preparing food and medicine, it focuses on the kind of royal family who make the Plantageneats in The Lion in Winter look like the Waltons. He's poisoning her, she's planning a coup against him and the Crown Prince has gone from an affair with his stepmom to one with his half-sister... Yet for all the poisoning and plotting the problem is that it's rather dull. It never descends into outright boredom, but it doesn't particularly engage for most of the first two thirds.As usual with Yimou, the moral of the tale is ambiguous: on one level it could be don't go against the natural order, no matter how unfair it seems (father knows best, even if he is poisoning mum), on another it could be know your place no matter how inexplicably cruel you may find the ruling regime. Or it could just be a good old-fashioned tragedy with unhappy endings all round. On a more dramatically successful film maybe the ambiguity wouldn't be so niggling, but with such huge resources thrown at it to such little effect, you feel that it should all add up to SOMETHING.True, a lot of money has been visibly lavished on the film, but it rarely feels wisely spent. That the corridors of the palace look like they've been designed by a Bombay stallholder with unlimited funds, more garish than opulent, make many of the interiors look more a monument to bad taste than a glittering façade to hide the corruption within. The wonderfully conceived use of colour and design of Hero and House of Flying Daggers here gives way to visual overkill. Forget the golden flower, this definitely suffers from the curse of too much CGi in the final battle as the addition of an increasingly unfeasible number of perfectly synchronized digital extras completely swamp the human element the scene needs to succeed. When the CGi golden army attacks the palace it doesn't really impress as much as it should - the CGi is good enough, but it's also too controlled and uniform, lacking the feeling of spontaneity you get with real extras. Maybe it's just that the look is so overexposed that digital extras seem too much of a cheat to impress the way that going to all the trouble of using the real thing did. After all, when so much is done in the computer, what physical human effort is left to admire? Nor does the individual fight choreography impress as much as in Yimou's previous films. There is even some surprisingly clumsy editing of mismatched shots in the 'smaller' scenes that make you wonder whether Yimou wants to draw attention to them or simply doesn't care enough to finesse them. Perhaps it's telling that the film's most visually effective moment is the massive co-ordinated cleanup operation after the battle as the bodies are dragged away and the palace is quickly restored to normality and that only the film's final scene has the kind of real emotional power that the rest of the film could have done with.It seems oddly significant that despite the epic scale, only 8 of the cast are credited while the crew, designers, costumers and computer technicians are billed at great length: people really don't seem to be the film's priority. That's sadly reflected in some of the performances. Perhaps it's because the once prolific Chow Yun Fat has worked so little this century that it's genuinely surprising to see how much he's visibly aged as the Emperor. While this is used to some effect, we rarely see why he does what he does, which tends to render him more of a shallow villain when the circumstances really merit. It's certainly hard to see him as the wronged party when his revenge is so ruthless and calculated. But sadly most of the performances are decidedly one-note while the cast wait for their big scenes, with only the female cast making much impression (the film is good on the submissive role women were forced to accept). Yet as good as Jin Chen is as the Emperor's wronged first wife, it's Gong Li who really impresses, and how. As the Empress trying to hold onto her sanity long enough to depose her husband before his poisoned medicine turns her into a living ghost she's remarkably powerful without ever overstating: it's the small details rather than the grand gestures that really count with her. Unfortunately as her stepson and lover, Ye Liu overacts the sensitive angst almost enough to make Nicholas Tse look subtle, yet somehow in their scenes together Gong Li still manages to keep them from sliding away into pure melodrama. Sadly, her efforts are never quite enough to make up for the film's shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1950s Camp Fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way to visualize this campy historical spectacle is to imagine Douglas Sirk and Sam Peckinpah collaborating on a 1950s decadent Roman Empire movie starring Clark Gable as the Emperor and Joan Crawford as the Empress.The story is set at the imperial court in fictitious 10th century China. The Emperor (Chow Yun-fat in a goatee, looking unnervingly like Charlie Chan), is the picture of Confucian rectitude and virtue. It's only a picture; with the aid of the Imperial Doctor, he is poisoning the Empress with a slow poison that will drive her crazy. The Empress (an imperious Gong Li) suspects that something is going on; she is planning a coup d'etat for the night of the Chrysanthemum Festival. As part of her plan, she is carrying on an affair with the Crown Prince, who is the Emperor's son by his deceased first wife. The Crown Prince is also carrying on an affair with the daughter of the Imperial Doctor; he doesn't know that she is personally in charge of slipping the poisoned ingredient into the Empress's prescription. Despite his active love life, the Crown Prince is a self-doubting dweeb who has never left the Imperial Palace. Meanwhile, Second Brother, who is the embodiment of martial virtue and filial piety, has just come home after a three year hitch fighting the barbarians on the frontier. He honors his father, loves his mother, thinks he's a better man than his half brother, and wouldn't mind being Emperor one day. Third Brother, still in his mid-teens, is shy and doesn't say a lot, but he has has mastered Yogi Berra's principle that you can observe a lot by watching. He has his own ideas and his own ambitions. Meanwhile, the Emperor is beginning to think that the Imperial Doctor and his daughter Know Too Much, and he personally knows a good deal more than he's let on. Then the First Mrs. Emperor turns up alive, revealing secrets that upset a lot of apple carts.The sets and the clothes make the court of Louis XIV at Versailles look like a trailer park, and I, for one, had never realized that 10th century China had mastered the tavern wench style push-up bra a thousand years before Victoria's Secret. We get opulent palace interiors, gorgeous costumes, hordes of groveling male and female servants, elaborate rituals, midnight gallops, shocking revelations, stunning betrayals, stabs in the back, ninja assassins, acrobatic swordplay, both individual and en masse, and blood splattered everywhere. It's all done in the gaudiest, most saturated color imaginable, with a particular emphasis on gold and crimson. At the end, there is one person left standing. The servants come out, sweep up the dead bodies, sluice away the blood and put out fresh flowers. The Chrysanthemum Festival goes off with barely a hitch.If there is a moral, it is that appearances must and will be preserved at all costs. It's all empty calories, like cotton candy, but if you like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing you'll like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful movie with absolutely no soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I went into the last movie I'm watching of 2006 with very low expectations after reading some reviews, and I must say I was still kind of disappointed coming out of it. I don't know what Zhang Yimou is doing, but his movies have been on a steady decline since the great "Hero". This movie, like "House of Flying Daggers", is BEAUTIFULLY made, but lacks substance.Let's talk about the cinematography first. The colors, details, patterns, and the views of the palace were so expertly filmed that I was in awe the first 30 minutes of the movie. Zhang continues his perfect track record in making spectacular visual epics in this movie. The acting was also very good, anchored by experienced great actors like Chou Yun-Fat and Gong Li. Even with my average score, if you are the type of movie goer that appreciates great visual feats in movies, I would recommend you check this movie out.Now for the disappointing bits. There wasn't too much plot involved other than your standard double-crossing/spy-vs-spy story. It reached the point of absurdity when new characters were introduced an hour into the movie to add a new plot twist in the already complicated web of intrigue. The entire process felt very heavy handed and damaged the impact of the tragedies in the movie. The battle scenes were very fake (you can easily tell it was CGI) and the ending was horrendous. It just left the entire audience hanging, and did not tie up the most important plot line of the movie. It really left a bad taste in my mouth after watching the movie.Anyway, I hope Zhang's next movie focuses more on the plot (like Hero) and less on the spectacles.

		<shortDescription>The Masterpiece of 2006</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zhang Yimou's latest film will not be liked by everyone. Many will claim that this is another copy of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". That is a shame because this movie is a true masterpiece equaling "Hero", "Red Sorghum" and "Raise the Red Lantern". Although there are martial arts sequences, this is not a martial arts film at its heart. Rather, it is a historical grand opera epic. In addition to great sight and sound, "Curse of the Golden Flower" boasts great performances by Chow Yun Fat, Gong Li and Liu Ye. Even, Jay Chou is surprisingly good. The movie works in so many levels and has a frantic pace that is unlike anything out there at this time. It is somewhat melodramatic, but also grandly tragic. This is what grand opera is all about. This is cinema at its best. This film will not break any box office record (in the US anyway). This film will not win many critics awards or Oscars. However, in years to come, this will be remembered as the Masterpiece of 2006.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curse of the Golden Flower ? Intrigue and over-scaled fighting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curse of the Golden Flower's intrigue is very interesting and offer a complex story. The over- opulence is even easy to disregard, until the fighting begins. It's like applying fine white lace to a garment made of coarse unbleached wool. It's messy. All the refinements get lost very quickly.The visuals are very poignant, the acting is good for the most part, and the scenario quite enjoyable. Had they cut out all the fighting, it would have made a pretty good movie. I would definitively enjoyed it more.However, if you're a fan of Asian style wire fighting, impossible odds, beyond measure heroes in action, then you'll have no problem enjoying this fine film. If not, then patiently sit through the battles and wait for the conclusion for closure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic imperial during China's Tang dynasty spectacular and colorfully directed by Yimou Zhang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10th Century , during China's Tang dynasty the emperor has taken the princess of a neighboring province as wife. She has borne him two sons and raised his eldest . On the eve of the Chong Yang Festival, golden flowers fill the Imperial Palace. The Emperor (Chow Yun Fat) returns unexpectedly with his second son, Prince Jai (Jay Chou). His pretext is to celebrate the holiday with his family, but given the chilled relations between the Emperor and the ailing Empress (Gong Li), this seems disingenuous . The control of emperor over his dominion is complete, including the royal family itself . For many years, the Empress and Crown Prince Wan (Liu Ye), her stepson, have had an illicit liaison and unspeakable secrets are hidden within the Forbidden City. Feeling trapped, Prince Wan dreams of escaping the palace with his secret love Chan (Li Man), the Imperial Doctor's daughter. Meanwhile, Prince Jai, the faithful son, grows worried over the Empress's health and her obsession with golden chrysanthemums. The Emperor harbors equally clandestine plans; the Imperial Doctor (Ni Dahong) is the only one privy to his machinations. When the Emperor senses a looming threat, the emperor relocates the medic's family from the Palace to a remote area . While they are en route, mysterious assassins attack them. Chan and her mother, Jiang Shi (Chen Jin) are forced back to the palace. At the night, thousands of soldiers are trampled as blood spills across the Imperial Palace in a spectacular final battle .This luxurious epic film was marvelously filmed with impressive production design , colorful cinematography and breathtaking scenes . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with dark surprises , thrills , fierce combats and groundbreaking battles . Amid the glamour and grandeur of the scenarios is developed a familiar intrigue in Shakespeare's King Lear style , including betrayal , incest , crime and exploring the dark side of Chinese empire . Impressive and rousing fights with thousands of golden armored warriors reenacted by lots of extras . Overwhelming attack on the fortress where is relocated the doctor's family , being subsequently copied in ¨Kung Fu Panda¨ . Wonderfully photographed especially when against a moonlit night, thousands of chrysanthemum blossoms are trampled as blood spills across the Imperial Palace. The motion picture was glamorously directed by Yimou Zhang who often works with the actress Li Gong and as well as most of his films , it begins with the title displayed in Chinese calligraphy style. Zhang forms part of China's Fifth Generation of filmmakers, who began making films after the Cultural Revolution , others from this group include Chen Kaige and Jinzhan Zhang . He is an expert on Chinese epics such as ¨Shanghai Triad¨ , ¨Hero¨ ,¨House of Flying Daggers¨ , ¨The flowers of war¨ and of course the Oscarized and successful ¨Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon¨ . Rating : Better than average . Worthwhile watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare with ninjas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shakespearian and flawed, sublime and ridiculous, moving and irritating, talky and with an impossibly high body count, King Lear and Hamlet meet Hero and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, the Curse of the Golden Flower by Zhang Yimou is nearly impossible to describe. There is something great about it, but also something unconvincing. The result, while interesting, is uneven to say the least.Ancient China: the Emperor (Chow Yun-Fat) is slowly poisoning his wife (Gong Li), who has a relationship with her stepson, prince Wan (Ye Liu), heir to the throne. The other two sons are noble Jai (Jay Chou) and young Yu (Junjie Qin). Jai decides to help his mother overthrow the Emperor, while Wan takes his father's side. Chan (pretty Man Li), daughter of the Emperor's doctor (Dahong Ni) and a mysterious woman (Jin Chen) are also involved.There are moments of sheer beauty in the Curse of the Golden Flower, but also scenes looking phoney and contrived. Some set-pieces are great - ninjas assaulting a house in a misty valley, golden and silver armours clashing - but other bits look uncomfortably computer-generated. Hero was on another level.Every frame is saturated with deep colours, creating an oppressive atmosphere inside the maze-like palace, with the always-repeating ritual of the "cure" with which the Emperor poisons his wife. The movie quickly captured my interest. Then it lost momentum with some awkward moments. Fortunately, it recovered with the bitter last act.Acting is strong. Gorgeous, elegant Gong Li plays the Empress, probably the character with more screen time. She gives a powerful performance as a woman driven by strong feelings: hate towards her husband, maternal love for her son Jai, forbidden passion for her stepson, jealousy towards young Chan. Also excellent is always charismatic Chow Yun-Fat as the Emperor, a cruel tyrant who is genuinely fond of his sons. Jay Chou and Ye Liu are fine as the two princes faced with moral dilemmas. Hero was one of the best-looking movies ever made, but I found it morally reprehensible. Here the message is more ambiguous, with Yimou trying to show the brutality and solitude of power in this Shakespearian tragedy set in Ancient China.The result falls somewhere between "brilliant but flawed" and "interesting failure", worth watching for the remarkable performances.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Lanterns, the return</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with a slightly heavy heart. I have been a huge fan of Zhang Yimou since seeing Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern some years ago. But while i really enjoyed 'Flying Daggers' as pure entertainment, i thought 'Hero' was little more than a beautiful propaganda piece for the government of China. Based on reading some reviews of 'Curse', i was beginning to think that he was the new Leni Riefenstahl.But how wrong I was - I'm very surprised that all the critics who lined up to explain to western audiences the anti-government metaphors of his earlier movies have reviewed this as a pure soap opera, a glorified 'Dynasty'. But they seem to forget that the exact same could be said of his earlier masterpieces such as Red Lantern. Those movies too were sometimes stagy and fully of internal dramatic inconsistencies that didn't stand up to too much analysis. But this movie is every much a devastating critique of centralized power as any of his earlier movies. Anyone with even a passing acquaintance with Chinese history and politics knows that the current government of China is very much a continuum of earlier dynasties, with Party Officials performing the same roles as the old Confucian bureaucrats. This movie is a straightforward satire of such centralized power with clear modern parallels. The clearing up of the aftermath of the 'coup' and the similarities with what happened after Tiananmen Square in 1989 is all too obvious.Anyway, having gotten that off my chest, suffice to say this is a gloriously over the top epic with staggering settings and set pieces, and of course it has Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li in the same movie, which should be enough pure pleasure for anyone.I had my strong doubts up to this, but I think in years to come critics will see this as one of a series of truly masterful movies from Zhang Yimou that will collectively consist of a coherent and brilliant artistic and political statement, not to mention pure kick ass cinematic pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chinese filmmakers have a double curse. They have this tradition where individuals only matter in context, so when there is a spat between a man and his wife, it can only be illustrated in large sweeps of society. This is compounded by the ability to marshal (real, human) extras and extravagant sets on a scale unmatchable anywhere else.I liked this filmmaker's earlier projects. "To Live" really was able to show the inside of a man by mapping it to lurches and sweeps in the world around him. "Daggers" was at least a masterpiece of ballet. And "Hero," probably my favorite, was the most cinematic, expressing real human qualities in luxurious cinematic terms. Who can forget the spatial existence of discovered deceit in the flickering flames in front of the throne?This is a wholly different formula in how the internals of a family sweep into the environment. The setup is an extraordinary web of relationships between two families. Some commentors think this is drawn from soap opera, but I think they have a common ancestor instead. This is Greek, and though on daytime TeeVee you will get similar relationship complexities, they will have their tethers to the cosmos broken. They will be single souls adrift in the world. These are souls that command the world, apparently. It could have worked. Why it didn't I think is because the filmmaker decided to root himself in the magisterial. It probably was influenced by the fact that he is a former lover of the female star and there are some reflections between that situation and what we see. Its "Annie Hall" with flying ninjas instead of lobsters. Breasts instead of the swirling of engagement. Narrative mistrust where Woody had open exploration and experimentation. Diane and Woody were in a place, a city that colored them. These characters here ARE the city.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>absolutely ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zhang Yimou's third journey into martial arts territory shows an honest attempt to improve the story side, but it's still an over-the-top, over-produced mess which is hampered by zero character development, laughably bad histrionics, and complete reliance on spectacle.Adapted from "Thunderstorm" by Cao Yu (transplanted into the Tang Dynasty rather than 1930s China), as well as borrowing liberally from Shakespeare, Yimou drops us right into the middle of a major family feud without any setup or backstory. The term "family feud" is really an understatement as this family is totally screwed up. Rather than go into detail and give away any potential spoilers, let's just say that the emperor (Chow Yun-Fat) and empress (Gong Li) don't get along, to put it mildly. What follows is a series of affairs, incestuous relationships, murder, intrigue, double crossings, triple crossing, and quadruple crossings. Sounds good? Not on your life. Things don't develop naturally because Yimou robbed us of real characters. As such, these "shocking revelations" come at us like a series of knuckle balls, bashing us in the face not because they're truly shocking or even all that surprising, but because they're hammed up in grand soap-operatic fashion. It's sure to elicit more than a few chuckles and boisterous fits of laughter as characters tremble, cry, scream, and then tremble some more as these Perry Mason-esquire revelations come to light.Gong Li, a talented actress in every sense of the word, is reduced to playing second fiddle to her impressive cleavage. She's given little room to breathe and no room to act or develop her character beyond that of another tragic victim. Chow Yun-Fat, also making his long-awaited return to Chinese cinema, is sorely misused as he spends most of the film sitting down looking menacing, that is until he whips off his belt to deliver some unintentionally funny discipline. The visuals, impressive indeed, ultimately prove too garish and distracting in a film that features the most over-the-top performances in years.Cao Yu's original work was notable in part because of the well drawn characters and heartbreaking interactions, but Yimou (again) seems more concerned with that elusive Oscar rather than actually telling a compelling story with engaging characters. Strangely enough, the fundamental theme behind the film, that what is golden on the outside is rotten within, seems to also describe not only this waste of celluloid, but other lame attempts by Feng Xiaogang (The Banquet) and Chen Kaige (The Promise) to duplicate the success of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which I don't even think is a very good film). All of these hack directors need to STOP making films, because they have clearly forgotten how.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensational and lavish, contains subtlety beyond traditional western fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those key words covered by this film are powerful, covered as they are by the lavish setting. A fictional account, nominally set in the Tang dynasty period, this movie is an exploration of ego within a family.The Empress, a cypher of the ego of a mother in a modern family, desires love from all quarters. She is not satisfied with having been a conduit to her husband's ambition, she requires more. But she won't get more because her husband won't surrender his first love/ ideal and because of an illicit affair she has had with her stepson. Were the movie a vehicle for Communist idyllic fantasy, the affairs of the empress would be a joke. The affairs aren't explained, however, and the affairs are merely obstacles within court intrigue that need to be navigated. Communist motifs are present, but the film stands without the need to highlight them.The eldest son has an ego that needs the love of a young woman, having claimed his stepmother. He is disgraced, and willing to surrender his inheritance claim to his younger brother. He is honorable and loyal, in his own way. He is compromised, wanting his father's love, while having stepped on his father's coat train.Typical of a communist motif, the youngest son has an ego too, which is not being examined by the others, yet which invites tragedy in ways reminiscent of 'Hero'.One would think that the ego of the father be satisfied. It isn't. Herod Antipas is said to have murdered his wife, and preserved her body in honey. The father in this case seems to be doing this twice. He hasn't achieved his ideal, and he is willing to crash, or crash through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curse of the Golden Flower is the latest movie from brilliant director Yimou Zhang. Now the director is obviously best know for his brilliant last two flicks, Hero and House of Flying Daggers. Hero was a beautiful movie, a film that while not featuring the most amazing fights in terms of excitement, they worked in terms of art. Swirling leaves billowing around a pair as they fight with swords. Scenes like that and running on water just make the movie something for the eye to adore. House of Flying Daggers however dropped the artsy fartsiness somewhat, while each fight still looked amazing, it worked more in action terms. The audience got more of a thrill out of it. Anyway, both of the movies were absolutely brilliant. So what of his latest flick, Curse of the Golden Flower? The most expensive movie made ever in China? Well you can easily tell it was the most expensive movie made in China, you just have to see ten minutes of footage. The sets, the costumes, everything looks absolutely stunning. Every single piece of money put into the movie is up there gleaming at you in some way. But the movie is not all about the looks, many critics say that the movie looks beautiful but is really shallow as well. I really disagree. This movie while slow at the beginning is very much a story driven film, not relying purely on the fight sequences. Instead grand performances, intriguing plot twists and beauty make this movie something to savour.First I will mention the performances, as it is the performances that surprised me most in this movie. Easily the best in the film has to be Gong Li as the scheming Empress. Gong Li is the latest actress from China to break through into the international market with the likes of Miami Vice and Hannibal Rising. Here we see the full extent of her capabilities and she is a force to be reckoned with. Her character is layered and complex, both victim and villain. Her character goes through a large array of emotions and Gong Li displays each one with a certain power and intensity. Opposite her, and almost as good, is Chow Yun Fat as the Emperor. Now there are no delusions as to what character his character is, his character is clearly the villain, and Chow Yun Fat is clearly having a ball playing him. In fact all of the royal family is played very well, Jay Chou, Ye Liu and Junjie Qin all excel in their roles as the three princes. Each actor bounces off the other perfectly and displays the complicated relationships of the family to perfection. Two scenes of note featuring all the family have to be the table sequence where the family meet, and a later sequence near the end of the film.Of course the action and fight sequences are what a lot of people will go to see this movie for. Admiteddly not a lot of them happen until the final half hour, the first hour of which barely any fights happen whatsoever. However, when the action does eventually start, especially the movies climatic sequences, the film is just something to behold. The scope seems a lot more epic in the final few fights, Hero mainly focused on simple two person fights, but Curse of the Golden Flower focuses on grand fights with thousands of people clashing against one another. But as I said the first hour there is practically no action, and admittedly this can be seen as a flaw. I found the first hour to be a bit slow at times, only about 45 minutes in did I find it a bit slow and wanting for something to happen, no sooner had I though this that a revelation came tumbling out of nowhere and sent the movie a much faster pace.Overall Curse of the Golden Flower is a movie that not only looks beautiful, but has a brilliant storyline going for it and a cast that never disappoints. A brilliant movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, you will be struck by the lavishness of the decors and the elaborate "choreography" of the palace servants. Then it will be the truly exquisite costumes and armors throughout that will impress you. The lighting and colors are also quite wondrous. Visually, it's all quite stunning sometimes to the point of distraction. But those are secondary considerations. The story was delightfully complex yet understandable and for most of the first 2/3 of the movie revolves around palace intrigue and family secrets. The emperor and empress were wonderful in their roles. Gong Li in particular is amazing at conveying emotion without saying a word. Unfortunately, as it went on, I realized that two of the sons weren't up to the acting quality of their "parents". They were both somewhat lacking in terms of emoting and charisma and it undermined all the drama going on.Besides the opulent and magnificent production values, this was obviously filmed by a great director at the peak of its form with its carefully constructed yet original cinematography. There are moments of quiet beauty and epic battles with moments I had never seen anywhere before. Actually throughout the last act, my mouth often stood agape at the sheer coolness of it all. I wish I had seen this movie on a big screen or at least high-definition because this grand spectacle deserves it. Why do I not rate this higher? Because I wish it had more emotional resonance (like Hero or House of Flying Daggers both from the same director) and a few better actors would have helped a lot. In finishing, without spoiling anything, one should admire the courage and intelligence of the Chinese director at indirectly denouncing the current Chinese regime.Rating: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is a sumptuous and beautiful film ? a real treat for the senses. Every shot has been painstakingly put together, and the colour palette on display here is like nothing you've ever seen before. The scenery is almost overpowering in its luxury. Now usually, I'd follow this description up by saying something like 'unfortunately, there's no plot to go with it' ? but not in this case. CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is a Shakespearian tragedy told anew and a film Kurosawa himself would have been proud of.At its heart, this is a family drama. Corruption, secrets and lies always seem to be present at the highest households in the country, and it's no exception here. A web of blackmail, adultery, incest, poison and murder unfolds in a completely spellbinding way and it's an added bonus that the cast can do the story so much justice. Gong Li is fantastic as the centrepiece of the film, the doomed empress trying to get herself out of an impossible situation; the three actors playing the sons are all brilliant in their own way, and Chow Yun-Fat makes for a hissable yet understandable villain.Of course, there's the martial arts too. While I would have preferred for more realism, there's no denying the artistry of the fights here. Watching shadowy assassins flying through the air or an army of golden warriors battling it out with their silver enemies is breathtaking and tremendously entertaining. This is a film that starts off slowly before ending on a real high ? a modern masterpiece at that. I hated HERO and really liked HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS ? but CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is the best yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilded walls, delusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the other comments point out the visual exuberance of this. Indeed the Tang palace shown here would make the Versailles look boorish. The film is a feast, a hot shower of melted color and gold. Walls are gilded, pillars are fire colored, ceilings are purple. Every frame an ornate sculpture. You can see why Zhang would be picked for the Olympic ceremony two years later - the festival at the end is like a trial run.But now to see the makings of things clearly instead of being dazzled. It's precisely a dynastic beauty that overpowers the eye, clouds the mind with visual smoke. Gold here is both opulence and delusion, beauty and ignorance, not unconnected these two. Within this gilded cage unfolds Shakespearean drama with tragic irony in abundance between emperor, wife and three sons.The idea, deeply Chinese, is that there's heavenly order in the world and man must take his place in it and devise his own order to mirror the higher one. The Chinese had indeed mulled over this long and hard to devise their own order that would support an empire. We see everything ordered here and the small rituals involved. Elaborate preparations are underway for a festival that celebrates the unity of heaven and man. But the medicine she's ritually made to take every day (to "balance her energies") is poisoned; an indictment of the artificial harmony favored so much by the Chinese.It is a household that we enter essentially. Scaled down from imperial machinations that involve poison and succession to the throne, we see an unhappy family. When the imperial doctor who has been administering the poison with his daughter is felled upon by mysterious figures in black in a most marvelous scene outdoors, these are apparitions of guilt that have come to haunt, puppets on strings descending from the sky. It's karma, another kind of heavenly order. Something went wrong once in this family and the world makes it wash up in front of them.I like that it's all abstracted within walls here, that we don't venture outside for sweeping history. It has elaborate action only near the end and using the same gilded abstraction. And that it builds the same order for itself around a household essentially and karmas set in motion. The ending is ruinous of course. All because a man took a wife out of convenience one day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On a technical standpoint it's definitely Zhang Yimou's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who is slowly becoming a big fan of Zhang Yimou's work I decided I might give this a try. Out of the movies I have seen that he's done of Hero, House Of Flying Daggers and this that this is by far the weakest of his movies, which is not to say that I didn't like it - I just preferred Flying Daggers and Hero more. Even on it's own I'd say it is worth a watch.The main focus is this Borgia-type family of the Chinese Emperor trying to seize more power. The Emperor is poisoning his wife - slowly but surely, his first born wants to make his mother happy, the Empress finds out about the poisoning and wants to confront the Emperor about it and stop him from continuing by any means necessary, The Emperor's second born is in a love relationship with a slave girl who's a part of a family that's secretly trying to kill the Emperor and also trying to stop an... incestuous relationship with the Empress and the third born barely knows anything about what's going on.So what's good about this movie. Well as typical of Yimou's work the cinematography is excellent, The fight scenes are very impressive and as typical of Hero, the scale of everything is just huge. I'm not kidding when I say that I think Yimou took the best technical elements of both Hero and House of Flying Daggers and combined both of them to make a technical marvel. I think especially in the battle scenes in the last third... It looks like something out of Hollywood (actually I may go so far as to say it looks better).On a non-technical standpoint, the story maybe where it falls flat. The first third is completely uninteresting unless you love looking at art design and the characters... This may seem obvious but they aren't that likable and even then they aren't that interesting.On a more positive note about the story, I liked Chow Yun Fat's performance as The Emperor. Basically he comes across as the guy who seems reasonable unless you do something to upset him, when that happens - run, but when I put it like that you might expect him to play it basically like a whiny spoiled brat, but he doesn't. All I have to say is that I do want to see more of his movies.So I just preferred House of Flying Daggers and Hero more. But if you are looking for a movie about diabolical family trying to double-cross and back-stab each other then this is probably going to be a major fill for you. This does have some really good things going for it, like that cinematography, I could talk about how this movie looks good for hours. If you want to watch this then I'd say it is definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An intense drama with superb production design.It's the kind of drama that we used to see in our childhood with family politics involved and the fight is for the throne. Who is going to be the heir? How to take the throne from a king who is good at fighting but not so kind at heart? This forms the whole story and indeed that is what is the whole movie.Characters are shown as they are, and slowly as the film progresses, their real motives are revealed. From crown prince to the empress to a doctor, everyone is doing something for themselves and its their selfishness that has drowned them. At the beginning, I thought it would be hard to understand story, but as things got simpler, I started actually disliking it. It's a complex story with every character being pivotal to the culmination of the story, yet with each detail revealed I was getting to know more of the story and as knowledge grew, interest reduced and that's what happened. Yet, this is a very hardcore drama and a great drama too. We don't see so much of politics involved and each character plotting against the other in many films. Now, before I go ahead reviewing anything, costume design and set design which combine into production design are aspects I loved this movie for. The climax fight that is choreographed superbly shows a glimpse of how authentic the whole film is. From beginning to the end, the palace, the kings costume, the queen's embroidery each has it's own distinct artistry and all are beautiful. Gong Li as the empress has showed great variation in emotion and so did Chow Yun Fat as the emperor. All others showed emotion well. Sound design was good tooNow, this is good movie and not a great one though, a 3/5 is what I think is apt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never mess with the Emperor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film from Director Zhang Yimou about Emperor Ping (Chow Yun-Fat) of the Tang Dynasty and his newly crowned Empress Phoenix (Gong Li), who has developed a secret affair with her elder stepson, Prince Wan (Liu Ye). In addition, the Emperor's controlling ways over the kingdom have been challenged and questioned by middle son Prince Jai (Jay Chou) and the ailing Empress. This all leads to a brilliant and dramatic display of rebellion, corruption, jealousy and war as Prince Jai and the Empress attempt to overthrown the evil Emperor.The setting of the magnificent Forbidden City was done in such beauty and color that it will leave you in awe at its stunning display of majesty and power. I have visited the Forbidden City a few times and it was great to see it portrayed in the movie when it was the home of powerful royalty.The costumes used for the cast, especially that of the beautiful Empress, were exquisite and elegant and, at just over an hour and a half, this movie had just the right amount of drama and action to make it entertaining and worth the view when I first saw it on a plane ride.***spoiler ahead*** I wished that the ending could have been different, for example, showing the Emperor getting a taste of his own bitter medicine. However, I guess it just shows how far a king would go to preserve his legacy and grip on power and how even the most powerful and seemingly prosperous family could meet its decline through greed and misfortune. ***spoiler ends*** Overall, it's a stunning movie that really showcases the majestic and supreme life of royalty in ancient China.Grade B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this is a visually beautiful film. The manipulations of the entitled classes is the main plot point. The ending is not at all positive or happy. I know life is not always pleasant, but it is amazing to realize how much of life's unhappiness is artificially caused by those in power. To me the bad guy in this drama is merely an *******. Same as Henry the 8th and all those who abuse power. I was disappointed in this movie, but I can see how others might find it a beautiful, even a great film.

		<shortDescription>A feast for the eyes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this movie on TV the other night while flicking around, and could not turn it off! As a Westerner with little knowledge of Chinese history or culture, (any knowledge that I do have has come from a smattering at school as a child and some movies as an adult), this visually spectacular work grabbed my attention and would not let me go.As has been said by others here, this picture is set during the reign of the famous Tang dynasty, where the Emporer lusts for complete control of everyone in his kingdom, including his immediate family. If he cannot gain this by twisting their lives to his will, he will do so by blood-lust. The machinations which surround his ambitions involve every member of the family, and his personal army, as well as his doctor and his relatives.I am not normally a fan of martial arts movies, but the fighting scenes which sew this story together are extremely well choreographed and spectacular to see. Be aware that the blood does flow though. The scenery in this movie is mostly of the Forbidden Kingdom palace and grounds, but is spectacularly offered. Hollywood could certainly learn something from the way that these sets are presented.Masterful performances by the two leads steer this movie through twists and turns which demand the viewer's full attention. Chow Yun Fat is wonderful as Emporer Ping, and the very beautiful Gong Li is quite incredible as the dutiful Empress Phoenix, and grabs your attention in every scene. While on the subject, from a male's point of view it is notable that the push-up bra's are doing overtime in this movie!This is a great picture which I believe that any fan of Chinese cinema, and also those who enjoy Hollywood's offerings about ancient China, will love. It is more than a martial arts movie, and more than a drama involving family. It is a thoroughly engrossing story told in spectacular fashion. I look forward to seeing this picture again, subtitles and all !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable feat in the world of film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As usual, director Zhang Yimou classically embellishes this film with plenty of symbolic color in possibly the darkest of subjects. A underlying fight, a quiet struggle, and many outwardly physical conflicts find themselves in this amazingly moving film. This film is not a date night movie for the weak of heart, it is a visual masterpiece and a heart-wrenching struggle set in a spiral of events which to us now may only seem barbaric. The leading character, played by Li Gong, is a favorite actress of Yimou's and has taken the lead in many of his best films. Her superb performance alone may constitute watching this film as she creates a stern and beautiful character whom we both adore and misunderstand. Her character's great strength is frightening, even in her weakest moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title refers to the Chrysanthemum flowers filling the Imperial Palace as the Emporer returns from the battlefields with his son, the general, Prince Jai. While on the road for three years, the Empress(sexy Gong Li) has been messing around with her stepson, Crown Prince Wan. He, meanwhile, has another girl, Jiang Chan, the Impetial Doctor's daughter, on the side. Intrigue follows, as the Emporer orders the doc to poison his cheating wife. Many family secrets unfold along the way, and the plots become Borgia like in their scope. Shakespeare's dramas also come to mind, with the twists and turns of the story. The thousands of bright yellow flowers, the palace, and the costumes provide an epic feast for the eyes. Curse of the Golden Flower is at the upper level of historical dramas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I love Zhang Yimou's films - Raise the Red Lantern. He seems to be really good when he's placed under extreme pressure and has a modest budget. But when he's given tons of cash, he produces this.It looks like an epic. But it feels so try hard - like the effort to increase the bust sizes of all the female actresses by several cup sizes.I found the battle scenes to be very corny and fake. Maybe they were trying to make it stylized or something like Kagemusha but it didn't work for me.When I watched Raise the Red Lantern, I loved the cinematography, the pacing, the direction - this film however seems the total opposite. Maybe it was made for a greater mass appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not planning to watch this movie. I zapped right into the movie starting on German TV. I recorded it to watch it some other time. But since I was so fascinated by the movie's sounds, colors and interesting and mysterious story line, I just kept watching it until the end. I am not good in writing reviews like a pro with that special structure and conclusion and things like that. I prefer writing what I think or what I would tell a friend talking about a movie. In my opinion this definitely is a great movie to watch especially if you like Asian movies, the old Chinese emperor times or even fighting scenes, which btw fit great into the movie, not too dominating, not too ridiculous. Overwhelming are the colors in that movie. A must see! I loved the scenes with walking people in the palace corridors, the flowers for the big event, everything! The emperor, embodied perfectly by Chow, really knows how the rule and reign. The palace is gigantic, the people are just drones, the army is so big...unbelievable. But topping everything is the empress. So strong, breath-taking beautiful, loving. It is more than goose-bumping, watching her in that movie. The clothes, hair, costumes in general are very nice in this film. And really, is there anything sexier than the moving nose wings of Gong Li in excitement? :-) I doubt it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the 10th century, the Tang Dynasty(where, evidently, it is a law that any woman must be strikingly attractive and, whenever possible, present her cleavage(which I swear grows over the course of this), and try to frequently run or ride horses to make those babies bounce... well, makes sense, if I had the power, I'd pass that, as well), in China, this is about the royal family, in their lavish surroundings. The emperor married the princess of a neighboring province and she has borne him two sons and raised one he had already. Unfortunately, for the last decade, she has been suffering a deadly illness, for which she is receiving medicine several times a day. She's been getting worse, recently, and has also become obsessed with sewing chrysanthemums. With her husband and two of the princes returning, a soap opera will play out between these people. This is based on the classic play Lei yu, also adapted in '57 and '61. It is the final part of Zhang's trilogy started with Hero(the middle part being House of Flying Daggers, which I haven't seen), and unlike that one, this is primarily a drama(and befitting a closing chapter, it is a massive production). The epic cinematography, breathtaking art(with vivid colors and intricate symbols... if it does get to be straining at times) and flowing editing make this a remarkable visual viewing experience. This isn't pure flash, either, as it follows the film's theme of there being ugliness underneath the prettiest of surfaces. There are a few battles - the finale is grand in scope, and takes up 10 or 15 minutes of running time, and it may satisfy some - but this is not an action film. When there are martial arts sequences, they are badass, impeccably choreographed, smoothly filmed(the camera pulls back from/zooms in on, flies around or swiftly follows, the fighting) and quite exciting. Also, ninjas. For some reason. Yeah, their presence is actually pretty distracting(note that I'm not complaining about their inclusion). This is paced well. The story is fine, not the most interesting or well-told. There are twists, and they aren't bad. The DVD comes with trailers for The Hoax, The Dead Girl, Miss Potter and Astronaut Farmer. There is a bit of disturbing content(some of it sexual, if it is not explicit) and bloody violence(some of it gruesome, if not much of it graphic) in this. I recommend this to fans of Asian cinema. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the curse of the golden flower is a bright film for an almost evil storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film the curse of the golden flower is a bright film for an almost evil storyline. This film is based in the in the 928 AD Tang Dynasty and follows the Emperor's family after he returns. The Emperor's family seam to have a lot of secrets and these unravel through out the film. The film starts out at the place with the day starting. You see the servants getting up and how structured the palace is run. The first character you meet is the empress as she is getting ready for her day. You see something is not quite right but a lye is given to you that both you and the character believes. Next you meet her steps son as the Empress storms into his room because he is planning to ask his father to leave. This where it is revealed that they have been seeing each other behind the Emperor's back. Some where within these first couple of scene you meet the youngest prince but you don't really notice him till the end and he seam to be more of a messenger and a background part till the end. The next scene you meet the second son and the emperor out at an inn. They have been at war and straight away you can tell who is more superior. The Emperor wears the solid gold armor. They fight and the emperor decides after his sons puts up a good fight they both should head home. This is where the story starts to unravel and the characters start to get crazier and more deceitful. Mostly everyone is out for themselves except ill say the second son.The relations in this film seam to set a theme as the spider web of deceit, mistrust and adultery. The family is set up of the Emperor and his wife the Empress, The crown prince from the emperor's first marriage and their two sons. This film shows an insight into Chinese culture with the color and the way the servant act around the royal family. The colors of the imperial palace bring a bright relief to the dark storyline. With the colors of luck and happiness painted and the walls you would think the family would be happy. I would say the colors are almost magical and insightful. I would say the big positive of the film is the insight to the respect aspect of the Chinese culture. When watching the film you notice that the servants almost run around in a bow position and bow on the floor when the royal family comes in. The respect is also shown through the family and emperor seams to be up the top.There are very few things I didn't like about this film but one ill have to comment on is in the war scene there is no sign of remorse. It has very vivid scene of death and destruction that I feel was not need in this film.The characters in this film are the sort of characters that you either like them or hate them straight away. The Character of the Empress for example is a character of great power yet is a servant to her husband. The empress I felt sorry for as at the start as you can see something is not quite right with her health. But as the storyline get thicker then you see that herself is one that can manipulate and cause trouble.I feel that all of the characters have this characteristic of having something to hide or trying to get there own way. But the more surprising character that shows this is youngest prince who seam so child like till then end. The way the film is put together leads you on a twisted during that unravels like a lace glove and captures the audience and pulls them in. But when the audience is release you are left wondering what happen and what would happen next?I really enjoyed this movie and you will too if you enjoy a dark but colorful film that express Chinese culture in a way that shows you how brutal it can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>film review-- Curse of the Golden Flower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Curse of the Golden Flower is another ancient as the background to the action film following the film Hero and House of Flying Daggers. This film produced by Blue Sky media and directed by Yimou, Zhang in 2006, China. The genre of this film is about love, history and plot. In this film, there are many good actors, such as Runfa, Zhou (Chow Yun- fat); Li, Gong; Jielun, Zhou (Jay); Ye, Liu. Curse of the Golden Flower, as the first truly global synchronization show the film in the Chinese film history, in addition, Yimou Zhang's film style, making this film successful. Curse of the Golden Flower was the 79th session of the Oscar nomination for the best costume design.Curse of the Golden Flower is one of the famous movies in China. But when this film released in the United States, triggered the U.S. mainstream media widely reported. They show the same enthusiasm rare on the film. On the other hand, there are lots of people do not like this film because they think this film too much emphasis on the outside and the lack of meaning. I will be divided into two parts to review this film. First of all, it will focus on enjoyable aspects of this film. After that, it will be present the worse part of the film.The first enjoyable aspect of this film is the story plots. Curse of the Golden Flower adapted from Cao Yu's famous work ? Thunderstorm. The film changed the background of capital from China's modern family into the courtyard of the ancient palace. The original work of Thunderstorm tells about the struggle between the feudal families and the intensification of contradictions. As well in the film Curse of the Golden Flower, it tells the people struggle for the rights and desire in the palace. The plots of the film are similar with the Thunderstorm. Expect for the general plots, there are many similarities details. In the Thunderstorm, it is strong criticism for the patriarchal systems in the feudal society. It stands for the modern people have the advanced thinking and progressive at that time. Also, Curse of the Golden Flower good use of the central idea of Thunderstorm and show the supremacy of the male head clearly in the movie. For example, the Queen (Gong Li) found the king (Zhou run fa) gave her poison but she refused to eat. The King forced in front of their son and said: cannot be broken this rules. Finally, the Queen had to drink the poison with tears. In fact, the whole plots of the movie become the biggest bright point. The second enjoyable aspect of this film is the great actors in it and their acting. There are many famous actors in Curse of the Golden Flower, also their acting made this movie successful. Because of Curse of the Golden Flower adapted from Thunderstorm, the relations of the people are very complex. However, in the film, the figure depict very meticulous. In Curse of the Golden Flower, Gong Li's age and her elegant and composed just posted the Queen of this role. In the movie, she performance incisively and vividly; she love tenderly on the little Prince (Jay), disappointment on the Prince (Liu Ye) and strong hated of the King. Zhou runfa's role of the king has a lot of performances about psychological portraits. In curse of the Golden Flower, as the King, he has demonstrated aggressiveness. He was always in the most peaceful and gentle tones to express the vicious and hypocritical attitude of the role. As the new actor, Jay's performances also add good results for this film. His show filial obedience to the Queen touched the audiences deeply. Also, the other important role in the movie is the Prince. Liu ye's role is very weak. He was always in low spirits and cannot stand the temptation of women. In curse of the Golden Flower, this role made he broke his previous handsome show. The third bright point of this film is director: Yimou, Zhang. Yimou, Zhang's film style is behind a strong color and a large number of compositions and strictly adhered to the real lives, narrative and lyric. In his film, he always would like to use color to show the grand scenes. However, in Curse of the Golden Flower, he pays more attention to the content of the film and made the film vivid story plot.From above, there are lots of best parts of the film. Nevertheless, the weakness dragged this film down like color. In my opinion, the main weakness of this film is color. Although the director Yimou, Zhang good at using color in the film, in this golden as the bottom color film, we can see that the color dazzling and artificial. In the movie, the color of yellow should show the supremacy of the distinguished. But too much color of golden made the audiences feel mess dazzling.All in all, although there are weakness in Curse of the Golden Flower, this film still worth to watch. In fact, the main reasons for attracting us are good actors and famous director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost An Epic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curse of the Golden Flower is a Chinese epic drama film directed by Zhang Yimou.It stars big name in the Chinese industry namely Chow Yun- fat and Gong Li together with Jay Chou and Qin Junjie.The movie presents a dying love between two powerful people leads to deceit, infidelity, and conspiracy in this epic-scale historical drama that has been reportedly the biggest budget Chinese film ever made.This Chinese film takes place during the latter days of the Tang dynasty.The Emperor returns home from the war with his son Prince Jai in tow. However, the monarch gets a chilly reception from the Empress; though she's eager to see her son, her marriage has become deeply acrimonious, and she's taken a lover, Crown Prince Wan, her stepson from the Emperor's first marriage. The Emperor, meanwhile, has his own plan for dealing with his failing marriage as he's ordered the Imperial Doctor to find an exotic drug that will drive the Empress insane and administer it to her without her knowledge. However, the doctor's ethical dilemma is intensified by the fact his daughter Chan has fallen in love with Crown Prince Wan and the two wish to elope. As the Emperor and Empress allow their estrangement to sink into violence and retribution, their youngest son, Prince Yu, struggles to keep the peace in the household. The movie was a good one.The acting of the cast was definitely brilliant.It consists of spectacular production designs and giant CGI battles especially the swordplay and fist-cuffs.It was definitely lavish,beautiful and appealing.What never lived up into becoming an epic film is the story and the screenplay.The violent and operatic saga of cruelty and revenge became more of an Asian soap opera and a melodrama that was contrived at some parts especially in the ending.Nevertheless,it is worthy of one's time to watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: a Chinese royal family plot against one another.The Chinese have a remarkable ability to churn out historical epics. Unfortunately they usually forget to imbue them with a little soul first. The royal family here would make Machiavelli weep with joy. They're all poisoning, rebelling against or sleeping with each other. Which would be fine except that they all come off as nasty little tyrants, leaving me to wish a plague on all their houses and to sympathise with the poor common soldiers who get slaughtered in the end battle whilst their masters and the director display a total lack of interest in their fate. Everything in this film is done on a big scale, from the running of the palace to the final battle, with a regimentation like clockwork. Again, inhuman and, whilst visually impressive, emotionally blank. You watch it and it is pretty and you can appreciate the effort but really you'd like someone to cheer on and possibly a sense of humour or maybe for someone to treat all the slaughtered soldiers and servants as more than disposable pawns. Pretty but empty.</fullReview>

The battles are ridiculous without being spectacular, they make The Lord of the Rings look realistic, and that leaves them as dull and they don't sustain your interest at all.The politics seems interesting although it isn't fully developed and the lack of real dialogue makes for a shallow plot.The real success of the film is the visuals, these are beautiful, I'm not sure I have ever seen quite such a use of colour and style, the palace is lovely to look at as are the costumes especially when shown in groups.The ending has a few surprises and is darker than I was expecting, it is enough to salvage some enjoyment from the film but not enough to make it good.Unengaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An operatic, dazzling and entertaining family tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is almost like a Shakespearian opera about a royal family that is dysfunctional in a horrible way that ends up tearing the family apart to the point of revenge, betrayal, incest, bitterness, spite and rebellion.Visually - it is absolutely amazing. The colours, the costume, the sets are all eye candy. Gong Li looks spectacular as the empress who is out to rebel against the emperor played by Chow Yun Fat. She is very convincing and considering this film is an expensive blockbuster, it is even better suited to her considering her appeal to international audiences, which is becoming more prominent,and the fact that this role is one of royalty. Chow Yun Fat is also very convincing as the cruel but at times misunderstood Emperor and this came as a bit of a surprise to me as I am used to seeing him as the good guy mainly.I think this film does get a bit over-dramatic and at times way over the top but it all adds to the fun in my opinion. Even if you are bored (though I wasn't), the film itself is just stunningly beautiful to look at. It makes you want to go to this place and see what it is like in real life. This film is like a glorious opera that you are experiencing and I had a ball watching this. I'll just comment again that Gong Li, well into her 40's, looks absolutely stunning and doesn't seem to age that much. Yet it is her performance that keeps the film going.The plot is simply a movie about trying to find peace in a hopeless situation and giving a fight despite the odds being against you. The only problem with the film is that it feels like the visuals and sets seem to take over more at times. Compared to Zhang Yimou's previous works where he used subtlety a lot more effectively, this takes a more operatic feel that entices you into the grand palace. Essentially, the film gives a simple message: everything looks great, but you really don't know the whole story until you've been inside and experienced it on a day to day basis.Don't expect an action packed film with tons of action sequences because there aren't that many, but it is a dysfunctional family drama/tragedy that makes most families seem normal. Nevertheless, this is great entertainment on a family tragedy. Great viewing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual spectacle with something for both Western and Eastern audiences.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curse of the Golden flower is another brilliant film by director Yimou Zhang. As expected of the director of House of Flying Daggers and Hero, it has high production values and aspects which appeal to both western audiences and Chinese audiences.The film follows political intrigues of the imperial family in Tang Dynasty China, including the many deceptions and coup plans that come with these intrigues. The director sets the scene for these scenes convincingly by reproducing the lavishness that may be expected of a Tang Dynasty royal family. The film places much importance on showing the over-the-top excessive indulgence of the royal family, such as the intricately engraved golden armour of Emperor Ping, to intricately embroidered silk robes, right down to gold rimmed serving plates and the very important jade cup from which the Empress is forced to take the Emperor's medicine. While this attention to set and costume representing the lavishness and sheer power that the imperial family held has importance for it as a semi-historical film, it would seem that the main reason is simply for the spectacle of it, it seems to be self-orientalisation and hyperrealism by Zhang Yimou, making what may have been true, and exaggerating it to make it more exotic to western audiences. The visual aspects of the film are one of the most memorable aspects of it, much red and gold is used in the film, offset with many greens, yellows and blues, all captured in an over-saturated fashion to make the colouring even more exotic and lavish, such effort has been gone to that the film could be watched purely visually as simply a piece of art. Also seemingly an attempt to draw in western audiences, is the film's attempt at being a Wu Xia film in the style of House of Flying Daggers and Hero. The few fight scenes that occur before the end seem out of place and have little reason, such as the fight between Prince Jai and Emperor Ping at the imperial inn, which is simply a fight for fight's sake. It was almost as though Yimou was not confident enough in the drama of his film to captivate western audiences. However, an exception is the final battle scene during the Empress' coup, which does feel necessary to the plot of the film, showing the sheer importance of this final battle, and keeping in accordance with the excess already established in the film, the final battle is an enormous event and a clear sign of Yimou and his team's ability as creators of film, as they had to coordinate over one thousand soldiers for the final battle and it took over 20 days to film the final battle (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473444/trivia?tr0724825).However, the film is more than just a visual feast of colours and extravagance, over-orientalised to bring in western audiences, it also has a solid story filled with traditional mainly Confucian and some Taoist beliefs (The Taoist beliefs are mainly presented in relation to medicine), and the conflicts that arise from adherence to these morals, especially the Confucian morals. The film goes to lengths to remind the viewer of these morals, with the emperor and empress together writing "Loyalty, Filial Piety, Ritual and Righteousness." Which when considered, are the factors which advance the plot. The film revolves around patriarchal power of the emperor. With one of the key opening lines and the key closing lines being the Emperor Ping saying to Prince Jai "What I do not give you, you must never take by force." With this in his mind, and having been brought up with Confucianism, filial piety is at the forefront of Jai's mind when the Empress tells of her plans for a coup, he says "A son can never stand in open rebellion to his father." He says this even though he knows what his father is doing is wrong, and eventually after some inner turmoil, he agrees to go against his values. Ultimately, for a western audience, the ending is very hard to swallow, as the emperor wins the final battle, and retains his control over everything, including the Empress. This seems to be a victory for Confucian values, but not justice. Overall though, even if as a western viewer you cannot agree with the final ethic presented in the film, simply for it's high production values it is a great film, however while it may be put into 'action' as a genre, it is best approached as a drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I do not give, you must never take by force.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emperor Ping returns to his palace just before the Chong Young Festival. The Empress Phoenix, his wife, is far from happy to see his return. Ping has ordered his imperial doctor to slowly poison the empress. And, in retaliation, the Empress conspires to overthrow her husband. As hatreds fester and secret passions come to light, no one will remain untouched by the Curse of the Golden Flower.The Director Yimou Zhang follows up House of Flying Daggers and Hero with his most lavish epic yet. Curse of the Golden Flower is an extraordinary film. It is a big-budget extravaganza that is reminiscent of some of the Hollywood epics of the fifties and sixties. As with all Zhang's western exports, his use of colour is incredible. The palace of Emperor Ping is brought to the screen in a blaze of arresting colour. Every costume and set create a world of sumptuous majesty a world that you will be immediately drawn into.Of course, like all Asian Cinema, this film has the usual martial arts set pieces throughout, but it does not seem to rely on them to keep the audience interested. Instead, the film uses a complex plot involving the power struggle between the two leads. Chow Yun Fat, as Ping, presents a character who is ruthless and dogmatic, and Gong Li's Empress Phoenix is vulnerable and defiant. Both stars' performances are beyond reproach, and all of these qualities come together to create a gloriously opulent saga.The Curse of the Golden Flower is an epic filled with intrigue and breathtakingly-bloody battle scenes, all set against a backdrop of radiantly decadent colour. If you liked Flying Daggers and Hero, you will adore the Curse of the Golden Flower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yimou found a way to exceed his previous work's beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Shakespearian soap-opera is led by Yimou Zhang, ending his trilogy of wu-xia, started with "Hero" and "House of the Flying Daggers". The screenplay has much to do with Kurosawa's "Ran", concerning the battle for the throne, the insanity of the Empress and the reflection of the Emperor's wrongs. Nevertheless, the screenplay fails miserably in its other aspect: the romantic stories. There are at least three important romances in the plot, and none of them is particularly interesting. On the contrary, every scene that contains one of this subplots is extremely boring, bringing down the pacing of the entire movie, and making it appear too long. Chan's and Wan's story, actually, has a great tragic finale, but, in the last minutes of projection, sandwiched between some of the most climatic moments of the film, this conclusion looses some of its power.On the other side, the battle for the throne has its assets, like the unmasking of all the intentions and plans of each of the Imperial Family members. Even young Prince Yu has some things to reveal, culminating in a good scene in the finale, which the screenplay simply throws into the ending, with a lame previous construction ? it only shows Yu wandering about in the dark, spying on the Empress. The greatest asset of the screenplay is the monumentally tragic ending, with deaths galore and merciless fates to numerous important characters. All of this is choreographed with little of the ethereal flights of Zhang's previous films, instead showing a more Lord of the Ring-ish vision of the battlefield ? not a particularly good option.Concerning the visuals, the director exceeded even the sublime beauty of his two previous works. In "Curse of the Golden Flower", not only everything is beautiful, but everything is insanely glamorous. Every single corridor in the castle has a highly detailed decoration and is full of colors and patterns; the vast courtyard, with tapestry, thousands of chrysanthemums and towering stairs; the Empress' room, like a fanciful, carefully decorated prison cell; meanwhile, the sets outside the Imperial Palace are murky and dull. The Oscar-nominated costumes are even more ostentatious, with golden armors that seem to compromise the warriors' movements, long ceremonial dresses for the Empress, together with an infinite set of gold adornments, including claw-like finger thingies.Instead of being beautiful in a sublime way, this movie's esthetics are way over the top, with a reason: Zhang wants to show all the exaggerated luxury of the Imperial Family, and the hoax it represents. A particular scene is the most full of meaning: numerous servants boil a great deal of aromatic ingredients in perfect craftsmanship bowls, then pour the liquid into a recipient under the Emperor's chair, only for him to sit in perfumed and warm vapors. Nonetheless, all the luxury is a façade: the wonderfully detailed corridors only display scenes of anger, grudge and madness; the Chong Yang Festival is the showcase for the most horrifying tragedies; the pretty chrysanthemums in the courtyard are promptly trampled and destroyed by war. After the whole mess ends, the beauty is quickly restored by thousands of servants and the horror, the madness and the grudge are back under the veil. This is a reflection on China as it is today: a country with deep cultural roots and traditions, whose only concern is to look mighty and rich, disguising all of its tragedies for the rest of the world.The vastness of the Chinese population is portrayed with a countless number of figurants, enhanced by visual effects that are indistinguishable from the real people. The cinematography also does a great job, by leaving the Palace always free of sunlight: there are always clouds blocking the sun, as if Nature itself stood against all that ostentation. While effective in its meanings, the movie lacks a decent technique: Yimou Zhang shoots dialogues in a weird fashion, and doesn't feel very comfortable with camera movements. Even worst, the director committed a great flaw with his actors. Many of the performances are better suited for stages, especially Qin's and Liu's, both terrible on their exaggerations. Yun-Fat and Gong Li are the ones that turn out better, and still aren't worthy of further mention.With interesting and opportune meanings in the subtext, "Curse of the Golden Flower" has little to offer as a story: it is only a fanciful portrayal of the modern China, with its luxury of visuals being a comment on its own. While this is the weakest of the wu-xia movies by Yimou Zhang, it concludes the trilogy in grand fashion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flower that will never die...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the Chrysanthemum Festival days away, Emperor Ping (Chow Yun Fat) personally invites his second eldest son, Prince Jai, to leave his military duties and return home to the imperial palace, where Ping's wife, Empress Pheonix (Gong Li), and two sons, Crown Prince Wan (Ye Liu), Prince Yu (Junjie Qin), reside. He wishes to celebrate the holiday with his entire family, but Empress Pheonix feels that something is amidst when she discovers that her medicine treatment contains a new ingredient.Easily more story based than Hero or House of Flying Daggers, Curse of the Golden Flower thrives on an amazingly tense story of deceit and struggle for power. Starting extravagantly, the story weaves its way through the various characters until it reaches its bloody, if not surprising, end. The characters are very much the building blocks and its an utter delight that each character does not merely represent good and evil, but degrees of both. This helps the emotional intensity and with the many forms of symbolism contained within, the story is bound to have many viewpoints. It should be noted that the film is never complicated which helps it have a fluid pace which makes for a steady film.Acting is a solid aspect with utterly convincing performances. Chow Yun Fat is steadfast as the cold and cruel Emperor Ping, and Gong Li shines as the desperate Empress Pheonix. While both have very strong performances it's a pity that Li has more screen time then her male counterpart, Fat, but when both are on screen together, the film begins to burst with experience, aided with the great craftsmanship of director Yimou Zhang. The only noticeable downside is Jay Chou who comes across as rather subdued, but luckily is never at any time unbearable.If anything it is surprising that the action sequences are the weakest aspect of the film. Besides the first two fighting scenes, the rest do not contain the stylised approach taken by Hero and House of Flying Daggers. Instead we are presented with more gritty fights with a semi-realistic approach. The majority of action scenes are between small forces, and so they aren't at all perfected as you would hope. And strangely, this actually goes yo make the fights themselves more violent in nature then they really are, and this is also partly due to some awesome cinematography on the part of Yimou Zhang.To much disappointment, there is a weak link in the chain, and that comes in the music department. Most of the music is comprised of chants, and while these really add to the tension of the film, they become overused very quickly as virtually every new story event is accompanied by the chanting. A better use of traditional Eastern tunes would have added to the very basic music repertoire.While various forms of cleavage is shown, no actually nudity is, and that goes for sex as well. Language is virtually non-existent but there is a lot of violence which involves crowds of combatants attacking each other. They are brutal at times, but never ever get to high degrees of gore; no limbs are lost either for the fighting involves stabbing and slashing.As an instant classic, Curse of the Golden Flower continues where the amazingly beautiful Hero and House of Flying Daggers left off, and moves into it's own direction. The only concern with the film is it's monotonous music, but that doesn't stop it being a dazzling film with amazing acting, a solid story, lush cinematography and awesome, if a little weak, action sequences.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>outward glamour, but not up to this master director's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Flowers! How lovely! You shouldn't have ? really! I mean ten thousand chrysanthemums, how will I water them? Just give me a CGI next year, dear." Of course, it being 928 A.D. Tang Dynasty China, the script doesn't go quite like that. An important date in the calendar requires a carpet of chrysanthemums at the Emperor's palace. While outwardly nice to his Empress wife, the Emperor is secretly poisoning her. Their royal family includes a half-son who has been having an affair with the Empress but who really wants to have sex with the doctor's daughter. Emperor and Empress pit their wits, sons and individual armies to expunge such dishonourable blemishes from the royal household. Naturally, the flowers get trampled on, but the red of blood makes a nice contrast with the golden colour and there's always more from where they came from.Curse of the Golden Flower is large scale Chinese cinema with hundreds of servants, soldiers, maids in waiting and every type of visual excess imaginable. The story lacks substance but makes up for it with an impressively psychedelic palace (using columns of coloured glass), imaginatively choreographed battles (which is getting harder with every successive Chinese historical epic), glittering costumes, and bosoms that constantly threaten to brim over. If you've paid money to see it, the least you feel you can do is be dutifully impressed.As an elaborate quasi-historical pageant, Curse of the Golden flower is imposing. It lacks the originality of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or the intensity and plot inventiveness of much of Yimou Zhang's earlier work, such as Hero. It feels like the Hong Kong equivalent of paying to see Tom Cruise in an all-action Hollywood blockbuster, replete with explosions and light hints of sexuality. We have breath-taking sets and wire-work action - each scene looks worthy of a poster you could frame and put on the wall - and the glancing references to incest, plus a hefty dose of blood and guts Asian-style, reassure us that this is a movie for Western adult audiences. The lush colours from the artwork department are almost overpowering. Cinematography displays a nice contrast between bright opulence in the palace and dark chaos outside. Top Chinese actors work overtime to squeeze emotion out of what could be a one-page script, and with a budget in excess of $40 million ? which goes a long way in China ? it is hard to argue that it doesn't give value-for-money on your Saturday night out. But, compared to this director's earlier masterpieces, Curse of the Golden Flower is superficially awesome while, at least to this reviewer, seeming a little unsatisfyingly hollow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family dysfunction?Curse of the Golden Flower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My introduction to writer/director Yimou Zhang was his first foray into epic territory Hero. The film took the beauty of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and infused it with inventive and powerful storytelling a la Kurosawa's Rashomon. As a result, the film was an amazing feat of technical and emotional brilliance. I still haven't seen his follow-up House of Flying Daggers as it seemed a more cartoony look into the genre, with visual style pushed to the forefront while story is pushed back. With his newest film, Curse of the Golden Flower, the trailer made me think that Yimou went back to having a solid story to tell and added the visceral flourishes to enhance the underlying plot. I enjoy tales of imploding nobility and family fracturing at the level of power, seeing how people will betray blood against blood. Also, it just looked stunning?set pieces and cinematography alike. Upon seeing it, I could call it a masterpiece of style with a lush environment so detailed one can understand why it is the new leader in Chinese film budget. As a whole, however, the movie becomes a nice shiny wrapper with little to offer on the inside. We are given a simple morality tale injected with so much fluff and ritual that you almost get faked into thinking you have seen something much more profound than you actually have.China is led by the Tang dynasty and an emperor with three heirs to take his mantle upon his death. The eldest was born by his first wife who has since died. Remarried to the daughter of another king, more out of political purposes than love, as we find out, he is given two more sons. We are thrust into the lives of this royal family at an important cusp of their history. All together for the first time in three years, they are about to celebrate the Chrysanthemum Festival in honor of family and duty. Under the surface, however, brews many secrets and tests that each member must face to decide on a path to take for the future. The emperor must decide which of his sons to give the crown to; the empress discovers that she is being poisoned into insanity; the eldest prince, Wan, realizes he is not of the mindset to rule although the crown is his to lose; the second son, Jai, is a deserving warrior whose love for his mother will always win out against the king; and the youngest son, Yu, is treated as a lap dog without regard or consideration for any real power. In true Greek tragedy form, the family falls apart and goes along a path to self destruction as all pick who they love more? father, mother, or themselves.As far as the acting and aesthetic go, Curse of the Golden Flower is amazing. The authenticity is unimaginable and so vibrant it is tough to see everything in each frame. There is so much to look at, yet on almost every opportunity, your eyes will go to the truly enthralling cast. Gong Li is great as the matriarch slowly slipping deeper into dementia yet still trying for a sort of revenge. Her utter devastation as she learns the price her ill-thought coup comes with is heartfelt and real. Chow Yun-Fat is his usual steady self, a professional of the field. His emperor is one who leads with a strong fist where duty and obligation will always win out over the emotional ties of family that can cloud a weaker man's judgment. By the end of the film we will see how all the atrocities could be attributed to him and what might be some sick test of loyalty to him. All other characters play their roles nicely and stay true to their positions in the Chinese feudal food chain. Thankfully each son is very different from the others and allow for unique story threads. Liu Ye plays the eldest son with the kind of trepidation and nervousness someone unsure with how their life shall progress would have. Jay Chou, on-the-other-hand, is great as the son caught between his parents to the point where he is no longer fighting for the crown, but letting love, which will never penetrate his father, take over his actions.Everything built up eventually comes to a really successful climatic battle sequence. Thankfully Yimou pulls no punches and all characters finish their respective arcs in the way they have been evolving to. No one comes out in the end at a place in which they do not belong. Sadly the progression to that point is long and tiresome. I understand Yimou and the artistic director wanting to really show the era in all its glory, but the detail can get very tedious; this is not an historical epic, it's a fictional drama. The continual use of extreme close up and cutting of everyday servant activities gets old fast. Also, the over-saturation of little superfluous things like the continual scraping and painted in sparks when swords collide, (show me the fight not the friction of the metal), overshadow the moments when artifice work, (the chase scene with Wan as we see streaks of color through the stain glass hallways). The story itself has moments of artificiality as well with many plot points being too crazy. Between the abundance of incest, the younger brother Yu's odd smile?making him seem mentally retarded?and creepy close-ups while eavesdropping around the palace, and the many convenient twists, the story is so convoluted for no reason. The true impetus at work is a simple tale of loyalty and betrayal tearing a family apart at the seams. Unfortunately Yimou tried to beef it up with trivialities that only hinder its success.Curse of the Golden Flower 5/10</fullReview>

Unlike American films, which seem to focus strictly on seeing how bloody they can make a scene. Also, I was rather pleased that it wasn't a cliché American-ized Chinese movie that revolved solely around ninjas.

Strong acting by all...not just Gong Li and Chow Yun-Fat.My only complaint about this film was that the last 20 minutes or so of over-the-top carnage was ridiculous, and I felt didn't really fit the flow of the rest of the movie.

		<fullReview>I like the period, I like the idea of the story, the view of customs, the costumes, scenery, beautiful action visuals etc, however I with so many tear filled moments found it very hard to feel the pain of any one character. It seems they're all a bunch of connivers begging to have their hand held...Secondly this is very much a high drama on the grand scale, but the music is not quite reflective of that, don't get me wrong it's there, in the background. Maybe it was the theater I was in (which had Lucas approved sound btw) I don't know, but without volume the strong male chorus just doesn't capture your attention to the scenes. Additional there really wasn't much of the pulsating rhythms I've come to expect i.e. "Hero" during the final battle, again it was there but not enough to get your hear pumping.Thirdly and probably the most important was, that this film is a 114 minute soap opera which focuses entirely on a dysfunctional Imeperial family. IMHO it needed more outside character involvement maybe even a glimpse of some historical events affecting the empire at the time to make it feel truly like a grand epic historical flick, as stands it felt like I was just there to be a witness to the silly infighting of the family, a lot which happens in-doors.All in all I gave it a high mark, for it is a work of art criticism aside.</fullReview>

Chow Yun Fat was so utterly disgusting and evil that I really got cold shivers of disgust down my back. I knew he was a good actor, but this was just creepy!!! And that all the other actors did just as well in portraying their character, added to the horror of this movie. It was like watching a Chinese version of MacBeth and Hamlet rolled into one. the Shakespearian air through the movie was just overwhelming. And as in Shakespeare's dramas, everything that possibly could go wrong, went straight to hell! I have only seen two movies so utterly void of hope. Namely the 1960's version of Hamlet, and Kurosawa's Ran. But this one topped them both because of its brutal visual and psychological imagery. This is by far the most disgusting movie i have seen in years, yet it is one of the better. If you see this movie you will remember it for a very long time. Make sure you are not depressed, and has not eaten, before you sit down to see this one. Because watching it, you SHOULD do. It is a true masterpiece !!!In all honesty i should have given this movie a straight 10. But because of its utter hideousness,I can't get myself to give it more than a solid 8.Thats all folks.

		<shortDescription>Rich and satisfying tale told with bold and impressive design and delivery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>China in the 10th Century has seen Emperor Ping rule over all. His new Empress Phoenix has had two sons with him and has raised a third from his previous wife. Unspoken resentments and mistrust exist within the Royal family ? even without the knowledge of an affair between Phoenix and her stepson. However on the eve of the Chong Yang festival, Ping returns to the palace with Prince Jai to celebrate the holidays. At this time it becomes clear to Empress Phoenix that she is being slowly poisoned by Ping and, while power moves silently play out within the palace, armies prepare for a bloody internal conflict.I didn't bother with the Curse of the Golden Flower at the cinema and even on DVD it was low down my rental priority list. The reason for this was that the trailer made it look like just another film with lots of martial arts flying and "meaningful" plot. I'd been excited about Hero and House of Flying Daggers and not actually be that taken by them so I figured I would be OK without more of it. Watching it on television recently though I'm happy to hold my hands up and say that I have been reminded not to follow preconceptions because this film is not like that at all. Instead what we have here is a richly delivered plot of intrigue and betrayal within the royal family. This culminates in a series of bloody sequences where the truth comes out as to who is controlling whom and the victor remains standing. If there is an allegory then it is not rammed in the face of the audience at the expense of everything else. This allowed me to enjoy the story for what it was and enjoy it I did.The story is enhanced by the delivery, which gives the entire film a look of richness and decadence that informs and develops the characters and their motivations. Within this pressure cooker of power, the silent stand offs do tend to bristle with tension as I hoped and the stakes feel so much higher. Also bigger is the scale; when the action comes it is large and impacting. OK so you probably need to be able to accept some acts of gravity defying action but not too much because here the focus is more on the scale of the battles as opposed to the movement of one-on-one fights. I preferred this and, although it lost the beauty of such fights, it gained from delivering something of real impact.The cast work very well ? again much better than the cast in the other films I mentioned. Yun-Fat is convincingly powerful and callous in his role. Li is much better though as she has more of an emotional core to her character and she plays it out very well; I liked her a lot here. Jay, Ye, Qin, Jin and others all deliver well in the supporting roles but for me it was pretty much Gong Li's film. Yimou directs with real flourish and style; in another film perhaps it would have been too rich and seem excessive but within the context of this story it works really well.Overall then a rich and satisfying tale of intrigue and betrayal at the very top. Bloody, callous and passionate, the scale and design of the film suit the story and make the film an enjoyable and engaging tale that is worth seeing.</fullReview>

A powerfully moving, extravagant family drama set around a captivating setting.The story is of Shakespearean/Greek Legend magnitude. Delving into the powerful struggles within a royal family and sublimely demonstrating how the lust for power leads to contempt, deception and destruction.Chow Yun Fat gives a commandly regal performance befitting no less than an Emperor. He exudes the restraint and depth of such a character. And Gong Li makes the role and the movie her own, emoting with flawless grace, the fall from grace of a woman borne to lead but doomed by the flawed men who serve her.The rest of the rest of the cast is superb too, and the script never lets down, but picks up pace right up to the hard-hitting climax.On top of the stunning visuals and engaging drama is the added delight of wonderfully choreographed action and battle sequences.Not one for fans of martial arts or historical movies, but an unmissable treat none the less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murderous imperial melodrama, but sumptuous and visually stunning. With Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curse of the Golden Flower (Man Cheng Jin Dai Huang Jin Jia) is gorgeous melodrama; a visual feast of scarlet, gold and magenta, of lush set pieces with thousands of characters (computer generated but still impressive), of armies of men wearing yellow, scarlet or iron- colored armor...but melodrama all the same. In Tenth Century China, the Emperor Ping (Chow Yun Fat), ruthless and malevolent, is slowly poisoning the Empress Phoenix (Gong Li), ruthless and determined, with an extract from a fungus which will drive her insane before she dies. They have three sons. There is the Crown Prince Xiang, somewhat weak, who has been having an intimate affair with his mother for a couple of years. There is the second son, Prince Jie, who is capable and torn between fealty to his father and responsibility to his mother. And there is the youngest son, Prince Chang, scarcely more than a teen-ager, always happy and ready to please, usually ignored by both parents, and a young man who hides his resentments. The Empress knows she is being poisoned and puts into play a plot which will culminate during the Festival of the Chrysanthemum. A violent plot it is, with bloody consequences for everyone. But does this dysfunctional family with all the plotting and maneuvering really mean anything? Not much, in my view, except as a reason to create wonderful visual images without end, plus a chance to see two outstanding actors, Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat, show why they're so good. There are plenty of confrontations, secrets about first marriages and first wives, sword thrusts and choreographed duels and battles to keep most people happy. I had a grand time, but I was hungry two hours later. Most likely if this film by Zhang Yimou is remembered in twenty years, it will be because of its production values. The palace settings, despite the dark doings, are vibrant with color; there are bright, multi-hued columns, rugs and walls that virtually scream to be noticed, heavy and ornate costumes and sumptuous details, such as the golden hair-pins Gong Li wears and the small, translucent cup she drinks her poisoned medicine from. The attack by the Chinese equivalent of black-clad ninja warriors on an Imperial outpost in a canyon is great, choreographed action...dozens of these shadowy men rappelling down cliffs, using hooks and cables to slide down from great heights onto the roofs of the compound. In the dusk it looks like clouds of black raptors swooping from the sky. At the imperial palace a great circular pavilion is built looming over the immense square. When the square is filled with yellow chrysanthemums it looks like a vast golden plain. The climatic battle between the two forces on this golden field of chrysanthemum is filled with brightly uniformed men in the thousands, with huge wooden walls rolled into place that sprout spears and slowly move forward while arrows darken the sky. Afterwards, cleaning the square of all the bodies and blood and armor, then replacing the crushed flowers with new chrysanthemums, is nearly as impressive as the battle itself. It's great, engrossing stuff. The one false note was the occasional gymnastic sword play between actors. When you see a middle-aged woman suddenly doing backflips, or an aging emperor sitting on an ornate bench able to ward off blindingly fast front, back and side sword strikes, well, for me, I found myself amused, not amazed. When one considers the movies Zhang Yimou has given us -- among them Ju Dou, Raise the Red Lantern, Shanghai Triad, The Road Home, The Story of Qiu Ju -- he gets a free pass from me on this one. It's great fun and not much more, but enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading through the various reviews it is pretty apparent that you either love this film for its grandiose presentation and beautiful sets and costumes, or you rate it as overblown pretentious rubbish. I have a nasty habit of buying films before seeing them, and this was one of them as I had already got Hero (superb) and Flying Daggers (awesome). So I thought this would be from the same mould. But it isn't. Is that good or bad? The film suffers, first off, from false advertising - mind blowing martial arts - oh yeah? Then it is sold on the reputation of Hero and Flying Daggers. Mmm? Perhaps not wise in the hereafter. I am confused because part of me loved it, and part of me (in Western ignorance perhaps) though it had the look and feel of the worst type of Chinese takeaway you could imagine! What action scenes there were did not disappoint. The story, very Shakespearian in style, intrigue and politics. One reviewer likened it to The Lion in Winter. That is a good analogy. On the other hand, I can watch Yun-Fat Chow for ever; he never fails to give a great performance. Li Gong - such beauty and oozes passion and suppressed sexuality, she is really something else. What I would ask reviewers to do, however, is before castigating this film for 'ham' acting as one reviewer stated, is to imagine how our films would look to a standard Chinese audience. Because we are use to a particular cinematic style, it does not mean that the style presented here by Yimou Zhang is 'over the top'. God knows; remember Kurosowa's efforts - the way the characters bowed and ran and gabbled away, and the sheer scope of his movies. Whilst not yet in the same class, Zhang has given a very good account of himself and his actors. But, I am still confused, because whilst watching this film, I swayed between admiration to frustration. I suspect that many others will too. In the main, it is a very good movie, but not perhaps of a style we are comfortable with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic epic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zhang Yimou is as versatile a director as you're ever likely to find. It boggles the mind to think that the same man who gave us RAISE THE RED LANTERN and NOT ONE LESS is the same filmmaker who has given us this epic epic. CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER has more twists and turns than a Republican presidential campaign. William Shakespeare himself would marvel at the behind-the-scenes intrigues. No dynastic stone goes unturned, no back unstabbed. Chow Yun Fat, at the top of the heap, comes across at once as both Highest of the High and Lowest of the Low. It's an amazing balancing act of the kind that only topnotch writing could underpin. And there you have it, in a nutshell: there's not a single aspect of this film to be found lacking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I will see your domestic quarrels and raise you an army or two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very beautifully made film, with great attention to detail. The plot is basically a domestic dispute between the emperor, empress, the emperor's first wife, the emperor's three sons. As each can command thousands of people at a single whim and none are allowed to express any opinion on the interior design of the castle, it grows kind of epic.And this is basically it. I don't really know the story of McBeth this was supposed to take after and I haven't seen Blood Throne either. One just grows frustrated more and more seeing what is going on in the Forbidden City, then it all ends.Bottom line: one of the weirdest films I've seen in a while, and I really do seek weird, worth seeing if you are in the mood for epic Chinese decors and plot, but beware you might also get really bored and ask at the end "what was that?". Extra points for weird.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tang Dynasty Clothing ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm interested to read that previous posts are questioning the authenticity of the costuming in this film. In particular, that during the Tang Dynasty, court women didn't wear low-cut clothing. I'd like to know why this idea has gained so much momentum given that it not true.I live in Shaanxi, the cradle of the Tang Dynasty, and upon a visit to any cultural heritage site it is easy to confirm this.In the Tang dynasty, it was fashionable and desirable for women to be chubby and have lots of curves. To accentuate these curves, court women habitually wore very low-cut, revealing attire. In fact, mausoleum paintings and carvings often show court womens' bosoms in such a state of revelation that you would think they are wearing some kind of ancient Wonderbra-prototype.So in fact the only major historical discrepancy I can see with this film is that they haven't chosen chubby enough actresses ... lol</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacle without a heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody in the world makes movies like the Chinese director Zhang Yimou. For abundant colour, dazzling composition and sheer spectacle, he is in a class of his own. Following "Hero" and "House Of Flying Daggers", both of which I loved, this work is the third piece of his trilogy in the magical style known in Chinese as 'wu xia'.The golden flower in the title is the chrysanthemum, since the film is set at the time of the Chong Yang Festival in a China of the 10th century when the Tang dynasty rules. In fact, in contrast to the scenic settings of his two earlier films, Zhang Yimou locates this work almost entirely in the Forbidden City (although it was not completed until 1420), a place of suffocating ritual and intrigue in which everyone is manoeuvring for position and fearful of usurpation, not least the Emperor Ping himself (played by Chow Yun Fat), his current wife Empress Phoenix (Gong Li - one-time lover and muse of the directer), and the three sons with different loyalties and ambitions.Visually this is a simply stunning work: the colours -especially red, gold and jade - are breathtaking, the cast is one of thousands, and there is a battle scene with a pitiful body count. One can easily understand how this is the most expensive film ever made in China. However, the narrative is often confusing and all the characters - except possibly Jay Chou as Prince Jai - ultimately unsympathetic. Compared to "Hero" or "House Of Flying Daggers", "Curse Of The Golden Flower" seems to lack a heart and certainly, compared to the selfless heroism of the first movie, here we have a sad and tragic conflict within the royal family in which the fate of the common people is never a factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually extravagant film without much substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Love Zhang Yimou films but I think this is one of his least satisfying films. If you go to see this film, you shouldn't have expectations of seeing a wu-xia film, although it does have a few, exciting scenes of balletic martial arts a la Hero and House of Flying Daggers.The core of the film is the scheming within the royal family (a real nest of vipers) enclosed within the opulent prison of the imperial palace. However, there is not much of an emotional edge to the scheming. I found my mind wandering slightly. I wasn't lost in the movie. Perhaps it was as a result of the weak script. The acting was a mixed bag: Gong Li, as the queen, does anguish and female toughness very well. Chow Yun Fat seems to be playing a pantomime villain. Liu Ye, playing the crown prince, didn't seem convincing but this may have part of his character who (and this may not have come across clearly in the translation) seemed to be weak and effeminate, unsuited to the role of prince. Jay Chou, as the Queen's birth son and avenging angel, draws more interest. When he takes up arms to defend his mother it is very exciting and chivalric.The second half of the film does pick up as the various plots and intrigues come to a head and there was relief for me when the action starts and takes some of the heat off the constant intriguing. The battle scenes are average and I was disappointed that they seemed to rush by and lacked distinctness or any real bite (it does not compare with the battle of Helm's Deep in LOTR which for me must be a benchmark). The climactic battle does take place at night which accounts for some of its fuzziness though.As you would expect from a Zhang Yimou film it looks fantastic and colour plays a big role: in the costumes and the hypercolour sets. If you watched the film for an hour longer I think the fierce colours would become nauseating.I am very loyal to Hero and House of Flying daggers but after seeing this I almost wish Zhang Yimou would turn away from big-budget historical films and do something simpler or something more thought-provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The curse of the Golden Flower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curse of the Golden Flower Normally I am always a bit wary about Chinese films as I am of Indian films because both of them are a bit over the top in everything they do. There is no subtleness in the movies. But being open to watching different genre of films my selection came down to this Chinese film.The movie is a historic melodrama about the Empress Phoenix (played by beautiful Li Gong), who wants to seek revenge on the Emperor Ping played by (Yun-Fat Chow) because he had captured her father's kingdom and made her his wife. The Yun-Fat Chow is slowly trying to kill the Empress through a daily dose of poison. Li Gong is in love with her step-son who is in love with his (unknown!) step-sister. Li Gong takes the help of her own son for a coup in the kingdom. Does the Emperor or Empress succeed in their motives; forms the part of emotional drama that ends up in the last battle sequence. Who wins? I will leave it on you to guess.The movie excels in all its departments ? particularly costume, sets, details of artifacts, jewels etc. The director Yimon Zhang (who was a photographer before he became a director) uses very rich and bright colors to give a royal and majestic look to his movie.Li Gong and Yun-Fat Chow have acted brilliantly in the movie. Li Gong as always looks very beautiful and pretty. The final battle sequence is shot in style which now ? a ? days is very common in Hollywood movies; with oceans of army on both sides fighting.The emotions are not too-over the top, and are bearable. Overall a good experience of a Chinese movie.(Stars 6 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Shakespearean Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER (Hong Kong, 2006) Wonderfully lavish and beautifully ostentatious action-drama from Zhang Yimou, whose HERO impressed me so much, as well as his succeeding visual delight, HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS. This one tends to be more political drama than action, but when the action scenes do come they do so in a rush and they are incredible spectacular, especially the climactic attack on the Forbidden City, with the wide screen filled with thousands of charging soldiers in ornate battle dress. Yimou's vivid color pallet is as stunningly provocative as anything in the previous two films, and Chow-Yun Fat and Gong Li are amazing in the lead roles of the Tang Dynasty emperor and empress in a story that boils down to a simple case of a dysfunctional family taken to Shakesperean proportions. Watching this shortly after seeing MARIE ANTOINETTE was very interesting, as both films examined the overindulgent ostentation of royalty, both examined male-dominant societies (moreso in Yimou's take on the exceedingly male-dominant Tang period), and both were filled with wonder as we got glimpses of the lavishness of palace life and the intriguing lives and etiquette of the massive supporting staff. The detail with which Yimou inhabits every camera shot is amazing, and his sound pallet is as interesting as his color texture; the sounds of the Palace household are continually astounding and the massive sonic atmosphere of the battle scenes are amazing. Another massively impressive and character-/story-based spectacle with a compelling and satisfying storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEAUTIFUL! Where Hollywood continues to disappoint and recycle worn-out themes, another foreign film blasts through like a searing comet and renews one's faith in the creative power of the film medium. Not only does this time-warp of an ethereal film beat even the most mind-numbed robot in the audience into a state of awe with it's sheer visual brilliance, the storyline will carry more sensitive viewers off like a Pegasus clad in mist. The acting is piercing and masterful, the drama thick and rich as melted chocolate, and the beauty... well, the beauty simply pulls the rug out and leaves you tottering until the final credit rolls out of view and the lights come on. Go see it on the BIG screen while you can, and leave the American Idol fan club home. Subtitled in English, but that is a tiny price to pay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it may be time for Zhang Yimou to give up the martial arts epic genre. Honestly, I think Hero was enough. I like his new film, Curse of the Golden Flower, about as much as House of Flying Daggers. It has its moments, and the design is absolutely fantastic, but it's not much after that. The story is one of court intrigue at the Forbidden City. Gong Li is the empress and Chow Yun Fat the emperor. She discovers that he is slowly poisoning her, and plans a coup. It takes forever for anything exciting to happen. Yeah, I love the action, I'll admit, but I would have been happy enough for a slightly more involving story. While the sets and costumes are outrageously beautiful to look at, the actual cinema isn't anything special. By the time the story does get going, it becomes a lot of fun. If you like violence, that is. If you're the kind of person to wonder how many of those soldiers and ninjas that got wasted had kids, this film probably isn't for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film yesterday, and being a big fan of Zhang Yimou, I knew I had to expect something beautiful, overwhelming and grandiose. So I cannot say I was "unprepared" for what I was about to see. I was amazed by "Hero" and even more so by "House of the flying daggers", so I knew that Zhang Yimou was a master of epic cinema, but this...Once again I sat there in the cinema, in an euphoric frenzy looking at jaw-dropping scenes, grand battles and pure cinematographic beauty. This film is not only entertaining and beautiful to watch, it is also extremely accurate and authentic. Every single detail, every attribute is perfect. In that right, the film is an impressive history lesson: the life and intrigues at the Imperial palace, the decor, the scenery setting, the costumes, the garnishing, the ornaments...just to much. The scene were the black ninja's attack the fortress from the air, the silver and gold armies in a grandiose battle, this was all just to amazing to watch. The directing is so perfect that you feel like in the middle of the battle. This is a film you must see on a big screen, so don't wait till the DVD release. Every time I thought: "that's the last time Zhang Yimou can surprise me", but every time I appeared to be wrong. I read that Mister Zhang is going to direct the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Beijing, so it promises to be, well...like always...stunning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This time director Zhang Yimou has not placed the visuals over the substance as he did in Hero or House of the Flying Daggers.The plot unfolds like a Shakespearean drama,slowly but subtly. Set in China's Tang Dynasty reign, this rich tapestry weaves a tale of intrigue, incest, and betrayal richly blending the characters, old-world grandeur,pomp and decadence where everyone is scheming against each other but no one triumphing in the end.Zhang Yimou is equally successful in projecting and portraying the characters' inner conflicts in this multi-layered, big budget epic backed by excellent performances of Yun-Fat Chow, Li Gong and other players.A joy to the eye!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A family drama disguised as an epic material arts movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically in its core and essence the movie is on big family drama, in which every family member of the royal Chinese family has a secret to hide. The drama isn't really that interesting to follow and perhaps also feels overdone but luckily in between- and toward the ending, the movie has more than enough action to still give the movie pace, style and reasons enough to watch this movie.The movie is well directed, so the movie doesn't ever drag or becomes bad to watch, even though for a long time nothing is really happening in the movie. I mean basically the first 30 minutes of the movie are all about the empress having to drink her 'medicine' daily, without much further story or character development.It are really two things that make this movie distinct itself from other genre movie; It's action and the visual look of it. Well maybe 3 things if you also count the acting, that was really good in my opinion, though it always remains difficult to judge acting in a language that you don't speak yourself.The movie really is an epic in terms of its look but also definitely in terms of its action. The end battle toward the end of the movie that literally involves ten thousands of soldiers has an incredible epic feeling all over it. Also the action during the big battle does not disappoint and it's not just your average 'chop-work'. But we are accustomed to this already, ever since the big success of "Wo hu cang long". Also the much smaller fight sequences before the end battle are really good and impressive looking, with great choreography and nice weapons. It also isn't as over-the-top (though it isn't exactly realistic either) as in "Wo hu cang long" was the case, which is I think a positive thing.But the visual style is perhaps the most notable thing about the movie. The movie is very colorful and uses many bright colors, also mostly with its impressive looking costumes (Oscar nominated). It also helps to make the movie a memorable viewing experience.I am normally not a big fan of this particular type of Asian cinema but after seeing this movie I wouldn't mind seeing more movies like it. 7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A type-Shakespearian paean to the best in burst less color and exciting action scenes with a real purpose, Zhang Yimou's latest film, "The Curse of the Golden Flower", is at least compellingly watchable. While this is far from "Hero" and not the least masterful like "The House of Flying Daggers", "The Curse of the Golden Flower" does have its sly tricks and well made gimmicks. The annoying story-line, much like a Shakespearian play, is about two emperors who willingly fight each other for the power and the future of their sons. The story, like all Yimou precedents, is wrapped around small gimmicks and inner complications that are, like no other of his films, this time unnecessary. But these Shakespeare-like machinations are well-performed by all with an appropriately exaggerated theatricality to their expressions; Gong Li proves her masterful class acting yet again through a very good role. And, like all Yimou films, the harmonious and extremely alacritous mise-en-scene purposefully cancels out all the film's narrative flaws as well as the superfluous opening shots that made some people at the screening where I saw fall asleep. Most of these opening shots of the film pertain to the beautiful castle in which the emperors live. But instead of easily laying a premise in less than forty-five minutes, Yimou lingers on his ideas a little more than his previous films, already giving viewers a heads up to his experimentation. But through its mighty flaws emerges a beautiful experimentation of betrayal, intrepidity and love. His magic still remains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was exited to see this movie. I LOVED Hero and seen parts of House of Flying Daggers. I expect to see breath taking scenes ? artificial or natural ? and fancy martial arts while hoping for a good story. This movie was lacking in both arenas.Some visual elements were wonderful ? jewelry, clothing, and shots taken outside. However, most of the movie was taken inside the castle. The interior decorator should have been shot for creating tied died pillars, tied died decorations, and tied died ceiling decorations. Because the background was so busy, it took away from their intricate attire and became quite annoying. My guy friend thought the EXCESS of cleavage was also distracting. Visually, this movie was not up to par with Hero ? or even close.The story-line was so exaggerated. Taking many notable moments in Shakespeare's plays, throwing most in the climax of the movie, and then working the rest of the storyline around this soggy soap opera-like royal family (rich white trash) does not equate to a great movie.The acting was good through ? except one part. "Watch Smosh Short 1: Dolls" which can be found on YouTube before seeing this movie. There is one scene were the gasping must have been taken from this 1 minute home movie. The similarities made me laugh.At any point, the movie wasn't my favorite ? I have seen and expected better ? but it was watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern Shakespearean film with a Chinese atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hearing this film being released in theaters, i couldn't resist to see it, for like many others, I enjoy Yimou Zhang films, such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers. Seeing this film, once again, Mr. Zhang has brought to life another great film, but with a different and more mature attitude.The film takes place in 928 A.D., with the Tang Dynasty, led by the manipulative and cruel Emperor Ping (Chow Yun-Fat), whom is on his return from a long journey, accompanied by his second, and favorite, loyal son Prince Jia (Jay Chou). His wife, the Empress (Gong Li) is taken ill with anemia, and must "drink her medicine" regularly everyday in order to combat her anemia. She is comforted by her eldest son Crown Prince Xiang (Ye Yiu), whom in secret is having an affair with one of the servants, Li Man (Jiang Chan), whom is the daughter of the Empress' doctor (Dahong Li).Everything seems ordinary and at ease, but soon secrets within the forbidden city are revealed, and severe punishments and unfortunate events follow, leading into an all-out rebellion against the dynasty.This was a great film that Mr. Zhang has delivered. Instead of the film being a Kung-Fu action flick that expresses lessons of love and country, this film takes on the old concept of Shakespearean tragedy and grandeur. The story is simply brilliant; it has everything a great tragic tale needs: deception, manipulation, backstabbing, incest (quite a bit in the film), and death.The costumes and set-decoration was magnificent, leaving me gripped by awe with such grandeur. It was amazing to see such a beauty on the big screen. The particular and rather over exaggerated colors made the cinematography simply gorgeous, loading the screen with color. Every single shot in the film was a work of art: from the simple tasks the servants are shown doing to the epic-scaled battles. Even better is the acting. There were quite a few new faces on the screen, such as Jay Chou, who was excellent in his performance as the second son who is drawn between his father and mother, in which he decides a fatal mistake that costs many lives. Gong Li was quite impressive; I was never a fan of hers, for I did not enjoy her in her previous films such as: Geisha and Miami Vice, but she delivers a chilling performance as the wife who is left in the dark and forced into insanity. Chow Yun Fat gave the best performance though as the "smiley faced" king, who ends up revealing his dark side of cruelty, cunning, and manipulation. The rest was equaling as superb as the others listed above.It sounds like the perfect film, but it has some unfortunate flaws. For instance, the film focuses a lot on the art value of the production design, but not enough on the story, which leaves several plot holes. The music in the film was very operatic which was a very good soundtrack, but blared through the film, making it rather annoying, and rules over the dialog in some important scenes (it was over done). And lastly, some, supposedly "emotional scenes" were rather corny, such as the deaths of important characters. Instead of weeping for them, I could only chuckle, for they happened so randomly and rather comically.To bring on a sad note, there isn't a lot of action as most would anticipate. There are a few action scenes, but this was no action film. These are made up of a few skirmishes, one-on-one fights, and a spectacular battle sequence at the end that is up with CGI effects as high as The Lord of the Rings films. The R rating is not a joke, it is violent enough for it, and much "women cleavage" hogged up the view in the film. Other than these errors, it was a piece of artwork and worthy of Oscar recognition. 3/4 rating</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a sophisticated amalgam of Chinese and western conventions to make an entertaining movie. I did not count the minutes here. The combination of actors' prowess, filmmaker's study, artistry with sets, costumes and story twists, made it a completely satisfying movie. the storyline twists were also greatly enjoyable. Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat are amazing in their roles; slight nuances being recorded on the big screen as significant as stage changes in an opera. The ninja arriving signal a wonderful foil for the 'formal' groupings of the other power groups such as the regular soldiers, etc. I think Gong Li should be considered for an Academy award here, Chow Yun fat as well; the performances are stylized, but for the movie camera as much as any western actor, i.e. Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant, Gregory Peck. This is an astounding movie, though bloody. A worthy consideration for any award for the Director's efforts as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good Movie Misunderstood/Not Undertood By Most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched it tonight with my Aussie boyfriend. I enjoyed the movie but for sure it is not for him. - He had been very bored in the cinema and commented: 'Chinese are crazy' after the movie.OK, Let say the different opinions came from the difference between Western and Eastern culture. - always blame the culture difference..heh. The plot is probably a bit strange for the wester views? I guess most of the western ppl struggled to keep up with the whole story and also can't enjoy the exquisite of the details. There are quite some excellent dialogs like the emperor talking about rules. Also, when empress know the rebellion could very possibly failed she said 'Since the flowers are ready, they will have to blossom once.'(rough meaning,can't remember the original) - It's so hard to translate this into English. In this short sentence, there's a common Chinese principle: you do it not because you want to win, but because you want to do it or you have to do it(for your own honor sometimes). It's not for the sake of its result, it is for the sake of its process. -nah...still not well explained.. I probably need to write an essay for the meaning or feeling behind it if I want myself being understood.:) About the plot. When I was watching the movie, I couldn't help thinking of another drama called 'The Thunderstorm', which is a 30s(?) Chinese drama written by Cao Yu. I just confirmed from the articles I read that the whole movie plot is actually came from 'The thunderstorm', which was regarded as one of those best dramas in China. However, as I can see from some of the comments here, quite some ppl got lost in front of big screen. It looks like there are too much action, too many ppl and too many scenes changing. Even some of the Chinese young ppl got lost too. They complained 'This is a big movie with no substance, no real meaning'. It's really sad to see so many Chinese didn't understand it at all. From my point of view, the whole story is as classic as any Shakespeare's works. What do you want more: revenge, desire,power,murder,betray...The whole world's novels and movies are just about these themes.I guess Zhang Yi Mou's only failure in arranging the movie is(it's sad to know this movie didn't win anything from Oscar) 1) The luxury visual acting and great dramatic plot distracted people from thinking of the movies real theme. -- Hey director Zhang, you overestimated your audience.:)2) A too typical eastern story expressed in a too western way. I can't deny Zhang Yi Mou is trying to please western audience in this movie. The Ninja chasing Chan's family. It's visually damn cool but please btw: about 'scantily clad' - In mid Tang Dynasty the girls are supposed to dress up like that. It isn't deviated from history too much. However, the story happened in the beginning of Tang Dynasty and I guess the designer made the costumes just to catch the audience's eyes. But too bad, the Oscar got sick of boobs already..Another thing need to mention is - Great actors and actress. I am impressed by Going Li again. Now I understand why so many western guys think she's hotter than Zhang Zi Yi. :) haha, She's best actress in China. Chou Yung-Fat is one of my favorite actors. He played the role so well and we can see the complicate personality from his performance. I checked some Chinese websites and sadly see that after the Oscar most of the people started to blame the director. This didn't surprise me. As nowadays China ppl tend to value everything according to it's market price, from movies to ppl around them. Glad to see some western viewers(like sm22281) can see it real value and comment in detail. My English is not good enough to do any deep analysis.So, I think this is still a great movie although there are some flaws. I can recommend it to anyone I know. If director Zhang can stop pleasing western viewers and stick on his own way, I think he could make it even better than now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary film which stayed with me a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a long career of cinematographic masterpieces,which were sadly underrated,I suppose director Zhang Yimou felt a lot of pressure to surpass with each new film the joys he had done.So,he decided to make more ambitious films like Hero and House of Flying Daggers.I consider that two films to be extraordinary.But,after House of Flying Daggers,Yimou made the intimate and simple film Riding Alone for Thousand of Miles and I consider that film as the least obtained one from his career.Yes,the film was deep and emotive but I felt it empty and a little boring.But,now,Yimou comes back with The Curse of the Golden Flower,an excellent film which is not only the best one of his career,it also is one of the best films from last years.The Curse of the Golden Flower is a real MOVIE...one of that pleasures which only appear sometimes.The films tells a solid and interesting story and it has a visual spectacle which is a challenge to the view.Also,the film brings real emotions.Chow Yun - Fat has a fantastic performance in this movie and Gong Li is also fantastic.There are martial arts on this film but I have to say that there are not much scenes of that.The few the film has have a porpoise to the story,and that's fantastic.Curse of the Golden Flower is an extraordinary film.This is real art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has gotten a lot of bad remarks but I think it was simply because of the few action scenes and martial arts in it but this movie, in my opinion, had more realistic fighting for it didn't have all the hopping around and jumping and floating/flying in midair, i.e Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Hero but I still love those film. This on the other hand was MUCH different.First off, the setting was stunningly beautiful. This film did a great job of capturing a mood and it sometimes made you feel you were there in that palace. You had a sense of what it was like living in that time period and what the environment was like. The art and everything else. I think it really paid off for this film.As for the acting, I LOVED it. Everyone did a great job. I don't think critics should judge these actors if they're not one themselves because the cast was brilliant. You had sympathy for each and every one of them, even if they were evil, idiotic, or down right crazy. The Empress was very good with her illness. The scenes where she was having these nervous breakdowns, when she shook, you sort of shook with her. God, it was making you crazy seeing her that way and she was taking it all in. She knew what was happening to her and something inside was just burning and wanting to scream out but she couldn't because the Emperor was in control and didn't allow disobedience. The first son and his intimate relationship with his step mother and blood sister was very interesting. It was this sick disturbing twist put into the story you think "why the hell did they do that?" but it was thrilling. Him and his sister's reactions when they found out they were related were priceless. I think anyone would have ran out screaming mad as she did. The second son, you just had to love him. His devotion to dying for his mother was heart breaking and even more when he killed himself. I was rooting for him to live on but THAT didn't happen. Seeing him die just set the Empress off completely and she just snapped. She reacted as any modern human being would have to a loss of a loved one and in suffering from losing to the Emperor who was slowly killing her softly; she screamed out her pain. The last son, well, I guess you could pity him. He was ignored and what-not; all he wanted was some attention. His act was selfish although and not such a smart move. His father gave him a old fashion whipping but it was till his death. Not such a good way to go.Overall, this movie was great and it truly showed a dysfunctional family. So if you have issues in your home, I recommend you see COTGF. It might give you a better perspective of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in a while, a movie comes along that simply takes your breath away. This, without a doubt, happens to be one of those. When assassins falling to ambush riders from the mountainside looks like a work of art, then the director and cinematographer have got to be geniuses.Throughout the film, the use of lighting to draw out a cacophony of colors - in a manner of speaking, that is - simply blows the mind away. Whether inside the imperial palace or in the courtyard, the colors just simply exploded! The fact that the film was in Chinese with subtitles did not detract from the enjoyment of the film. If anything, had it been done in English, it would have detracted from the film's authenticity.While there was the occasional indulgence in some fight scenes, this was untypical of Chinese films that the fantasy aspect - like flying swordsmen - was kept to a minimum.Wonderful, wonderful film... and to those who have yet to see it, hurry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yimou Zhang is a perfectionist. As his background came from photograph, all his movies got beautiful colors. This one is no exception, yellow, golden, red, representing so many and give audience many space to do their own interpretation and imagination.Apart from Director Zhang, the performances from Chou Yunfat and Gong Li, even three sons are marvelous, especially Chou Yunfat. His performance can get you involved so much, you can hate him, love him, sorry him. The best scene is the second son Kneed down in front of Gong Li and promised to help her rebel when he said:"I will help you just because I don't want to see you drink poison." Though it's one master art, still many improvements. Zhang can find a better customs designer and find a better musician.I enjoyed his Hero and Flying Dragger more.

		<fullReview>It is the 3rd commercial "big" movie of the master Zhang Yimou after Yinxiong (Hero) and ShiMianMaiFu (Flying Dagger). It is a wonderful combination with art and commerce, much better than the previous two.The movie tells a miserable story which is based on a famous drama in China - Leiyu (thunder storm). Due to the terrible culture reformation, lots of new generations Chinese do not know details of the drama except the title. The movie put the story into two days. It is a family tragedy, which the movie let it happens in an emperor's family.All the people in the movie can be found prototypes in Chinese traditional society. The absolute power, the revolution, the servility, the brilliant scene soon after a slaughter, all these impact my soul tempestuously. I even forgot the time.Yingxiong (Hero) inaugurated a new era of Chinese movie, ManChengJinDaiHuangJinJia (Curse of the golden flower) reaches the peak.

		<shortDescription>A rather confusing MacBeth -- however beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Kurosawa made his MacBeth with Throne of Blood, Zhang Yimou has chosen the same topic. It is, however, very confusing. As a former cinematographer, his scenery and costumes are stunning. Zhang is best with his outdoor scenery of his country and the contemplative films about the depth of feelings of the his subjects. Those are the films I love. He deviated by doing the martial arts films, House of Flying Daggers and Hero, but I think it was to try to come up with different uses of swords, spears and wire-flying martial artists than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. He did them masterfully, but his spirit is in his country and its people and the general stories of the past. I loved Raise the Red Lantern, Qui Ju, Jo Dou, and Red Sorghum. There are a few others I want to see that are in those earlier triumphs. I hope he continues to make films like his next, Riding Alone for a Thousand Miles. Absolutely wonderful. As for this film, I take it as a tribute to Kurosawa andShakespeare, nothing more. Kurosawa did it better. Zhang should stick with his cinematographic and in-depth studies of people. There he shines as a master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An indisputable masterpiece, unlike anything you have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've not been an admirer of Zhang's work since he turned his eyes to commercial movies. However, this one is completely different.Let me start with the negatives first. There are commercial excesses in the movie, a la Titanic or King Kong (2006). Also, the colours are sometimes too saturated for the audience to appreciate. Finally, the fighting sequences are not convincing and the doctor's daughter's story is not well developed.However, everything else about this movie is breathtakingly beautiful and thought-provoking. I agree with many reviewers regarding the connection between this movie and Shakespeare's plays or the Chinese novelist Ba Jin's work. However, movies can use a lot of instruments unavailable to plays, which this movie makes full use of.The cast are simply fabulous. I cannot sing high enough praise of the acting of Gong Li. It seems that she is living the character's life. The male leads are no less great. The concept of the movie is simple yet the fine details are well taken care of by these actors and support staff, which makes it an achievement akin to a grand opera. Speaking of opera, might I add the music is wonderfully matched to the story, which enhances the dramatic effect? Watch it in theatres while you can. Or, you owe yourself to purchase this movie on DVD if you love art cinema, theatre, or opera. Don't watch or buy it if you are looking for Kungfu.</fullReview>

'Curse of The Golden Flower' is great as I have expected to be. It's not a kung-fu, which I despise, but a drama which took place in the Forbidden City.I love the cinematography. It's like a poetry by colours. Golden, silver, red. Dancing on the screen, making my heart melts.Two thumbs up for Chow Yun Fat's and Gong Li's act. They are top performers. I can feel their rage, hatred, sorrow, and pain. As for Jay Chow, I cannot say that I fancy him but he's okay.However there's something bugging my mind.

		<fullReview>It is often difficult to describe the story full of specific culture to foreigners within a short two hour movie. With such limitation and the objective to be an international film, director Zhang has chosen a very simple screenplay for this movie. I can not say I am not disappointed to such empty and non realistic content. Neither can I say I don't have a good time when I am in the theater and filled my eyes with all the visual stimuli. There is a reason that people want larger and larger screen with finer and finer resolution. It can't help about the movie writing, but it does help the movie seeing.Story is happened with one day in a royal family. The eldest son of the king is having affair with his step-mother. The king decide to punish his wife's betray. And the queen response to this by convincing her own son to take over the crown. All these happen on September 9th, the day that traditionally family member will be getting together in a high place. On that day, you will see the flowers cover palace, the girls occupy the corridor and the soldiers fight in blood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a movie that is a cliché from start to finish.The first hour tells a very simple and predictable old story (you could sum it up in a couple of sentences) and doesn't even bother to embellish the basic premise with any subplot or details. Instead it fills time with interminably long "smouldering" looks (sorry, this was not good acting as some claim, it was first-grade ham) and people running around the over-the-top set swishing their over-the-top costumes about or showing off their cleavage.Then the second half changes tack completely and turns the whole thing into "how many thousands of people can we get to run/jump/fly at each other while swishing various weapons around?". Utterly silly assassins flying around all over the place, squealing... it's truly like a *parody* of a Chinese historical action movie! Which wouldn't be so bad except it takes itself far too seriously! It's so obvious they were trying to "make an epic". Enough with the rainbow-coloured costumes and interiors, which don't look at all classy or beautiful. Stop labouring the fact that the good army are on the gold and yellow side and the bad army are all black and gunmetal. I got it already, it's not clever.It's a silly, simple story done about as tediously as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just my afterthoughts after seeing this movie. I am not a huge movie fan and I don't know how to write a "proper" comment. :) It requires a fair amount of knowledge of the Chinese traditional culture or beliefs in order to understand what is going on in the movie. The lack of it will significantly decrease the enjoyability of this movie, rendering the audience feeling "funny" or ignorant of what is being presented:- According to some very ancient Chinese literature, The Chong Yang Festival was celebrated in the royal palace with Chrysanthemums and the evergreen plant (called simply "the berries" in the movie). This festival gives the stage to the story. The youngest prince in the movie has explained this festival really quickly, but I am sure many people just missed that.- And just before that, when the King saw his sons coming up the tower to meet him, he said: "To the highest mountains my brothers ascend, but one is missing the berries in his hair." It is from a Tang Dynasty Poem by Wang Wei, meaning how the poet had missed his homeland on the day of the Chong Yang Festival, and he regretted that he was not among his brothers on that day. And "the berries" was actually a medical herb and also a talisman to ward of evil according to Chinese legends. This herb finally appears when the royal family put them on at the night of Chong Yang Festival in the movie.- Chrysanthemums means longevity. Chong Yang Festival was also known as the Chrysanthemums Festival. Chrysanthemums wine was drank on that day too.- Legend has it that the family should leave home on Chong Yang Festival to avoid disaster. Another way of seeking longevity.Though the family relations were a mess in the movie, I didn't miss the point when the King grabbed the Queen's hand and wrote together the four Chinese characters: "Loyality, Filial Piety, Ritual, Righteousness". It is too ironic to see a traitor like the King himself emphasizing on these things again and again. And the tragedy of this royal family all came from the lack of these virtues in the father, and he could not force his children to do them without setting up a good model.Since this movie was about family feud, I want to see the story more than the special effects or martial arts. However, it fails to touch people's hearts because all characters are so hard to relate to. If the Queen was to be thought of as a victim, so were her treacherous, rebellious, or foolishly loyal (not in any particular order) sons. I think more time should be spent on building up the story instead of making the relations so complicated. At the point where the story is supposed to reveal a secret, I just feel so disgusting instead of surprising.I think if the movie could provide a positive side of the human nature (there is a little bit found in the doctor, but it is definitely not enough to leave any impression) as a contrast to what this royal family is doing, it would make this movie more memorable as we could relate to what values the director could have believed in or could have wanted to show.And to compare Prince Jie to Hamlet? He didn't even ask himself to be or not to be and made his decision in less than a minute!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Watched in Toronto) The Chinese live theatre scene saw a development towards modern "spoken theatre" in the 1930s (SPOILER warning to those who are familiar with this subject). In 1933, one of the prominent playwrights, Cao Yu, produced "Thunderstorm" which has to-date remained one of the most popular Chinese "modern" plays and, incidentally, was made into a movie in 1957, which features Bruce Lee in one of his few non-fighting roles. While "Thunderstorm" was in some respect inspired by Ibsen's "Ghosts", "Curse of the golden flower" is an almost 100 per cent copy of "Thunderstorm" insofar as the plot is concerned, down to the details of the intense medicine-drinking scene. The only difference is that the dictatorial head of the family in "Thunderstorm" is not an emperor, but a business tycoon, and the medicine is not poisoned as in "Curse". Those who know "Thunderstorm" will recognise the transported plot in "Curse" probably quite early in the movie. For the rest, a majority of probably 99.9999% of the audience, the plot twists would have quite an impact, as evidenced in the various IMDb comments. But, whatever you think of the plot, it is NOT NEW.A lot of the movie rests on the powerful story, which is quite self-evident when you consider that during the entire first half of the movie, there was only one action sequence, one of no consequence as it's only a practicing sword bout between father and son (emperor and prince, if you prefer). In fact, the movie is not strong on action. Try as he may, director Zhang Yimou is unable to surpass, or even repeat, the visual feast he served up in "Heroes" and "House of flying daggers". The action sequences in "Curse" are, in a word, dull, unless you get a kick out of watching rank and file of men wearing golden armours running together. If you do, consider yourself fortunate because you'll find happiness in any half-decent video game. But I should be fair, as the action featuring prowl Ninja assassins is exciting. That comes at about the middle of the 2-hour movie. Don't miss it.The main attraction of this movie is the acting, of which ample opportunity is provided in Cao Yu's powerful drama (no objections if you prefer to call it melodrama). If you are familiar with "Thunderstorm", you'll see the carbon copy of the figures ? the bastard of a head of the household, repressed but rebellious second wife, weak self-pitying older son, idealistic second son, sweet innocent girl??and more (but there is no third son in "Thunderstorm") ? although the events are somewhat different as the story is transplanted into an intriguing palace. Chow Yun-fat is delightfully wicked, Gong Li lovingly defiant and Liu Ye appropriately tragic. These three top-notch actors have all found their perfect niche in this movie (although I must admit that I have never seen Chow being so evil, convincingly so). The supporting actors are adequate, and it is interesting to see Asia's top pop singer (think Robbie Williams) Jay Chou taking on a role quite different from the young Japanese car racing wiz kid in "Initial D".</fullReview>

Having seen "Hero" and "House of flying dagger" I find this one to be the most empty vessel of them all. There is plot, a lot of it, but why would you as a viewer care. There are relationships but they are hardly developed and get "killed" out of the movie. And then the martial arts. It's hard to see the choreography so it gets a little boring apart from the first scene. I'm hoping Yimou gets back to the scaled-down stories of his starting years, because all this glitter and gold has been done before with more substance behind it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from watching the 8.30 pm show at Vivo City Gold Class and I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable the movie was.I guess it could have been the bad press with the movie but I was really very impressed with Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat. They are true virtuosos, masters of their fields. Very impressed with the both of them.Even that Jay Chou wasn't that bad although, although to be honest, he is just too green and inexperienced. He was miscast as the 2nd Prince because of his lack of good looks, but I can see that he tried his best.But Gong Li, who acted opposite Jay as his mother was superb. Her convulsions (because of a long time illness no spoilers) were realistic.Her varied range of emotions were a joy to watch. I didn't feel she was acting; you don't see the wheels moving. Chow Yun Fat's Mandarin wasn't that bad too. Not at all. He exudes the strength and power of the ruthless Emperor.The only person whom I thought over acted was the actor, Ye Liu, who played the Crown Prince. I was not used to his acting. Now with him, you could see him acting.The action scenes were not a lot since this is more of a political intrigue film BUT the two major action scenes were very impressive.One happened at a small villa amidst the mountains.The other is the one at the end which occurred at the Imperial Palace.The only gripe I have with this film is the set decoration. It is quite garish.The colors on the pillar walls were like these tie dye t-shirts which Rupert of Survivor wore. Really odd.The costumes were not too bad. Even with my Chinese background, it was all alien to me.I am not sure it's authentic but I will give the costumers the benefit of the doubt. They must have done they research to stand by the deep cleavage of the actresses.Now I know where all the money went to. Though the set decoration can be a bit rainbow-brite for me, it certainly was opulent.Go watch this film. It is a must see.</fullReview>

I went my classmates, all of them male, and they ended up not liking it because there were too much talking and not enough action.I, on the other hand, thought that the drama was well-written and well-acted. Some parts were exaggerated (ie. the fight scenes, and the announcement of time of day every 10 mins..) But overall I enjoyed the interactions between characters in the film. It was also interesting for me to see how the characters end up doing what they do, and seeing the story finishes in the way that it does.It IS a depressing film, though. Plus, if you're looking for lots of action, you'll be disappointed. The fight scenes only happens at the later half of the movie.But if you're up for good drama, then go watch. Other than Jay Chow's so-so performance, I thought all the acting were very well done.It's definitely much better than Hero and Flying Daggers (in terms of story and structure). I haven't seen the Banquet so I can't comment on that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curse of the Golden Flower reunites Zhang Yimou and Gong Li for the first time in eleven years. Boy, was I excited, but then, this movie started to receive negative reviews. I went to see this movie myself and I was blown away..This movie has been described as a martial arts epic. It is not. It's simply a story about a dysfunctional imperial family, nothing more. I think one of the primary reasons why people thought this was disappointing is because they expected A LOT of action. The trailers are a bit misleading, because there really isn't all that much action in this movie. Zhang Yimou is a master at storytelling, and he does it exceptionally well in this film.Acting. Jay Chou's performance disgusts me. This boy needs acting school, and how he got cast in Curse, I do not know. Not only was his performance bad, but his appearance was ridiculous. The audience in my theater laughed when Chou made his first appearance. The acting in this movie was overall good excluding Jay Chou. Gong Li delivered an amazing performance, as always, as well as Chow Yun-Fat, Liu Ye, and Li Man.Action. Like I have stated earlier, there isn't much action in this film and with the very little action that exists, it wasn't really all that impressive.Overall, I give this movie a 9/10. One star deducted because of the lousy action and Jay Chou's performance. Ignore the action in this movie and you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curse of the Golden Flower is a spectacle. On a technical level it's everything a great wuxia film has to be. The sets are wondrous, the costumes defy believe, the makeups are detailed and the music fits everything nicely.If only the story or the characters were more interesting. As they are, I have problems remembering what the plot was even about, now that some time has passed. It's that generic. There was something about a royal family torn asunder by internal struggles, a new stepmother in the middle of it all, and various sons scheming to come out on the top, but it was so hard to follow because characters seemed to change alliances on a whim and in the end I only had the barest idea about who betrayed who and stayed loyal to whom.The acting is also rather stifled. Though I blame the script more than the actors, who each have some good moments throughout the film. The interactions of the imperial family are heavily formalized, ceremonial and most of all cold, which actually might have been the case in real life as well, but a great movie it makes not.Curse of the Golden Flower is worth a watch for fans of wuxia genre. It's amazing to look at and perhaps I just wasn't in a receptive enough mood to appreciate the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, quite plainly, a dreadful movie. It's hard to believe that this is the director of The Road Home. The golden costumes--tinsel, tinsel, tinsel--that so often fill the screen are laughably gaudy and cannot be justified on the basis of historical accuracy. The exquisite Gong Li chews up the scenery and then spits it out, and the grimaces of the Eldest Son when he discovers that darkest of secrets-- predictable with a capital P--are difficult to watch without smiling sadly and sympathetically for the actor. My knowledge of Mandarin is thin, so I had to watch the movie accompanied by the English soundtrack...my Lord, what overheated clichés are shoveled in our direction. There is not a death scene in the movie (and there are many) that doesn't involved writhing, screaming, and an obligatory facial closeup. The final battle was, I suppose predictably, more like the stylized mass choreography preceding the Olympics (Yimou was responsible for those, too) than anything that might actually have happened in battle. If you want to see Yimou do something like this much more adroitly, I recommend House of Flying Daggers or even Hero. This film, to put it plainly, is a waste of everyone's talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zhang makes a film that LOOKS nearly as good as his "House of Flying Daggers", but IS it as good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The answer is a resounding "No"."Curse of the Golden Flower" is another beautiful visual film from Zhang.The storyline is about a Royal family in turmoil. Gong Li and Chow Yun-Fat are good as usual, and the acting on the whole is strong. So what's wrong with this movie.I think it's quite simple. The movie is basically set-up for failure. The whole time it seemed as if Zhang might have been trying to out-do himself - spending so much time on set pieces that he kind of left the cinematography in the drawer. The other problem is the storyline. There's no payoff for the viewer, and we don't get any likable qualities from any of the characters. There's no one to root for!It was a hard watch - hard enough that the visuals couldn't save the day. The visuals ARE spectacular, but this movie was a labor of LOST love for both the director and the audience. It's a not a bad film by any means. There was a lot of care put into the look of this film. I've already mentioned other positive qualities, but I have no desire to see this again.61/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lavish Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing like a grand martial arts epic, and few can do better then Zhang Yimou, director of Hero and House of Flying Daggers.In the year 928 AD the Chinese Royal Family are about to celebrate the Chong Yang Festival. The Emperor (Chow Yun Fat) and his second son Prince Jai (Jay Chou), had been fighting at the frontier and are returning to the Forbidden City. The Empress (Gong Li), a strong woman and the Emperor's second wife, was in charge of the preparations, but showing signs of being ill. With the court of Forbidden City there are dealings, plots, secrets and power-plays. There are affairs, and murder plots. The Empress discovers that she has been poisoned on orders on the Emperor. She discovers his secrets and plots to overthrow him with aid of her son.The art-direction and costumes are fantastic. It is bright, grand and colourful, a wonder to the eye. The cinematography is also of a high calibre.As a film Curse of the Golden Flower is the Chinese version of a costume drama. It is melodrama at times, but all the court relationships and subplots all come together. It is a story of revenge, grandeur and a family falling apart.Zhang Yimou is known as a martial arts director, and his action scene are great. There is no exceptions here, particular in the beginning. It is over-the-top, but if you enjoy other Chinese epics like Warlords, and Red Cliff you should enjoy this.The acting is of a good standard. Chow Yun-Fat is one of the best actor/material artist from China and Hong Kong. He role is fairly small, but he does play a villain effectively. Gong Li is also an especially actress in China and Hong Kong, acting in a lot of successful films. She is an effective screen presence, but she did seem to young to have two adult sons. Jay Chou was also a decent actor in this film.I think out of Zhang Yimou's three epics, Curse of the Golden Flower is the weakest: but it is still a very entertainment film and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Shakespeare could have thought this up...except he didn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing a person will notice when they watch "Cures of the Golden Flower" is its vivid imagery. If you thought "Speed Racer" was an eyeful, check this out! It's just as colorful, except that it's all real (or at least it seems to be). If there's any true statement that can be made about Zhang Yimou's 2006 film, it's that it's NEVER dull in the visual sense. It's a pity that the story couldn't have been just as strong. Then we'd have a real masterpiece! In ancient China, trouble is brewing in the royal palace. The royal family has come home to celebrate the Chrysanthemum Festival. The Emperor (Chow Yun Fat) is a power hungry sadist who is slowly poisoning his wife (Gong Li). Her sons (Jay Chou, Yi Liu, Junjie Qin) are in the middle of this increasingly stretched chasm. If this seems like something Shakespeare would write, I was thinking the same thing, but it isn't.The problem with the film is that the storyline is weak, and the characters are sketchily developed. These aren't necessarily bad qualities, but a film that tells a broad story with one-dimensional characters needs to have more bombast. Visually, the film has it. But story-wise, it thinks it's more complex and developed than it is. As a result, the film drags, especially in the middle.At least the acting is good. The film stars two of Asian cinema's shining stars, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li. Typically, Chow Yun Fat has played the hero type in films (this is especially so for American audiences). Given his background as an action star (he was a favorite of John Woo and one of the stars of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), one might assume he's incapable of playing a bad guy. Think again. The Emperor is truly evil. He's got a vicious mean-streak a mile long, and no act of sadism is beyond him. Admittedly, Gong Li doesn't have much to do except look crazy, but Li is so talented that she can make even the most boring character the best in the film (there's a reason why she's known as the Asian Meryl Streep). Her sons fare worse. Ye Liu is flat, bordering on bad. Jay Chou manages to be the only likable character in the film, and the only one we really feel for. Junjie Qin is unimportant. However, Man Li, Liu's lover, is adorable, and despite having a secondary role, she has the most visible character arc.Zhang Yimou has a flair for visuals, that much is certain. However, although his films "Hero" and "House of Flying Daggers" became art-house hits with the demand for stylized Asian martial arts movies after the success of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," they were both defined by one thing: they lacked a story. With "Curse of the Golden Flower," he's rectified that, at least somewhat. At the rate he's going, in a few films he's going to create a masterpiece.I recommend the film, but note that although the beginning is weak, it gets better. Just stick with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sony Pictures Classic produced movie is about the family politics prevailing amongst the Tang dynasty of China. This a movie where King tries to kill her wife, empress who want to overthrow her husband from the throne has an extra marital affair with her step son, who is the crown prince, this prince is in love with a maid at the palace, his brother wants the throne.The story is complex but editor and director has done a commendable job of presenting the movie in simple and beautiful way. Movie has very good background score which matches the majestic sets of the Forbidden City, which is portrayed in all its might. This movie boasts of some great special effects, the action and battle scenes are quiet magnificent.Actors has complimented each other extremely well, Chow Yun Fat as the Emperor is great. But sometimes we are not able to understand where the story is going. Also at times movie becomes boring, as some scenes are repeated.http://moviesopinion.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespearean plotting in Imperial China</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started watching this I expected plenty of action as in other other films directed by Zhang Yimou that I'd seen, however this film mainly follows the political machinations of the Imperial family. This was not a bad thing as it was gripping stuff that felt more like a Shakespearean tragedy rather than a martial arts film.As one would expect from a film by Zhang Yimou the design is amazing with stunning colours and fantastic choreography both in the fight scenes and showing the general goings on in the imperial court.Things in the imperial court isn't going well, the empress is having an affair with her stepson, he is also involved with the court doctor's daughter, the doctor is poisoning the Empress on the orders of the Emperor. When she learns that she is being poisoned she plots to overthrow the emperor during the chrysanthemum festival. There are other motivations and sub-plots but I don't want to spoil them all.I've already mentioned the look of the film but that doesn't mean that I think the acting wasn't good too, especially Gong Li as the Empress. If you liked Zhang Yimou's previous films I'd recommend that you give this a go, just don't expect quite so much action despite what the reviews quoted on the DVD box might suggest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that you don't necessarily need to see more than once. Don't get me wrong this is an excellent film &amp; one of those films for whatever reason didn't translate to U.S. Box office. I saw this in Theaters all by my lonesome when it came out. It wasn't that it wasn't advertised well, no one seemed to want to see it. This is a fantastic film &amp; those that can wait, will be thrilled for some of the biggest fight scenes ever put on film. What is most surprising, is that the best part of the film is the ending &amp; I won't put any spoilers, but I will say that it doesn't involve fighting at all. Chow Yun-Fat is great as the Emperor &amp; Gong Li as his Queen are both really good in their roles. The two sons although not really known also hold their own &amp; lesser actors would have had a hard time playing opposite the two stars. If you are one of those that loved "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero, or House of Flying Daggers," then be sure to check out this. If you just liked those, well skip to the fight sequences because more than likely you need to see things blow up &amp; don't care about the excellent character &amp; family development. This isn't quite "Crouching Tiger" but it is better than the later two films I mentioned. Especially if you live in the states and consider yourself a true movie fan, no matter the language, (they're called subtitles, deal with it!) then stick this in your rental queue or check it out at the video store. Be sure to know the name because most clerks won't have a clue what you're talking about &amp; that is a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intriguing Movie Full Of Secrets And Lies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty good movie that offers an obviously fictionalized look at life behind the scenes in the court of the Tang Dynasty of 9th century China. Given the apparent fascination movie makers have with dysfunctional families, it's perhaps not surprising that this fascination has spread to China. The family of Emperor Ping makes the House of Windsor look like paragons of virtue by comparison. The Emperor is slowly poisoning his Empress. Why he's doing that is a bit of a mystery, but the story is slowly revealed. Each of the Emperor's three sons get involved in the intrigue in various ways, and the result is a sometimes bewildering series of events in which it's hard to know exactly who is plotting against who from moment to moment. In spite of the obvious soap opera feel, the movie is interesting enough and offers a spectacular glimpse (if accurate) into the opulence of a 9th century Chinese Emperor's court. The movie lacks the heavy martial arts emphasis that some of the Chinese historical epics are full of, but it should be noted that what there is in this movie is less "beautiful" in its portrayal than in some others movies, as well as being exceptionally violent and at times bloody. There are secrets galore that keep coming out as the movie goes on - certainly enough to retain the attention of the viewer. Overall, one of the more enjoyable movies of this genre that I've seen. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From seeing the trailers i was expecting this to be more like the other films of Zhang Yimou's such as Hero or House of Flying Daggers, but this came as a surprise to me, not because of the lack of martial arts but how this tale of a corrupt and deceitful royal family really becomes a fascination to you. The film itself has a tone of intenseness, mainly due to Gong Li's performance, along with the terrific music score that adds that electric energy into the scenes. The visuals are fantastic though I feel that visual effects has a big part in it to play.I would have liked to comment on the story's message but that would lead me into spoiling the plot. This film isn't' really for everyone, and is not a pleasant film in terms of its progress, but the visual look of the film, beautiful Gong Li and an equally convincing Chow Yun Fat makes a good bundle. China certainly knows how to make its conspiracy films much more entertaining - more focus on the characters and their developments. The film leads you into the outcome with such intensity that you are rooting for some of the characters to win in this battle of adultery, backstabbing, betrayal and family anguish. Honestly, this was like watching an operatic performance displayed very well on the screen, that will want you wishing you could be at the set itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a strange, yet in it's own way, very beautiful motion picture. The film does not have a great script, the story is often confusing and the dialogs could have been 'deeper', more involving. But having said that, the visuals in this film are so stunning they alone carry this motion picture effortlessly. The colors, the set decoration, the costumes and the cinematography alone make this movie worth watching. I have rarely (if ever) seen anything better in this respect. I think it is scandalous that this film only received a nomination for costume design. It should have easily won in that department (and probably would have if it had been a Hollywood production), and should have at least received nominations for the cinematography and set decoration as well.If the script was only nearly as good as the visuals, this movie would have been a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>However overused the expression may be, Curse of the Golden Flower is a movie that gives you the perfect excuse to shell out on a massive flat screen television. Director Zhang Yimou is already renowned for his striking cinematography and the ability to produce some of the most beautiful martial arts films you will ever see, but it still cannot prepare you for what a visual experience it is. This film is simply beautiful, every shot, every camera angle, every frame has been carefully considered and planned out to ensure that the images tell the story as much as the acting, the colour practically bursting out the screen. The story meanwhile is packed full of the intrigue, treachery, violence and tragedy that have become synonymous with Yimou and the finished film comes off like a Chinese version of Ran, only with more Ninjas and fewer Samurai.Set once again in feudal China, Yimou visits the sumptuous palaces of the ruling classes as the Emperor Ping (Chow Yun-Fat) returns home with his son Prince Jai (Jay Chou) after a prolonged absence. His intention is apparently to celebrate the upcoming Chrysanthemum festival with his wife (Gong Li) and his sons, Princes Wan (Liu Ye) and Yu (Jungie Qin). However, his intentions are altogether more sinister and in his time away, secret allegiances have been made and illicit affairs have sprung up, leading to mistrust and secrecy among the royal family. As their various plots unravel, the palace is set for a collision of loyalties that result in bitterness, violence and death. Thank God the in-laws didn't show up as well or things could have got really messy.Needless to say, Golden Flower is grandiose film making on an epic scale. Yimou was clearly going for a Shakespearean tale of folly and disaster amid the ruling classes and despite the occasional over the top breakdown, he pulls it off. The actors meanwhile succeed admirably in their roles, Gong Li, Jay Chou and the veteran Chow Yun Fat especially. These are royals after all and showing their emotions when their status prevents it is no easy task, but they all commit themselves well. Chow absolutely shines as the scheming, no-nonsense Emperor and it's easy to see why Gong Li has been such a success on the international sphere.What may be most surprising though is that for the majority of the film, there is almost no violence at all. Instead, Yimou favours tension-filled family meetings and back room negotiations. In this sense, it is more of a family drama than a 'proper' martial arts movie, but the balance is readdressed in the action-packed finale where an army of Gold clad warriors storms the palace for a vicious battle among the courtyards and corridors so intense that characters are literally buried beneath corpses.Aside from the fact that the subtitles on the DVD are infuriatingly small, there aren't many complaints I could make about this movie. As a piece of purely visual art it is breathtaking and while it might get a bit silly every now and again (the sheer number of soldiers appearing out of nowhere in the finale, the Ninjas in the attic), it's a welcome addition to any Eastern cinema collection. It's also (whisper it) not as long as you might think and tells a story that had the potential to be four hours long in less than two. It's not the greatest martial arts movie ever, but it's certainly the brightest and if you only ever watch one Zhang Yimou film, Curse of the Golden Flower is a good choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yimou's psychedelic spectacle is less martial and more art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zhang Yimou, easily China's most ambitious director, is now well established as the helmer of well-crafted, classy martial arts extravaganzas. His previous epics Hero and House of Flying Daggers captivated us with good old fashioned tales of honour and heroism, coupled with staggering stunts and jaw-dropping visuals. So, many of his fans might be slightly baffled by this third, and apparently final, instalment of what he calls his 'wushu trilogy'. Surprisingly, Yimou's latest delve into ancient China is conspicuously high in discussion and low on action. In fact this regal tale of family loyalties, incest and betrayal seems to have more in common with a Greek Tragedy or Shakespearean drama than Asian actioneer. First off ? a warning; The Curse of the Golden Flower is hard to watch. This has nothing to do with the level of violence, which is atypically sparse but typically bloodless, nor anything to do with the convoluted plot, which is, by previous standards, relatively straightforward. Visually however, Yimou's latest is the cinematic equivalent of an acid trip. For those of us enamoured with Hero's gorgeously simple colour-coded palate, provided by genius cinematographer Christopher Doyle, Curse of the Golden Flower will come as something of a shock. Gone are the splendid panoramic vistas. New collaborator Xiaoding Zhao keeps us locked up inside stiflingly lavish sets along with the heroine, painting every frame with liberal splashes of gaudy prime colours to rival Joel Schumacher in Batman mode. Everything from dresses to drapes looks like it's been in a hot wash with Joseph's technicoloured dream coat. Gone too is the quiet, dignified grandeur of its forebears. Competing with their set for our attention the characters tear around the place as dramatically as can be, and everywhere you look there's a pair of ripe bosoms threatening to escape a rib-crunching bodice. But, once you've adjusted your senses to all this flamboyance, there's no denying the striking beauty, and Yimou's penchant for melodrama rarely exceeds what this story of passion and propriety demands. Only occasionally does Yimou grant us respite from all the decadence of Gong Li's exquisite prison, and fittingly these location scenes are like coming up for air. Zhao demonstrates he also has an eye for more conventional beauty as we're taken to golden mountains for the film's first all-out fight sequence. Here Yimou finally delivers some truly innovative action, with black clad ninjas soaring through the air with grapple hooks and zip-wires and ready to kick some ass. Action aficionados will be left wanting though, as these moments are few and far between, and, in keeping with the mostly sombre tone, the stunt men rein in their more outrageous gravity defying moves. This isn't to say the unfurling personal drama isn't riveting to watch. Like with all the Bard's best, it's just as pleasing to witness the clashing of venomous words as of swords. Yun-Fat is effectively nonchalant as the cruel patriarch, although we're not given enough cause to thoroughly hate him. The standout role of course belongs to Gong Li, who, as a mixture of Hamlet's Gertrude and Anthony and Cleopatra's Egyptian drama-queen, brilliantly portrays the proud Empress attempting to conceal a well of emotion beneath a flawless mask of makeup. With two thirds of the film dedicated to establishing the ticking time bomb of repressed emotions and hidden agendas, it becomes clear that the film could easily collapse under the combined weight of Gong Li's opulent head gear and its own plot strands. On the odd occasion things threaten to descend into Eastenders-worthy farce (in some situations there is literally nothing left to do but run away screaming), but one suspects, or would hope, in these more ridiculous moments Yimou's tongue is lodged firmly inside his cheek. When it all eventually explodes Yimou abandons restraint entirely and pulls out all the stops, staging his most ambitious battle yet in a courtyard of potted chrysanthemums, which is equally absurd and enthralling. It's all terrific fun, but what we're missing in all the chaos of the final act however is a real hero. Chou's un-charismatic prince just doesn't cut it.Unconventional, outrageous and overwrought though it may be, we mustn't begrudge Yimou's desire to try something a bit different. What we get is the closest he's yet come to a character study, but with all the thrills of the best kind of theatre. Besides, we don't need another Hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful looking movie that is meant to make the viewers feel disgusted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first ten minutes sitting through this movie was a bit of a shock. There was gold and jewels and jade and colored glass all over the palace. The young slave girls were dressed in tight dresses that displayed their heaving bosoms, the Empress is all dressed in gold embroidery. Everyone, and I mean everyone in this film looks really gorgeous. So what's the problem that I see? Everything was too much. There was too much glitter, too much gold, after awhile, it just got too much that I felt vaguely disgusted by what I was looking at. And I think that's what the director wanted.This movie is about the ugliness of a dysfunctional family (in this case, the royal family of China). It did not matter that the Emperor and his family lived amidst such great wealth and extravagance, they were miserable and they were also in the midst of destroying themselves. This is not an easy movie to watch as it goes through betrayal, incest (really yucky stuff) and murder.To put it briefly, the Empress knows she's being poisoned by the Emperor and she wreaks such vengeance that it breaks apart the whole family.I thought the acting was very good. Gong Li is very watchable and she makes the viewer feel both sympathetic, yet disgusted towards her. Chow Yun Fat shows such evil and arrogance in his role as the Emperor. And yet, as the Emperor, he still has a certain charm. The Emperor may be pretty rotten to the core, but Chow Yun Fat in this character makes the viewer feel for the emperor too. During this film I was mesmerized by Chow Yun Fat's remarkable performance. If you are not interested in anything else in this film, at least see this film for Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li's performances.The problems with this film has a lot to do with pacing. There were some spots during this long movie where everything just dragged. A man sitting across from me in the theater fell asleep and started snoring. That's not good at all! Also, during the film, a man and his kids quickly ran into the theater and sat down. I guess they were expecting some sort of action, kung fu movie, which this film was not in spite of some breathtaking fighting towards the end of the movie. After about fifteen minutes, the man took his kids out of the theater and left. I think I heard him complaining loudly that there wasn't any action going on. Word of warning, read some movie reviews before taking your children to see a specific movie. This movie was definitely not for young children.It's not a great movie, it's a little pretentious, rent and watch it for the performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flower blooms but not as bright as Yimou's previous works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Curse of the Golden Flower" A film review by Brian Murphy"Man Cheng jin dai huang jin jia," or "Curse of the Golden Flower," writer/director Zhang Yimou's latest epic dissecting the dynasties of ancient China, is a powerful film that stubbornly refuses to end. The film examines the psyche of the Imperial Family during the Tang dynasty: Their loyalties/disloyalties towards one another, forbidden love affairs, Shakespearian murder plots and the families' resolve or disintegration during a time of rebellion.Mr. Yimou explores characters, story lines and thematic elements similar to his past films. The royal family is headed by the unsympathetic Emperor Ping (Chow Yun-Fat); a stoic, sometimes brutal patriarch who is comparable to the King of Qin in Yimou's masterpiece, "Hero." He has married the honorable Empress Phoenix (Gong Li) to gain the throne, and her defiance of him is proof that theirs is not a marriage of love. Of their three sons, Prince Jie (Chou Jay) and Prince Cheng (Junjie Qin) are completely biological, while Crown Prince Xiang (Liu Ye), the next in line for the crown, was the product of the Emperor and his first wife, a common woman. Xiang has formed two secret love affairs, one with servant girl named Chan Jiang, and the other is with his stepmother, the Empress. Mr. Yimou has explored forbidden love affairs before, in "House of Flying Daggers." Suspecting that her husband is slowly poisoning her to death, Empress Phoenix has decided to enact revenge upon her devious husband, planning a rebellion for the Chrysanthemum Festival (hence the title of the film). If you thought the band of misfits from "Little Miss Sunshine" were a dysfunctional family, wait until you get a load of the Imperial Family. While rich in cinematography, bursting with color, flowing with passion and glorious with set construction (the Imperial Kingdom is stunning), the story plays like a Greek tragedy, along the lines of "Oedipus Rex." With a shocking conclusion that echoes Chan-Wook Park's devastating "Oldboy," and, sadly, the cheesy 80's comedy "My Chauffeur," the tone of the film ranges from stoic reverence to seething anger, so there is no room between the palace walls for an uplifting ending. Mr. Yimou is a brilliant storyteller and director, and he seamlessly blends scenes that display the rich tradition of servants and masters, tender moments of mother and son, and the passion of lovers, yet somehow manages to depict violence, warriors and assassins with the same, cautious eye. A scene involving lovers Xiang and Chang quickly transforms to a violent assassination attempt by ninjas who gracefully glide from the mountains before inflicting their malevolence. Despite his artistic gifts, and perhaps in spite of them, Mr. Yimou constantly wrestles with a timely ending to most of his films. Like Peter Jackson's "The Return of the King," the climax of "Curse of the Golden Flower" is a prime example of a great director exercising his demons by defiantly refusing to kill his film when it needs to die. The result is a heavy-handed, overwrought conclusion that sucks some of the weight from what had preceded it. The dynamic of the mother-son/daughter-son relationship is not further enhanced by extending the increasingly ludicrous battle near the film's end, nor is the symbolic language strengthened by the repeated hammering of it into our skulls during and after said battle. Mr. Yimou has created a mythic world out of an actual one, deftly commanding his actors and receiving emotional performances, in return. When he learns to be more concise, he will truly be among the most prolific directors in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People entering the theatre expecting to see Hero II or HoFD Revisited will be disappointed. This isn't a slow-mo art-house piece (granted, a very good one) or a nauseatingly drawn out love story (not so good). Curse of the Golden Flower is drama on the highest level. It's not without flaws, but the pure electricity of its high-wire act makes it definitely worth seeing.Ensconed in an opulent palace is the royal family, comprised of the Empress, the Emperor, and their three children. The Chrysanthenum Festival is approaching, so everyone is getting ready for some peace and harmony. Sounds picturesque. But the Emperor is slowly poisoning the Empress for her incestuous relationship with her stepson, the second prince has returned after exile, the youngest child pretends to be innocent, and the Empress has decided she isn't going to let her husband drive her mad for free. This movie is Gong Li's from her first sip of the poisoned medicine, her first tremors from the corrosive force of her husband's hate. Zhang Yimou has returned to a woman's perspective, back to where he rose to fame with movies focusing on a woman's struggle in a patriarchal world. At the same time, he elevates each character to superhuman levels. This isn't merely Hamlet; it's Antigone and Medea set on Mount Olympus. Reflecting this, some of the action and shots are highly stylized; the sea of soldiers is better as an ocean of armor than a bunch of individuals. Moreover, the characters have been so twisted and stifled by the weight of their brocaded gowns that it's no wonder every move and every glance borders on madness. Catching glimpses of the vulnerable human being underneath the brutal insanity is both fascinating and terrifying business. If you can accept that Zhang Yimou isn't going to provide you with mollifying respites, that each character is savage and desperate and flawed, that this is grand tragedy the only way it should be done, then you'll be amazed.So now, the flaws. Jay Chou makes a disastrous entrance. In his initial scenes he is wooden and oddly sullen. Throughout the film he improves by leaps and bounds, but first impressions last. Next, the screenplay does not allow any of the characters to fully develop. We're given tantalizing glimpses, but any more intimate connection is bumped aside for another tour of the palace, more horrorshows of madness. Superhumans still need a human component; we're less interested in super-cutouts orbiting through space.The bottom line: this is a tight drama buoyed by amazing visuals and some riveting acting. It's not for those who want to walk out feeling as perky as Jay Chou's closing credits song, but it satisfies in spades Aristotle's requirements for a great tragedy: catharsis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Ceinemagraphy, Average Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Executive Summary: This movie is a welcome change from typical Hollywood movies. It has great cinematography, good story, and good costumes. Apart from that, there is nothing exceptional about this movie.What I liked: (1) The cinematography was phenomenal. The movie is packed with grandiose scenes of palaces. The battle scenes were also fantastic.(2)The costumes worn by the royal family were beautiful.(3) The story was engaging. Character development was great.(4) The acting of all the main characters was great. (5) The movie was a welcome change from typical Hollywood movies.What I did not like: (1) I did not understand the ending; it went over my head. I found the ending abrupt. (2) If you are too picky you may find the story a bit implausible. But most moviegoers cut movie makers some slack and grant them creating license; if you are one of those moviegoers, then the story was just fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like most Zhang Yimou films, this one was beautiful. I love the way he incorporates solid bright colors to capture the mood of the scenes. Just like Hero and House Of Flying Daggers, bright colors were everywhere. In every shot, and in every scene. The acting was amazing. Each characters mannerisms portrayed their character perfectly. Lots and lots of secrets and lies creeped in and out of the story. As it slowly unveils, you see yourself intrigued to the point where you would never be able to stop watching until the movie is over. So many secrets... So many lies... There were too many for the movie to end perfectly. The climax was so long that there was no way the ending was going to be able to put it all together without flaw... The action scenes were amazing. Packed with blood and honor. I don't see what else you would want from a war scene. All in all a beautiful, brilliantly written tale about China's Tang Dynasty. Just a bit over the top in the secrets area... Brilliant Film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite movie in the genre, it is even my favourite movie in my entire movie collection. The scenery and acting is flawless. The scenario is great and not cheap in the "American way": Yes it doesn't finish well, it doesn't submit the story to a certain "action ratio" requirement, that is exactly the point and why this is such a good movie, it makes absolutely no compromise to please expectations. Above all, every single visual detail has been worked to perfection.The usage of castle and environment in which this movie takes place by itself make this movie deserve high praise. However it is in the details that this movie steals the show.Only 7 on IMDb, what is there to say? I think people, overwhelm with the movie visual generosity somehow failed to understand the inner working of the story and brilliant acting.Most recommended! 10/10In my opinion even better than the masterpiece 'House of the Flying Daggers'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stultifying Oppression of Absolute Power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The palace is a Technicolor reverie, with its colorful curtains and carpets, a prodigious field of yellow chrysanthemums filling the massive courtyard. Reds and yellows in particular are almost tangible. Everything looks so vivid and ablaze, but these, alas, are only looks. The servants, royal guards, subjects, royalty, all take strict example from the curtains, carpets and chrysanthemums. And one little wiggle out of line, and everything comes toppling down.There is an utter oppression inherent in Zhang Yimou's Shakespearian depiction of the Tang Dynasty, cloaked in elaborate decoration, etiquette and grandiosity. It even infects the Empress. Whenever she has one of her strange attacks, she reacts with defensive posturing, panicked by her perception that she appears weak to her subjects. She can hardly even accept it when she is alone.The plot is slowly revealed. The laborious nature of the characters' world functions to offset brief, quiet, evasive dialogue exchanges. Secrets and suspicions are buried beneath the subjugations of the pervasive hierarchy. Everything seems starved and silenced. Indeed, no one speaks freely or can do anything without concrete permission.This is achieved through incredibly subtle and detailed performances from all, not least from Gong Li and Chow Yun-Fat. Of all his performances, no matter how jaw-clenched and taurine, Yun-Fat has never dissociated us so affectingly. He often doesn't move, and exudes absolute inscrutability and impenetrable ego. Likewise, Li's fear and sorrow are counter-pointed matter-of-factly by small tiffs of intimidating coldness. All of Yimou's actors play their roles, big and small, entirely with faces. Whether or not they speak---in deliberately composed solipsisms---they cannot depend on language to express themselves, only proper gestures and the slightest triggers of emoting.The film is a painstaking composition that weaves unabashed, logistically overwhelming spectacle side by side with delicate, almost fleeting subtlety. This is not Hero, and it is certainly not House of Flying Daggers. It is more like a hearkening back to Yimou's earliest work, like Ju Dou. There are gargantuan battle sequences, greased-lightning swordfights, even flying ninjas, but they do not lie at the heart of the film. What does is the stultifying oppression of absolute power, depicted as a labor of love and a unique, genre-bending, purely visual piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Controversial Film Gets A Controversial DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curse of the Golden Flower--Although a few of the other review allude to the weak plot, I am surprised no one has noticed that the plot of this film has more in common with an episode of "Dynasty" with Chow Yun Fat in the "Blark Carrington" role and Gong Li as "Alexis Colby" - and it seems that every hack-kneed soap opera plot devise is used - the upstairs/downstair romance, the wide who resents her over baring husband and has an affair with her much sexier step-son, the first wife thought to be dead who shows as the star witness of the nurder trial (oops!, that last one was from TV's "LOST"). The film is beautiful to look at but I became very "aware" of how much CGI effects were used to create the thousands of soldiers.The movie is essentially a Greek Tragedy with the outcome one expects from a Greek Tragedy. One is reminded of Ceasar, Hamlet, and Homer as the royal family self-destructs over jealousy, power, and revenge. In the end the King is left with nothing but his power -- a hollow victory Jay Chow was very poorly cast. Chow Yun Fat's mandarin is the epitome of HONG KONG style mandarin. Gong Li's talents are just wasted portratying a one dimensional character. Everything is just overly dramatic to the point of nausea. Everyone is backstabbing each other for no real apparent reason, that's basically the 'plot'. This might be all right if they weren't a bunch of wooden one dimensional asswipes.OVERALL: My overall reaction to this DVD is a mixed bag. As much as I like FUNimation offering so many episodes for so cheap a price, the whole "widescreen" issue is just too much of a pain. If the whole cropping issue pisses you off like it did me and so many others, hold off and see if FUNimation offers a full-screen set. I'm a firm believer of "if it ain't broke don't fix it", and that could be said of FUNimation's previous standard full-screen DVD releases. Final verdict? A mixed bag. Only get it if the cropping issue doesn't bother you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" Curse of the golden flower" is a marvelous combination of pure stunning, visual beauty and the ancient Greek tragedy. It has all the right ingredients of the traditional Chinese opera: quest for power, betrayal, incestuous relationships and relentless flow of blood in the end. It is impossible not to be deeply exhilarated with the magnificent cinematography. The colors are mind-boggling, you can almost feel the texture of the beautiful costumes, and the naked passion of the fairytale can not be resisted. Among the excellent cast stands out Li Gong as a spurned queen whose revenge washes everything in blood. Another great Chinese masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning, high on intrigue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually, this movie was stunning, satisfying the senses on a variety of levels. The action sequences were fantastic, keeping you on the edge of your seat. The final battle rivals the intensity of any major 'western' film while keeping in the character of story. The set was great, with beautiful landscape and magnificent palaces (the courtyard with all the chrysanthemums was amazing). Costumes were fantastic and realistic (a few anachronisms aside). The story is high on court and family intrigue. It has the ability to draw the viewer in and keep you guessing. Although you suspect, you never really know who is on what side and how the everything will play out. This element translates well into any culture and you could imagine the same level of intrigue in the courts of Europe, China, Russia, etc.Chow Yun-Fat is a strong actor who has the ability to carry a film, without minimizing the jobs done by the others. Li Gong, who plays the Empress, probably benefits the most from not being overshadowed by Mr. Yun-Fat. Ye Liu (Crown Prince Wan) is probably the other standout here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I viewed a movie this morning, The Curse of the Golden Flower, and I would like to tell you what I think of the movie in my own words. I found the movie to be interesting. It is impossible for me to explain what the plot of the movie may really mean as the Chinese ethnicity is strange to me. The movie, I am sure is rooted deep within the physical, mental, and cultural characteristics portrayed by the Chinese race.The film is set in Tang Dynasty, 10th Century, on the eve of the Chong Yang Festival, the Imperial Palace is filled with golden flowers. The Emperor (Chow Yun Fat), returns to the city unexpectedly with his son, Prince Jai (Jay Chow) to celebrate the holiday with his family. The Empress (Gong Li) and the Emperor have a strained relationship as an unhealthy liaison has been going on between the Empress and her stepson, Crown Prince Wan (Liu Ye). The young men of the family become stressed to discover the Empress has been drinking a tea made of her husbands medicine. Prince Jai states, "you will never drink father's poison again." She becomes hooked on his strange brew of herbs and drugs. The palace is filled with the glamor and grandeur of the festival. Golden flowers fill every corner of the city as an army of Chinese rebels is forming. A battle follows and blood flows through the streets of the city. The battle no more than ends and the Emperor immediately puts the city to work cleaning the streets and replacing the city to its former beauty. The movie is filled with tears, death and dying. I hate to say that the Chinese are a violent people as I do not know that for sure. However, this is a bloody movie filled with bloody men.The musical score is beautiful. "Do not cross the river as you will not make it to the other shore," the words are underscored as the entire movie is. You must read the words or you will not understand what is going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hmm...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a lot of talk, by established critics and those who roam IMDb, that this movie lacks in substance and storyline; I cannot help but disagree.Maybe it is just me. Maybe there is simply something I like within this particular story that does not resonate with other viewers. Maybe I'm just stupid.But there seems to be a real story here...not false and commercial like the average Hollywood biopic or western, but a story with nuance and a zen-like depth. Of course these sorts of things are hard to judge as an American viewer; is this the Chinese equivalent of Hollywood's Troy? Or is this a unique film in its own right, even in its own land? I confess that a lack of knowledge either in Chinese history, language, and film-making has kept me from knowing this movie on any level higher than the archetypal level.Elementally, this story is rife with intriguing subtexts and layers of meaning the film leaves and exposes in the open through its use of image and subtle court nuance. For instance: the actions of each brother, and the psychology of each brother's motive; the images of Jai's golden army plunging into the city, battling the dark armies of his father; the "oedipal" motive of Jai. (In this last case I do not mean this in a Freudian way...in some mythology, the hero is the one who destroys the sins of the father--i.e. the principles of the father which were unjust--and replaces them with new principles that adhere to a stricter morality. Freudians seem to have completely forgotten that the experience of reality is a manifold, and thus, impenetrable by dogma).It would not be important for me to go into detail about every part of this movie and every crevice of its meaning that I have enjoyed...to do such a thing is not only unimportant but pretentious as well. I have taken to watching film in a very zen-like matter, passively immersing myself within a film's subject and experience; I cannot pretend that Curse of the Golden Flower is as good as Kurosawa, or the Seventh Seal; it does not plunge that deep, though it does allow further than some have seen. The subject is a rich one that allows for many interpretations; I believe this is a movie worth seeing even if I have scarcely shown anything to prove it...for that, I apologize...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story gets swallowed by the opulence of the visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Court intrigue in the Forbidden City. Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat turn in some of their best work in ages as a couple at war with each other in this good semi-epic. The plot has the Emperor and his wife at war with each other. The Emperor would prefer his wife to quietly expire, while his wife would rather not. Add to the mix clandestine love affairs involving the sons and you have a volatile mix thats sure to lead everyone to a bad end.Fantastically shot this movie was a shoe in to get technical Oscar noms for its look. This is a movie thats a feast for the eye. Its attention to detail in the day today running of the palace is mind blowing. The running of any royal court never looked so good, nor so machine like. Its amazing.The place where the movie gets into trouble, and certainly the place where most, if not all of the negative reviews have come from is the fact that this is a small scale story inflated to look like a grand epic. Don't get me wrong I love the look of the film and I love that the movie allows Chow and Gong to really act, but this is a smallish scale story set in the royal court of China. This is not Hero or House of Flying Daggers, its probably closer to Raise the Red Lantern, Ju Dou or even Traveling Alone for Thousands of Miles. The story gets swallowed somewhat by the opulence of the visuals. Honestly you get distracted from the story by the "oh wow! Cool!" visuals. This isn't to say that the movie is bad, its not. Its actually quite good, the problem is that its kind of hard to concentrate on the story when director Yimou Zhang keeps showing you sparkly things as the cast is going through their paces. The movie is made in such away that you have to see it twice, once to get past the eye candy and once to really watch the story.Absolutely worth seeing.</fullReview>

The battle among the chrysanthemums was better than anything I have ever seen.The costuming was absolutely sumptuous. No expense was spared to present extreme extravagance in costumes. The visual delight presented was captivating.The story itself was one that had everything you could imagine - poisoning, sleeping with step-mom and sleeping with sister, political intrigue against the throne, martial arts and army techniques that dazzled. The martial arts were given sparingly, as it was the story of the Royal Family that was the centerpiece.Li Gong (Zhou Yu's Train , 2046) was at her very best as the Empress. She demonstrated a range of talent that ranks her among the top tier of actresses.Yun-Fat Chow (Pirates 3, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) was masterful as the Emperor.Jay Chou and Ye Liu also gave outstanding performances as the Princes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>while i adored "hero" and "house of the flying daggers", i was quite disappointed by "curse". it's not that i missed the great fight scenes; i was prepared for a more melodramatic movie with less action. but this time zhang yimou didn't manage to involve the spectator.how this failure? regarded in itself every element of the movie is great: the imagines, the music, the fight scenes, every detail is perfectly arranged and even the story reminds at times of Shakespeare. it's sure, by the way, that this time, it cannot be complained about a storyline that glorifies power (i.e. implicitly the power of the communist party). yes, resistance seems useless, but power as presented here is just the origin of mistrust, murder, conspiracy, hate.so what's the problem? the movies problem is that everything is too perfect. two hours of beautiful and overwhelming images, of bright and perfectly arranged colors, of pathos and tears, of deep chorals and everything is just too much. you really get tired of people confessing and understanding in close-ups with the same music throughout the hole movie. at times this reminds more of a soap-opera. of course, this microcosm inside the palace -thats nowhere connected with the real world -, the tight doorways the characters wouldn't stop going along, this bizarre world turning around power and revenge - that's the subject of the movie. i get it. but after an hour or so you already got it, and it goes on. worst thing is you even get tired of the beauty of the images.all in all i must say that it's not an bad movie but a missed chance.ps: fight scenes are cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful but baffling tale of an Imperial internecine struggle in Ancient China</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing The Curse of the Golden Flower, I was aware that it was receiving mixed reviews, mostly suggesting impending disappointment for fans of Zhang Yimou's previous martial arts classics, Hero and House of Flying Daggers. However, this is not really part 3, making only a token nod to the arts martial, albeit in some well-conceived set-pieces. This film is probably more in keeping, in mood and tone, with some of his earlier work, and to understand where the director is coming from in this project a film-goer might do well to acquaint themselves with the full depth of Yimou's back-catalogue. That said, I was disappointed not by the differences between this film and it's two predecessors, but by the bafflement with which I was left at the end of the film. Some stories are all the better for some lingering mystery, but in this case I felt the story was aching to offer up a complete explanation of the intentions, reasons and history, in intimate detail, of the main protagonists. Sadly, the story was explained in some areas, but not in others. Guesswork might fill in some of the gaps, but for me that won't do in this case. The other main flaw this film exhibited was a lack of sympathetic character development (owing partly to the mystery surrounding the various members of the Imperial family), which resulted in a general inability to care a great deal what happened to any of them. To end on a high note, the acting from the leads (Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat) was excellent, and the film was a beautiful confection to behold throughout. I enjoyed Curse of the Golden Flower, but the experience could have been as pleasant as that of Hero and House of Flying Daggers for different reasons.</fullReview>

They left us in the wrong lurch. All of the sons were dead and it was just the empress and emperor sat at the table. Come on! The fact that all the sons were killed was frankly quite depressing. The sons were all killed, so was the doctor, his wife and her daughter, and by the end you felt a little depressed. But, as I said before, the costume, battle scenes and overall visuals were amazing. Why, then, you may ask do you only have a 5. Because of the plot, I found it too simple, and the end found me left wanting more! I think because of this it only deserves a 5!</fullReview>

But having issued that warning about HOW I saw the film, I'll go on and tell you my impressions.First, the film is dazzlingly beautiful: gorgeous sets, costumes, attractive and compelling actors--and so, recreationally, it's a treat for the eyes. I'm not as impressed with the music of the film, as I was with its visual appeal.Second, the acting is superb, and the film absorbed me and intrigued me.However, unlike many other works by this director, I felt that this film was somewhat insubstantial, in that, when it was all over, one felt very much like saying, "Yes, and so what?" There wasn't much point to the story, which is an unpleasant and cruel tale of court intrigue much like any other--a sort of Tang Dynasty "Lion in Winter" without any of the fun or tongue-in-cheek quips.It's worth a viewing--maybe even two or three--but neither the characters nor the story have much staying power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A higher class of visual and martial arts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite coming from the same director don't expect this to be anything like 'Hero' or 'House of the flying Daggers' there is less fighting and more story for a start. Set on the eve of the Chrysanthemum festival in China's Tang Dynasty it tells the story of an emperor who returns from conflict to re-unite his family, his eldest son by a previous marriage and his two youngest by the princess of a neighbouring province he has taken as his wife, and rule over his created Kingdom. Simply all you need know from the rest of the story is that it is pure Shakespearian and Greek tragedy all betrayals and double crosses and dark secrets that could rip the family apart and threaten the kingdom and the emperors rule. The emperor is played with seething malice and subdued intelligence by Chow Yu-Fat and his beautiful but naive princess is played by Gong Li who spends the whole film looking stunning, together they work off each other like a soap opera couple all smiles in public and frantic bickering behind closed doors. Their sons are a mixture from the bizarre flirtings and infidelities of the eldest to the warrior instinct of his soldier brother and finally the wet but aspiring nature of the youngest and they all constantly via for their parents affections in various ways. Of course there is some fighting and it is as usual very impressive and stylistic but more than that it is the buildings and rooms and costumes and colours that make this a feast for the eyes. It's the jewelry and embroidery and armour and general attention to every minute detail that has you not quite sure where to look on the screen, although its mostly longingly into Gong Li's deep eyes as the camera loves her and so it should. As the twists and turns bring the characters to their knees and armies into combat the melodrama becomes more and more tense until the final outcome signals the end of the film. If you want a story that is complex and exciting coupled with visuals that you wont see anywhere else then watch this movie, but if its crazy kung-fu you're after then stick with your 'Kung-fu hustles' and 'Warrior king's as this one is a clever eastern drama of multi-layers and epic proportions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Curse of the Golden Flower expecting it to be something like the previous films made by Yimou Zhang, notably House of Flying Daggers and Hero. Whereas both of these films did use on occasion large numbers of extras, they both struck me as more personal films. Curse of the Golden Flower is a credible attempt to maintain that theme of personal contact while surrounding the principle actors with the elaborate hierarchies and numbers of people found in an Imperial Court. Of course, were can one start accept with the color-scheme? The richness of the palette which is used draws the eye into a splintered rainbow at every turn. Not being an expert on Tang dynasty decorative arts I leave it up to others to decide on their accuracy, but their sumptuousness on set really underpins two of the main themes of the film: madness and luxury. It was almost a relief to get to some of the night scenes, were the eye and mind was less strained! The magnificence of the set and the costumes was what most impressed me about this film. I felt the plot, while hanging together, was a little clunky at times and the acting no more than it needed to be - no star turns here. No bloopers either. The use of armies of extras provided the suitably epic court that an Emperor deserves. A worthy film for a Saturday night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is, first and foremost, visually rich.It is full of bright, and vibrant colours, akin to Hero. Unlike Hero this movie does not feature martial arts.This is not an action movie. If you're expecting a great action movie along the lines of Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon or Hero, this is not the movie for you. Action in this movie does not move the plot along. The conflict for the most part is internal, only exploding to external conflict at the height of tension.What this movie is, is a great piece of acting, and story-telling. This is a tragedy to the nth degree along the lines of MacBeth or Hamlet. The depths of plotting, and emotion distress of its characters or key to keeping the story going.If you're in the mood for drama, this if for you. Just be sure you turn on the subtitles as dubbed movies only destroy the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK movie, not what I expected but I still like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So people have been talking a lot about this movie (mostly hateful comments though.) So here are the bad things that I agree: 1. The terrible subtitles are really getting on my nerves. 9 out of 10 Chinese movies have cheesy subtitles that do not go along with the script (well, at least the translated script) How much have they spent for this movie? Says, a million bucks? And they can't make the damn subtitles any better? You gotta be kidding me. The Empress says "Come back!" but the subtitles read "Go now!" 2. Colors, there are thousands of color, maybe even more than my LCD screen can display. This time the director might have got too carried away with his "impressive cinematography". It gets annoying if you keep doing that Mr. Zhang!Other than the 2 annoying things above, I have to admit that Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li did a wonderful job portraying the rotten and corrupted royal family. I'm impressed the most by Fat, he really turned into a mean Emperor.The storyline is a bit old since I've seen this kind of "royal tragedy" so many times. It's just kinda old.Overall, I give the movie a high 8/10. Now you Chinese movie haters can start sending me hate mails, haha.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really great, the story is marvelous, the costumes are fantastic, the actors are wonderful, and even the setting of the palace is really detailed. The story is breath taking, the king made the first prince as his favorite, the queen loved the first prince, and in fact the first prince loved the queen too, the 2nd prince was a filial son and his mother favorite, the 3rd prince knew everything and acted like he knew nothing at the end he got the worst suffer even though he was still a teen still his mother didn't care about him. The king was a mean person but he really loved his son with his 1st wive (1st prince). Gong Li's act is great she's really a great actress, she's better act in Chinese movies than Hollywood's movies. Nevertheless the soundtrack (ending theme song) performed by Jay is really good. Zhang Yi Mou really did a great job this time same with Chow Yun Fat.This movie is worth it to be watched and I hope I can see another movie as good as this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a first stone or one of the first stones on the road that is leading China to inundating the average, under the average and slightly over the average public of the globalized world with brilliant decorative films that contain little but shine a lot. The setting, the palace, the costumes, all the elements that build the image we see on the screen are marvellous and admirable, even if the falling weapons sound like table forks and if it all looks like an illusionary illusion of beaming gold and silver. The intrigue, the plot, the action is nothing at all except some wide and hefty internal fight in the imperial family that is reduced to a pack of rats in a big pot. They eat one another alive and their mouths are dripping with blood, human blood mind you, more than the mouth of Anne Rice's vampires. So we jump from father killing to mother killing to brother killing to neighbour killing to whatever you may think of killing, and of course the boss will save his skin with a little help from some ninja turtle warriors and from some soft Kung Fu fighters. It is kind of sad to see so much money wasted on such a super production that has no meaning, not even that of a metaphor of the modern world. Luckily our world has changed slightly and you don't need to kill your mother, your father, your brothers and sisters to become president of our modern states, even if at times the competition is tainted with some doping activity trying to boost your votes.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yimou Zhang once again produces a work that retains his position as one of the master builders of contemporary cinema. His ability to capture an intricate story historically based in a setting of splendor is up there with the great filmmakers. CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is no exception.The time of the story is the Tang Dynasty, one of the more corrupt and cruel periods in Chinese history. Emperor Ping (Chow Yun Fat) has married a princess from the neighboring province, becoming Empress Phoenix (Gong Li) and in addition to becoming stepmother to the Emperor's firs-born son (Ye Liu), she bears him two additional sons (Jay Chou and Junjie Qin). Attending the palace is a doctor (Dahong Nim) and his wife (Jin Chen) who figure significantly in the family's destiny. Each of these dysfunctional family members has secrets that could destroy an empire. The Empress is clearly the titular head of the kingdom and her wily manipulations and incestuous relationships are controlled only by her doses of a medicine that is supposed to make her insane. The boils on the body of the ruling family fester until great wars break out and the royal family is revealed to be the strangely bizarre group they are.The story works (though admittedly it is often difficult to follow) because of a brilliant cast and a pacing from the director that almost matches the glory of the visual production that seems to keep growing on the screen, like a huge garden bearing more color and moods as the story progresses. Yimou Zhang is a visual artist and choreographer but he is also a man with the gift of finding the cores of his characters beneath all the glorious trappings of this films. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually overwhelming, tremendously colorful, almost dreamlike Chinese epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When taking into consideration epic productions from various countries, there have hardly been any about some Far East tales. Except for some few movies, including a historical film titled THE LAST EMPEROR by Bernardo Bertolucci, there have not been many attempts to create something involving and serious. And this film, THE CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER (in my country translated as EMPRESS), led many viewers to high expectations since it is a purely Chinese film with Chinese cast about the Chinese history. When watching the film for the first time, you will be lost in many aspects of the action, plots, sometimes confused by conspiracies, but one thing is certain: you will never forget its magnificence of visual effects, lavish costumes, dreamlike colors and really luxurious sets. That impression after first viewing is one great fact about this film, that is the impression you will always have no matter if you watch it for the second or the fifth time.Filmed at the Forbidden City in Beijing, the film makes a perfect use of visuals to the extend you hardly find in many American epics. Of course the style is different as the culture is different but you are equally struck by this magnificence as you were when watching CLEOPATRA or THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. That stands out above all the rest: the cast, the action, even the content. Although the story is interesting as set 1000 years ago during the reign of the Tang dynasty, this all the time remains shadowed by the power of costumes and lavish sets. Like for instance the celebration which changed everything when the hour of the rat appeared, there are moments when you are just WOW... overwhelmed - costumes, luxurious sets, battles though deadly unrealistic but symbolic...The performances are exotic. Certainly, you cannot treat them the same way you do in American or European movies. They are different but very good in a way. Li Gong is marvelous as Empress Phoenix, kinda "Chinese Cleopatra". She has this charm of Chinese women, has this sort of magic of the Far East in her gestures and entire acting. Among female characters, I also loved Man Li's part as young, beautiful, powerfully sensual Chan, a daughter of the imperial surgeon with whom an imperial son falls in love. Male characters are also memorable but in a different way (here as in hardly any other movie I have seen). Yut-Fat Chow unforgettably presents emperor Ping's unrestrained brutality and cruelty he imposes on the members of his family. Ye Liu is fine as Wan, the right successor to the throne, one of three imperial sons. The performances are first rate for such an exotic film.Not to say much about the story, closely knit to Shakespeare's dramas supplied with additional eastern charm, there is one more aspect important to mention. THE CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is an epic movie that may boast an exceptional balance between moments of great elegance and colors and moments of brutality. What I mean by that is there are scenes for everyone in this film. Just it's enough to say it's an exotic, unique epic the action of which takes place in the imperial court of China - yes, very political...but everyone may find something for himself/herself. Young people will love colors, women will most probably like the insight into empress's life, men will like the battles, elderly people will like the politics. When I saw the film, it occurred to me that there isn't much of anything skipping the fact that there are exaggerations and lack of realism in many moments. Im sum, after viewing the movie in cinema, there were two middle-aged people next to me who said: "The whole movie would be just less than an average epic if watched on a small screen." This sentence resembles the entire idea of the film's effect. THE CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is a must-see in theaters, it is so intensely focused on visuals that a small screen will surely lower its artistic experience and will not leave much in a viewer. Chinese CLEOPATRA combined with MACBETH and HAMLET! High camp monumental picture, history, treason, murder, desire for power, conspiracies and ever present imperial family affairs. Really worth seeing as a 10/10 spectacle and as a 7/10 movie in general.</fullReview>

You can find millions of criticism for his previous movie on Chinese forums.However, I have to admit this time he is doing a great job. The story is excellent and the acting is almost perfect. The only "problem" is that it is not a traditional Chinese kong fu movie so maybe it doesn't attract west people much.Anyway, I highly recommend this movie to every Chinese and anyone willing to accept a Chinese movie with non kong fu style.I hope one day China can produce a great movie like the "lord of the ring".I would like to give it 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ancient nonsense break to new mutiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie, the unenlightened Westerner (that was me until a few minutes ago) will see this as laughably overwrought melodrama, suspended in a simplistic plot that isn't properly explained, with action and sets far beyond the pale of credibility, and a storytelling structure that simply does not make sense.Of course, upon reflection (and a bit of research), it becomes clear that all these elements are entirely deliberate. Zhang Yimou is no fool. The Curse of the Golden Flower compares very well indeed with the plot of some ancient Greek tragedy, and is really more stylized theater than motion picture.All right, so what is this simple but extravagantly produced story actually telling us? I'm not sure. But it seems the director was going for a very universal description of the action, adding elements and details from all sorts of historical periods, ensuring that the audience understands that what is being depicted is something concerning general truths. Truths about what? Well, surely about civilization. The thoroughly ritualized Tang Dynasty must represent, in general terms, human civilization. This can lead to several interpretations of the director's intentions, of which I will suggest three:1. Many will (as I did at first) interpret it in terms of the political situation in China, meaning that the evil Emperor represents the ruling Communist Party, in turn meaning that the movie is a statement *against* Chinese communism. I don't believe in this interpretation, because I think the movie is talking about the entire human condition and not just China. And I think the Communist Party of China agrees with me on this, because otherwise it would not have supported the production of this movie. This brings us to:2. If the Tang Dynasty of the movie is a symbol of all civilization, then the movie is saying that civilization may be oppressive and rigid and destroy a number of rebelling individuals, but it provides a necessary bulwark against chaos and anarchy; it is ultimately the lesser of two evils. Thus, the Emperor is actually *right* in what he does, and so, by extension, is communist-ruled China and any other tightly controlled civilization. By this reading the movie is even saying that tight control is better than loose control, amounting to the statement that communist China is better than Western democracy. This is the interpretation that I believe the Chinese establishment subscribes to, and which I also accept. But, there is one small detail that may have escaped their attention:3. The Empress who is poisoned by the Emperor. A pretty important detail. Traditionally, the major male and female characters of most art movies represent the overall rational and emotional state of things. Here, an over-zealous exponent of reason is slowly killing the symbol of emotion. That is, cold and clinical "good sense" is overpowering love, killing it, turning all civilization cold and clinical. Inhuman. Ultimately dead. Thus, the dying Empress symbolizes the apathy and emotional lethargy of modern society, which is caused by the rigidity and inhumanity of the established social system. Not *just* in China (although, *especially* in China), but across the world.The poisoned Empress is the truly artistic element of this story, appropriately played by the best actor of the lot, Gong Li. She penetrates and attacks the movie's own symbolism, taking it beyond what might have been sanctioned by the Chinese (or any) establishment. Which is where the movie becomes a brilliant achievement.However, I realized all these things only after having watched the movie. While I was watching it, I thought it was flashy but dull, colorfully kaleidoscopic but unengaging, well-choreographed but inconsistent, visually spectacular but narratively preposterous. The scene where the incestuous relationship between the crown prince and the doctor's daughter was revealed could command no empathy in me, because the viewer had long since been informed of the situation. And the super-synchronized fight scenes were completely unrealistic, and didn't fit the apparently "realistic period drama" of the rest of the story. Had these fight scenes appeared in some crazy action fantasy that didn't take itself seriously, I would probably have cheered, but in a serious movie like this they had me groaning. And the ending, with the surviving prince being asked to serve his mother poison for the rest of her days, was just so absurd that, when the prince killed himself and splashed his blood into the cup, I honestly thought that they might go the whole nine yards and have her drink from the cup of both poison and her son's blood! At that point I was just, like, whatever! I had given up on any kind of logic, and was ready to rate the movie a 3 or 4 out of 10. But thanks to the user comment of Wallpaper1, I thought better of it and activated a brain cell or two. And I'm glad I did; it was well worth the effort.But I'm still unsure what rating to award the movie. Based on my initial boredom and confusion, I shouldn't give it more than 5 or 6. On the other hand, many classic movies only start making sense after you think about them, and maybe watch them a few times more, and it's a pretty safe bet that this is one of those movies. When I watch it again, fully cognizant of the symbolism and message, I expect I'll rate it an 8 or 9. But I will hold off that rating until then, and give it an intermediate rating for now. The compromise must be a 7, but my ultimate rating will probably be higher.</fullReview>

You can root for anyone, and by the end, you still probably won't be satisfied.On the one hand, this film is pretty ridiculous - a coup staged by an empress against her husband, incest, infidelity, poisoning...it's almost like Shakespeare, only far more entertaining and accessible.Leading to the entertainment value are the stunning visuals. This is potentially the most gorgeous movie I have ever seen (and I've seen Zhang Yimou's other films). Bright colors, amazing costumes, great staging of formations of large numbers of people in beautiful clothing...it's no wonder the film was nominated for an Oscar in costuming. Oh, and there's fireworks! (Yes, the Chinese had fireworks 1000 years ago...whether they looked like that, I don't know...) The acting is amazing too, especially given the over-the-top qualities of the plot. I really believed and sympathized with these characters.Moreover, the film kept me engaged the whole time. For not one minute did I get bored or wonder how long it would be until the end. And when it did finally reach the end, I wanted more.Go see this film. It's a real treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple little gem wrapped up in a very large box.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 is a very high rating for just about any film, with ten being close to establishing a new religion (just kidding), and I do not take this rating lightly. This film strives for nine stars and comes close. Before I go any further concerning what made this film so pleasant, a presentation of complaints, both minor and major, must be addressed. 1. The setting goes beyond colorful. The setting goes beyond indulgence. The setting goes beyond extravagant. In fact, the setting exuberantly bypasses optic opulence and lands somewhere between Willy Wonka on Dada crack and a supernova hue-splotion. At first, the viewer will probably be disoriented by this barrage of color. In time it becomes more apparent as to why Zhang chose such a stunning visual vehicle. I will address that later. 2. The music seemed oddly placed in some scenes. It wasn't bad or even necessarily ill-advised, it just seemed to fall a little flat. 3. The acting is initially wooden and very constrained, working well against such an opulent setting. However, the viewer doesn't see just how well this device works until later in the film, so there can be a little discomfort as he or she tries adjusting to the films early presentation. 4. Last on the list of complaints-the editing. I was distracted from the flow of the plot on more than one occasion by poor editing. Zhang's project is ambitious, and a few poorly edited moments really doesn't hurt the film. The emotional depth the characters eventually fall into is so subtle and unfolding that you don't even really realize there has been such stark character paradigm shifts until well after the fact. Each actors role subtly caresses the others, forming surprising moments of inter-related intimacy. These moments carry weight and are devastatingly effective contrasts against the blithe color-copia setting. Furthermore, as opposed to being overtly melodramatic, they seem appropriate and hidden. The truth isn't in the direct statement made by each character, but rather each statement and action tells a little piece of a larger conversation. The setting itself actually becomes an extension of will. It provides the perfect synthesis and blend to the story, silently contrasting actor performance in a way that is entirely unexpected. Zhang presents something of absolute wonder here. The viewer gradually becomes aware that he/she is watching a carefully constructed, multi-layered tale told in the oldest traditions of story telling. Is this film a classic Grecian urn or some ancient Chinese tapestry? Its as if Zhang somehow blended elements of storytelling worlds apart into a stark and beautiful visual sculpture. Despite what you might have heard, this film has an enormous amount of violence. Some would argue the action isn't entirely believable, but I'm not entirely certain it's supposed to be. The incredible battle scene near the end of the film was a visual treat and well coordinated. I'm probably the only person in the entire world who believes the following statement. The beauty and real surprise of this film isn't in its extravagances, but in its absolute and utmost faithful restraint. Some might find it slightly contrived, but Zhang paints with feathery, ethereal strokes, depicting something of austere simplicity. A very telling and pleasant picture. This film is at heart, a simple little gem wrapped up in a very large and colorful box. ****DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT SURPRISES****On a slightly pedantic note, I'd like to add some personal musings. The original title of the film, translated directly, is "The City of Golden Armor" or something close. During the ostensible time period mentioned at the opening of the film, 928 AD, the Tang were/had just lost control during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (kind of rough and tumble, might want to check my facts). Typically, only the emperor himself was allowed to where gold during this time. The Golden Flower refers to chrysanthemums, revered in China because of their austere strength and beauty. Plus, they bloom well after almost all other flowers, during the cold autumn months. Furthermore, the golden flower referenced a meditation process that cleanses the mind through rigorous practice over a specified period of time. You see the emperor himself in a posture very similar to this practice throughout the movie with many references to the time table of "his" empress. The poison, which is used with stunning symbolism at the end of the film, is directly linked to the medicine. Every element of the film (plot, setting, characters...etc.) seemed very dependent on each other. I believe this film tries to work on a holistic level. The reason this film seemed like something so much more than a silly, extravagant soap opera with eastern hang ups is that it appears Zhang is truly presenting a tale whose characters all represent a single sentence about the state of things. While I can only surmise what all this might mean when put together, it does add some material on which other viewers could consider. PeaceWallpaper1</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely have I seen a movie so bursting with luminosity and color as Yimou Zhang's "Curse of the Golden Flower," an eye-popping tale of palace intrigue set in late 10th Century China. Li Gong plays the beautiful Empress Phoenix, who is slowly being poisoned by her husband, the Emperor Ping (Yun-Fat Chow), as punishment for the affair she is having with her stepson and heir-to-the-throne, the Crown Prince Xiang. When she discovers what is being done to her, she enlists the aid of one of her own sons (Ye Liu) to help her carry off a carefully orchestrated coup against his father."Golden Flower" has just about everything a historic drama done in the grand operatic style needs to be successful: passion, forbidden love, incest, jealousy, betrayal, revenge, family secrets, and, of course, oodles and oodles of blood-soaked battle sequences that pay homage to the richest traditions of the martial arts (picture to yourself an oriental "Lord of the Rings" to get some idea of the scale and scope of these fight scenes). The melodrama does get a bit out-of-hand from time to time, hitting a peak of silliness long about the last half hour or so of the movie. But the film itself is so visually ravishing and gorgeous to look at that we go along with it even when it's not all that easy to take the story it's telling very seriously.Prime credit for the movie's success goes to cinematographer Xiaoding Zhao, who has wrought various miracles with his lighting and camera, making the rich and shimmering colors literally pop from the screen in unmatched brilliancy and vibrancy. Equally stunning are the production and costume design by Tingxiao Huo and Chung Man Yee, respectively. It is a tribute to the quality of the actors that they are able to stand out so vividly even amidst such peerlessly sumptuous settings.Small wonder why this is the most expensive and commercially successful Chinese film ever made.</fullReview>

Each new scene reveals a bit more of the story and dark underlying secrets.There are many hidden relationships and secrets which threaten to overturn plots and lives. Each new scene changes the circumstances for each character.This film is very colourful, literally. The palace and all the main royals are decorated in golden clothes and jewels. So it is quite stunning to the eye.This movie is quite sad and depressing throughout the movie but the mood interests the viewer more, rather than making them wanting to just leave and try to get rid of the unhappy mood. It finishes with a dramatic ending.A downside of this movie was the editing was poor in a few places, such as music would suddenly cut off when scenes changed.I thought the actors did a wonderful job of portraying their role. The way they spoke, facial expressions, stance, etc. all were suitable for their character's position and made the movie feel more real.Overall, a riveting if not depressing movie.

		<fullReview>Directed and written by: Zhang Yimou / Based on a story by: Cao Yu / U.S. Release: December 2006 / Viewed: January 14, 2007"Curse of the Golden Flower" has to rank as one of the most visually stunning and lavish films ever made. A costume epic set in 10th Century China during the Tang Dynasty, it tells a story of royal family secrets revealed, for better or worse. This film now stands as the most expensive film ever made in China. The attention to detail, production design, cinematography, costumes and visual effects are outstanding. Visually, this film is a knockout, unfortunately, there is a problem with the storytelling. There is a lack of development of the main and central supporting characters of the film. The overall acting is good, but the characters are limited by the film's screenplay. We immediately delve into the story of the royal family, knowing little or nothing about the main and central supporting characters. There is secret plotting going on and the empress appears to be the victim of the emperor's scheme. Secrets are eventually revealed in the film's disappointing ending.If only there was more attention to story details (a better script), this film would rank as a cinematic masterpiece. As a film enthusiast, it'a little sad to see so much money and talent lavished on a film, being a wasted on an unsatisfying and unemotional story. Former cinematographer, Zhang Yimou is clearly a visually talented film director. He is not yet ready to be the sole screenwriter for one of his own films. By writing the screenplay to this film, he has spoiled this otherwise magnificent film of his. I hope he will team up with the two screenwriters for "Hero" and "House of Flying Daggers" again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning - the story is cr*p. But the visuals are truly the next step in film production. The film is just a distill of the other movies made by Zhang Yimou and so much more when it comes to visual art. Because this is what makes the movie memorable the art. It's true that visuals alone do not make a movie great. Let's face it: Hollywood and their huge following across the Globe hails visual as paramount. There is no story besides some weak intrigue in any of the last ten years of Academy Awards from the Gladiator to No Country for Old Men. You might have gore, cheap audio tricks to intensify the thrills and an overuse of hard light perceived as "dramatic" by the distributors. This movie does challenge the perception. Colors, choreography and camera all work together to bring the best eye candy production I've seen so far.In my book visuals aren't enough for a 10, but given the state of the "big production" or "blockbuster" style even before Star Wars... at about Ben Hur age this actually brings out something.There is also a plus for the interesting way of blending extras and CGI. Zhang Yimou cleverly breaks the Hollywood clichés and at the times where one might be expecting a CG army he will use real life extras and vice-versa. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding visuals; confusing &amp; ultimately boring picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you notice about this picture, and the thing that stays with you long after final credits, is the visuals. Intense colors, beautifully framed scenes, stunning opulence -- all leads to breath-taking beauty.Now we know where the budget was allocated. The plot was so subtle as to be non-existent in parts. I ended up watching it dubbed *and* with subtitles in order to try to figure out what was going on. And discovered that the dubbed translation differed from the subtitles in several critical places, leaving me more confused.Gong Li is riveting as the empress, giving layer upon layer of dimension to an essentially cardboard cutout role. Jin Chen is fabulous in her minor but critical role. Chow Yun-Fat is wasted as the controlling emperor. The other actors' performances were so thin that I had difficulty telling them apart, even though they looked very different from each other.As others have noted, I was strongly reminded of The Lion In Winter while watching this, which made watching this that much worse. Yes, it included a twisted, dysfunctional family whose fate is determined by the titanic contest of wills between husband and wife, but these paled in comparison to the intensity of the story and acting of Lion In Winter. Ultimately I was bored by the picture. It's not a martial arts film. It's a film with some martial arts sequences -- just like any drama that has a few scenes of violence. Regrettably, this drama lacked coherence and any kind of compelling narrative. Perhaps it has layers of meaning evident to native Chinese. I certainly couldn't get into it, and ended up fast- forwarding thru The Big Battle and some of the Long Emotional Shots just so I could get to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soap opera as visual spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yimou Zhang's latest martial arts epic may be a little slow-moving for some tastes and, for those with the patience to stick with it, the reward in terms of storyline is not really adequate: court intrigue descends into a power struggle amongst the members of the dysfunctional Tang dynasty that comes across as more soap-opera melodrama than the epic tale for which Zhang seems to have been striving. The lengthy battle scenes go some way towards making amends, and the set and production design are absolutely stupendous (especially if viewed in HD), but the overall feeling once the credits roll is one of disappointment.There's no-one to root for here: the queen, slowly and deliberately being poisoned by her husband, is seducing her stepson who is weak-willed and timid and, we (and he) discover, is sleeping with his half-sister. His older brother it transpires, is in league with his mother, who is planning a rebellion, while the youngest brother, while initially coming across as something of a simpleton, is hatching plans of his own. Meanwhile, the father is a cold and distant figure of simmering hatred who pretty much looks as if he deserves everything it looks as if he's going to get.Viewers unfamiliar with eastern films may struggle to come to terms with a style of film-making that lingers far longer on characters to record their emotions than western films, while the ninja assassins begin to look like comedy support at times: it's as if they spend all their time clinging spider-like to the ceiling, waiting for trouble to start so that they can glide smoothly down on their ropes.As you might gather from the above, I'm not a huge fan of the genre, but I'm always able to appreciate a good film, whatever it's about. This film is well-made, colourful, and full of violence ? but it isn't very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most vivid tale I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although fights and battles are only good (comparing e.g. to Hero or House of Flying Daggers), the palace, amazing garments and jewelry captivated me (no comparison to anything).Under this colourful, shiny cover lays an interesting plot. The whole story is not complicated very much, but life of main characters became more and more mixed. The nearest a day to drive away evil, the worst things happen. I can't tell who is guilty.Beside the events are depressing, the way they sound like made me listen carefully, the way they look like did not allow me to blink. I was afraid I might miss a beautiful scene or subtle detail. It is absolutely worth to see. At least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good to look at</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is good to look at, that is something everyone would agree (except may be a colour blind person). The sets are lavish and costumes are intricate. Women show their bosoms ;-) through out the film, In short a visual Master piece. But the cinematography isn't very impressive, could have been better. Now the story, well let us just say it is a story of a pi**** off wife (the empress) trying to get revenge from her husband (the emperor). The actors are good thou, but could have been better. I wouldn't say, I totally wasted my time, but visual part starts to get boring after sometime and you end up wanting something more, because the story is quite predictable and it just stops challenging you or riveting you. Also the fight sequences are limited and do not reach even to the mark of the film itself. (and I was not expecting a Kung-Fu flick, so spare me the lecture) In the end I would advise watch if you have nothing else to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ha ha Ahahaha Aha aha ahaNow that my eyes have recovered, the above pretty much sums up my feeling towards "Curse of the Golden Flower". I must admit to having found it really rather enjoyable; true, it was doubtless full of anachronisms (I'll admit my knowledge of 10th Century China is patchy at best) and the performances were often entirely over the top, but it was so much fun, and utterly gorgeous, to watch that I was prepared to forgive these flaws. I guess it helped that I was already aware of the number of criticisms levelled at the film (obvious imagery, peculiar chronology, vaguely shallow but melodramatic characters) but if you treat it as a glorious, mass games-like fresco, it pretty much works, although it does get especially silly in the last 20 minutes.So anyway, I give it a seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A heartless exercise in calligraphy, even if an outstanding one from a figurative point of view (only for this my vote is 6). The plot is laughable (what they had said if this were an opera!), the script only a little less, and the acting, well: there is no acting to speak of, excepting the actor who plays the Emperor. Gong Li faded charms cannot hide her amateurish, barnstorming acting of the Empress, and the sons are some of the worst actors I've recently seen. Moreover, the is an overdone and marked stylistic discrepancy between the ceremonial and court's scenes, in which one can recognize the hand of the master of Red Lanterns and the battle scenes, with its abuse of computerized graphics.</fullReview>

Everything was perfect. The twists, the scenes, music, actors, actress, director .... are all perfect.Ying Xiong (Hero) is in the same line with this one. This one is somewhat different from many of Zhang Yimou's famous movies : the Road Home, To Live, Qiu Ju Goes to Court. But all in all, Zhang Yimou is a great director and this one is a great movie.Special thanks to Zhang Yimou, Chou Yun-Fat and Gong Li.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i am a huge fan of Asian cinema in general not Chinese ,and i love yimous recent movies.....however this time around im not so impressed.first the pros :the film is so vivid in colour its almost burns out the screen.the cinematography is beautiful sometimes you don't know whether too look at this movie or try and eat the screen. there is some genuine moments of great tension ,shock and great acting.and some cool action sequences. the music is moving and the sounds engaging. there is not a lot of action this time around but thats a wise choice because this is more of a period drama (although not very accurate).the cons however are :its so slow for the first hour ,that all the colours and amazing set pieces in the world cant make up for it ,slow to the point of boring!because of this by the time the film reached a decent pace i didn't really care about the characters ,especially gong li ,who i thought was the wrong choice for the role. the cgi was appaulling considering how much was spent on the costumes and sets ,and it stands out a mile ,when the siege happens towards the end. the action scenes feel a little out of place i found myself wandering at the end as i had lost interest with the characters ,especially the king ,who like the other characters are two dimensional and tiresome to engage.the plot is also transparent as hell ,the fact that its dragged out only slows down the film further.overall has some nice touches but deffinatley not a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad...... Shoud've been better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Im usually a BIG fan of this genre of movies but this one has left me a little disappointed. Do'nt get me wrong, Im not debunking this film - it has some spectacular camera work &amp; amazingly colourful film sets, but the story &amp; the 'telling of' seemed a little weak in comparison to the visual side of things. Li Gong was better in this than in Memoirs of a Geisha &amp; Chow Yun Fat was his usual self, confident &amp; a true star in his own right, the emotional tension between both these two in the film is just right - but even with this in mind the performances by the whole cast seemed a little 'hit &amp; miss' at times. I would like to have seen what was left on the cutting room floor because I believe there was much that should have been left into the final cut but was removed to keep this movie at a reasonable length. Its possible that the plot holes were caused by this &amp; we may have had a somewhat longer film as a result of them being left in. Which is OK in my books because with this much eye candy the story needed to be stronger &amp; more in-depth. These big budget Asian movies are becoming more common now &amp; with every one that arrives to the theatres you can almost taste presence of the Hollywood influences. Thats OK to a point but it always seems to misfire due to the way the directors try &amp; tell the story in a 'Hollywood' way. This sometimes does'nt translate well &amp; the obvious differences between eastern and western cultures tend to spoil the outcome. It so hard to get the balance right &amp; for me, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon set the benchmark perfectly. Compare the two on their merits &amp; you will probably get the point I'm making. You actually cared about the story in Crouching Tiger, but not so here with Golden Flower - its a little weak &amp; relies on powerful visuals rather than script, a shame really, because I really wanted to LOVE this film. On the plus side, Golden Flower has set new levels of camera/visual works that are going to be hard to top - on that basis alone, this is a MUST SEE film. Some of the scenes are jaw dropping, but do taste a little of Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings series at times - but thats not a bad thing. This is one of those movies that you will need to probably sit through twice due to the complex way the director chose to tell the story - perhaps my second viewing will lift my opinions of this movie somewhat? The overall outcome for me was that I was glad the advance screening tickets were free &amp; the theatre seats were comfy enough for the odd 10 second doze here &amp; there...Roll on April so I can see this again - it deserves another viewing, Im hoping that the English dubbed version wont be as awful as I've heard it rumoured to be..... Fingers crossed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newset installment to the "martial artsy" series may take a (mello)dramatic turn for the worse, but justifies all in the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zhang Yimou continues to elaborate on the Chinese action spectacular with an injection of soap-opera worthy dramatics taking front and center stage throughout the Tang dynasty piece. In focusing the story around multiple webs of intrigue surrounding an embittered royal family, Curse of the Golden Flower manages to keep all action relevant and well-paced instead of feeling tacked on and forced like in the past. Granted, younger fans of the more visceral fighting they have come to expect from the man who brought America Hero and House of Flying Daggers may start feeling apprehensive and later unresponsive to a majority of the docile palace mystery and convoluted revelations taking place throughout most of the film. Any action junkie patiently waiting for a payoff however will be compensated in a bombastic conclusion that can only be summed up as spectacularly silly.Like his other visually intensive films, Yimou continues to push his production values to the max, often overshadowing any real content a particular scene may have to offer. Too much focus has sadly been placed upon decorating every nook and cranny with as much color and texture as possible, and while the end result still proves masterful in it's escapist endeavors, I dare say at times some of the overdone sets, costuming, and props felt a bit tacky, mis-matched and downright distracting from the focal point of these strained ancient family dynamics. What really keeps the film from strictly being just another piece of Asian eye candy are the seasoned performances coming from two of the East's most popular stars, Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li. Here the two leads are able to anchor what little though stinging sentiment an overwrought plot line finally yields, through a few choice moments of undeniable chemistry and truth beneath all the pomposity and formalities that too often mar the fun details with a stifled redundancy. International superstar Yun-Fat may look and talk the part of emperor more then he actually inhabits it, though I remained satisfied throughout his quietly menacing take. The always ravishing Li steals the show as usual with mesmerizing beauty (no less, when in the grips of illness) only accentuating her endless talent instead of the opposite.For all of the melodrama one may have too wade through on an over-bloated visual palate, this Curse remains worth having, eventually coming into fruition with the final act paying off in spades.</fullReview>

I especially like the song sang by Zhou Jielun at the end of the movie which is very very nice and made me moved much more, it's the best music explaining the story. The flaw of the movie is the character of the third prince, the cast is wrong, because the actor's appearance is too young, so the plot he killed his brother and wanted to take the power from the king is a little stupid,it's unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The coming attractions shown endlessly before any movie can be annoying or can make you want to see the movie. Seeing the coming attractions for "Curse.." made me HAVE TO see the movie. I did not hesitate when the showing was perfectly timed for me this past Saturday afternoon.The first thing that caught my eye, naturally, was the set design. Beautiful to look at. Then there was something about the way Gong Li was just walking through those beautiful sets that made me have to see what she was all about. She appeared to be a woman possessed, obsessed and on a mission. She really did give off that much in a five second clip.And she does not disappoint! I had never seen her before, but I am now a fan. She owns the screen. As the Empress, she is also beautiful to look at but she is much more than that, too. She's intelligent, she knows what she wants..she's also fed up, because eventually she realizes that her life is out of her hands, and that her husband is trying to get rid of her, inexplicably, and she's none too thrilled with the idea of anyone getting in her way. She's also having an affair with her stepson that is not going as well as she might have hoped. This is probably understandable because, well..LOOK AT HER! He's getting rid of her by spiking the medicine she has to take, and it makes her light-headed and sweaty and who wants that? Since its HIS idea, she has nothing to say in the matter, and that's why, in part at least, why she's fed up. But you know what they say about a woman scorned..she's not having any of it, and good for her.The movie is kind of "The Lion in Winter"-ish, but prettier. Some of the acting is laughably over the top but that didn't bother me all that much. Chow is very good, too, but for me this one is all about the lady. Oh, and there are action sequences toward the end, when the inevitable pooh hits the fan, and they are very good for those in the audience who like that kind of thing, but anything that took my eyes off the Empress was a distraction, truth be told. It is not a great movie and I did not experience that I-just-saw-a-great-movie feeling that all true fans of cinema hope for once they hit the street, but as I've gone on about ad nauseum, I have to give it up for Gong Li, a true screen goddess who owns every single frame of film I had the honor of seeing. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a good movie though not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: The last part of the comment contains some plot of the movie. Please don't be surprised.)I went to the movie theater 3 days after the opening show. I have to admit that both the movie company and the theaters have done a good job of advertising the movie. All over Nanjing, Jiangsu, you could see the advertisements with golden color on the walls, TVs, buses and the subways. So even though consumers have been cheated and teased so many times since the first photographic and computer aided graphics centric movie "Hero", they all got to know this movie and expect it to end the endless tragedies of Chinese soap movies. On the board of Worker's cinema, a paste said most of time the theater is gonna be filled with crowded people. So I chose to go on Monday. It's much much better because the No.7 room, one of the best of theirs is almost empty. The movie starts exactly at 2:45pm, though I didn't realized at first. Because the volume was so low and I couldn't feel the same music effect which match the price I paid. I have to say, director Zhang Yi Mou is really good at putting all the brightest colors together. The palace is filled with golden yellow, red and bright green. Even the costume of a common eunuch or lady-in-waiting are wearing the most shining clothes; Don't have to mention the Queen(Gong Li) and the King(Yun-Fat Chow). The story goes much alike as one of the most popular drama in 1930s by Cao Yu.In this movie, the Queen was having an affair with his step son, the crown prince, Yuan Xiang, son of the king's ex-wife. The king knew it since the first day they got together. He decided to poison his wife chronically. Yuan Jie(Jay Chow) is son of the queen and just came back from the border. Slowly the queen discovered that she was being poisoned and decide to rebel in September 9, lunar Chong Yang festival of China. The crown prince was also in love with a royal doctor's daughter, Jiang Chan. It turned out that the royal Doctor's wife is exactly the same woman exiled by the King. To revenge, the queen told the truth that crown prince and Jiang Chan are brothers and sisters. Jiang Chan went insane. The rebel army led by Yuan Jie is attacking the palace while the youngest brother killed Yuan Xiang and tried to usurp the throne. The crown prince discovered the secret before and had told their king that Queen was going to rebel. As a result, the rebel army(golden flower troop) was beaten and all killed by strongly armed escort of the royal palace. The heart broken King declared that if prince Yuan Jie surrender and the queen continue to be poisoned, they could be spared. Yuan Jie suicided in front of his mother and the queen went crazy. It's a tragedy.The story is moving and the actors and actresses did great job though their actor's lines are not well designed. All in all, it's a movie worth seeing in a movie theater and you don't have to laugh at the funny modernized talking of the people in ancient costumes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Director rests on his technique!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yimou Zhang is a brilliant Director. He is arguably the greatest Director alive today. His best films like "Huozhe" and "House of Flying Daggers" are most certainly classics of modern Cinema. "Curse Of The Golden Flower" is not.In fact the star of this film is the Production Design. Normally that distinction goes to an actor. My first problem with the film was with the musical score. It was an overly bombastic choral score that detracted from the visuals and performances. Simple dialogue scenes were pervaded by this histrionic music as if commanding the desired emotions at the desired moment. It failed on all counts.The film is essentially an old fashioned melodrama. Some of the performances take us back to the acting style of the early silent picture days. The Martial Arts also strike a false note. They seem out of place in what is essentially a family melodrama.The Battle scenes also have the aspect of a computer game. Ranks of CGI soldiers fill every inch of the screen and charge in a very controlled non-human way. This computer manipulation of great armies may make the directors life easy but it strips away any sense of human nature. Li Gong holds the bare threads of this film together with another strong performance. Yimou Zhang is resting on his technique as a Director. There are also an extra-ordinary amount of close-ups in this film as if he was making a drama for television. He makes no attempt to try something new. He uses motifs we have seen before. He uses action we have seen before. He uses Special Effects we have seen before. I hope this is a Yimou Zhang we will not see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty pretty nothingness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zhang Yimou is probably the favourite director of the Chinese government now after his paean to patriotism and exhortation to self-sacrifice for the Chinese state in his film Hero, thus he gets to direct the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics in Beijing, and certainly no expense is spared for his film Curse of the Golden Flower (an odd and incorrect translation of the title), another sumptuous and opulent production that we have come to expect from him.Visually the film is gorgeous, full of vibrant colours and stunning set pieces, but unfortunately, his taste seems to have degenerated somewhat since Hero and House of Flying Daggers, and now it veers dangerously towards kitsch, and perhaps even landing squarely into kitschdom. The set is amazingly gaudy and garish, stuffed full of the worse excesses of the kind of things you might find in a Chinese souvenir shop. The interior design of the palace with its colourful plastic dangly bits is almost laughable, and the overall tone is as far away from Tang aesthetics as it can possibly be. Some people here complained about the costume the women in the film wear and the semi-exposed breasts, but in fact it is one of the few things that the film got close to right - that was the style of dress worn by Tang womenfolk as depicted by the famous Tang dynasty artist Zhou Fang, whose work no doubt inspired the costume designer (The actual dress would however be more likely to be looser fitting than the tight-corset type imagined by the costume designer).The plot of the film, as noted by many people here, are closer that of a soap opera, with fervid passion, illicit affairs, and tortuous scandalous ridiculous family relationship. One may argue that you can find this kind of stuff in the finest literature, except that those works are saved by magnificent prose and beautiful writing. Here in this film the dialogues are clunky and the plot poorly sketched. The worse sin with this film, however, is that it is deadly boring, especially in the first half where I almost gave up watching. There is nothing in it that makes you interested in or care about the main characters. There is however a battle scene in the second half which is actually quite thrilling, and it is what saved it from getting a score of 1/10 from me.It is, in essence, just a family melodrama albeit in an imperial setting. And if you want to watch family melodrama, try Peyton Place instead, it'll be more rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic, haunting, following the footsteps of Cao Yu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's rough storyline was based on Cao Yu's Thunderstorm. Cao Yu (1910-1996) is a renowned modern Chinese dramatist who is regarded as "the Shakespeare of China". If modern Chinese drama has come of age in the 1930s, then Cao Yu and his dramatic trilogy of Thunderstorm, Sunrise and The Wilderness are a hallmark of this maturity. Rich in implications and excellent in techniques, these dramatic works are regarded as the classics of modern Chinese drama. Just before graduation in 1933 when Cao Yu was only 23 years old, he finished his virgin play Thunderstorm, to be followed up by Sunrise (1936) and The Wilderness (1937).Although the original Thunderstorm was set in a declining feudal-capitalistic family in the 30's of Chinese high society, the adaptation of the original storyline to the decadent Late Tang Dynasty setting is a job well-done. Indeed, moving the setting to the Forbidden Palace raises the intensity of tragedy and struggle exponetially, while naturally blending in stunning visuals and painstaking detailing of the historically accurate scenes of royal life.After impacting audiences world wide with heart-breaking love stories (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and impeccable martial arts and grand courage of historical Heros, Director Zhang Yimou turned dark in Curse of the Golden Flower. The characters are more 3D and complicated, the desire runs deep--no love but lust; no vision for the common good but personal goals; no promise and no hope. The decadent palace, luscious flesh and gorgeous pure gold jewelry contrast the darkness of human reality--everyone is for their desire and the result is a monstrous machine called "the Empire". Every frame is a master piece oil painting. A haunting, heart-twisting master piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting movie... but a lot can be done to improve it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I review this movie. I would like to apology to those who will be taking offends or disagreeing my review or my opinions because my review contains a lot of spoilers.I'm not going to do a story telling about the movie because this movie is the most expensive Chinese film so far (US$45 million) and it is directed by the famous Zhang Yimou and acted by legendary Chow Yun Fat from Hong Kong and Gong Li from China and popular Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou. So you should go watch it. It will at least worth your ticket price even if you may not really like it.Curse of the Golden Flower is a sad film. Its a pretty short movie... about an hour plus. This film has very few characters. It only focus on the Royal family (5 members) and the Imperial doctor's family (3 members) and maybe 1 army general during the battle and 1 old eunuch man. I was disappointed that there was lack of character development in the movie even though there were so few characters, maybe because the movie was quite short. The characters were all very dull looking and speak in a very dull tone. There wasn't much of a happy scene, showing how miserable the royal family is.Before I saw the movie, I expected it to involve more historical facts like the royal family, palace, their system, Tang dynasty etc. But it turn out to be just focusing on the story and forgot about those good points above that will improve the movie.The movie's plot line is very simple but not very appealing or entertaining. It focus on the ridicules and yet complicated relationship between the Royal Family members. The *SPOILER* part in the movie was the incest relationship between the 1st Prince and his step mother. That was still okay for me... But he was also having another incest relationship with his half sister! which was super turn off for me.During the climate of the film was when there was a battle between Silver and Gold army. Jay Chou's character led about 10 000 soldiers(if i'm not wrong) to march into their destination... but if you saw the movie, you will notice that only about 20 or more soldiers really got to fight and the rest were all massacre in the later part of the movie. Both army did not actually went into full battle. With US$45 million, I expected a real army battle. They got to make full and good use of the 1000 extras.But other than all the spoilers, I do enjoy the wonderful and beautiful directing of Zhang Yimou but I don't think he can win an Oscar with this movie next year. I love the costumes, colors and the settings of the movie. Those elements colorize the movie and make it into a visually perfect and beautiful movie. The acting was great... Gong Li was superb as usual, Ye Liu (1st prince) was great too. Jay Chou's acting was okay but if compare to his previous movie Initial D, there was a big improvement. But I really really enjoy Chow Yun Fat's acting. There were news lately about him jokingly saying that Gong Li criticizing his mandarin. But to me, he did a great job and playing the villain in this movie, it was something fresh. He was the best in the movie. If they have this award for best villain of the year, he will sure to win.The ending song by Jay Chou call "Chrysanthemum Flower Bed" is perfect for the ending. It is a nice song.Curse of the Golden Flower is still worth watching. I'll rate it 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uhhh... interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when take a bit of Pete Jackson's "Lord of the Rings", mix it with "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon", Shakespeare and add a dash of "General Hospital"? You get this film.Huh. I'm not really sure what to say about it. It teetered on the abyss of being comically horrid, and yet was really striving to be a classic film. In the end it winds up being a near parody of itself with action film actors attempting to do high drama.Couple this with the usual Eastern martial arts film wire work and you got yourself a film that's almost unsure of where to go when all is said and done.Truth be told the film was simply too visually and physically confining to be the film that it wanted to be. Nearly all of Acts I and II take place in a red-and-gold opulent palace that, from all outward appearances has only one or two rooms and a main hallway. Okay, story wise that's not true, but the set design wasn't varied enough to give this viewer the impression that the palace was a palace. It just looked like a couple of rooms connected by a hallway.Then there's the obligatory martial arts' scenes, done in all their staged/choreographed glory as to be near comical. In fact I had to stifle a couple of chuckles while watching these segments they were so corny. Wire work and staged action do not a good action sequence make. When will the Chinese film industry come to terms with this? Probably never.The acting was okay. If anything it was a little sub par, but not much, and typically and needlessly melodramatic.Had this film not been trying to achieve the ultimate cross-genre golden achievement award, then it might have been a more solid piece of cinema. As it is now it's just a curious oddity with a spritz of class via a big budget to act as frosting on a mediocre cake. Cutting down the action and making it more realistic, and replacing the action cast with a more dramatic cast would have served this film well. Right now it's a quirky and slushy production.Pete-Jackson like battle scenes only serve to add another nail in the coffin for an overachieving film. To be brutally honest I thought the battle sequences were excessively cheesy and just generally poor in terms of execution.Is this a plot driven film? High drama? Period-military-thriller? Ehh... it's all of those, but mostly it's just not that good a film. It's impressive in terms of production scale, but just too wound up in itself to really deliver a better photo-play that it might have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sometimes a grandiose historical epic, but mostly a lurid, totally absorbing royal family drama; one of Yimou's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with flaws and all- and there are a couple at least here in Curse of the Golden Flower- I can only think of a handful of filmmakers that have shot to the moon like this and gotten away with it. Zhang Yimou tried it before with Hero and, for me, sort of didn't pull through completely successfully (not that it hasn't gained its share of fans, and House of Flying Daggers was actually incredible (both for being able to pull off its wacky high-flying action scenes and scoring as a romantic drama) and the top of the pops in Yimou's big-budget melodramas. 'Golden Flower' comes pretty close, if not totally, to 'Flying Daggers' successes, even if it's possibly even more entertaining and acted on a level that goes to the lengths of emotional absurdity. I don't think I could ever see an American action-epic with the kinds of dark, secret, and lost characters in a film like this, and while I would say the action sequences and battles in said Western counterparts might make a little more sense, the pageantry and power of the visuals strikes this one a bit more extraordinary.I wish I could put the plot into context, but it might take too long, and it's already provided on the main page of the site. Suffice to say though it's a mouthful to try and explain it all in one piece; simply put, we're given a tragedy as it unfolds more so on the personal level up until the last half hour, where Emperor Ping (Chow Yun Fat) and his Empress Phoenix (Gong Li) are in a crippled marriage, and hidden behind the rituals and strict decorum and everyday mercies of circumstance there's hatred on both sides, with the Emperor plotting his wife's murder via poison in the medicine she drinks, and once discovered her plot against him through various channels. There's also the Freudian ties between the sons- two from both of them and one from the Emperor and a previous woman (who will be of significance to much of the picture)- including not only a liaison between mother and step-son, but between a half-brother and half-sister. In between an amazing bout that occurs with quasi-Chinese ninjas storming the Phyisican and his wife's home, including grappling hooks and chaos and a chase, and a massively epic battle sequence in the Emperor's enormous stretch of royal grounds, there are many scenes that are intimately attuned for the actors, and pitched just high enough to make it delirious fun and sobering in sadness.Sure, it's over-the-top stuff that one might read in another permutation in a trashy supermarket novel, but Yimou is smart enough to let the actors take this material to work much better than one would expect. Gong Li, really, is the centerpiece here as the Empress torn by a life of diligent servitude, only to find that her long-standing sickness is not getting any better (there are a few scenes of power where she almost breaks down in cold sweats and shaking fits), and her allegiances become all the more torn, twisted and fragmented by the poison doing bad things to her mind, and to her tryst with her step-son, and to her intentions towards her wretched husband. It's a great performance, worthy of Luchino Visconti, whom I thought of a couple of times watching the picture in terms of comparing operatic to operatic. Chow Yun Fat, too, is fantastic at being the man who corrupts not necessarily really his control over his empire, but that he can't tell through the third person referrals from his children what's really going on. The scenes of revelations during the last half hour, which include him showing the true state of his hair (a real wicked moment), are some of the best of the film. The rest of the cast, too, does pretty well for themselves, even if one or two of them (mostly the youngest son) don't take too much to the over-the-top styling.And the over-the-top, sensationalism of the picture does have its drawbacks, too. I'll need to see the film again to totally understand things in terms of the action set-pieces, like which side was which (I did finally get a sense of what happened by film's end, of course, but like with Hero I felt a little boggled). The music is also monotonous from time to time, albeit with touches of grace and just-right flamboyance. And there might be almost TOO much to put into suspension of disbelief with some of the dysfunctions in the family chain(s), like with Prince Wan and his little girl-on-the-side who's really more than either would think of to be. But I really put myself into not just the operatic intonations, the Shakespeare-goes-Eastern story and characters which highlight the madness and decay in royalty, but the epic scope of the picture as well. The costume design, up for an Oscar, is a small marvel, though the production and art design ranks up with the best I've seen in the decade, where the colors are more than lush, as if out of some artist's fever-dream interpretation of what the insides of a palace look like. And Yimou's camera moves along this world- and gets the battle scenes- with the efficiency and skill that he's been building towards since Hero. Even if what you see might seem all too ridiculous, you likely can't take your eyes away.Is 'Golden Flower' almost too morbid? Perhaps, and the characters run the risk of veering off into being cheap in its melodrama. This being said, it ends up working on all of its levels, more or less, and it thrills while it pokes into the psychologies of its magisterial characters, and it ends on a very stirring note.

		<shortDescription>Zhang Yimou's zillion-yuan test for the Beijing Olympics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Curse of the Golden Flower" can be best described as an apotheosis of overwrought kitsch, hyper-saturated colors and military choreography. Everything in it is big, lavish, excessive, but staged in a clockwork style; every shot spells *money* and "extravaganza", but under stiff control. If you -- like me -- once marveled at Zhang Yimou's refined artistry in masterpieces like "Ju Dou" and "Raise the Red Lantern", you'll be baffled by "Curse": it's hardly to believe they were directed by the same man. After "Hero" and "Flying Daggers", Zhang completes with "Curse" his exhibitionist, rococo trilogy, where the "message" (i.e. the connections between power and corruption) gets crushed under formalist grandeur, militarist fascination and commercial targets.The colors in "Curse" belong to a sort of Phosphorescent Lollipopland, with blazing goldens, sanguine scarlets, shocking purples and pinks; it feels like a color-blind exam. The lighting is so overdone it's flat; the sets so overwrought and overcrowded that Hollywood Bible epics of the 1950s look minimalistic by comparison. The costumes, though masterfully executed, are so flamboyantly flashy they upstage the actors. Oh, and as many reviewers pointed out, there are those anachronistic (?) popping boobs...very distracting:)The CGI work is underachieved; the music is monotonous and incongruously Westernish. The action scenes are lukewarm at best: Zhang is a flat, unexciting fight director -- he doesn't know how to edit them. The plot is even more convoluted than the sets, while the dialog alternates between risible clichés and hermetic symbolisms. The cast is told to over-act: Chow Yun Fat sulks, groans, squints his BLUE (!) contact lensed-eyes, and combs his goatee with a cool gadget-ring. Gong Li suffers, trembles, cries, suffers, trembles, cries, drinks endless cups of poisoned tea and feels sick all the time (is it the stifling wonder-bra or the smell of the script?). Song pop-star Jay Chou has an interesting face, but is betrayed by the director, who lingers on his clueless "reaction" shots, revealing Chou's lack of proper acting training. The closing credits song (which Chou produced, wrote and sang) just proves that bad pop songs exist everywhere. What IS remarkable about "Curse" is the flabbergasting amount of money spent to tell what is, after all, a huis clos story: all that matters in the plot takes place indoors -- the CGI, the battles, the armies, the ninjas, the fights are pretty much there to satisfy action junkies, justify the stratospheric budget and crush the audience with a paraphernalia of excesses.Also remarkable, of course, is Zhang's taste for unimaginative, clockwork crowd choreography: thousands of real and virtual extras flow by in rigid geometric patterns with a maniac precision that can only be described as military-inspired. No wonder Zhang has been appointed to stage the opening ceremony at the next Beijing's Olympics: "Curse" serves as his zillion-yuan test for the job. All of this made me think of how Zhang's substantial, ground-breaking past work has turned into vacuous formalism and establishment-friendly status. And I recalled his notorious megalomania and authoritarianism (check the documentary "The Turandot Project" by Alan Miller) and his quote saying "My films are an excellent channel for promoting China's culture"."Curse" is a gigantic soufflé, an exhausting mammoth extravaganza made by a self-obsessed, control-freak artist who -- though he states in interviews his "aversion to politics" -- seems to feed on, cherish and serve the very status quo he thinks he transcends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or, Curse of the Golden Flower, as the international title goes, is a film about love, deceit, honor and more in the Forbidden City, around the year 820. It starts of days before the yearly Chrysant festival and tells the tale of the Emperor, the Empress, the princes and what goes on between them. Which is more than it should be. In this way, the Forbidden City is a place where there is more than immediately meets the eye.Although the film starts a little slow it quickly picks up the pace and when it is rolling, it keeps on going. Starting with a mild case of boredom in the palace it quickly turns toward forbidden relations and even larger things. All this is played out in the middle of fights between people trying to defend either end of the story (some of them small, one to one fights, some of them raging huge battles). The film uses a lot of big scenes - overviews of the city, large groups of people, but also lots of singular faces up close.The effect of it all was that the film is quite overwhelming: there's always something happening somewhere on the screen. Either a small effect, or something large, but always adding something significant to the total value of the film.A very attractive watch, intriguing story, and nice imagery.8 out of 10 people lost in The Forbidden City</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched The Curse of the Golden Flower on DVD this afternoon.A couple of days ago I watched House of the Flying Daggers by the same director and liked it a lot, so my expectations were high for this film. It wasn't quite what I expected, that's for sure! The film concerns the intrigues of the Chinese imperial family, at a distant point in the past. There are few battle/fight scenes, and many scenes of grandeur and decadence. They actually built a set of the forbidden city! The plot resembles something a cross between The Lion in Winter and Kagemusha. But even so, the action is rather stilted. It all comes to a head in the last third, but I felt like I was watching opera more than anything else. And the final battle scene and massacre resembled something from a Lord of the Rings film, rather than anything particularly realistic.Not that I minded, and unlike Kagemusha there is some form of drama here. You just have to wait for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not a good movie. The movie was breathtakingly beautiful, but that's where it stops. The operatic, grand tragedy elements that others have commented on are leveraged in a disjointed, nonsensical manner. The movie, like an opera, takes FOREVER to make a single point - but without the magnificent music and voices to make it enjoyable. The movie ends up being just a very slow, very tedious movie that is saturated with brilliant color. After a while, even the color and beauty resonates less and less - as the story just drags on and on. Even the fight sequences (which are few, but grandly over the top) lose interest and seem out of place in the context of the otherwise boring story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Persian black fungus? They really got it from present-day Iran?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I haven't seen Zhang Yimou's early movies, only his works from the 21st century. And it seems that he tries to outdo himself each successive time: "Hero", "House of Flying Daggers", and now "Curse of the Golden Flower" ("Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia" in Mandarin). The plot is a little hard to follow, and I suspect that the battle scene is supposed to be the one that sticks in people's minds. To me at least, this mirrors George Lucas's most recent movies: they try so hard to be as big as possible, that it's too grandiose to even take in. As I understand it, this movie is supposed to be a metaphor for China's conversion from western domination to communism; do we really want to idealize the Cultural Revolution (or some of the things that have happened since)? Otherwise, it's a visual treat. The palace interior looks psychedelic. Starring Chow Yun-Fat, Gong Li, Liu Ye and Jay Chou.So the black fungus really came from Persia. I knew that China traded with other cultures, but I never guessed that Persia gave them anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So spectacular, you should see it once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is far from my favorite Chinese movie, it is one I strongly recommend you see simply because of its spectacular battle sequences in the last third of the film. While it's obvious in places that lots of CG technology was used, it still is amazing seeing battle sequences that come close to those from the Lord of the Rings films in grandeur and scope.The plot itself reminds me a bit of A LION IN WINTER and I, CLAUDIUS since it follows the very dysfunctional machinations of the emperor and his family. After a while, it becomes a bit difficult figuring who's scheming against who and keeping track of all the amoral actions of the cast that make them seem much like a more dysfunctional and power-made group than the famed Borgias of Italy! All this is done in amazing style and grace, though the first third of the film might seem a bit too slow for many. I'll concede this is a bit true, but urge the viewer to stick with it--the film inexorably draws to an amazing conclusion in which 1000 extras were employed in a huge battle in which it appears that about 50000 troops were fighting to a very, very bloody death. And please note that I did say "bloody". This film earned an R rating even though there is no nudity and the language is rather tame--all because buckets and buckets of fake blood are used and the deaths are at times very brutal.In closing, there are a couple things to look for. First, the ninja-like assassins are really high on the cool factor. They are of course over-the-top as is some of the action, but it is far more believable and uses far less of the high-flying gadgetry of films such as CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. Also, watch the scene were the emperor and his #2 son have a sword fight near the beginning of the film--wow is THAT exciting!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the six-gun which never runs out of bullets, like the hero who emerges from horrific car crashes with nary a scratch, like the bullet which miraculously severs the rope/wire/button/remote-control/etc saving the day, like the amazing requisite car chase, like the exact change every cab rider/restaurant diner has, there are certain conventions in Chinese cinema which don't come close to anything remotely approaching reality, too. Westerners understand allegory and symbolism; but, somehow, don't seem to recognize it when it appears in an Asian context.A given in Chinese period film is the spectacle, pageantry, mass choreographed movement, elaborate battle scenes (has anyone ever seen a film about Elizabeth I?), martial arts, and wire (flying) work. Rather than viewing it as amusing or comic, we can learn to appreciate the technical challenges of the filming, and the meaning/symbolism of the action which is painted in such broad strokes. Is it Good vs Evil? And who is Good/Evil? Is there Irony? - "You are truly insane!" As for this film, the color was amazing, tremendous production values, good acting, but it was a bit slow in the beginning. The characters were interesting and even sympathetic, but it took a while before I even cared. This pacing may reflect the tremendous popularity of the Chinese serial drama which often runs to 40+ episodes for a story Hollywood would tell in 90+ min. So, if pacing is not important, this is one worth seeing. It may even improve your Chinese Movie Tolerance Index!</fullReview>

How two opposing armies could meet where one was completely unaware of the existence of the other was a huge stretch. How they then could possibly preserve the life of one person in the resulting shoot-out was ridiculous. Assassins raining down on wires that seem to be suspended in mid air most of the time was laughable. There was a lot of potential for this portrayal of a dysfunctional royal family, but the aforementioned over-the-top scenes ruined it so in the end I lost all interest.

		<shortDescription>Epic, tragic, conventional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie because I liked the previous films of the director ("Hero", "House of Flying Daggers"). As expected, the picture overwhelms you from the first moment with colorful and impressive settings, costumes and decorations. However, I found it somewhat difficult to think myself in the situation of the characters of the movie, as there does not seem to be a certain character the story is focused on; and, additionally, as western/European spectator you may find it hard to get into the setting as it is strongly determined by traditional Chinese custom and history. The storyline reminded me slightly of some Greek tragedy - the patriarch ruling his kingdom and his family with a cruel hand, the hand of destiny causing almost impossible coincidences, eventually leading to a (unconscious) romance between sister and brother, the monumental struggle of vast armies and heroes for honor and power. Nonetheless, I had the impression that the story was maybe just a little bit too simple as it can finally be distilled to a rather conventional family tragedy with elements of personal ambition and mother-child relationship. Moreover, virtually all the movie plays inside the emperor's palace, which is beautifully modeled, but the story just does not have the depth to fill a movie playing almost in a single location - a little bot more or intrigue, of surprise, of background would have elevated the film to the class the big Chinese movies define. Additionally, some of the computer effects, especially city/palace backgrounds, seemed somewhat obviously digital and almost cheap. Summing up: Good movie, but nothing there hasn't been before.</fullReview>

Throw us a bone here and give us somebody to root for. Plus, what is happening to Zhang Yimou? Every movie he does comes out shinier and less substantial than the last one. Flying Daggers seemed technicolor compared to Hero, but Curse is blinding. What with the cleavage and the costumes and the cleavage and the hot pink sets and the cleavage and the fight scenes and the cleavage - what exactly was the point of the whole thing?

		<shortDescription>Zhang Yimou is following a road to mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you combine Shakespearean tragedy, a visual explosion of color, and three of the most internationally marketable stars of Chinese cinema? The Curse of the Golden Flower. While those qualities should've proved to be a great mix, Zhang Yimou's obsession with his visual trilogy crippled this film's potential.I'm not a huge fan of martial arts. That being said, I think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the finest films ever made. It's a work of beautiful genius; lyrical and haunting. Because of this, I'm willing to give the occasional Wuxua film a chance.When it comes to Zhang Yimou, I think his older works put him in an elite crowd over the last 20 years. His filmography compares nicely to other great luminaries of the industry. To Live and Raise the Red Lantern are two of the most poignant and emotionally complex films of the last 15 years. I thought Hero was a stunning achievement, not only on it's own merits, but because it was such a marked change of pace from one of the world's most brilliant auteurs.But House of Flying Daggers, while extravagant, was indulgent. It was an overblown derivation of Hero, but lacked the emotional power of the it's predecessors script. It was, in short, too much.Curse of the Golden Flower is in line with House of Flying Daggers. Visually, it's a magnificent work, but it's almost an assault on the senses. This film goes beyond baroque. The world created by Zhang explodes in a beautiful pastiche of color. It could've worked, however, if only Zhang had pulled back a bit. Instead of having a mythic status, as I'm sure it was intended to have, the film comes off as bloated and melodramatic.This film is beautiful to look at, but difficult to fully enjoy. If Zhang Yimou had chosen to make an epic martial arts film, this could've been spectacular. If he'd decided to make a haunting character study of this royal family, it would've been powerful. Instead, it was a visually stunning film that missed a lot of it's marks.Final analysis: watchable for it's visual acuity, but don't expect a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is yet another Chinese movie to give ironists pause in that non-Violence viewers in the West are drawn to these films by the sumptuous settings which aspire to eclipse each previous film and this from a country known for its extreme poverty under Communism.This time around we get a story of sorts, a dynastic power struggle invoking the more lurid aspects of Hamlet - the poisoning (attempted) of a monarch, albeit a queen rather than a king, and actual mother-son incest that remained unconsummated in Denmark - and even aspects of Lear - a kingdom potentially divisible by three. Bizarrely the battle sequences are shot in semi-darkness perhaps the better to conceal the trickery but even in full daylight it would have been largely meaningless and impossible to tell who was doing what to who and why. This is probably, for me at least, the weakest of the recent spate of this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zhang Yimou's latest is a glorious freak-out of a movie. You can cut the melodrama with a knife; the whole thing is hopelessly over-emphatic, like a parody of Shakespeare. But it works a kind of spell, and it won me over, lingering in my head for a few days after I'd seen it.Those who have become used to Yimou's brand of gloriously choreographed fight scenes may be disappointed by this film, as it's short on the action and long on the plot. Unfortunately, Yimou's strengths lie neither in creating challenging plots nor compelling characters, so much of this film is given over to long and ever-so-slightly-boring character scenes. Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li play the Emperor and Empress of China, engaged in a family squabble from hell, along with the Emperor's son from a previous marriage and the two sons they have had together. Family members declare their loyalty to one or the other of the parents and everything ends tragically and bloodily. Most of this is ridiculous stuff, like "Macbeth" crossed with Douglas Sirk. But there's enough dazzling color, histrionic feuding and swooping action segments to carry the film through its dull moments. I especially liked the swarm of ninjas that fly around on cables like a batch of giant black spiders and act as the Emperor's personal bodyguards; and the film's climactic battle, that reminded me very much of Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood." A gorgeous looking piece of eye and brain candy.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The visuals are stunning but overall the movie disappoints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curse of the golden flower looks amazing! The bright colors,the huge masses of soldiers,the great palace and the clothing! There are some wonderful action scenes but nothing really special! It's purpose here is to serve to intensify the drama! At the beginning the drama looks promising! But in the end there is not even a satisfying conclusion! The main focus is on Gong Li! Chow Yan Fat also is present but doesn't have enough screen time to lift this movie to a higher level! It seems he is at a loss with the bad story! Without going into the story I can honestly say that the story is too simple! The events that are happening are similar to that of a daytime soap opera! The stunning visuals cannot hide that the plot is bad! I could accept the simple plot if the drama was indeed intense! But how could it achieve this without a sensible motivation given to the characters! It sometimes is not really clear why characters act the way they do! I mean Gong Li,the empress finds out she is being poisoned by her husband,the emperor (Chow Yan Fat)! And still she keeps on drinking the tea with the poison in it! Also the characters are not really likable! It is like they are not given the opportunity to do so! It is a shame and waist of talent to use actors of this caliber in this way! In comparison to previous movies made by the director this is a very bad one! If you get the chance watch Hero or House of Flying daggers in stead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing in the Curse of the Golden Flower you will noticed is the colors of this over-cooked film. This movie has the color palette of an exploding paint factory and overly loud like a pink fluorescent shirt.This movie is about a Chinese Imperial family a thousand years ago that wants to play like a Shakespearean tragedy but ends up confused the heck out me. You have the emperor, his younger new empress, his three sons. Mixed them all up and add a dash of poison for a good measure and you got a whole lot of blood letting in the end. I can not make head or tail of this movie not until after I have read the plot summary on IMDb. It seems that the emperor is having second thoughts about his new younger wife and decided to pull a Henry VIII without the whole beheading thing. His new younger wife by-the-way got the hots for her oldest step-son, while her second oldest sons happens to be her son with the emperor. I have no idea who the third sons belongs to. Anyway, the empress discovered the poison plot and decided it's time for a management change at the top, while her oldest step-son is chasing the daughter of the imperial family's doctor, which the emperor wants to have the good doctor and his family doing the dirt naps. Things really got interesting when the youngest son decided to jump into the foray.The color palette of this movie is not the only thing I have problem with this film. The costumes in the movie seems like somebody mixed up the woman's Chinese imperial costumes with the woman's Europen royal costumes of the 15th century. I have never seen so much cleavages in a Chinese film! Another thing you get to see is lots and lots of hallway tracking shots, long hallway tracking shots with color splashed everywhere by a person with a bad case of ADD. One more thing, the film-maker likes to show lots and lots of people in his movie. You have scenes of thousands of imperial soldiers running around for which you don't know where and how they came from. During the movie I have no ideas of who are the bad guys or who are the good guys, and frankly, I don't care, because in this film it's hard to root for the emperor, empress, or the princes or anybody. This is the kind of film that reaches across the border of China and over the vast Pacific Ocean and grabs you and makes you say, "holy crap, this is an awful movie!".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who liked Hero and House of Flying Daggers, and fans of Zhang Yimou's style since acquiring high-budgets, they will like this film.But as the response for those films reflect, Zhang Yimou's development into a mainstream aboveground filmmaker has settled for mediocrity. This film was confusing and unnecessarily convoluted, but the story is actually very intriguing as it stands. If it was handled by a director who was not so much obsessed with color, with overwhelming the screen with as many objects as possible, and with the breasts of Gong Li and Man Li (Chan), along with the rest of the female extras, spilling over...Honestly, this film is just mediocre. I get the sense that Zhang couldn't figure out what to do with all the money after all his excessive splurging on sets and costumes and high profile actor/actresses, which points to his shot selection and what ended up on the final cut...i mean, some shots just i get the feeling Zhang said "dang, i have 5 million more dollars, lets shoot that table scene from the top again..." okay, that was a bad example, but i don't want to get into more details so i don't thrown off a spoiler.more is not necessarily better, mr. zhang.and mr. jay chou, for all his musical prowess should stick to writing music...cause i just want to laugh.did i mention this movie was unnecessarily convoluted?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curse of the Golden Flower Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia Yimou ZhangI took a course in college that explored the various literatures of the world. Over Christmas break, I brought home 23 books that took me 16 weeks to read ? my mother read them in a weekend. After each blitzkrieg through a foreign culture, she'd say the same thing: "They are just like the Italians."From the vantage of my grizzly old age, I realize that she equated any culture that demonstratively expressed its feelings and felt a sense of cultural pride with being Italian. (My father is Irish ?and I am culturally schizophrenic).The Chinese emote nearly as powerfully as the Italians. Don't confuse the dainty Japanese etiquette with the raucous cloth rending, suicide prone operatic tone of Chinese drama. The Curse of the Golden Flower could have a score written by Puccini.The House of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero all made the commercial release of this film possible. (My favorite of the three listed is Hero by a long shot.) The Curse may not actually harm your future, but it didn't measure up to those previous films.The palette of the movie is primarily gold, red and green. They over kill some of the color saturation ? but hey ? you came for the exotic right? The acting is melodramatic. I think most American audiences will see the acting as simply bad and the rude teen-agers in my theater who though they had bought a ticket to a Jet Li movie, certainly laughed their way through the melodrama. But the master key to the seeing this as melodrama, and not campy poor acting, is Chow Yun Fat. Chow Yun Fat is as fine an actor as there is, and he is as melodramatic as the rest of them.If you see it, release yourself from the expectations that the fight scenes will drive the movie. (They were disappointing). I would wait for it to come out on DVD. I am certain The Curse of the Golden Flower will make for great take-out.MySpace.com/200WordCritic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Emperor has no clothes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zhang Ymou, who has given us Raise the Red Lantern, Zhou Dou, Red Sorghum and so many other films herewith delivers a piece of eye-candy that is just that: sweet, delicious on the eyes, busy but lacking in nutrients, substance or health or psychological benefits. The Machiavellian plot is so convoluted that one quickly loses interest in the face of confusion. The obvious is thrust under our noses again and again while the beautiful Gong Li is relegated to looking like she's constantly constipated, Yun-fat Chow's role as Emperor Ping is a parody of Fu Manchu while the supporting cast of thousands move around the carnival-colored set like puppets. Zhang's martial art scenes have become surreal and have lost the ballet grace of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and his own Hero. We saw it coming in House of Flying Daggers but alas, the Curse of the Golden Bird has taken it beyond the extreme. If you like a huge serving of visual goodies in terms tightly organized and directed colors and movements, you'll not be disappointed. The cinematography is exquisite. But, if you want some meat with these rich noodles, you will leave the theater feeling hungry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could alternately be titled: "The Most Awkward Family Dinner Ever" as it raises family dysfunction to new heights of excess. The problem is, when the visuals are so extravagant and beautiful and the story is so weak and sloppy, a hollow gap forms between the narrative and the imagery. The viewer then struggles to stop focusing on this glaring gap and find a way to enjoy the film's production quality. But, even the visuals are too colorful and too dramatic to be effective. They all begin to blend together. The only subtlety resides in the characters, and that quickly fades too. Though the trailer totally sold me, the movie itself crushed my hopes for another Hero or Crouching Tiger and left me with a feeling of confused emptiness. Such a beautiful waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story still thin, and too much color</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was still hoping that Yimou Zhang can make a movie as good as "To Live" someday, until tonight after I saw Curse of the Golden Flower. I have to seriously remind myself again, he's lost it.Despite the flatters I read from news that "this time he really has a story", I am still disappointed. The story was simply too thin. It feels like a 40-min play, stuffed with a bunch of colorful scenes. Everything was so predictable that it made me believe that Yimou Zhang cannot handle complex plots.No doubt the acting was great. Gong Li didn't disappoint me -- she was spectacular. Yun-Fat Chow impressed me by his fluent mandarin. Jay Chou was at his best, he does have some talent besides music.And lastly, the colors. Oh yeah, the colors. They are too much. Right from the beginning the golden and red colors dominate every single shot. At some point I felt so sick of it that I took a water break. Yimou's use of colors in Hero was well recognized, and that was quite nice. But this time he certainly over did it.In summary, the story was still thin. Colors were over done. Go see the movie if you want to hear Yun-Fat Chow's mandarin, or Jay Chou's song, Ju Hua Tai at the end. If these two things don't interest you, you can certainly find better things to burn your money on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahhh - brand new carpeting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this surprise of a picture. I read that it was China's most expensive movie ever, at a "scant" $45 million. It certainly seemed the director eschewed realism for sensationalism. I was OK with that. It was between going to see Rocky Balboa or the new CIA movie and frankly American films have begun to bore me, so I took a chance, because I saw a newspaper article that rated Golden Flower highly. I was thoroughly entertained although not for one minute did I believe the rainbow-colored palace or the low-cut women of the palace. I didn't care. It was a lot of fun to look at. What the end of the movie said to me was kind of a day-glo Alexander Nevsky. Just like Nevsky, I see this film is a warning to foreign armies. No matter what you do, you can't beat the Chinese. They're too huge and they're ruthless. And as soon as they're finished engulfing and devouring you, they'll wash your blood away and cover it with brand new carpeting.</fullReview>

Power, love, envy and pain, contrasting images depicted the human natures very well. However, the relatively simple storyline could still be even more mature, like Hero or other of Zhang's works.

		<shortDescription>Better, but still a long way ahead to go for Chinese movie industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparing to Yimou's other big movies of same kind, namely, "Hero" and "House of Flying Daggers", I would say it's better only in terms of storytelling. Like what he did before, Yimou put much emphasis on the costumes. I think most audience were stunned by the shining golden armors of thousands of soldiers and the only word on my mind at the first sight of such scene is "incredible". However, for me, there is just so much gold in the movie that my eyes soon got overwhelmed and bored and I had to take my eyes off the big shining screen to avoid those scenes. Sometimes if you impose too much good things of same kind on the audience, those good things may turn to bad things. That's why you can't go either too much or too little. The degree matters.The most obvious feeling I had after I watched it is, I was expecting to see more content all the time while I was sitting there but I didn't see much. When the movie was over, I couldn't help asking myself, "What does it say?". It's a two-hour movie but I felt that there isn't much content in it.First of all, there are too few conversations in the movie between those major characters. Maybe the director wants to express most of the meaning of the movie by acting, rather than by words. But among almost all the great movies, the actors' lines or the narrative play a very important role in making those movies great movies. Many conversations in the movie don't necessarily mean that the meaning of the movie would be easily identified, nor does it mean there is no depth in the movie. On the contrary, well designed lines could be very thought-provoking.Second of all, there are too few scenes throughout the whole movie. There are some scenes describing different aspects of the palace. But for me, there is not too much difference between them. With no doubt those scenes in palace are visually compelling but for me that is just one good scene. In that sense, there are just too few scenes in the movie, which is another factor that contributes to my feeling of lack of content.Third of all, there are too few characters. A royal family plus another family of imperial physician are not enough for me. Even you saw thousands of soldiers in golden and silver armors, they can't amount to even one character. I am not saying you have to have many characters in a movie to be able to make that movie a good movie, but you've got to have enough specialties for your limited characters to convey enough content to the audience.When I stepped out the theater, I was not satisfied because I was not filled up and this movie failed to give me enough room to think about it. I even didn't get entertained much, which was exactly what I expected before I went into the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>china movie "curse of the gold flower " cheat foreigners.The foreigners whom unknowing Chinese history to watch china movie "curse of the gold flower "? china movie "curse of the gold flower " cheat foreigners unknowing Chinese history.Some wrong in china movie "curse of the gold flower ".1,The ancient Chinese always thought the mountain is a place to inter the deceased person. It certainly is considered it is the biggest taboo and inauspicious if the imperial palace constructs in front of the mountain. Such as, is it means to incantation emperor is dying early? So in ancient China, most cities is built at flat place. It is enough proof to inspect the Han dynasty city Xian, Beijing, KaiFeng.2, This movie only has two scenes? Outside a palace scene and an indoor palace scene. Less than theater and modern drama scene. How to think it is a film to spent more than three billion Yuan? Is it big movie? 3, This imperial Palace is built nearness hillside. No people living around? No city house? Only have an imperial Palace? Emperor look like as a fairy? No eat, no drink? Living along far away people? To save money for making this movie without city wall as the war prevent? 4, Very easy to think, in the Chinese history which emperor is willing to let oneself wife reveal her breast to sway all day under the minister's eyelid? Didn't he abstain from his ministers produces evil thought to the empress? Why most Chinese emperors always have that many court eunuch? he fears that palace man have irregular to his empress or imperials.If the empress is sick, the imperial physicians all only can account number arteries outside curtain, Cannot see including empress's face. Obviously emperor consider oneself wife is a best the beauty woman in nation, that can let other people see empress at will and easy? This is another simple common sense. No controversy .So "curse of the gold flower " make a joke to the foreigner.Update Jan.15th.2007 If conceives to draw off this movie magnificent scene, the clothing and reveal the breasts in the lens, we can see how it is a withered movie! Any content does not have.The Chinese women bare half of the breasts with their small toes binding under? In ancient of china, are there such women? Ha ha!

		<shortDescription>Zhang's hidden critic on China?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go to the official website and look at "Behind the Scenes Pt1", Zhang said it himself: "Gold and jade on the outside rot and decay on the inside"Kind of reminds me of China today. Looking at the surface, this film seems to say "Look at how great China was and, since we are making this film in this day and age, still is" And we need only to hear of Shanghai to conjure up images of amazing modern progress.But the story is about the decay underneath the surface. Everybody knows that the Chinese government has serious problems with graft. Zhang goes on to say "the regime was corrupt"Zhang went on further to add that it's a critic on the feudal system. A "reflection of feudalism in China", where the father is absolute authority. Absolute authority from the people in charge? That applies to China today still.Perhaps to protect himself, he adds with an awkward laugh "of course I'm talking about the past." Now why would one need to emphasize that if this really doesn't apply today? If an American should talk about America's history with slaves, he doesn't have to emphasize "of course it's in the past." Because however conservative some Americans are, slaves ARE a thing of the past. But corruption, feudal absolute authority? I don't see what's changed. And I suspect, Zhang sees it that way as well. The awkward laugh seems to say, "of course I can't be saying this about the current regime, and you know I HAVE to make this clear." The awkward laugh is his "wink wink".Zhang is amazingly smart enough to package this so that most people will just take it for its pure entertainment value, its visuals, action, etc. The government probably even financed it. It's the greatest trick an artist can do, that is to criticize someone and yet that someone happily accepts it and even foots the bill. But the sad thing is, and that is an additional layer of irony to it all, how most Chinese viewers, and overseas audiences as well, are not going to get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarantino could probably provide more contemporary celluloid examples, but the closest I can come to the plot of this elaborate epic of vicious royal conflict outside the world of Greek tragedy is the Jacobean revenge plays. And it's got the poisoning that was all the rage in those days, as well as incest. Nothing too complicated, really. An emperor (Chow Yun-fat) of the later Tang Dynasty (tenth century A.D.) is slowly killing his current consort (Gong Li), through a royal doctor whose wife Jiang Shi (Chen Jin), unbeknownst to him, is an old mistress of his and the mother of one of three possible heirs to the throne, Crown Prince Wan (Liu Ye), who is unwittingly having an affair with his step-sister, the doctor's daughter Chan (Li Man), and has knowingly been the lover of his stepmother, the empress. You could say things are rather inbred in the Forbidden City. The empress, who suspects the hourly herbal teas to treat an "illness" are slowly killing her (and turning her into a "cretin"), is preparing a surprise to coincide with the oncoming Chong Yang Festival celebrating golden chrysanthemums. As the overwrought action draws to a climax one of the sons lays siege to the palace with a large army garbed in gold and embroidered chrysanthemum images, and a third son reveals another surprise: he doesn't like anybody and wants to become emperor, now. Fields of flowers are drenched in blood before it's all over, and digital armies have clashed by night, with hordes of red- or black-garbed ninjas flying down from on high to capture individual royal rebels.This grandiose affair is not without notable performances and wonderful looking people, chief among them Gong Li, whose outsize emotions are worthy of a Greek tragedy ? except that Medea didn't have six-inch-long elaborately painted fingernails. Gong's face is mesmerizing to look at. Prince Jai (Jay Chou) looks fabulous and sexy in a war helmet. John Woo favorite gangster/cop hero of the Eighties Chow Yun-fat manages to be both appealing and scary as the emperor and Li Man as the taboo girlfriend is just the prettiest thing you've ever seen. Why doesn't it work better? I think back to the pleasure provided by House of Flying Daggers and I believe the difference lies in the claustrophobic nature of this story, most of which takes place inside a garish recreation of the palace that looks like a very, very expensive jukebox. There's just too much material here crammed into too confined a space with ornamental violence that seems too unrelated to the central core of royal machinations. I suppose these older-generation Chinese epics are the equivalent of popular folk art ? except they don't come from the people but from an increasingly international-focused film industry whose creations are neither culturally authentic nor emotionally convincing.This is also a very nasty story. It's demoralizing to find a royal family whose members are all out to get each other. But if we got to look in on that in emotionally valid terms ? if some time was taken to develop the feelings and conflicts instead of constantly interrupting them with kung-fu action or vast scenes of concubines all with identical cleavages, or ninjas spinning around with curved weapons in the air ? the nastiness might develop some conviction. As it is, this is a spectacle that seems both ugly and hollow at the core. Anyone who is seriously pleased by this may not be paying much attention to what they're seeing. Sure, as a spectacle it's frequently eye-popping. But its pretense at content is superficial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Zhang Yimou's film in past 10 years!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film yesterday at its premiere festival on Dec 14 2006 and I'm so excited for it, I believe it's the best Zhang Yimou's film in past 10 years! The film's title gives a clear hint at the chosen color palette. Gold is the tone throughout the picture. The armor is a triumph in costume design. The suits and helmets made for Jay Chou, who plays the prince, are gold-plated. Chrysanthemum patterns and ornaments can be seen throughout the film, in the furnishings and costumes - this golden flower is a symbol of rebellion in the film.The film is roughly adapted from "Thunderstorm" - the best drama of China writer Cao Yu but the story is set in a period after Tang Dynasty - about 1000 years ago. Gong Li(Empress) and Chou Yun-fat(Emperor) provided their excellent performance in the film, and also I love Jay Chou (the Prince Jie) in this film.Comparing with other Zhang Yimou's films such as "Hero", "House of Flying Daggers", we can see the breakthrough from this film: the picture and the photography are still perfect, but this time, the film tells us an excellent story (of course part of contributions are from drama "Thunderstorm"). And the other reason for me to vote 10 point to this film is the performance from the cast ? Chou Yun-fat, Gong Li, Jay Chou &amp; Liu Ye ? this group is nearly the strongest player team in China.I loved that it surprised me in how it ended, an ending that moved me to tears when Jay Chou began to sing the theme song "Golden Flowerbed" . This is a film I would love to own and watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't expect to get carried away by the story here. As usual with Zhang Yimou, you get a drama without much of a point. Just people running around being unhappy and committing suicide or killing someone else.The story serves only as the setting for the film, and although the movie (slowly) moves to a conclusion, it ends without resolving much of what happens and the watcher is left to interpret the ending to the rather uninspiring fragment of a story.Beautifully filmed as usual with Zhang Yimou, but the movie itself was about as filling as a large helping of hot air. If you like Zhang Yimou and want something with even less of a story than Hero and House of Flying Daggers, then this is the movie for you. If either of those movies felt less than perfect to you, or you want something more like Ang Lee's movies my recommendation is to stay clear of this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The positives: This movie is visually stunning. The fight scenes use creativity that will amaze seasoned action-movie viewers. You will feast on the sword fight between emperor and son, small group battles and army against army. Vibrant colors and spectacular sets fill the screen through out the entire movie. The acting is well done and believable. So what is so bad about this foreign movie besides having to read the English subtitles the whole time? While pleasing to the eye and to the heart of adrenaline junkies who feed on martial arts action; the movie has almost zero moral value. Few of the major characters display qualities of virtue, or moral uprightness. This is not a movie of good verses evil, but of evil verses evil. Treachery and betrayal seem to be the theme of this story and are portrayed in the most sacred relationships. In my opinion a good movie promotes something of value or at least sends you home in a good mood. If you like feel-good movies or at least one with a positive message, "The Curse of the Golden Flower" is not for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one who did the English subtitles for this Chinese movie should have his balls ripped off and feed to the goats. Kidding aside, the subtitle's font are all white with no black to contrast it with the light hues prevalent in the movie. With 90% of the movie comprised of talking heads, all I get is a headache trying to follow the dialogue. Most expensive Chinese movie indeed, what a waste. By the way, I've watched it in a cinema in the Philippines.I don't understand the story much because of the stupid subtitle problem. What I gather from watching all the pretty pictures is that the plot is about a dysfunctional royal family. The power struggle between the Emperor (Chow Yun Fat) and the Empress (Gong Li) is quite convoluted but is expected in this kind of narrative. The cast all gave good performance but the acting of Gong Li is above par.Directed by Zhang Yimou, the one who handled one of my favorite film, Hero, still shows that he's the deal when it comes to sweeping cinematography. The sets and costumes are elaborate, the palette's rich. You have to see the interior and exterior of the imperial palace to see what I mean. Martial arts sequences are very much toned down, as compared to Hero, so if you're expecting this kind of fare you'll be disappointed. The director makes up for it during the last part of the movie when the armies of the different players clashed. You'll be amazed by the sheer number of extras and I don't think there's not much computer generated effects used here.Good movie but very much marred by ONE MAJOR technical issue in production. Maybe I should see it again when it comes out on DVD to read a better subtitle and appreciate it more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make no mistake, Zhang Yimou's ("House of Flying Daggers") latest movie has some of the most beautiful set and costume design that you will see on screen this year. It's a sumptuous feast for the eyes.But it's also a poor excuse for dramatic film-making. The plot is convoluted and relationships between characters murky, making the task of keeping up with who is backstabbing whom needlessly complicated. The film grinds on towards its inevitable conclusion which much like the director's "Hero" ends in a way surely to be unsatisfactory to Western audiences. It all boils down to very expensive, lush agitprop.But at least "Hero" had verve and fantastic fight scenes. "Flower" feels more like a stiff exercise and the fight scenes so clearly augmented by CGI as to lose suspense. Like the recent "Star Wars" episodes and both "Matrix" sequels, the CGI-heavy action scenes betray any sense of reality, making the fight scenes consequence-free. The multitudes of faceless soldiers squaring off against one another look artificial so we fail to invest in their fate. Who cares if another amalgam of pixels is deleted from the green screen."Curse" is a slog that's a poor imitation of the director's own work and other recent epic wire-fu imports. The movie, however, will make a perfect film to demonstrate home entertainment systems. The film's rich palette and epic bombast is gonna help move widescreen plasmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is not so good. I agree with the one of the authors that this is the worst movie from Zhang.The story is not Understandable. I should give an F to the story and A- for the outstanding Special Effect and E for Jay Chou Acting and an A for Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li. They act very wellOverall the rating is D. Too bad for the movie. I appreciate also the original soundtrack music not the ending music which was horrible to me.The composer for the music for the movie is great but not the main theme called "Ju De Hua" which sound awefull to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, curse you, Crouching Tiger. Your excellence and grace kicked open the doors to finer Hong Kong cinema in the US for many of us, creating an audience for intelligent, well-done films from a foreign culture whose timeless storytelling would appeal to anyone ? even jaded Americans. And for the past six years, we've been thrashing ourselves to get to the theaters to see most of your new releases, at least the more heavily promoted ones, to see if there would be another such film to greet us. Most of them fell noticeably short, and the closest, House of Flying Daggers, while strong, wasn't in the same league. But Curse had everything going for it in the trailers, even the presence of Tiger's lead, Chow-Yun Fat. So there was reason to hope.Perhaps comparisons are unfair; maybe comparing other HK period pieces to Crouching Tiger is like comparing current dramas to Citizen Kane. But the fact remains that for many of us, Tiger is a benchmark, albeit a high one, and the hope remains that we'll once again see such an enchanting and absorbing film.Curse follows the personal lives of the Emperor of China (Chow Yun-Fat), and his wife (Gong Li) and their three sons as they struggle against one another in palace intrigue. At first I was reminded of The Lion in Winter, which starts with the same premise, but Curse quickly moves away from that film (sadly). There's all sorts of intrigue: the Empress is having an affair with her step-son; the Emperor is trying to poison his wife slowly; the sons jockey for position to be next in line for the throne; and so on. Everyone has their secrets, everyone has an agenda, and they're all playing for power.So, Chinese Shakespeare, right? No. More like Chinese opera, because everything in Curse is blown up huge, from the costumes to the emotions to the sets to, well, everything. Curse never once tries for realism, instead immediately depositing us in a gaudy fantasy world where everything is super-technicolor, from the sumptuous robes to the brilliant colored walls to, well, everything. At first the lushness of setting is intriguing, but after a while it's the visual equivalent of a seven-course meal comprised of nothing but candy. You want to scream enough already! By the time we reach the final action sequence, it's more than you can bear.The acting is expansive, but I'm betting that's by design (you'd almost have to go over the top if you wanted to compete with all that scenery). Chow Yun-Fat plays it slyly villainous, and Gong Li cannot help but elicit your sympathies as the ill-fated Empress. But it's all in wide, wide brushstrokes, as if the audience all sat very far away and could barely see the action. When we reach the climax of the story ? a long, drawn out, hyperbolic battle scene ? we're on overload, from too much scenery, too much frenetic action, and too much emotion; you're simply glad the movie's ended, it's so exhausting. Even more disappointing to western audiences, the movie has an unsatisfying conclusion, at least to our tastes in drama.To me, this movie wasn't as bad as Jet Li's Hero, with which it shared a great many flaws, mostly because something actually happens here (that, and I've always disliked Rashomon copies, as the original is pretty overrated). But it was in most ways a pretty big letdown. Maybe some cultural messages simply don't translate, or maybe, like I said at the top, the quest for the next Crouching Tiger simply got in the way. In any case I left the theater disappointed that this movie wasn't more, and in some cases less, than it was; maybe on DVD the over-ripeness will be toned down, but somehow I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is as slow as it is pretty, or you can reverse that. Either way: it's gorgeous with brilliant colors that are eye-popping. It's also one of the more boring stories I've ever seen and I defy most people to sit down and watch this all the way through and not be bored out of their minds despite the wonderful visuals.This turned out to be a soap opera, with a little bit of swordplay here and there.....mostly there, meaning the second half of the film. By then, most people -- at least us Westerners - were sound asleep or had taken the DVD out of their player. Gee, they are even starting to show us dysfunctional families in Chinese films. I like Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li. Most people who like Asian films, which include me, like them, too, but that didn't make this film any more interesting.One other thing: whoever was responsible for the English subtitles ought to be shot. I played this in Chinese with English subtitles and in dubbed English with the subtitles also on. The latter is what stunned me in that I have never seen so many sentences different from what was being said on screen. Sometimes it was educational. I got two translations of the same sentence, but it got ridiculous and added to already confusing storyline.This is wonderful stuff on the surface: real eye candy, but the story sucks. I am starting to lose my faith in film director Yimou Zhang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Empty Spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know the cliché about eating Chinese food: You get full fast but feel empty an hour later? Well, I felt empty about 20 minutes into this awful movie. Truly, this is the worst film I've seen by a so-called fifth-generation Chinese director, let alone someone of Zhang Yimou's stature."COTGF" feels emblematic of the materialistic excesses Chinese society is currently experiencing. The director thickly laid on the glitz and the bling with a trowel, to the point where the viewers were simply overwhelmed with all the oppressive opulence. The literally over-the-top costumes (Gong Li's tightly corseted breast should score an Oscar nod for a "supporting" role) and sets served only to underscore the lack of direction, acting skills, and storytelling.Characters came and went endlessly for no apparent purpose through palace corridors and rooms that looked like a bag of multi-color Popsicles had exploded in them. The story itself was just a thinly veiled rip-off of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth." The actors, especially Liu Ye, the actor who played the Crown Prince, were left looking amateurish and ridiculous when they resorted to facial histrionics to convey emotions. (The audience I was in actually laughed out loud at Liu Ye's death scene.) A number of scenes were announced with the ever-present and irritatingly ominous music as if they were very important, only to have the audience go, "Huh, is that all there is?" when the scenes ended. The martial-arts sequences were laughably staged and a far cry from the mastery of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." On top of that, the director relied too much on computer-generated special effects to fill out the screen during battle scenes. The special effects were obviously fake to a jaded audience who is used to much better CGI visuals in other movies.All this is very disappointing to see in a director who made such stunning films as "Raise the Red Lantern," "Ju Dou," and "To Live." Those films had startling visuals too, but they weren't meant to supplant the heart of any film, a story. It's as if Zhang had lost his way starting with the mediocre "Hero," where he overemphasized his painterly use of colors to the detriment of storytelling, which is, first and foremost, a director's responsibility. It's as if he felt he has to bludgeon his audience on the head with bloated, grand, operatic extravaganzas to entertain them, in the absence of true humanity, something he expressed so well in the magnificent "To Live." I can only hope that he'll find his connection to the human condition again, perhaps in smaller films in the future. When will prominent Chinese directors realize that "going Hollywood" will eventually rob them of the very qualities that made their films so special in the first place?Finally, if you're a fan of the great Gong Li, look for her in "To Live." She was poignantly subtle, completely natural, and heartbreaking in it - at the peak of her acting powers - unlike her unfortunate breast-heaving performance in "COTGF." However, I would lay the blame squarely at Zhang Yimou's door, as the director, for this overblown dreck of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hour Too Long!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a long time Zhang Yimo fan. In fact, it's been so long that I no longer remember why I still drag myself to the theater to watch his movies. I keep being disappointed yet I keep going, hoping that some day he would again deliver the magic of cinema like he did many many years ago in his creative prime.Unfortunately, the guy is in a rut of which he can't seem to be able to get out. Every film he makes is basically of the same style - he strives to engage you with breath-taking photography in order to compensate the simply plot.What makes an artist great is the ability to transform and become even greater. Not Zhang. His faith in his formula is so insurmountable that he keeps using it to cut all his "cookies" year after year. And to keep the gullible audience coming back time and time again, the budget for his movies is getting bigger and bigger.This film was in extreme excess of all things - the acting, the richness of brilliant colors, the rampant out-of-control emotions, the ample jiggly breasts, extravagant costumes, the huge army of extras, and yes, the violence! yet it left me empty at the end wondering why I went to see it in the first place. It must have been my brand name loyalty and the masterfully edited commercial on TV.Zhang Yimo, you really need to get over yourself before you can become truly a great director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Family quarrels are bitter things. They don't go according to any rules. They're not like aches or wounds; they're more like splits in the skin that won't heal because there's not enough material." F. Scott FitzgeraldIf you want a cinematic definition of "melodrama," then use Curse of the Golden Flower, Zhang Yimou's colorful family drama dominated by the color of red blood, heavily influenced by Shakespeare's tragedies such as Hamlet, Macbeth, and Othello, and decidedly over-the-top with incest and revenge.Emperor Ping (Chow Yun-Fat) is slowly poisoning Empress Phoenix (Gong Li), who is having an affair with her stepson, Prince Jie (Jay Chou). And that's for starters because real incest rears an ugly head while the children struggle over the issue of who will become the heir. The emphasis on family politics takes the usually visual director into a soap opera world where just keeping track of the miscreants takes emphasis away from his usual flourishes with gymnastic fighting and unforgettable costuming.To put it in perspective, Yimou is far superior to Shakespeare in staging, but centuries apart when it comes to character and dialogue, where the Bard has no equal, although he might have admired Yimou's ability to sustain an audience with little dialogue and a high degree of fancy. If you expect Crouching Tiger aerial acrobatics, there's some, but little by comparison in the drama-driven Curse. It lacks the verbal athleticism of Shakespeare's tragedies, relying as it does on operatic flourishes of emotion and second-rate TV afternoon theatrics that rely on sustained shots of actors frozen in mechanical response until after the commercial. Or maybe even Jerry Springer combatants sparring.Because it's been more than a decade since Yimou worked with his former lover Gong Li, Asian cinema aficionados will welcome the reunion. Unfortunately the director allows her to overact in too many scenes. However, her passion for her stepson, dolt that he is, is never established, just claimed, so in the moments they are together, it is much easier to see them as mother and son, not lovers. Chow Yun-Fat has a curious role that allows him to be mean-spirited without being hated by the audience, a change for him from the one-dimensional benign heroes he usually plays.Curse of the Yellow Flower is a melodramatic spectacle to be enjoyed for its grand colors, grand armies, and grand emotions. Leave the rest to Bill Shakespeare.</fullReview>

I was so let down by the end of the movie and would not watch it again.

Since she knew Wan told the emperor, why would she still carry on with the doomed plan? The emperor is mad. If he want to kill her, just do it. Why poison her slowly? Some more he kills his own sons. 2. The anachronistic plot. Since when do people dress in gold armour and fight? Gold is too soft, and in that period, people wear chain mail, not gold. 3. The stupid costumes. Zhang Yi Mou is a disgusting director, he purposely make the women dress so revealingly. moreover, the palace looks ugly and gaudy, what with people banging on gongs every hour, and people can barge around each other's rooms, no doors but hangings, sauna baths for the king which hasn't been invented, fireworks (only invented 100 years later), really narrow palace corridors, and the servants who just clean up all the dead bodies like this happens everyday? 4. the acting. Gong Li can't act, she is just there for the eye candy. Nor can Jay Chou act, he is not even eye candy. Wan looks like a retard, Chan like a slut, Jiang similar to a tortoise, Yu is a teacher's pet teenager. 5. Zhang Yi Mou just make this a stereotypical presentation of ancient Chinese. You should never watch any Zhang Yi Mou film again. 6. The music is horrible. Especially Jay's "singing". The chorus song is weird, China has no choral singing, it only has opera. Even though it is not bad, you can't even hear the words.</fullReview>

No wonder the queen couldn't even breath properly and felt dizzy all the time. The King would simply killed her by passing a law saying, push the dress size back a little, so the old xsmall is the new small."even though the previous two movies' plots had received uncountable harsh critics, but one thing was undeniable, the images that was presenting to the viewers' eyes were just satisfying.But this time, i feel my eyes were murdered by the use of colors in this movie. the entire drama looked like photoshop just vomited on it before it got released.and i will not comment on the plot...thank you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>high drama, of a red guard era legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zhang Yimou was right about himself, he only knew something about China. Maybe it was just a post-revolution/post-colonial China because he could not even tell a story about a "generic" China: In Hero he threw some Chinese cultural symbols together and tried to feed the world that stew, or just collage, as China (to rival Ang Li's well-digested and portrayed conflicts between Chinese philosophies in CTHD). Beyond that he's in control of nothing. He is so desperate on his way to master-hood, but his way of movie-making is just going to render him a half-cooked decoy.A professor in Beijing Hao Jian said Zhang had always been revealing an addiction to the collective unconsciousness of the cultural-revolution generation. He used to make movies based on some good stories about the post-colonial, revolutionary, or post-revolutionary attrition to the Chinese society. He or the generation he represented went through all those but could not grow beyond that. When the suppressed anger had been let out, trauma been told with a succession of international recognition, Zhang is now left with nothing much besides his constant pursuit of FORM, which has been translated to the Zhang-styled pretty and eye-popping-ness, his detailed imaginations of fabricated rituals, and the dwindling of individuals commensurate with the growing size of budget.Professor Hao mentioned this and I totally agree: There is no escaping from things such as imperial rituals or authority worship for Zhang's generation, even though they started as cultural rebels against the system to start with. When finally and comfortably accepted and incorporated not just by the film industry but also the nationalist frame set, they resorted to the kind of discourse they knew and learned about story-telling when they were young in a red guard age. In a Chinese writing class 2 or 3 decades ago, kids were given topics, a central idea to be plugged in,told how to paragraph, and went on with fabrication with a recognized "safe" boundary.Maybe only successful film directors are privileged to live in their puberty dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In coming to this film i had expected more, or at the least to be entertained. To be honest, not even the action scenes or choreography for them saved this film.Usually, that could be a saving grace for any ancient-based eastern film, however it was not the case here. If there were any great lengths of action, they were ruined by poor, choppy close-ups and overly flash 'dramatic' lighting effects. While this tried to serve Jay Chou's character well towards the end of the film, making up for a possible lack of martial arts ability, the rest of the epic battles lacked thrill or wonder.Mid way through the film, i began thinking "Will this film pick up the pace?", and "Is it the quiet before the storm?", it was neither. The movie didn't go anywhere. There was tension amongst the family sure, and shocking themes like incest and treason, but this failed to climax appropriately or culminate anything of real value.The credits rose, and i sat there with my dear girl puzzled and asking what on earth was that. The highlights that merit the one star (apart from i couldn't give it a 0), was the performances of Yun-Fat Chow and Jay Chou. Both of them added some depth and flavour, along with the beautifully coloured backdrops and costumes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curse That (Does Not) Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Zhang Yimou decided to attempt trying the 3rd time on a martial-art based film after his critically acclaimed Riding Alone For a Thousand Miles, he named the film The Curse of the Golden Flower.Based on Chinese author Cao Yu's classic literature Thunderstorm, The Curse of the Golden Flower is a replica of Thunderstorm. Thunderstorm depicts a wealthy businessman and his affair with his ex-lover and wife that has go terribly wrong, where his children were implicated in the storm in a Shanghainese household in the 30's. Now, Zhang has brought the whole family to the imperial family in the Tang Dynasty. Chow Yun Fatt is the businessman that turns the Emperor, Gong Li is the wife that becomes the Empress, Jay Chou is the son which Gong Li is his mother, and Liu Ye is the eldest son whose mother was his husband's ex-lover. And what is the Golden Flower? It's tonnes of chrysanthemums grown in the palace.Spare all details on the story line, and we will see why the curse works, but at some point, it doesn't work. 1st of all, Zhang is going back to the same old way of using visual, or rather, colors, to earn the heart of the audience. Almost every scene in the film appears to be too colorful. From the decorations and colors used to paint the palace, it appears more like a piece of artwork created by a A+ art student for his final year project. This somehow, doesn't blend well with a martial-art based movie.2nd, Zhang is repeating the effects from Hero and House of Flying Daggers. This has somehow proved that Zhang wants to commit back the mistakes made in a martial-art based film: CGI effects are a big no-no. Apparently, he has not learned from his mistakes, and he has not seen the mistakes committed by his fellow movie director, Chen Kaige in The Promise (Wu Ji).3rd, Chow, Gong and Liu saves the movie from great failure. Chow and Gong, who are both veteran actor/actress, displays their perfect fine acting skills accumulated for years onto The Curse. Gong, being Zhang's muse in the previous decade before turning to Zhang Ziyi, has proved to be the right choice for the role of the Empress. Seeing Gong playing the Empress is just a combination of her role of Hatsumomo in Rob Marshall's Memoirs of a Geisha and the despaired wife in Ju Dou. Chow's Mandarin may not be well spoken, but his fine acting skills that he brought along with him for the past years has saved the movie from failing. Liu, who was one of the rare young talented actor, was given a bigger opportunity to explore his role compared to his role in The Promise.4th. Jay Chou. I am not pin-pointing at Asia's hottest celebrity. The Taiwanese born singer meets the criteria of acting in a movie, and he excels in his recent box-office hit Initial D. However, he wanted to brought his current look of leaving some beard into Tang dynasty. Apparently, this doesn't work. This makes Jay stands out among his co-actor, which makes him look odd.5th. Ending. Hero's ending was straight and direct, and it was excepted. Thus the movie goes straight to the point without much delay. House of Flying Dagger, on the other hand, ends with a pretty ridiculous ending that a martial-art based films should not have. To make the ending more beautiful, the films ends with credits rolling along with an English soprano. English soprano in a Chinese sword fighting film ??? The effects are imaginable. The Curse, however, did not end exactly the way how Hero and House ended. Zhang wants the ending to end the way he did for his art-house flicks.Though The Curse might comes with tonnes of flaws, but it did has some point that is worth mentioning. Zhang gives Thunderstorm a new life, where it shows us something that has never happened in the history of the Emperors of China before. The duration was just right, where the story hits directly to the point without excessive details.The Curse works much more better than Hero and House. But maybe Zhang should work on more critically acclaimed art-house dramas than making more martial-art based films. People would want to remember Zhang as a man who created tonnes of critically acclaimed art-house where it will be discussed for years, not some crappy martial-art based movies that becomes a mockery.</fullReview>

My wife and I spent the entire way home from the theater talking about new words to describe how bad it was. 'Vomitrocious' was her best one.OK, first and most importantly, the story sucked. There's not one bit of it you really care about. I mean, if the director was trying to make an Altman type film where they do every little detail of what actually happened and tried to put it all in your face for you to examine, then fine. Yes, maybe they did things that way. I still don't care unless there's a story there. I didn't go to this movie (after seeing Hero and House), wanting to see a historical documentary. The only redeeming quality of the film was that it kept you awake with the odd epic-type music coming in and out at random, and with the jarring tie-die colors splashed here and there. And at the end of it all - who are you supposed to feel for? The Emperor? The Empress? The denied lovers? The Prince? You don't care for anyone - but yourself. You'll wish you'd never seen it. The piece falls flat. I figured "ok, we'll get to the interesting part soon now". And it almost - almost - got better. But then, as the gratuitous violence took over (overwhelmingly), the film just became excrementally worse. Things just happen for no reason - people's loyalties are done in broad strokes, and the violence (excuse me, the *pointless* violence) was overwhelming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a great disappointment from director Zhang Yimou. The plot, which I won't bother to describe here, plays out like a Greek tragedy. However, by the third act, the script, acting and staging become so overwrought that the film descends into camp. Much has been said about the film's colorful visual style. Nothing from "Curse" was not done to greater effect in Yimou's earlier "Hero." Ultimately, the film bears comparison to the so-bad-it's-good 1980 film version of "Flash Gordon." Both are films are filled with incredibly colorful sets and costumes, a villain who literally twirls his goatee, scantily clad females and a lot of scenery-chewing by screen legends who have done much better work elsewhere.The Taiwanese pop idol Jay Chou, who tends to be inexpressive in his music videos, is merely adequate here. Chou's love of martial arts serves him well in the action scenes. But Chou is completely blown off the screen whenever he shares a scene with either Gong Li or Chow-Yun Fat.On the positive side, the visuals are impressive at times, and the film doesn't have the pro-government tyranny propaganda found in "Hero." And of course, Gong Li and Man Li look stunning in their low-cut costumes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am now leery what Zhang will do to the Beijing Olympic's show. He is getting worse in the art of telling stories with film material. Curse of the Golden Flower is a joke. There is no believable emotions in any of the actors, and the action is fake. The color is ridiculous and the story is illogical. I hope this movie will not represent China because this does not even match up to Kung Fu Hustle of 2005. Zhang should return to make movies of small budget, like Not One Less, Road Home etc. Even Hero is not as good as his first historical drama:The Great Conqueror's Concubine.At least, Zhang is not pretending he is making another martial arts movie. In the epic fighting scene of Lords of the Ring ,part 1, it is believable. But Zhang rather copies from Matrix, part III, his special CG doesn't know how to generate random motion, and therefore everything is happening predictable and fake.He also copies from The Fall Of The Roman Empire in creating the last battle.The only good acting is the Liu, who plays Prince Wen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Curse of the Golden Flower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zhang Yimou is desperate. Desperate for that elusive Oscar. In his third attempt to lift that statuette, he has stuck to the martial arts genre, still deciding to go headlong since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon's (CTHD) win. For his previous attempts, he has utilized CTHD star Ziyi Zhang in both Hero and House of Flying Daggers (HFD), and had resorted to casting big Asian stars like Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, all of whom are known actors to the West, and the likes of Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro. Here, he dug deeper, and went to snag CTHD star, and another recognizable face Chow Yun-Fat, as well as ditching Ziyi Zhang for his original muse, Gong Li, in roles fit for royalty.Well actually, they are royalty in this Shakespearean inspired tragedy. Or should I call it comedy. The family of Chow as Emperor, Gong as Empress, and royal princes played by Jay Chou, Qin Junjie and Liu Ye, are as dysfunctional as can be. They scheme, they plot, they fight, they switch loyalties, they have deep dark secrets and huge skeletons in their closets. They have complex relationship problems of the paternal, maternal, brotherly, and you can probably name every issue from incest to heterosexual sex, they're all in it. These folks know how to love, but for all the wrong reasons, and in all the wrong ways.Someone should remind Zhang Yimou that story is key. Seducing audiences with costumes that show twin peaks, peekaboo moments, and having grand sets and massive foot soldiers running around, just can't cover up the lack of a strong story, and it lapsed into convenience of wrapping it up ala HFD with nonsensical, implausible (maybe it's possible but I doubt) plot elements. If you thought having HFD's extremely quick transition of the seasons bad, wait till you get a load of this, and its loopholes (like one dealing with travelling time) stuck out like a sore thumb.If you're expecting cool martial arts swordsplay, then I'm sorry, look elsewhere. The fights are few and far between, and nothing spectacular. Other than relying heavily on CG trickery, the fights are short of exciting, save for the first showdown at the beginning of the movie. It all went downhill after that, except for one scene where a funky weapon was wielded by one character. It brought back the memories of old Shaw Brothers martial arts flick where combatants wield the most interesting weapons like clubs and rakes, but this one takes the cake! True to the theme, it's in gold too!Despite its convoluted plot, which credit though, makes itself clear as the movie progressed, the actors are probably sleepwalking through their roles. Chow had little to do except be nasty (and surprisingly, little screen time!), Gong had to break out in sweat from her tight tube top, Jay looked extremely lost, while Liu Ye who played the Crown Prince, was portrayed as one horny bastard. The sets, while beautiful at first, gets tiresome after a while, especially the psychedelic palace decor which really will get to your nerves.This is truly a wannabe Banquet gone stale, and one wonders how much those gold plated stuff, if they're real, could have fetched on the market to make up for lost box office revenue once word gets out that it leaves a bad aftertaste. If there's any consolation, at least it's better than Chen Kaige's The Promise, and there's a scene here which is finger lickin' good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curse of the movie viewer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how to say about this movie other than "very bad"! It not only makes no sense but also a waste of money and time to produce this movie. What was Chang Yi-Mo thinking? I have no doubt that he has talent but I don't think he knows his limit. There are so many techniques he used in this movie are copied from other movies but only worse. I just don't know how to say it but it seems like he can only do "copy and paste".I feel so bad for Chow Ren-Fat... He performed so good as he did in "Crouching tiger hidden dragon". He is a real talent actor even in a bad movie like this. You can tell he put up a lot for this and tried so hard to express the role of the emperor.Gong-Li performed moderately. Jay Chou is a wash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is really a curse to all Chinese movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Zhang was once the best director in China. His movies were leading the trend and had good story to tell. Unfortunately, his several movies in recent years were all bad except production cost! A movie, finally, is a way to tell story or stories. A movie without storytelling can only be called video-graphy or simply garbage. Originally, The Curse of Golden Flower was adopted from one of the few famous masterpieces of Chinese writer Cao, Yu. Cao's initial play set to happen in 30s of China, where new and old idea conflict to each other, where ugly and dirty custom were replaced by more advanced, western influenced ones. It was really a good play to discover what's between people's deepest minds.As director Zhang used the good movie to make his famous good looking but nonsense movie, it is really a pity to see how Chinese movie overall deteriorated from story telling into money hole. If you ever watch this movie, what you will remember is the yellow color and bloodshed. Maybe the less dressing of the actresses could be another one, which shows how bad Zhang's taste has become.It is amazing also, that Zhang can make a once famous story a total mess. Even for those who were familiar with original play can't tell what's going on.All in all, the worst movie of Zhang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Communist View Of Monarchy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, Yimou's frames of the interiors of the Forbidden City could be blown up into paintings. He reaches his apex here visually; I have all his other movies but this is unparalleled in its beauty. The multi-colored opulence is again paired with moral depravity as we saw in Shanghai Triad and Raise The Red Lantern. I know the plot seems a bit recondite; it is easily unraveled for you. If I asked Mao to make a movie about the Tudors of England what would his delineation of feudal monarchy look like? Well, exactly like this: corrupt, evil, incestuous reprobates who are the moral inverse of their surroundings just as Tang, the Triad monster, was the moral opposite of his gilded home guarded by a faceless army of goons in Shanghai Triad. When you first watch this, you will sympathize with the Empress. Upon repeated viewings, you will notice she has seduced her step-son the Crown Prince to his disgrace and disfavor of the emperor. Jai, her real son and favorite, has been sent away in disgrace and is just returning at the beginning of the movie. His offense was trying to 'take things not given to him' as the emperor says. The emperor has retaliated by surreptitiously poisoning her with her hourly 'nerve medicine' of which she must consume every single drop. The doctor and his new wife, the real birth mother of the Crown Prince, are the only people with knowledge of the emperor's nefarious deed. Suffice to say, without further explication, the only moral characters are the doctor's wife and daughter, other than that every single character is a moral reprobate. The empress carefully withholds information from Jai, using his knowledge of the poisoning to enlist his support in her upcoming chrysanthemum rebellion. Notice, she says she will tell him all AFTER the rebellion. To understand what you are watching you must remember that, while China is modernizing, they still are a communist country. Yimou, a visual genius, has this moral inversion in all of his movies: Ostentation with moral depravity. To his credit: in To Live, he shows, at the very end, the young girls made surgeons killing patients due to their medical ignorance. This was part of Mao's idiocy of anti-intellectualism where he removed intellectuals and replaced them with peasants. The 'Great Leap Forward' is accurate if you mean off the side of a cliff suicidally. Here, even the tiny youngest son impales the Crown Prince and attempts to assassinate the emperor in front of everyone during the festival. He looks to be all of twelve years old. Look, I own the movie for its aesthetic beauty which has no equal in any film I have ever seen. Yet, thematically, the characters are all monochromatic cartoon characters of pure evil. Human beings simply are not like this; they are both Light and Night. Whenever you see characters this simply rendered, rest assured, an ideology is being pushed. Yes, all human forms of government are corrupt as are all human institutions. I might add that this generalization also applies to Communism. Yimou's movie To Live proves he is not a blind ideologue. Yet, here, my main objection to the movie is not the over the top CGI at the end with silly numbers of soldiers. No, who do I care about here? The corrupt emperor poisoning his wife? The scheming empress who, failing to grab the throne through the Crown Prince, has moved on to her Machivellian manipulations of Jai by hiding her actions from him? The tiny, youngest son who is a murderous, scheming maniac? One good rule of thumb is that ideology, when it does history antithetical to its precepts, delineates only its opposition in contravention of any scintilla of reality.Yes, I own the move, I adore Zhang Yimou. I even own that awful Noodle Shop remake of Blood Simple. If you love aesthetically stunning movies, buy this film. Truthfully, Yimou must live in China and 'render unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar;' I am not naive about the pressures on him. Trust me readers, villains come in all ideologies across every possible delineation. You still should view it at least once to see beauty like you have never seen before in a motion picture. For me, I would gladly serve Emperor Ping rather than Mao-Tse-Tung who killed tens of millions of Chinese in his purges disguised as 'Cultural Revolutions.' To me, Yimou's other movies made him a legend that will endure as long as movies exist. Q.E.D. "He Who Controls The Past Controls The Future." George Orwell From 1984</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are an American, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. You might say that I didn't get the movie...no no, I understood the movie and I still say it sucked. Heres why:-The movie moves very slowly, 2 hours to get to the meat of the story. -Majority of the movie is intrigue, I don't think that fits well with the idea of a movie, cause movies are suppose to show things -Not enough kung fu, there's was a good bit of action in the second half, but you'd be better off watching an ACTUAL martial arts movie. Although the assassins and the King were pretty badass, I'll give him that. -No ending, you'll be stunned when you see the credits begin to roll, you won't be expecting it, you'll have too many questions -Family is just a little too messed up (sarcasm on the little) -It wasn't pretty, it showed 3 places, a hallway, a courtyard, and some house out in the middle of nowhere. Better scenery easily found in other movies.I think this movie will flop in American box offices. For having such big names like Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li, I was sorely disappointed, not in their acting, but in the fact they chose to play a role in the movie. I give it a 3, I'm sure it blew Chinese cinema out of the water because of how much money spent on the costumes and set. I like Li Gong, Chow Yun Fat, and the costumes. The rest of the movie bites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worse Chinese epic movie in recent memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curse of the Golden Flowers" is by far the worse Chinese epic movie in recent memory. The story/plot is unsubstantial and nonsensical especially compared to "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" and "House of Flying Daggers". As well, the fighting scenes failed to impress, the heavy reliance on computer graphics made the film seem budgeted despite being having the largest budget out of all Chinese films. "Hero" presented better and more believable fight scenes coupled with impeccable cinematography. COTGF had unbelievable characters and were generally flat. The story was flawed and incoherent.The overall acting in the film was mediocre with the exception of Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat who presented better than decent acting ability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry I couldn't give this one a lower score than 1. It is perhaps the greatest nihilist movie of all time - everybody dies - everybody except the state. I can't buy the rationalizations about the cast looking good and acting well while getting snuffed. The fact is that the story leads to one giant black hole and the movie ends. Yawn. This is not a matter of western people not understanding Chinese culture. The story is lame, thin and barely a step up from the cheesy Chinese soap operas you can tune into every day on CCTV 1-9. In fact - the plots of the soaps are at time more entertaining than this film. I mean, this film is really just a full-on gore festival with a few nice costumes. There is not even any real swordplay - everybody just gets chopped up with thrown knives and shot with bows and arrows. I will give some props for the overall set design and cinematography. But were there really day-glow walls in the palaces of the Tang dynasty? The only level i can really understand this movie on is that it must be a sort of metaphor for or comment on the Tianmen square rebellion of 1991. Gong Li and her boys are the Chinese people, while Chow Yun Fat is "the Chinese state". And in the end "the state" wins hands down and the people are hopeless and utterly destroyed. A bleak and depressing situation, but most people in china really don't need to be reminded of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No seriously. Yimou Zhang fails again. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Well I just got suckered into watching a 3rd failure IN A ROW BY HIM. Hero, House of Flying Daggers, and now this (I won't rationalize why Hero and House of Flying Daggers fail here, so feel free to send me hate mail). First, this was a waste of chrysanthemums. If they go on the endangered species, you'll know why. Second, what the hell is with the plot? There's very little/no motive at all behind the main storyline. (won't go into details cause my mind's automatically rejecting the thought of thinking about this movie). Okay, the lead actors/actresses weren't bad but what did they have to do? Cry, act frustrated, pretend to bleed, and possibly beat the sh** outta one's one son or stabbing one's brother. That would be the spoilers. xD Third, costumes fail. I don't want to see Asian breasts jiggle and one nipple slip. Most movies I'd be fine with that. This movie it just turned up the suck. Also, making me hate conformity/communism/dictatorship/everything azn.Feel free to send me hate mail. I wasn't articulating or explaining very well, so I deserve it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has totally put me off watching any more Chinese period movies. At least with the other recent period movie "The Banquet" the movie sets was stylish. The first thing that struck me when I saw this movie was how totally garish the palace looked. Not only was it, for some strange reason, red, green, white, and all colours in between, but there was such a surfeit of gold that it looked like nothing but cheap yellow paste.Maybe the director thought that he could draw the viewers' attention away from the fact that he forgot to prepare a storyline with a continuous parade of heaving bosoms. This is a new one to me. Since when did the old Chinese costumes include an abundance of cleavage?One of my friends who watched the movie with me had to force herself not to walk out of the movie because she had already paid for the ticket. The guy behind us couldn't help but chortle every time Chow Yun Fatt (the Emporer) appeared. At one point he laughed very loudly. Was the fact that Chow looked quite ridiculous in his togs or was it his wooden acting? Oh and the Empress has forgotten her clothes.Altogether too melodramatic. What a waste of time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shallow and random movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could vote -10 for it, I wouldn't hesitate to because of its impact. The critical thing I'd like to remind you is that: this movie cost ridiculously over 360M Chinese currency. That's heck of money, which is likely equivalent to an equal amount of dough in United States. Maybe some of Chinese people believe their booming economy can decently afford such cost, but don't make me try to guess your *particular* backgrounds. Every time, as I hear that certain *renowned* Chinese director is to make a big-budget movie; I'm literally hit by chill. I am quite positive that that movie will be a "flying wuxia Tang or post Tang Dynasty gravity free feudalism brutal emperor" stuff. If you ever get a chance to have a close look at how ppl struggle to make a living in China, especially in rural counties, you will agree with me that any thoughts of spending 360M hell of money on a nonsensical movie are as inhumane as any extremism. It is an urge compelling me to tell you this is because I experienced such life and I'd ever traveled to far more destitute inner region of China very recently.Let's go back to the movie. One thing I learn from my English teacher is that Literature (in all forms; opera, painting, and drama, etc) is about releasing emotions through evoking spectators compassion. It is an universal standard should be respected. But did I ever bother by the feelings for the roles in the movie? Not a bit! On the contrary, I did find the roles were loathsomely boring. It might, but most unlikely, has something to do with its setting being not contemporary. Though, my bottom line here is: even if you cannot touch my feelings, will you at least entertain me. Frankly, I don't find incest, poisoning, and brutally tormenting a child to death are ever appeal to me entertaining. Not to mention how awful Jay casting as Prince Jie, very disturbing make-up of eunuchs, snow-white tits, and gaudy to dirt golden color.The director's motives to produce such movie with such hideous theme are also unseemly. I mean the communists need to glorify its governance and the director is obsessed by Oscar and fortune. That is how they hump together to show off to the whole wide world how great is their communism working out, "See, We have plenty of 360M dollars to be wasted." Can you ever imagine viewers of the movie are not restricted at all in China? Any age can see it in theatre. The fun thing is those *superior* urban ppl do bring their minor kids with them. OK, it's a fashion to them. So hilarious! Da*n typical xxxx phenomenon! I hate to be cheated or to see some one trying to manipulate other gullible ppl. The movie is, to me, expect-ably awful. THE THING DRIVES ME MAD IS IT HAS A BUDGET OF 360MILLION Chinese CURRENCY! AND WORST OF ALL, IT IS TOTALLY WASTED because its box-office revenue will goes to Sony Classic, but not Chinese ppl. AND THIS IS UNFORGIVABLE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed with type of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film at the World Premiere at ARC Light in Hollywood last night. There are a few reasons why I rated this so low. But I'll tell you first off why I gave it any points in the first place. To be fair, the acting was fair for the primary actors (though I'm not convinced all roles were casted for their ability to play the character rather more for their popularity, surprise there) and the cinematography, costumes, colors were remarkable. Now why I rated it so low:1. Little to no gungfu, fighting is more war/gorilla like rather than individual where you can see the moves and appreciate the choreography. Little gungfu is a bad quality because of the expectation for having more than just a couple good gungfu scenes.2. Limited locations of shooting, mostly in one location - I found I couldn't wait to get out of the first location - although this could be good as some of the characters may also feel this way. But for me, it was dull.3. The most depressing point for me is though I expected violence, I did not expect family violence that was not at least strongly backed up with good storytelling. The most sickening scene does not make sense - comes across as they put it in to "shock" people with how sickening they can be, rather than putting something in to tell a story.4. I don't just judge films by their cinematography and technique - I also judge films on their use of power. Films/media have the power to imprint our minds with concepts, ideas connecting our emotions to images. I personally believe filmmakers have a responsibility in considering the effects of the films on people who watch them. This film does not take that into consideration. A horror film is a horror film and everyone knows it. This story is just sick - because it attracts audiences that may not otherwise see the film had they known it would glorify family violence. I honestly found this film tasteless with a hopelessness in the end. An emotion becoming too common in our world.</fullReview>
