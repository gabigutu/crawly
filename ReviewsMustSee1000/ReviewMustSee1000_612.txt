		<shortDescription>Finally, a Show that stays true to it's written roots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid reader, I am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. So when I saw the preview for "Game of Thrones" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. "Game of Thrones" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.UPDATE:I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait. Even after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most stunning shows on television</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do not believe any of those negative reviews. I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.It is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.After watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like "Merlin" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.Even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Readers who come to this review later in the series must note that, at the time of this writing, I have only seen the inaugural episode. It's probably safe to say, when dealing with a series of novels as beloved as The Song of Ice and Fire, the most scrutinized aspect of the T.V. adaptation will be how well it holds to the source material. I am here to confirm, as a fierce devotee to the books, that we have nothing to fear.While certain scenes play out differently in execution, the plot remains perfectly intact (so far). The characters have been transplanted well from page to screen, and the actors (most notably Peter Dinklage) nailed their personalities quite well. However; it is only fair to point out some of the acting seemed a little wooden at times.Special effects were well done, though nothing mind-blowing, but the scenery and props perfectly captured the feel of the novels (in my mind at least). It also must be noted that there was just the right amount of nudity, violence and vulgarity to let the audience know they were watching a tale woven for mature viewers without using said nudity, violence and vulgarity as a crutch.All and all, I am very, very pleased with this adaptation, and I went into it expecting to be disappointed. If I were to gripe about anything, it would be that newcomers who have not read the books might not know what to think of this fantasy story for adults. Some may shrug it off as fodder for geeks, while others might take offence to what they may see as a defiling of a genre usually meant for children.UPDATEAfter watching the entire first season, I can safely say this is perhaps the BEST adaptation of book into film/TV. While many moments in the show do not match the moments in the book action for action and word for word, the plot is never sacrificed when doing this, and the alterations simply make the story a better fit for a one-hour television time slot.In addition, new scenes (by which I mean scenes which never happened in the book at all) fit seamlessly into the greater plot, and help the audience with information they would only otherwise get via the narrative of the novel (EG: asides which explain character/world history).Top form, HBO. Top form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lord of the Rings - I think not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing a review comparing this brilliant title to Lord of the Rings made me make an account here and post my very first review. I had very high expectations from this series and I believed that it will (like most TV series) absolutely ruin the book. And I couldn't have been more wrong! Where do I start...The cast is great, though not amazing with one exception - Sean Bean is perfect for the role of cold master of the North, Eddard Stark. The setting, the atmosphere is perfect and not boring at all! Some scenes are just amazing and are exactly as written in the book - for example the scene where they find the wolves, the nature and the dialogs are just as they should be. Now to get to the part most people are interested in: What is this? What can I expect of the series?THIS IS NOT LORD OF THE RINGS. Now that I got that out, I can continue. The very idea behind the series is a lot different. It's based around great families on different sides of the world, the stories their members have to tell and the secrets they hide. And there are many secrets, You will have a chance to witness small portion of them in the first episode. If you cannot follow the story just yet, don't worry! It's meant to be like that, you will eventually get to know all the characters and get involved in the story so much you will BEG for next episode just to see what happens.What to expect? Plots, love, action, war, hatred, quite a few surprises and much much more... All that after the first episode. I really hope they will not ruin it as the series progress. Conclusion: Do not miss this! Yes YOU complaining that the book is better. And everyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one will blow you away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love, betrayal, greed, murder, corruption? All collides in mythical world of Westeros. George R. R. Martin's world is unlike any other fantasy world you have ever seen. The main conflict lies between two families: House of Stark and House of Lannister, but there are many more stores to be told?Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) is the main character of the series, and the story is mostly about him. Since HBO has staked a lot of money into this series, there will be a lot of colorful characters, just like it the books. The art dept. has done a magnificent job by creating a whole new world from scratch. Costumes, armors, landscape, photography? All has been done in well-known HBO way. Travel along side your heroes, from the cold North, and The Wall with Jon Snow, across the desert-city on the South, with Ned Stark, and join Daenerys and her riders on a mission to retrieve the Iron Throne.Let the Game of Thrones begin!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I am a huge fan of the books, and I find it exhilarating to see a show that is so close to what I made in my mind while reading it.I see some of the reviews are complaining about the sex and violence, to me that is like going to a restaurant, order a steak and complain about getting meat..They keep true to the epically written book, and they depict the characters in an excellent way.With a few exceptions I would say they have made what will be an epic show here, and I would really hope that they continue for all the books.</fullReview>

It sticks loyally to the books and doesn't "dumb things down" for a wider audience. If you are worried you won't gain the same experience by watching the show before you read the books, fear not - It's the same experience, with a different medium!Although, I guarantee, soon you will be so pulled into the world of Westeros you will run out and buy the books just to find out what happens next!Sit back and enjoy, my friends - Winter is Coming!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This TV series is magnificent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This TV series is magnificent! I read a book and I must say that A Game Of Thrones is one of the best books I've read. So when I first heard that HBO will do a series on the this book I was thrilled but I was afraid that they will not be done exactly by the book. But I must say that I was wrong and that the series is better than I thought it would be. Much better! While I watched the first episode I had the same excitement as the time when I first read the book. HBO has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. Sean Bean was born for the role of Eddard Stark. Costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. Actors are perfect for the role they play in the series. For me the biggest surprise of the series I figure Daenerys Targaryen. Emilia Clarke actress who plays Daenerys Targaryen is more beautiful than I imagined it would be and more beautiful than is described in the book. The Wall is a lot different than I had imagined, but in a good way. The series revolves around Eddard Stark and his family. He has a wife and five children, three sons and two daughters. Eddard Stark is ruler of the North and close friend of King Robert who needs his help in ruling the Seven Kingdoms.The seven kingdoms, united under one ruler, have lived a life of peace and comfort since King Robert took the throne. But nothing is ever as it seems. Within the king's court there is murder and treason, with no one aware of what is really going on. Across the seas, the last remnants of the previous royal family gather forces to reclaim their throne. To the north, the unthinkable gathers, the creatures of myth and legend that have been forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh and Exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones on HBO is a TV adaption of George R.R. Martin's books, a Song of Ice and Fire. For those fans who know and love the books, then you can't help but love the TV adaptation. It is difficult to translate books into movies or TV series, but HBO's GoT made it look easy. The characters, cast, scenery, costume, etc., all looked incredible, and gave me the feeling that I was inside the books themselves. Although not every little detail was translated perfectly, and nor should they be, the pilot episode was a grand achievement.For all those Nay-Sayers out there: If you don't like the series, then you probably have never read the books or watched the countless behind the scenes trailers that helped those who didn't understand the complex storyline. Yes, this story is complex, its original, its fresh, and it is very exciting. The story line gets better with each episode. You also have to keep in mind that this story is an adult story, and as I said, it is complex. Simply put, HBO didn't dumb the story down, but rather remained true to the core of this epic fantasy. For those who have never read the books and found the pilot interesting, trust me it gets better and better. Stick with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy has never seemed so real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.'Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. Every "country", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. Of course, that was all already there in the books ? but translating that so perfectly to a TV-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement.Yet for all its grandeur, scale and breath-taking visuals, what really makes Martin's outstanding work come to life on the small screen is the fantastic ensemble of actors. At the core of this show (any show, really) are the characters. Tyrion, Cersei, Dany, Jamie and John (and all the ? many ? others) don't lose anything of their complexity; the amazing cast succeeds in showing all their respective characters' inner conflicts and often questionable motivations and virtually no one comes across as one-dimensional (except maybe for Joffrey).There have been a couple of great TV-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale AND quality, 'Game of Thrones' is ? at the moment ? in a league of its own. A joy to watch: breath-taking, epic ? and highly addictive ? Television. 10 stars out of 10.Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damn you George R.R. Martin! Don't do movies, finish the damn next book ... oh wait ... he did! OK! Than let's look at the series...Well, above statement has a meaning: I read the books! Yeah, big deal, but when I did I always thought: "It is not possible to do a movie about this!" And I was right! ... but they did a series! And I can't really believe it, but: It (well, the pilot) is quite good! Never expected that! Also funny how many people talk about the nudity and/or the gore. Yes you see some breasts and so on ... so what? This is a fantasy, that is realistic (if you didn't read the books and don't know, what I mean by that: Wait and watch the series ... and you will be surprised!) so the scenes are realistic too! I like that! Adds more to the feeling of the books!The main problem is, that if you don't know the books you are quite lost with the characters and what happened to all of them. But I hope we will get deeper into the minds and backgrounds of those people! The cast for that is really well done and I hope for they can pass on the feelings I got when I read the book!Overall: Great start, hoping for Brilliance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no better show on TV (at least Fantasy genre) than Game of Thrones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is the type of show in which you watch the first few episodes, and you are bored. But if you continue, and watch a whole season. You will love the show with such an intense passion that only GOT viewers can love. With it's intense intrigue, mind blowing plot twists, amazing acting, great makeup, a huge budget. It literally is the show to impress. Granted it may get a little every once in a while, but only for like a few minutes. Every minute is gold, and it only has the fans wishing it had more than 10 episodes per season. A huge GOT fan myself.. I can testify to the authenticity of this masterpiece. Not a show for children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an average score of almost 10/10 from almost 1 million users, do I even need to write a review? Oh well, why not?No TV series or movies can be compared to GoT. In many BS movies/shows you can predict the ending after watching it for a few minutes (good ones always win and the bad ones seem to be completely retarded, blind, and incompetent. Well, not anymore!!!The story in GoT is absolutely amazing, filled with interesting and "realistic" plot twists and unexpected events.Acting is great, costumes and scenery as well. Every character is unique and interesting, and its great watching them develop. Everything is top quality. If you start watching this, be prepared to get addicted quickly - you'll just feel a strong urge to watch the next episode, and another, and another until no more episodes are left. There is a downside to GoT however that needs to be mentioned: as many have stated, after watching it, you will realize that 99% shows/movies out there are not up to its standards. A show of this quality is rare indeed.</fullReview>

In all seriousness, I don't know why I avoided it for so long, but I wish I hadn't. This series is awesome.I also didn't realize that it actually delved into items such as dragons, witchcraft, etc. I really, really like it and I'd recommend giving a few episodes a shot to see whether or not you like it. Please don't judge it on the snow scenes. That is the only storyline that I seriously don't get, and wish was cut out - I feel like those people have been lost in the snow for forever.</fullReview>

It's quick paced, and with so much going on at once, there's never a dull episode. Somehow, you really start to connect with their world and grow strong emotions for characters (AHEM JOFFREY I HATE YOU)I also love how you don't know who's going to die next... Purely exhilarating and I can't wait for more of Season 3 to be released!After reading these reviews, I can't understand how anyone can rate this less than a 9 - there are very few flaws if any, and it feels like Game of Thrones fills A HUGE GAP in TV. There's nothing like this show and I'm dreading for the day when we are given the last episode... Just watch it to believe it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I have free time and look to be entertained, I seldom reach for a book or engage in the arduous task of reading through an expansive novel. So for me, whether or not Game of Thrones remains true to its original roots factors little when it comes to the entertainment value of a movie or television production.When it comes to cinematic entertainment, I want to be fully engaged in the story and characters presented on screen. I want to be surprised and kept on the edge of my seat by clever writing that makes the unpredictable twists and turns of a story plot actually make sense. Actors, whose craft is so convincing, that whether you love or hate the characters they portray, they passionately inspire you to feel something? even if you find yourself shouting at the screen like a complete buffoon as if watching some sporting event. And, if left biting my nails at the end of each episode in anticipation for the following week's program --- I'll gladly pay the extra monthly fee to HBO just for the privilege! Game of Thrones, in my humble opinion, is all that and more. In regard to overall quality, I find it even surpasses the majority of expensive movie productions being released in local theaters. While I'm hardly a professional critic, history expert or avid reader of fiction novels --- I AM a happy and passionate fan of this superb HBO series and simply wish to add my sincerely applause to the cast and crew that made this HBO production the enormous success that it is. Thank you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have vote this series as 10/10 because it really deserve . without further ado let me describe some prons and cons of the seriesProns:1.Graphic is excellent without a doubt they spend a huge lot of money to make this incredible series . 2. Storytelling is more than perfect. the most amazing thing about the series is you can't expect what comes next and if you tried to predict you jaw will open soon. 3. casting . the best casting i have seen . every character play their role perfectly not only that they were also suited for that character. 4. Direction. no point on telling the director and his direction was excellent . 5. New World Map . i guess its almost impossible to make your own world map which is done here. 6.Reality mix with fiction : the series take some reality politics but added fiction like giants, witch , magic , wizard ,dragon etc which make series more and more watchable. 7.heart stopping ending at every season.Cons: 1.sometime unnecessary nudity and sexuality which wasn't necessary . 2. too much talking in some episode which makes bore.verdict: this is the best series ever made ,worth watching ,yes but watch alone not with the family .(the review is made on the basis of TV series not on book)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best thing on telly at the moment!!Watched the first episode without knowing anything. Doesn't give anything away but certainly sets the setting. The whole package is brilliant. From the opening credits, to the marvellous acting from young and old characters alike. I must admit I am not too keen on British films or dramas but a majority of the cast are British but they do a sterling job.Each episode invites the viewer into this mysterious world where power,love, magic, deceit,honour and much more all intertwine. What really makes this show are the characters. There are so many unique characters in their own way - their parts have been played so convincingly and they essentially make the show.Hate them or love them you will certainly appreciate quality performances from this cast.Only criticism is Season 3 doesn't quite live upto the other two - and of you are lucky enough to have not watched them already - watch the episodes consecutively --you'll be so hooked you wont have the choice.</fullReview>

That being say, if you are looking something else to watch, something really extraordinary, Game of Trhones has everything you would wish and more, much much more. The story itself, with 3 main plots and such nice development across the seasons, could be enough to make your mind. We have the history of the 7 kingdoms in which one of them struggles an allies with the others for power, for love, for family or glory. Everything is connected in the world of Westeros (the main continent where the story goes on). The seize of power, fighting all in all to see who sits on the Iron Throne is the goal here. But another thing and not less important is the characters (and also the cast portraying them) that fills the roles and make us closer and closer as the plot flows. Let me give you a little advice, do not stick too much with any of them, could bring you a lot of grief. Trust me. Landscapes, montage, customs, CGI, everything makes it feel as real as it can be, getting better from season to season. Finally, a mystic, terrible and powerful force is awakening to threat the entire world, and there's an old prophecy that says one day will born a prince that was promise, and his song will be the Song of Ice and Fire, which is the tittle of the whole saga from the books from where the show was adapted. So, stop reading and go watch this unique fiction fantasy drama action series, cause if you miss it, you'll be missing the greatest adventure of your lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Kingdoms of epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best TV show in the world every season was just outstandingly good and I was at the edge of my seat all the way through. The story has originality and a great script my favourite episode to date is season 4 episode 10. Every season on episode 9 you see brilliant plot outbursts that really stand out to the whole story of the show.Spoilers: Season 1 episode 9 had the beheading of Edard Stark(Sean Bean) Season 2 episode 9 had the giant battle outside kings landing with green fire. Season 3 episode 9 was when some of the main characters got killed off like Catlin and Rob Stark. Finally Season 4 episode 9 had a massive battle with giants and mammoths from The Wildlings north of the wall and they were against Castle Black, and also is the only episode without Tyrion Lannister(Peter Dinklage). Although throughout the whole of the show there at least one death in every episode. End of spoilers.Throughout the show there is great acting and great character development and also good story development. The only season which wasn't that great because well it had some limits it wasn't as fluid as the previous seasons and that was season 3 I don't know why but season 3 wasn't as fluid but then season 4 brought back the no holds barred rating again (18). My favourite character at this moment is Arya Stark(Maisie Williams) because she is just a bad-ass and also she is a fantastic character because she has witnessed the loss of her father Edard Stark but plus the reason why I like Arya is because that her story takes a big part in the show and that I think makes a key character. I recommend this TV show to everyone because even though some people may not like it because they it's just like The Lord Of The Rings trilogy it actually has no references from none of them films. This TV is Excellent and epic and literally the best thing on TV right now. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To create a show as complicated and beautiful as Game of Thrones you need many ingredients. First you must add a dab of medieval England and Lord of the Rings. You then add a pinch of sex and nudity. 3 table spoons of war and violence, a whole bag of love, deception and revenge, you mix this with the lengths people will go for power and add a little dwarf and there you have it, the beautifully crafted show Game of Thrones!The genius of Game of Thrones however is not all that I mentioned above but rather the characters. Everyone in the long list of complicated characters is so different yet all seem so real. The genius dwarf Tyrion, the honourable Eddard Stark and the cunning Littlefinger. All these characters hook you in so much that you in a way don't care about the main plot as long as they live. That is why I believe Game of Thrones is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****Contains Spoilers****This is one of the best TV series I have seen in a long time. I am yet to read the books but if the TV series is anything to go by then the books will be outstanding.This has to be one of the only TV programs I have ever seen where main characters are killed off throughout the series for instance Eddard Stark being beheaded in series one was a massive shock to me as I thought he was going to go far being as he was a main character. Also the battle of the Red Wedding was another shock being as not only one main character was killed off there were 2 potentially 3 and the fact that they slaughtered a pregnant woman.This is a must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never raved about something on TV so much in life! There is nothing' quite like Game of Thrones!I recall people talking about it years ago in its first three seasons.. But I'm one who doesn't like what the majority like, I don't love trendy or popular things. Roll on a few years, I was in my local CEX and the boxset (seasons 1-4) was on the shelf in pristine condition.. I traded in some unwanted DVDs &amp; then purchased the boxset. I got home, put in disc one and was hooked for the next two &amp; a half weeks, getting through three or four episodes some days.That's how I came to love Game of Thrones, by chance.. If you're anything like me &amp; willing to give something a go just to see what all the fuss is about, do yourself a favour &amp; do it! The acting is second to none, the vastness of the world will leave you in awe, the way the story unfolds will leave you mesmerised... The shocks, the twists &amp; turns.. This is a fantasy genre but there's a realism to it all! The action sequences aren't over the top, they are realistic. That's why even Lord of the Rings doesn't compare to Game of Thrones (I love Lord of the Rings) but you know what's going to happen, the good guys will prevail. Who are the good guys in Game of Thrones? Will they come out on top? This is another reason why Game of Thrones is realistic, because there is no good vs bad; everybody has goodness &amp; some evil in them as well.. That's true for all of us, well more so to the people it's based on in history. I even watched all of Breaking Bad after I'd watched Game of Thrones.. It just doesn't compare.Nothing is on the scale of GoT.. It's a one off &amp; when all is said &amp; done it will be hailed as the greatest show of all time! The end of season six highlighted the fact it's still the most shocking show on TV today! I've never felt so many different emotions watching anything on TV! I was left with euphoria after watching the final episode of season 6!If you've watched it all, you'll know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, give it a go, see how it affects you... I'm sure it will have you addicted so you can't wait for another hit of Game of Thrones! The best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was blown away by this show from start to finish. I couldn't believe how rich and spectacular the visuals were, how first-rate and technically marvelous the entire production was. But as much if not more so than the production itself, the intricate story lines and deeply complex characters make this show how deservedly popular and lauded it is. Rarely has there been a medieval, fantasy epic this rife with feeling, passion, betrayal, slaughter, and downright twists and turns. With a terrific ensemble cast and special effects that make the most expensive Hollywood blockbusters look unimpressive, "Game of Thrones" has left its mark on the zeitgeist as the show to beat in television history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to come and write a review even though I rarely do, so why am I writing one now? Because of the trolls that just love to hate on anything and try to drag down the score of what is easily a 10 star rated show. There is no reason this show should be scored anything below a 10. It has everything and is so appealing visually the only score for it is a 10, acting 10, story line 10, special effects 10 and so on. The only complaint I have is George wanted 13 episode seasons and D&amp;D would only do 10, that is truly sad, D&amp;D have shorted us important story lines that have been cut for time and so they have cheated us out of 18 eps at and hour each, that's 180 hours of GoT left on the table, that's a travesty.So for you trolls that want to hate something so glorious, hate away, you are insignificant and enjoy your miserable existences while I and millions of others enjoy the Game of Thrones :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not had the pleasure of reading the books however, it seems that the series sticks close to them according to other reviews. It can seem drawn out in some episodes but with so much to cover I can see the challenges. Overall it is a stunning masterpiece with something to grab your attention each episode. I love how the opening sequence is somewhat interactive in that it keeps up with what is going on in the story line. For me, it is the best opening sequence in a long time. If you love fantasy and I am a big fan of fantasy, you couldn't ask for more. Well, maybe just to see those awesome dragons fully grown finally! I can't wait, what a spectacular series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ticking time bomb full of Wildfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that there are plenty of good fantasy films and TV shows out there, including the Lord of the Rings, Once Upon a Time, and Your Highness... (that last one was a joke) But HBO's Game of Thrones stands at the top of the mountain when it comes to fantasy stories on the small screen. The sheer size and scope of the world created in A Song of Ice &amp; Fire is beautifully realized in the show, and the set pieces/costumes are very well done. The writers also did a fine job of staying true to the books, while also throwing some unexpected curve balls into the story to keep even the readers on their toes. Each episode has intriguing dialogue, deceptive plots, and most episodes have some top-notch action scenes. Season 2, Episode 9 is particularly thrilling, and the Battle of Blackwater Bay will not disappoint fans who have stuck with the show to see its epic climax. But the thing that I like best about this series is that all the events feel like they are leading toward an explosion of action. This ticking time bomb started with the reappearance of the White Walkers, and came to another huge turning point at the end of Season 1 with the birth of Daenerys Targaryen's dragons. Eventually a war starts tearing apart the realm, and most of the characters have no knowledge of the White Walkers, the Targaryen uprising, or the vast army of wildlings marching South on the Wall. Season 3 is now underway, and they have shown 5 episodes so far. The War of Five Kings is really starting to heat up, and all of the major characters are taking big leaps as the story goes along. A Storm of Swords (the third book) is the only one I've read so far, but I must admit it was one of the best page-turning, action packed books I've ever read. The last 3 or 4 episodes of this season will be epic, and the show will only continue to grow in popularity after season 3 is over. So grab some popcorn and a Big Gulp, because Winter is Coming!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all let me say that I have never read the books and had no preconceived notions about this show before watching it. I was hearing and seeing buzz for "Game of Thrones" and decided to see what all the fuss was about.I can't tell you how happy I am that I did! I don't know where to begin but let me start off by saying that this show has mass appeal. You would think that it would primarily catch the interest of fans of the book series or the same kind of geeky guys that are Lord of the Rings buffs. This is certainly true but once you get virtually anyone to watch an episode or two they will be hooked!To make my point I will use my fiancée as an example. She has no interest in any kind of fantasy type movies involving sword fights, dragons and mystical lands. GOT certainly has plenty of those things in spades but what it also has, and ladies please don't hate on me because you know it's true, is a shitload of DRAMA! There are so many acts of betrayal and backstabbing you don't know which characters are frauds and which are trustworthy and honorable. IMO the best thing that this show has going for it is it's cast of multi-dimensional characters. There are so many characters to follow, each of them unique, that it can become overwhelming at times. However, I would recommend that you don't grow too fond of anyone of the characters because in the crazy world of Game of Thrones anyone can be taken out at anytime!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We had the HBO screener copy sitting around for months with no interest in watching it. We weren't sure what to make of it but I'm used to seeing the terrible mini-series set in medieval times attempts on television, so I was weary of GOT. We ran out of things to watch and so popped in the first 2 episode that came on the Emmy screener copy and we were blown away, and bummed there were only two episodes on it. I've stopped watching it so I can read the books, which are also amazing and page turners. This isn't a genre I would normally enjoy reading but it's so well written that I'm really into it. Also, knowing what's going on in the series helped me understand what is going on in the book. It's very detailed, in an almost Jane Austin kind of way and uses words we don't use in modern time, not to mention, a lot of character names that aren't very modern, so it takes a bit of thinking in the beginning to catch up and understand what is going on. But you get used to it pretty quickly and then it just flows. I would highly recommend this for anyone. My dad likes crime novels but I plan on giving him a copy of the book because I'm pretty sure he would like this. Would it be blasphemy to say it's as well written as 'The Hobbit?' Sorry, it's just really well written and a gorgeous and epic show, and as good as production value in any movie. A must see and a must read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional storytelling with unmatched depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not much of a TV show fan. And while I recognize the greatness of recent dramas like breaking bad, mad men or house of cards, it is very difficult to get so invested in the characters there, and I don't think i've ever waited anxiously for the next episode. And that, is what Game of Thrones does better than any other series, it makes you care for the characters, and it keeps you waiting for the next episode. Game of Thrones isn't the best TV show out there, that honor would probably go to The Wire, but it is shocking that despite not even being held in our world, it is far more fascinating.The best thing about this show is it's unsurpassable depth, especially in seasons 2 and 3, which have focused more on the characters. Personally, I used to watch this show casually, and skipped the parts I didn't like while asking my friend to remind me what was happening. It is massive and it's hard to keep track of everyone, and so a casual viewer might not agree with my statement of depth. As a casual viewer, I thought so too at first. I didn't like the talkative season 2, or even the beginning of season 3, as the show slowed down there.But during a very boring summer I decided to invest more in the series. I went to a wiki and read the characters backstories, watched every episode again and then read through the first two books. The more time i spent on the series, the more I noticed how deep the story is.I also think, contrary to many other opinions, that the show is steadily improving, despite the fact that the plot is slowing down. It's focusing more on the characters, which is fine with me, considering that they are the most interesting ones out there. The Lannister males, Tyrion, Jamie and Tywin, in particular are some of the best characters in any show, ever.The first season suffers from sexploitation, and second and third seasons have talkative episodes that aren't always interesting, so I'd give it a 9.5/10, but since that's not an option.. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't watched this show at first, season 1 was finished by the time I started watching and I heard from many gamers (pen and paper roleplaying) that it was a truly amazing series and I assumed it to be good, but I found that it was GREAT! There are few series out there where I can sit and watch the show, truly interested in every aspect of it. I sit there wondering about every single character. The important ones, the non-important ones, the vile ones and the good ones, the annoying ones and the enjoyable ones. Character I absolutely loathe are so well written that I am always interested in what they are up to, what they're doing and what they'll do.There are quite a few twists where for one moment you think things are going to be okay and it's going to be a stereotypical order in the storyline and then all of a sudden the scene does a 360 on you and you have no idea where they're going with the storyline. Everyone who watches this has their favourite noble family that they would like to win and have justice and take the throne. I personally want to support the under-dogs, the Starks but I'm sure others like the other nobles in different parts of the world.I highly recommend this as I have never seen another fantasy series that was done well in so many years. If you are a lover of fantasy I'd go for it. Magic rarely comes into it, but when it does, it is something truly powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game of Thrones - Looking forward to more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cringed when I heard that Game of Thrones was being made into a series. Initial thoughts were that things would be grossly out of place and simply not nearly as well told. Then I heard that the series' author was on hand to ensure that the writing for the show would be consistent (not exactly the same but consistent) with how the characters were written.This concept created one of the most amazing TV shows out there. Of course having HBO's budget sure helps create the most amazing sets and wardrobe imaginable helped out substantially.This being said - Game of Thrones is not simply an adaptation of the novels. I tell people that the TV series is a visual companion to the novels; which are so big that you almost need the TV series to help your mind see all of the pieces moving. From the Wall, to the Horse Lords, to the Eyrie, to well you name it - the scenes are breathtaking. But for as amazing as it all is none of it is as good as the cast. I tip my hat to the casting directors - they had one heck of a job putting this crew together. Every cast member fits so perfectly into the shoe that is their character. My novel favorite is Tyrion Lannister - played by Peter Dynklage - is just as I imagined reading him. Special kudos to the entire cast however as they are as ruthless/loving/amazing as the characters they portray.However I will say that there are differences in the show from the novel. This is to be expected. Some of the major differences include: Raising the ages of the children (some are married/in adult situations - this is a good thing as the novels never really "held back"), cutting scenes short, providing information sooner, situations not in the novel, and some name changes. Game of Thrones has so much History, developments, events, and characters that this must be done. But it happens with much care. In a particular TV scene, the Queen and King are sitting together talking about events that brought them together. This scene (If I recall correctly) is for the show - to sort of wrap some information for the watcher, but it's done so well that I doubt anyone can complain. The series certainly keeps the tempo moving, the characters lively, and the audience engaged in the events. The show could have scripted word for word many events, but I think the brevity they have shown in season 1 works very well into their favor.Unlike most written works to screen, Game of Thrones does a great job capturing and bringing to life possibly one of the greatest modern fantasy stories ever written. I hope you enjoy this show as much as I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I am bit late to write the review but...This show is damn awesome. The location, the characters, the targeriyans, the king's road, the dragon egg's, the mad king, the loyal friend, the bastards, the dwarfs, the traitors, the plotters, the unholy lovers, the pet-wolves, the night's watch, the WALL, the blue eyed spirits of the haunted forest, the noob who becomes the king, the cunning lannisters, the prince with blonde hair, the tyranny surrounding the word Khal Drogo, the gulf of grief, the chameleon Baelish, and much much more!I don't generally prefer TV shows because they run too long and the story keeps never ends. Luckily my friend recommended that since entire season 1 is out there, why not watch it all? Here's the twist, each episode is a master-piece. I watched first episode, my mind blew-off in bewilderment of the 'pure' violence &amp; love, the characters displayed to play the Game of Thrones. The Baratheon King is a extremely cunning character, who never takes the center stage and yet remains purely in power. The Starks are the most lovable family with an unfathomable family pride. The all-powerful Lannisters, a family or kingdom in themselves. The bastard dwarf is one of best characters I have ever seen in any TV show. A character so tiny yet so powerful. Tyrion Lannister's dialogue delivery &amp; portrayal of 'the bastards' is absolutely stunning. He is chatty and witty, probably the only Lannister without the trademark characteristics of a Lannister!and I could go on and on about the other characters!More than anything, all episodes remains absolutely loyal to the title, 'Game of Thrones'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This adaptation (so far) is without a doubt the best I've ever seen. Few books ever make the transformation from script to screen without loosing something monstrously important to whomever has read it and taken it to heart. We can all reel them off. The Beach for me ... what a pity. But HBO really have pulled it out of the bag with Game of Thrones. The sets, characters and costumes are perfect, they've even kept huge segments of dialog exactly the same.GoT almost plays out like a medieval polecat thriller, with a hint of fantasy. If you're after a Lord of the rings type saga, you're going to be disappointed, only until you realise the plot is so thick and rich, you'll be on Amazon 5 minutes later ordering the books to find out what happens next. I'm on book 3 and hand on heart, I think it's one of the best stories ever told.I dare anyone not to enjoy this epic medieval drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of thrones can't truly be placed into any specific category due to its incredibly organic stile of story telling.When you watch movies, such as lord of the rings or the hobbit(yes I understand that they are both Tolkienian), you know which characters have got "invisible plot shields" which make them impervious the lethal danger, yes Frodo gets stabbed and poisoned by the Morgul-Blade but that all works out for him fine in the end.In game of thrones characters are treated as people and don't get give these mysterious powers to evade death by pure fluke. You will form emotional bonds with the characters and each time a character is killed of it just makes you become more and more connected with the Game Of Thrones Universe.Game Of Thrones also probably has some of the strongest characters in books and movies alike because you can really elaborate on you feelings about a character and 2 people may have interpreted a characters actions differently depending on the persons outlook.This is a very mature show and should be treated as such so if you just want something at and listen to as your eyes glaze over while playing a video game or reading a book then this is not for you. In order to really appreciate the depth of the series you need to pay attention to the context because if you miss a bit you may loose track of the entire series or even show as a whole.The only thing which I can say that some users may not like is the large amount of graphic sex and nudity in the series, but that isn't anything to demote it for, just be warned not to watch it in front of children.To conclude, game of thrones is a fantastic TV show if you are watching it and not just using it for white noise. I would wholeheartedly recommend game of thrones as long as you are mature and over the age of 14.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review ever and i am extremely glad it is for 'Game of Thrones'.In fact, this amazing and vivaciously plotted TV series made me register an IMDb a/c.I am not much of a reader, as i tend to get bored just by looking at the thickness of books.I didn't even knew that the complete plot was derived from the Book series 'A Song of Ice and Fire' written by George R. R. Martin, until i finished the third season and learned that the next season will commence in 2014.I will start the books just after completing this review, i can promise you that. Before wrapping up, i would like to share with you all the stupid reason why i watched this series. It happened because of a PC game called 'SKYRIM ELDER SCROLLS V'. A friend of mine told me that there are surprising similarities between the two which i now find to be so crude.I will also warn you not to judge the series just by watching the first few episodes cause you will miss so much fun-packed adventure and a blend of versatile characters that will be imprinted into your minds for lifetime.The dialogs are so awesome and highly intellectual that they imbibe you with wisdom and nourish your inner-self.My favorite so far is 'There is Power in a King's blood'.******HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Books = Great Television Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since J.R.R. Tolkien's works has someone created such a masterful and complete fictional world as George R.R. Martin. His extensive world with its numerous characters inhabiting it, is a joy to read about in the books and to view on this brilliantly adapted Television show.The numerous main plot points and side stories which are all inhabited by various characters that pop in and out of each others individual journeys make these books much more fitted for a television series rather than adapting it into a series of films that would most undoubtedly end up leaving out a number of characters and plot points that would leave the ignorant viewer confused and would not do justice to the books.Of the numerous POV characters that appear throughout the books and Television series, some of the most prominent ones include Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage), Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), Arya Stark (Maisie Williams), Stannis Baratheon (Stephen Delane), Bran Stark (Isaac Wright), Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and you know what? There are just to many to mention. The way that the above characters intertwine with all the other characters inhabiting their world is masterful.The world that these characters inhabit is plagued with civil strife and rebellion after the death of the King with many believing they have a right to sit on the Iron Throne and command the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. With in-fighting and treachery abundant in each of the regions the path to the throne is not as easy as it would seem. Along with the battle for the throne, the regions of Westeros are starting to become increasingly aware of a threat from beyond the their borders in the north and from the uncharted regions of the continent of Essos. Magic seems to become part of world again and disciples of The Lord of Light challenge the practiced faith of The Faith of the Seven of Westeros.One of the attributes of this series that makes it so enjoyable is the fact that no one is safe from the dangers of the world, no character is "invincible" as becomes apparent after the first book.Not wanting to reveal to many plot points I will this review here, but one last thing I will say is this: Pay attention to the details of the earlier episodes series and chapters of the book, and don't get to attached to any of the characters because they might not last as long as you think they will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: The review may contain minor spoilers but they do not spoil the story in any kind of way.I delayed watching or reading Game of Thrones for a long, long time and I'm kind of glad I did. Why, you wonder? Because I got to sit through two seasons without waiting a week for the next episode. But, well, then I came to the third and that problem became ... kind of relevant. As an avid reader and a major fan of any sort of fantasy (may it be games, books, movies, TV shows), I honestly don't know why I didn't pick up Game of Thrones before. I do remember telling my friend "It's mainstream, it's sure to suck" or something along those lines. I might have been in a world of hipsters back then so do forgive me, please. However, when I picked it up, I realized that it's everything but it's not mainstream. I watched two seasons before picking up the books, and I can proudly say that I hadn't wasted thirty or so hours of my life. Game of Thrones deviates from any known formula - for TV shows or books. Its story and characters span across many continents and each characters has its own story to tell - they all matter. There are a lot of characters - some you might love, some you might hate (looking at you, oh my King) but you can't help but admire each and every one of them. In a nutshell, Game of Thrones is a Game where people try to outwit each other, where people try to survive against all the odds and, of course, get laid somewhere in-between those things. What makes the story unique, though, and what makes it deviate from other fantasy stories is its unique aspects of no main character. Sure, there are some that get more screen time than the others, but that actually should be a sign for you. In the world of Seven Kingdoms and beyond, no one is safe - no one is certain to live. This alone makes the series even more interesting and creates odd sense of tension you can't get off. I'm sure many people, even non-readers and non-viewers, have heard of sheer brutality G. Martin possess. Well ... it's true. As far as the other things go, the scenery and locations are either breathtaking or distastefully brilliant. From the wood houses and stone castles at the North to the beautiful architecture of the Capital, to the empty, frozen lands beyond the North - they're all breathtaking. The scenery alone invests you into the story, making you a part of it. Because the story spans over the entire world, you won't be seeing one type of scenery through the entire episode - and I think that's the thing that makes this show jump from 9 to 10. There's just so much to inhale, scene after scene, episode after episode, and you never go "Oh God, I get it, there are walls all over the place and it's cold and it's snow" because takes jump from one side of the world to the other in the matter of seconds. As far as the soundtrack goes, it's not as great as the things mentioned above, but it does the job. There are indeed some epic tracks, but most of the time, music stays in the background. Still, nonetheless, it amplifies the feeling of epicness as you watch the series.There's a lot to take from Game of Thrones. There are a lot of stories to be told, a lot of characters to kill off and a lot of battles to be held (Dragons, I'm looking at you). In all aspects, it may not be a true masterpiece; still, no one can please everyone. Personally, for me, the lack of true fantasy, may it be dark or high is what makes me a bit ... itchy about the series. However, as I caught up with the books, even that problem faded. I look forward to more of Game of Thrones ... but the pain is to wait, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best TV Show by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this is my favorite TVShow, and i have seen a lot of series such as Lost, Breaking Bad, White Collar, Greys Anatomy and many others, but still this is my favorite one. No i have not read the books but my cousin have told me that's the same thing. I love Game of Thrones because of it's story, the scenarios, the actors, the visual effects. I mean this series has everything anyone could love of any TV Show. The story at first is a little bit strange and you may not get anything but after at leas t5 episodes of the first season you know very good the story and how is it going. And if you relate with a specific character it may be killed, yes in this tvshow many main character got killed but i think this makes the series more special, it's completely different to other shows when the main character never gets killed. The custome its another thing that makes game of thrones very special, its absolutely awesome and perfect, again, even more than other series such as lost or NCIS. I can't simply wait for more of this series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As true to the books as possible given the time restrictions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the first season before knowing anything about the storyline, and it sucked me in; it was totally incredible! Since then I've listened to 4 of the unabridged audiobooks in the series, all of which were EXTREMELY well done from my vast experience with audiobooks. I knew the storyline before season 2 began, yet I still couldn't wait for each new episode to air. Having read the books, the episodes helped to fill in bits I may have missed or misunderstood in the books, so the 2 mediums melded together nicely. This isn't a typical cliffhanger series with new stories written each week to fill a quota; it's a television adaption of the books which are gritty, ruthless, and are completely unpredictable in their turn of events, just the way you would expect things to be if this world actually existed. It stays within the story's boundaries given the limited time allowed for the series. Like the Lord of the Ring's, both film series are linear and tell the story, but both book series are more colorful with much more depth to the stories, more sidestories and character development than the time restrictions allow. I would recommend to anyone who likes the show even a little to read the books or listen to the audiobooks (Roy Dotrice really makes the characters in the book come to life!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREATEST TV SHOW of all time....The best 50 minutes of TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when i started watching GOT.I thought that its gonna take some patience to get myself to like it. WrongBy the middle of the first episode i was hooked. By the end of it I was addicted. Every episode has the tendency to surprise...or id rather say shock you and keep you thinking about it for some time. The fact that its on HBO promises violence....and hell of a lot of nudity, but not forced. Things don't happen just cause they gotta. The characters are perfectly placed and cast well. The writing is powerful and at times dark. All in all if you haven't started watching yet , now is the best time to watch the first two seasons because its a helluva good show .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game of thrones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having no idea what the series was about or even that it was based on a book I accidentallystumbled upon the very first episode of the game of thrones on a popular online TV show website. 'An HBO production', this had to be interesting, I thought. With series such as entourage, the sopranos and sex and the city setting the bar pretty high, the expectations from the first episode were already built up.The show starts off with men hunting. The setting develops an eerie sensation as the audience realizes that it is the dead that it being hunted. The dead, in the show aren't glamorized vampires or werewolves but monsters of some sort. At this point you think to yourself, 'umm... fantasy for adults?...hmm'. This apprehension however, disappears within minutes of the sequences following it.Game of thrones, is a show like nothing before. The underlining theme of fantasy is so realistically portrayed that the story, unimaginable in today's day and age somehow still seems plausible in another time. The complexity of the characters is so simply executed, peeling back one layer at a time that it becomes impossible to pick a favorite. Even the queen, involved in harming a 10 year old to the extent of paralysis, can be sympathized for when the antics of her disloyal husband are revealed. The show touches upon every taboo that may exist in today's society. Providing, what I feel is a sense of, liberation! The violence, the sex, the greed, the manipulation and even the hint of love are all ingredients in a very entertaining drama series.There however, do exist some censorship issues. The nudity of women for instance, crosses the line of indecency. A scene featuring a 10 year old boy drinking his mother's breast milk is a little more than unsettling. Putting the television show aside and thinking of the child actor at the present moment, is it really necessary to expose a child to such things at such a tender age? Breast feeding an infant is appropriate to ensure healthy development but for a 10-year old boy? It almost borders on pornography, especially since kids are growing up much faster now.Game of thrones is brutal, hard hitting and shocking. But it isn't uncommon to get so engrossed by the characters and their lives that censorship issues no longer matter. It is a thoroughly enjoyable TV series which is very well executed making every part of the show vital for its success. The creators have left very little room for improvement doing a fantastic job at every step of the way. HBO, once again lives up to expectation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best and most well-balanced series i have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I've watched the complete first season in one day,and i wish there was more, because frankly, this has to be one of the strongest series out there. There isn't one character that i find boring, i care for every character and the story is built in a very slow way that is just amazing, giving you small bits by bits but in a way that is so well done that you are gonna be craving for more. Amongst all the character, i would have to say that Arya Arke and Daenerys Targaryen are my favorite characters, since they are two symbols of powerful and strong women who are slowly climbing to their true potential. Arya being a tomboy skilled with weapons and daenerys carrying dragon's blood.Although it is a very well scripted and played out show, it is not for the faint of heart or depressive people, it is very grim, and at times hard to bear, but i find that in a sense it gives me hope that our race has made progress trough the year and that even if it is a ''fictional'' show, i imagine it is very resembling to medieval age. Therefore is why it fills me with relief to see that our time are much easier to live in, and it shows me that our situation is not bad at all, and that we have everything given to us. This show is very humbling in a way. There is also a lot of nudity and blood in the show so beware.For those that make comment saying that it is too violent and there is too much nudity, i would reply : we were born creatures of sexuality, and we will die so. We are born naked and are taught to be ashamed of our bodies. I think this show brings us back to the base, the sexuality is shown in a very smart and useful way. As for the blood, well it is a show about war and hard times , surely you'd be stupid not to expect a lot of it. Got a problem with it? then don't watch it.if you are wanting lord of the ring, this show is not gonna give it to you, it is a very realistic show with some few supernatural elements, there aren't mages with rods and hordes of orcs, so beware! Anyways, a very amazing and beautiful show in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This TV show is an amazing vortex of love, betrayal and gore. All of the violence is realistic and the sex/adult themes are handled maturely. I have watched ever since the first episode and it hooks and you in and keeps you watching. There are many characters, so, to hold attention, there are only a few characters focused on per season, and they are developed very well. You will find yourself loving or hating these characters and the acting is just incredible.Each and every actor plays their part. This is a television masterpiece and should not be underestimated. If you are not a watcher, then you should begin watching and you will thank me personally - and find yourself siding with houses before you know it.I cannot describe the magnificence of this show in a review, so you should watch it and have an opinion of your own. I, myself, do not understand why so much hatred goes toward this show, but I strongly disagree and hope that others who watch this series agree with my opinion.In short, this TV series is magnificent and deserves every award that it has won and its rating of 9.4/10. It is worth the watch - definitely!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fans of the book rejoice!! A winner in all categories!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard nothing but good things about Game of Thrones when my boyfriend and I picked up the first season; as such, I had high expectations. I was not disappointed?if anything, my expectations were not high enough. Starting in the evening, we intended to watch "just a couple of episodes." Hours later, as the sun was coming up, we were still glued to the TV. We watched the entire series in just two days. This is easily one of the best acted and best written shows that I have ever watched! Imagine my further enthusiasm upon discovering that it was based on a book series. Being an avid reader,I picked up the first book in the series A Song of Fire and Ice (which shares the name of the show) at my earliest opportunity. As much as I loved the show, I absolutely expected it to be much different from the book; as an avid reader, I am also aware of how badly most movies and TV shows manage to foul up when making the transition from the written page.I could not have been more wrong. This show follows the book so closely that there are even whole sentences of dialogue that must have been copied directly from the book into the show's script. The few differences are so minute as to not really matter; most of them actually add to the show, rather than being detrimental. In addition, the casting is fantastic. Having seen the show first, I worried that the appearance of the actors might color the way I viewed in the characters in the book; this was not the case. Although I did, in fact, picture the actors in most cases, it was only because their resemblance to their fictional counterparts had been so closely adhered to in the television adaptation. With so many characters involved in the book's story, one might assume that some of them would have been left on the cutting room floor when the series went to wrap . . . but, as I mentioned, the amazing adaptation included every plot point, no matter how small of a part a character may have. This is good news, as I have seen far too many movies and shows that ignore a supporting character in early episodes only to have the character become a major player later on, leaving a plot hole in the early episodes and people wondering, "Hm, where did this guy come in?"I have not had a chance to begin the second book yet, although after finishing the first one, I immediately went out and bought the rest of the series. As excited as I am about reading the next book, it is with even greater anticipation that I wait for the return of this amazing series. I would recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of the fantasy genre. Truly,I would recommend this show to anyone!! If you are looking for something to watch that is visually and intellectually captivating,incredibly acted and well written, and fun to boot-- or just an entertaining bit of TV to get you through a rainy day-- then you have found it in Game of Thrones!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of wind but no direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried many times watching this series but always found the first episode so tedious that I kept giving up. Then I found myself with a lot of dead time at a job once and ploughed through the first 3 series thanks to the blessing of fast forwarding. So yes, the production is epic and the scenery stunning and some characters are worth following.But the plot devices are so clumsy it is painful! The main beef I have is with the military campaigns that eat up hours of the story but NEVER comes to fruition. Instead they peter out in one quick assassination or a quick battle and the whole thing is forgotten. We then follow another campaign for hours that ends up in a dead end with no advancement to the story at all. Also there is way too much sex and sadism, but apparently people like that in their series. I'm not anti-sex, I just like the plots of adventure movies to get out of the bedroom from time to time, although that has slowly been phased out through seasons 4 and 5. The concept is great and as I said the production value is amazing but there is no satisfaction to be had at any point. For me story telling is about watching heroes (sometimes flawed ones), overcome odds to achieve something that changes things for the better at some point. But there is little of that if none at all. All we get is series of overlong cat-fights, doomed campaigns and pointless travels that achieve nothing in terms of viewer satisfaction. Killing off main character is all well and good as a shock tactic but it looses its impact if it happens every 2 minutes and we are left with no-one to root for, and then what's the point of watching. Then it just becomes cinematic masturbation of seeing how depraved people can be and how grand the scenery can be. But as I said all this without the human element is utterly pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It always felt like this show was sitting just below excellence. Feeling the need to take a cheeky giggle at a nipple or dick every so often to make the viewer pay attention.D+D The producers of the show clearly think you're not very clever if you watch this program. You need a pair of boobs every so often to keep you going through a story far too difficult to follow for a TV simpleton. That's nonsense, and yet they do it every episode. No one in Game of Thrones is looking to fight for what they believe in, or for honour, or for freedom. They're too busy wandering from North to South and East to West finding their next companion for ludicrous out of the blue sex scenes. If it's not sex, then the character will probably die at any moment too. Killing characters makes a show deep and clever, no one is safe...that's what you're supposed to believe. The boobs are classy, the deaths are clever. Shut up and eat some popcorn and stop thinking about the world or questioning the dubious quality of this show. If you wanted clever you'd read a book, but lalalalalala there isn't a book like this anywhere on the planet and you should definitely not look for one!The way this story has proceeded is pathetic. Shallow. Half baked and weak throughout. Characters have no depth what so ever. TV can be excellent and characters can be complex, just check out Breaking Bad for a quick and easy example. Shows do not need constant death or constant sex to sell. We don't need silly one liners throughout every scene. The story to Game of Thrones was supposed to be epic, and yet it's now just one big story about how a pretty girl with nice boobs and 3 dragons is going to fly across the world and become queen.This is not good enough and the shark has officially jumped.</fullReview>

Do not underestimate their tenacity with which they deliver to us the most brutally honest and fascinating stories of these multifaceted and extraordinary characters.Oh the things they will do for - love, honor, duty, power and the list goes on. I'm not going to tell you anything specific about the show, because going in not knowing anything is the best way to experience Game of Thrones. I didn't know anything and thank god for that! It really was love at first sight.(I really do wish I could experience the magic once again)Enjoy every second of the brilliance! Get ready to love and hate the world of Game of Thrones!

With the beauty of Emilia Clarke we are all in love with Daenarys. Yet others inspire us with great passion of like or loathe. If you are in any doubt look at the average rating of 9.5 from over a million people, then look up your favourite TV programmes of all time and you will find this rates as one of the best out there.Go out and watch the first episode...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The production scale,the sets, everything is so huge for a TV show and is becoming comparable to any multi million dollar Hollywood movie. At first I thought of would be an ordinary fantasy series with some adult scenes forcefully pushed into it. But later on I started liking the plot twists ,the unexpected killings, the war scenes etc. The series is addictive and this is why it has gone on to become the most watched TV series in the world. The series is not for the faint hearted though as it contain many violent and torturing scenes.But overall it is more than fun to watch and keeps you guessing what is going to happen in upcoming episodes</fullReview>

There are 2 things you must like to fully enjoy this series. First is medieval stories and the second is mythology. In each case the most enjoyable is the relations between people, and that has no era...After this you just need to know that: everything you expect to happen will not; every character can become the your hero of the episode; - all types of people are represented in the story and you will know at least one of each kind very well during the various episodes; and the most important, it doesn't mater if you like someone or if you hate them, in a real war everyone suffers and the majority dies.So, in conclusion, expect a lot of emotions from you side as during each episode you will for sure feel a lot of hate, angry, love and sadness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I write a review I like to take a look at the "Loved It/Hated It". I do this before watching some movies/TV shows that I am uninformed or wary of wasting my time. I have to say I can't even remotely relate to what the "Hated It" folks are rambling on about. This series is well cast,(and a bit daring I think for casting Peter Dinklage (the dwarf) in one of the primary roles), he is excellent, you're not sure at the start of the series if your going to like or hate him but by the end of season 1, if you're anything like me, he has become one of your favorites. Lena Headey and Sean Bean are really the only actors that I was familiar with before watching GoT, but each character seems perfectly cast to me.I did not watch this on HBO and therefore did not have to wait for weeks or months for the next installment, and thank goodness, once I started watching it was almost impossible for me not to go ahead and watch the next episode because the end of each episode left wanting more, and isn't that what a really good show should do.I will say this, I was startled by this series in one way, they are not shy about killing off main characters in this show. I know that this is based on the series of books, A Song of Ice and Fire, I have not read them but I understand that they stay very true to the novels, but I would have found this just as startling for a novel, I won't spoil it for you by saying which characters but I will say steel yourself they come fairly often.Because this is HBO there is a fair amount of nudity, sex and some fairly graphic violence, but I found none of it offensive nor gratuitous, but if that sort of thing bothers you it is the only reason I would say not to watch this series. I have watched all of the first 3 seasons and now can't wait till Season 4 begins, I hope you will enjoy these as much as I have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most epic series ever created!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Show has everything! Smart conversations, great story line, sex, violence, betrayal, death, magic and dragons! When I first started watching it I didn't have any idea what to expect, I was just looking for good shows to watch, but I got hooked on it from the beginning. The creator of the books is know one of my favorite writers. I just bought all 5 books and started reading them and I can say that the first season of the series is exactly the same as the first book. Can't say for the others cause I haven't read them yet. I recommend that you read the books too, for they are beautifully written and and I guarantee you'll enjoy them as much as the show. It has a lot of different stories intertwining and progressing at a slow pace but delivering an interesting and unpredictable result. For example, the death of Ned Stark, who seemed to be the protagonist of the show at the first season, left me and the other viewers surprised. So next you would think that his first son who later became the 'king of the north' would rise and avenge his father's death, but after three long years of seeing him on the show and beginning to believe that he will succeed and win the throne, he got killed along with his wife and mother at a wedding. In each movie or series the protagonist usually doesn't die, or at least dies at the end, which makes you not actually worrying when he is in danger. In game of thrones though, you never know who's safe or not, and that's what makes it so interesting to watch! ''In game of thrones you win, or you die''</fullReview>

		<fullReview>or continue to reach a 7 (so far...talking about my personal rating of course). Book Reader here. Yes I know but to my "excuse", I was reading the books when GOT Series was still a "Fanboy Dream".I was extremely pleasantly surprised by the series though. They managed to incorporate many core elements of the books into the series, especially in season 1. The actors were very well chosen and most of them fit their roles even better than I could have imagined. Needless to say, I was less critical and more "happy" about the series.There was one thing though that worried me from the beginning. The Books had a problem. After Book 3 (Storm of Swords) there was a major "drag" in the books. Suddenly all kinds of characters were introduced in Book 4 (Feast for Crows) that had so far no real background. Many major Characters were just dragging on to something somewhere and the overall reading pace was...less pleasant. This is not just my opinion, it can be well seen in the ratings of the books on some resellers Websites. While the first three Books are "breaking records" on high ratings, the two books after them have a sizable "dent".How would the series avoid this problem if at all? They managed to pull it off somewhat in Season 5 by compacting many Story lines and characters but still, it felt a little off compared to Season 4 (which is roughly the content of book 3). Now with two Episodes down into Season 6, the faults are more than obvious unfortunately.I am getting the feeling that the author (George Martin) had a "Window of Inspiration" for the story, that was open for the first three books. After that, the window closed and he tried to continue (for whatever reason), without a clear vision of how the story should unfold. The series goes down the same path and some decisions in storytelling remind me to much of Hollywood.In the first 4 Seasons, when powerful people died, the viewer had a good understanding of the reasons why, they may not have liked it emotionally but they could understand and adjust to the situation logically. In the first two Episodes of Season 6, we have two very powerful people die in ways that are extremely against anything that the storytelling has build up so far. The circumstances of their death, while at least one of them for many people emotionally satisfying, defy this fantasy universes own logic. This makes it harder for viewers to accept this ultimately made up story. They might try to explain it to themselves, to keep the enjoyment they are used to by now high, but there will be a little "sting" in the back of their heads that will lead to more critical acclaim as the episodes come down.Those two are just examples, there are more "blunders" and logical errors in the two episodes of Season 6 but I wont go to much in detail. You can read that all over the internets by now anyway.I am afraid that this show will not be able to uphold its own standards and ultimately become mediocre at best. Because of Season 5 (which was a 7) and the first two episodes of Season 6 (which are 5 at best) I had to lower my rating from a 9 to 7. With the hopes that it is just a rough start and they will tie up the knots at some point. I am not holding my breath though.Edit after watching the whole Season 6:Have you at some point in your life ever wondered why reality is so much different then in the movies? In reality, bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people and sometimes good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad and sometimes good becomes bad and bad becomes good and sometimes you don't even know what is good and what is bad. In the movies, good is good and bad is bad, you know, keep it simple for a broad audience.Game of Thrones brilliance is/was that it managed to prove that a broad audience can be reached with the truth, that so many Producers seem to deem to complicated for us "simple folk". Just as I stated in the above sentence, GoT too was a mish mash of things happening but always understable and well presented.Now we seem to be back to the simple good/evil formula. Daenerys, Jon and Tyrion are here to save the day. We will burn the evil forces of the undead with the righteous fire of our dragons and all will be well. We sing, we dance and we continue watching cartoons. Sad really.I am a little too harsh yes. I know many people like the series still and I don't want to finish without saying something good about it. The battle scene in Ep. 9 is very very well done indeed and may yet set standards for even Big Budget Hollywood productions.So, there you have it, I even finished my review on a positive note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best TV show in the new millennium so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story itself is something special - similar with Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings - it takes the audience in a different world. The story is well written and makes emotions - mostly those emotions that you want to become a part of that world, you want to experience the fights, you want to see dragons in life. So the TV show, what is based on such good story, doesn't need that much - just not ruin the story. And this show does that. The cast is good, the bad thing is that there are some actors changing for the same roles - I don't know why they are doing that, but as a huge TV show, you should evade that by any means. That is making the viewer disconnect from the story. Anyway - the cast is good, the story is unpredictable (if you haven't red the books), everything seems as real as possible - real emotions, real fights, real dirty bastards doing faul things - no sugarcoating.For those, who are rating this as a less than 7 - you should be banned from watching anything ever again, because you don't understand anything about TV/movies. If you rate this as a 1, you should be removed from this earth, because it proves that you have no logical sense and you are a probable mass murderer :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start I must say I have read all the story published so far. And I have watched every episode shown so far. In that order. Usually I keep my thoughts to myself, but seeing the last season(4) in TV, I have picked up the quill to express my gratitude to the actor or the person responsible for picking up Mr. Pedro Pascol to play the role of Prince Oberyn Martell. SUPERB!!! I am in awe and that role or acting is a definitive measurement for me. It just surpasses the character I had pictured in my mind by so far, that I am speechless. Unexplainable. And that is in addition to already the excellent acting work (greatest of all time?), performed by Peter Dinklage and Jack Gleeson (whom I suspect everybody watching, are hating). Highly recommend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amidst the wasteland of self-righteous, formulaic, procedure driven cop dramas and mindless "reality" shows, this is a true gem. With Game of Thrones, HBO has taken a huge step toward redeeming itself for the truly boneheaded decision to end the great -- and still missed -- Deadwood series without true closure.An original, imaginative and unpredictable storyline, awesomely staged and brilliantly performed by actors -- many now famous and others soon to be -- Game of Thrones is really "TV worth watching." Already into a fourth and well deserved season, every episode to date has never failed to exceed the highest standards anyone could set for TV entertainment. I only hope that it lasts another four years in order to really play out the fascinating details and intricacies of its characters.One word of warning: do not get too attached to any single character. In this fantastic world, any(!) one character could and can die at any time (hang on Maisie Williams/Arya Stark!). The game of thrones is a truly deadly one. Just sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite a slow start in my opinion, but oh my mother of dragons it became good! I could make a list of perfect things in this TV-Series so long so you had to sleep before you were done reading, but I'll keep it short! The acting was so freaking good, especially from Jack Gleeson (Joffrey Baratheon) whose head you want to crush until there's no life left of him. Then the music - so excellent! When I first heard it it was almost as if I got goosebumps. Well, it doesn't surprise me now, when I've seen how perfect everything is in this TV-Series. When I first started watching this show I wasn't satisfied, but that was mainly because I watched like 10 minutes and wasn't patient at all. My friends and my brother made me give it another try so I did, with the thoughts of negativity towards the show. But the more I watched, the more I saw what a masterpiece of a TV-Series this was. Now I've even bought the books in hope of one day read through them all... (Halfway through the first one at the moment). Can't wait to see how it all turns out in the end!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever watched a show so good that you try to get your friends to watch it to? Game of Thrones is that show.Game of Thrones premiered 2011 on HBO and I was lucky enough to watch it then. Usually I don't catch these great shows until they are almost done. Game of Thrones setting is the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and follows struggles between the nobles for the Iron Throne. Ensuing threats continue on in Essos and the North. A main inspiration for the series is from European history including England's Wars of the Roses between 1455-1485. The series delves into Western high medieval Europe. This show is based on books and had a massive budget to start, plus plenty of promotion. The show has been parodied by famous comedians and has a cult following. This will be one of those shows that people will be sad to see end. - Asif Zamir</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably TV's Finest Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is easily one of the best shows on TV at the moment along with Breaking Bad, and is perhaps one of the finest ever. The detail is incredible and every episode is superb. Peter Dinklage is entertaining as are the rest of the cast, but with such great detail into the whole world of Westeros it's easy to understand why every character is so enigmatic and wonderful- whether their evil like the tyrannical King Joffrey or kind-hearted like Emelia Clarke's Daenerys Targaryen. Season 1 is probably it's best so far, but with episodes like 'Blackwater' and 'The Rains of Castamere' each season is assured to be a thrilling watch, worthy of your attention. Any show that can fearlessly kill off some of its best characters and maintain the same level of class like Game of Thrones does deserves attention and this series, despite taking a while to reach a pivotal point, is continually intense and never, ever boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest shows of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GAME OF THRONES is based on the novels A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, a fantasy series by American author George R. R. Martin. The series contains five books so far, two more will follow. The plot takes place in the mythical continent of Westeros, which is comparable with the European medieval. There are several powerful families or houses which are permanently fighting for the "Iron Throne" of Westeros. GAME OF THRONES combines epic adventures like in THE LORD OF THE RINGS with political intrigues and interpersonal issues like in THE SOPRANOS.The actors are well chosen, most of them fulfill the image I personally had in mind when they were described in the books (unless they changed the outer appearance of some characters on purpose - for example one character has blue hair and a blue full beard in the novels, in the show the kept his outer appearance more usual). There is a huge amount of characters introduced, for non-readers the overview can be difficult to keep; That's why you always should pay attention, especially when new characters are being presented. The huge amount of characters does not lead to a chaos without any system, it all makes sense if you keep an overview.Season 1 keeps as close to the novel as possible, when you read the book not long ago, you will even recall specific dialogues. In seasons 2 &amp; 3, the HBO directors digress from the novels very slightly, but don't worry - the changes they made aren't really important, it's often just budget-forced; sometimes characters are left out or two characters occur as one.When you hear about the show, many people say it's just about sex and killing one main character after another. Don't listen to this! Well, there is a lot of sex, but that's not what it's about. GAME OF THRONES shows how the European medieval could really have been - dirty, treacherous, dishonorable and inequitable. The point of killing main characters is true; George R. R. Martin is ruthless and does not care how beloved his characters are - when they need to die, they die. That doesn't mean, any death of a character is random, even if it seems this way at first. When the story goes on you will realize that every death has its purpose for the plot.A major point that makes GAME OF THRONES one of the best books/shows in the past decades is the actualization of good and evil. There are only a few characters who are clearly considered as "the good ones" and even less, barely a handful of "evil ones". Every character has his own goals and achievements he wants to reach, just as ways to realize them. It's up to you if you support one specific character or not. There are many plot lines with different characters, some of them you will learn to love and some of them you will learn to hate.If you enjoy the fantasy genres in general and are looking for a show full of tension, exciting plot twists and with an absorbing, really huge plot, then GAME OF THRONES is a must see!</fullReview>

But boy,after watching the pilot I was so amazed I got hooked immediately. Stannis Baratheon and Tywin Lannister and my favorite.I still remember the speech by Tyrion in S02E09,'Those are brave men knocking on our door,let's go kill them!',his facial expressions were so real,the director is a real genius! Having said that,I have and will not watch any other fantasy series or movie if it isn't as good as game of thrones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Special Show!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not read the books, A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin, nor have I watched the show live from the beginning years, but I had heard good things and a lot of hype about Game of Thrones, so I thought, as a fantasy and medieval type fan, I would check it out. And boy, am I happy I did!! From the very first episode and particularly about midway through the first season, I was totally hooked onto this show.Now, you learn pretty quick the mood and tone set by this show. I am a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings and to a lesser extent the Chronicles of Narnia, but this show, even though at times feels like those, is really anything but. It has a much darker, meatier edge to it, sometimes almost feeling too intense for some people. Due to this, it will certainly not be a show that will please all audiences, but for others, it will make what is great about this show, the unpredictability. What makes this show so special though is the story of all the characters, the sets, and the writing. Also, when I say all the characters, I mean ALL the characters as there are at least 20 characters that you will know by the time you have caught up watching the show thus far. Though its very complex and sometimes can feel hard to keep up with every character's story, the show does a brilliant job at balancing all the character's off that you feel like you know each and every one individually. The dialogue between the characters feels fresh, intense, and just down right gritty. But its this dialogue that keeps you focused throughout every scene. The cast also is simply incredible led by Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, Emilia Clarke as Daenarys Targaryen, Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister and Maisie Williams as Arya Stark. Again, with all the characters, that is only a select few, but others are just as deserving of these accolades.I personally caught up with the show in just under one week watching, as I absolutely did not want to stop watching, wondering what would happen next in the revolving story as your feelings towards characters change, and characters you grow to love suddenly have things, let's just say, don't go quite the right way for them. I am not going to compare it to other classic shows of the past, as I have never been the biggest television watcher. But all I can say is that even though this show has a lot of things that are quite intense in the form of violence, language or nudity, it doesn't ever feel like its the focus as the real themes here are family, politics, and loyalty. It's an experience to watch each and every episode, and I can't wait to continue on the journey with all these characters. As Daenarys says most notably in one scene: DRACARYS!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that I just finished the first two seasons I'm seriously surprised. This TV show is truly something to be amazed about! Right now I'm really trying to find a flaw in it but I just can't. I thought of everything, the pacing, the cast, the direction and I even dared to question the amazing production value! But i couldn't find a single main thing, maybe the occasional out of pace scene but nothing to distract you if this amazing journey. Let's start with the plot, it is an adaptation of the famous series of novels A Song of Ice and Fire from George R. R. Martin. Like you guessed I haven't read them but I'll congratulate George for such a deep and rich universe and characters! But you are gonna ask, can this show really pull you into this story and make you like the protagonists? The answer is: ABSOLUTELY! I found myself cheering for Tyrion as he led his forces in Blackwater Bay! I liked hating Joffrey's guts and seeing what other horrible things he could do! And I liked immersing myself in Jon Snow's journey to the mysterious and wild lands that lie North of the Wall! The story is so engaging and it never gets lost in the overwhelmingly big cast of characters. There were a few times where I said "woah, who was this?" or "what was this dudes name?", but nothing overly complicated. The actors are great, they are full of charm and fit the characters. The ones that really stood out where Peter Dinklage as the smart and cunning Tyrion Lannister, Sean Bean as the honorable and loyal Ned Stark and last but not least, Jack Gleeson, playing the and sometimes chilling Joffrey Baratheon! Another thing I want to talk about is the astonishing and amazingly crafted presentation. It takes you in... no, it sucks you into this world and makes you care about it and feel part of it. I swear every time I see it I just sit back and enjoy my time in Westeros.</fullReview>

I understand that since the books are so large the writers cannot fit all the material in the show. This is fine. However, what is not okay is completely changing certain story lines and characters. Season two did this too much! I did not enjoy it as much as season one. Just to name a few - the nights watch story line, Dany's story line, Stannis, theon. I know I'm not the only one who thinks this- I've read several articles online and even non book readers have said season two dragged and was kind of boring. Anyways the reason I gave the show a 10/10 is because they have redeemed themselves with season three! This is one of the best books in the series, so action packed! And the writers have done a great job showing this on television! However, I do highly encourage everyone I know who enjoys the show to dive into the books! They are beyond phenomenal and you will not be disappointed- I promise!</fullReview>

Its just AMAZING. I'm completely hooked and obsessed! Once you watch there's no turning back, you'll be hooked from start to end of every episode. At the end of each episode you're left with a cliffhanger which then in turn makes you watch the next, and so on. A truly fantastic series and I look forward to every episode!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never having read the books, and being pressured for months by my in-laws to see this, I had the very great pleasure of being able to watch the entire first season consecutively in one day.By the time it finished, I was checking the date for the second season to start, hoping it was tomorrow. Sadly, I had to wait with the rest of the world.My first experience of George RR Martin was back in the 80's with the Wild Cards series of books, which engrossed me with the way each character's story intertwined with the others, how events experienced from the perspective of one would be impacted upon others. To have many authors involved in developing separate characters each was a masterpiece of editing.To have a sense of uncertainty about what might happen next is a difficult thing to bring to any story, with most plot lines having been subjected to a standard format and the characters being stamped out copies of the common stereotypes.Martin seems to have brought a great part of that early concept of straying from the norm to this world, with the unexpected twists following a far more intriguing storyline than the average TV show, where the big names always make it to the end of the episode with all of their parts intact.From Epic scale ideas, and subtle (and at times not so) hints at a rich past full of the best kind of myths, we begin to see the weave coming together on several levels. The way in which personality traits of characters are maintained in the face of life and death decisions brings an authenticity to the progress of events.The separation of information that allows each thread to play out without being warped by events in another thread, that couldn't and shouldn't be known, is a key component in bringing drama to the table.Besides all of that, the casting is good for the most part, and with believable performances it is easy to find more than one character to care about, to invest some emotions with and to hope for.</fullReview>

The characters were not developed much further, and the dialogue got leaden. Not sure where they are intending to go with this, but quite frankly, not sure I want to know.

I have completely lost interest in the series, although I'm impressed by the production and all the actor's efforts. The series has produced many exciting characters and let viewers get acquainted with many new promising actors / actresses. Veteran actors has popped up to the surface again and proved their greatness. Game of Thrones has lots of qualities and the series has in many areas outperformed everything else that has been shown on television before ... but ... the lethargic pace sucks the will to live out of me. Sure, things happen... people are dying and the new "wild cards" are thrown into the game. The problem is that it does not feel as if it matters. I'm not against the drama part but it feels like the awesome entertainment is suffering from drama being to stretched out and not leading anywhere. The series has not reached its end yet so my review is not engraved in granite but I no longer following series after the 4th season. Likely I'm going to see the rest when the entire series available on iTunes or similar. I rate it 5 stars because it at this point bores me. Who knows? Maybe I will restore the 10 I gave the show after season one after I seen the last episode?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is an epic medieval show, that is, from the looks of it, had a big budget that is utilized nicely and well executed. And takes a lot of time, but that's reasonable. Also, it is based on a series of books. Although, I admit that I haven't read the books yet, but if this is really based on the book, I can imagine that the book is also terrific. About the budget that I mentioned above? Let's talk about that.Plot: Well, the plot is based on the book, and it's a story about political control and power, hence the name of the show. Now this is where the show shines; there are lots of unexpected turn of events and twists that will jump at you. Even the main character could die, or the least unexpected one could die all of a sudden. Because of that, you will never know who are the protagonists on this show. Unlike the other shows, the protagonists survives, fights the antagonists, wins and saves the day. This show isn't like that.Props/Materials: You can see that they really had spent the budget on the props and decors that well. They're really decent. Their props had a simple, if not, nice design. Like the tents in Tywin Lannister's camp, decorations in the King's Landing castle, their weapons. Not to mention the needed extras. That would take a lot of work and budget. Soundtrack: Orchestrated medieval soundtracks. While they're not much significant in the middle of the show for me, I really love the music on the opening intro. Actors: Great acting, and you never see someone who puts their head or looks in the places that they weren't meant to, and has a pale acting. I didn't see anyone that look liked they were struggling with acting. Characters: I haven't read the book yet as I said above, so I'm not sure that the personalities of the characters are different apart from the book. But chances are that they are in their same qualities and background when compared to the book. This show has lots of characters that you'd love to hate, you'd love plainly. But great, nonetheless. Effects: The opening title is astounding, that it looks like it's also an intro from a Blizzard/old school Age of Empires Strategies game. While effects aren't much that present in this show, they're lifelike and well looking. Two examples are Daenerys' dragons and the blizzard behind the icy Wall.Overall: The tension in seasons increases as the plot passes. This is an example of a show that has a big budget and it was used well. And also, the reason while they only film 10 episodes per season and why they take much time. It's quality is very high that it looks like you're not watching a TV show but a movie instead. For those who are going to start in season 1, it might seem boring, weak and chaotic at first, you might have no clue what is going on in the first place. By the time you start season 2, it's different. I really like this show because it somewhat depicts the system and the society in the medieval times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of this genres or dramatic TV shows in general but after the recommendations of few friends and the IMDb user review rating for this show, I thought to myself, well, I should sit down and watch at least 1 episode and boy was I glad I did.I went through 3 seasons in a couple of weeks and I am left speechless, blown away, hocked - more like addicted, crazily in love, and can't wait for season 4 to start.While it is true that few actors, maybe one or two, are a little wooden in their acting range that did not put a dint in the overall experience watching this series. By far and by any account and measurement this TV show is absolutely the best thing to ever make it on TV. I just finished the third series last night so I am still shocked by you know what.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how you turn a great story into great television</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you need when making a television series on this scale is a very good story. George Martin wrote and continues to write a magnificent story that in many ways is on a scale similar to Lord of the Rings. It is more than just a fantasy adventure, it is an entire world, full of different cultures, languages and history and everything that comes from it, good and bad. What makes the television show so good is that it follows the story closely, deviating only when it must to suit the audience needs and visual requirements. No matter how good a television show is, the viewers imagination is less engaged than a readers and therefore must be served sometimes a little more blatantly.The story is in a way simple, even with a few separate areas of intrigue slowly converging, but the characters, their history, their reasons, they are complex and as such you can't just tune in and expect to be rolled along from battle to battle with the hero saving the day and winning the girl. In my opinion to truly enjoy this you need to have read at least the first book if not all of them so far. The books build the world in a way that it is difficult for a television series or film to do. The detail combined with time and your imagination are what makes it so impressive. The negative comments I've seen here all appear to stem from that very issue. No plot they say, yet there are many and they are so realistic it's fascinating. Too much sex and gore, yet this is a medieval setting, a very real and not so distant past should tell us that life in those times and places was often grim and usually short. I even saw one who scored it 1 out of 10 and opened with "I don't like fantasy stuff" which reminded me neatly not to have the omelette for lunch as I don't like eggs.Read the books - watch the show. But pay attention. Life is interesting because of the little things, the details, the nuances. That as much as the visual effects and scenes is what makes this a television masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Season 5: Hugely disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until recently I was a big fan of HBO's adaptation of GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire, there were minor changes in season four and some very dodgy pieces of dialogue written by the show runners but it now seems they were just testing the waters for something much worse.I understand that the books themselves have a lot of detail, too much to properly translate onto the screen but the show seems to have gone wildly off the rails, cutting characters and sticking characters where they shouldn't be and throwing out their story arcs. It's all just so two dimensional and boring now, the world doesn't seem to have any depth and the dialogue is absolutely terrible, more to the point events that hold a huge amount of weight (Ramsay, Reek and Fake Sansa) have been removed making one of the cruelest characters in the books seem completely benign.Boring, I have dropped my score from 9 to 5, It would be lower if I hadn't enjoyed the previous seasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many have reviewed this so I don't have to go on and on about the entire premise. I do have to say, because I really think it should be said, that there is so much potential here, but it's ruined. The lighting, the directing, the cinematography, the production value, the wardrobe, all so well done. It's beautiful...So why only four stars? It's filled with so many gratuitous sex scenes. Any way you like it: Gay, Lesbian, bi, Straight, Incestuous, sex while murdering... the list goes on and on. I really like sex. I do! I like it in movies and I like it in shows, but this is ridiculous. Almost none of it drives the story. None of it is really necessary at all, but sometimes it's nice to have a nice tasteful love scene. In this case it's a ploy to get ratings. It appears to have worked! My next complaint is about something that they could not have changed as it is part of the story from the books, but this is my review and I can give my opinion (shared by many.) They kill every character that you care about. Then, they introduce some new characters for you to like, and they kill them off. The bad guy wins. That is what they are trying to convey. It may be their prerogative to convey it, but I don't have to watch it. So I don't. I stopped watching. I just couldn't take it any more.The sad part is that there is so much good in this series. I really like the concept of the White Walkers. I like their take on dragons. The whole aesthetic is so well done. The world they have created is quite breathtaking. I just wish I could bring myself to watch it. The story just stinks. Oh well, there are plenty of people that like it so this is just one man's opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An epic tale of the struggle between good and evil. Game of Thrones is stunningly beautiful and a work of art out of the ordinary. Rarely have I been so moved by a movie / series. A must not only for those who enjoy a fantastic medieval adventure, but also for those who wish to be blown away by a brilliant storyline, strong characters, unexpected twists, beautiful scenery, captivating dialogue, fast paced action scenes... I could go on forever. You will hate the evil characters and love the good ones, or the contrary if you wish. To feel such strong feelings for the characters in a movie / series is the ultimate proof of what masterpiece Game of Thrones really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Art of the Cliffhanger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read all the books, I suppose it's only natural that I should be completely bored of the TV series. But knowing what happens next hasn't stopped me enjoying and revisiting other books, movies, and shows -- in fact I've got a small shelf full of them. Perhaps the trouble with "Game of Thrones" is that it offers so few pleasures besides finding out "what happens next".The cast is generally very good, and they make the material sound better than it really is. The dialogue is weighed down with clumsy expository speeches -- at least one per episode, usually more -- with which each actor has to wrestle. Peter Dinklage, as the dwarf Tyrion, stands out as a sympathetic, if self-centered, antihero, and he manages to command the screen even when his lines are stilted, clunky rubbish. Sean Bean, before losing his head, delivered a typically charismatic and soulful performance as the tragic hero Ned Stark, but even he struggled with the exposition. The many child actors, Maisie Williams especially, are more believable, maybe because children aren't normally saddled with huge chunks of Expo-Speak. Much of the rest of the cast have endeavored to create performances so subtle they end up almost wooden, while a few others engage in dodgy accents and some arch scenery-chewing. (Aiden Gillen, as the scheming Littlefinger, gets less comprehensible with each passing season).The show is heavy on plot, with seemingly several dozen characters all competing for your attention while they vie for the throne of the Seven Kingdoms, or just try to out-maneuver and kill each other off. There's so much plot that there's hardly any room for style, and the show is filmed in a rather dull, stagy fashion: the average scene involves two characters sitting in a room or walking through the woods and trading Info-Dumps or arguing with each other, and periodically someone will get stabbed. The reliance on dialogue means you don't actually have to watch the show: instead you can just listen to it without missing much, except the gore and nudity.And while there's nothing wrong with a little harmless gratuitous nudity, "Game of Thrones" pours it on with a trashy prurience befitting a sexually precocious 12-year-old boy, rather than an adult of either gender. The male gaze entirely dominates these scenes, apparently designed to appeal to fans of soft-core pornography who want a little high drama with their smut. Their gratuity can be gauged by the fact that the naked women are usually uncredited extras, and very few of the main cast -- male or female -- appear in these scenes. The gore and violence are equally trashy, with squirting arteries and squishy sound effects, to the point that they become more laughably ridiculous than genuinely painful.So what happens next? That's really the only thing keeping this show going, as every episode and nearly every individual scene ends with a cliffhanger to keep you coming back for more. Characters are captured, betrayed, condemned to death, beheaded, or left for dead on a regular basis. Ned, Robb, and Catelyn Stark have all passed on, as have Tywin Lannister and his sadistic grandson Joffrey; the fun now will be seeing who gets bumped off next. But if you've read the books, or if you have any interest in watching "Game of Thrones" a second time, the question "What happens next?" isn't going to appeal to you. Even if you just want to watch a good story that's told well, you're going to have an uphill battle with "Game of Thrones".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to even start...? This HBO TV Series is absolutely awesome! Without giving anything away, the show gives you all the drama and action you can ask for. From lies to war to sex to death, it's all in there.Not only is the acting spot on but holding true to the books written by George R.R. Martin are excellent. There is a little ad hoc changes but the books and the series is pretty much on par. What is like about the series is the realistic feeling of really being part of the action and part of the fantasy world. This is a huge bonus for followers of the books and series. Another bonus is that George R.R. Martin is not afraid of to stay from the status quo from other genres of this type. Mr. Martin has repeatedly said that no one is safe in his books. This is awesome as your always on edge awaiting the next moves from the key players in the show. This is an absolute must see TV series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 3rd season is amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the show. After the phenomenal 1st season I went to the library and borrowed the first four books and started reading them. I must say that Martin's way of structuring the story and the amount of characters makes the reading quite difficult. Somewhere in the middle of the fourth book I gave up and decided to watch the show first. The second season was great, although mildly slow-paced. Enjoyed the slowly increasing supernatural elements like Lady Melisandre's magic, the horrible walking dead and, of course, the dragons. The last two episodes were action-packed and left me yearning for the next season. Now I'm watching the 3rd season only one day behind the original showings in the US and I must say that it is breath-taking! The action, the characters, the pure evilness of the characters, the fantastic elements, the effects and settings.. the sinister dialogs (especially Tywin's "heart-warming" moments with his children Tyrion and Cersei), ahhhh, this is something never seen on TV. Having read so far, I think I know what is happening in the last two episodes of this season, and without spoiling anything I can say that the viewers will be stuttering! Can't wait to see how the story continues on the screen. Extraordinary work, HBO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George RR Martin's A song of Fire and Ice is as epic and fantastic a series,set in the sword and sorcery mold as there ever has been. It's longer then the Lord of the Rings and five times as engrossing. The Game of Thrones TV Series is just as great. It's a grand story filled with heroics. Villainy and Magic of the darkest foulest kind. But unlike The Lord of the Rings. The Games of Thrones also has another edge. Politics,and family loyalities. Betrayal and manipulations that seem impulsive have resounding consequences. This is maybe one of the few shows on TV where actions have reactions The Walking dead is the other show where this has happened. For all of it's grandeur and glory. This is one of the only shows on TV Where it doesn't have any flaws. It's that good. OR if it does have flaws we're too busy having a good time to notice them. Subtle hints are tossed thru out the show as to what is going to happen. You just have to keep watching to see if you're right or wrong.Imagination is king. And this show is full of imagination. It's full of the stuff that makes Legends. Each episode makes you want more. and the story carries you along relentlessly and mercilessly. You are caught in it's grasp. and you are going to thank God that you are. Because it's the best kind of trap to be caught in. Nothing is what it seems. And little things mean big things. And Evil walks the world some disguised as humans. Some disguised as monsters.While Heroes look like ordinary people or look like monsters the only thing separating them is the actions of their hearts. And the Game of thrones plays on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily The Greatest Fantasy Television Show Ever, And Better Than Most Fantasy Films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, let me say that I watched the first two seasons without reading the books, but after season two I was interested enough to read all five novels before season three. In this way I have the perspective of both a watcher and a reader. The purpose of this review is to help people decide whether or not this show is for them. A Game of Thrones (and the series of novels that it is based on) is somewhat unique in its story telling. Although it is a fantasy world, it is more based on our actual history than previous fantasy writings such as Lord of the Rings. It is also very dark, depicting many events that would have (and often did) take place in our own medieval time period. For these reasons, it is very difficult for some viewers to get into the series without previously reading the books. After reading some of the more negative reviews here, I feel the need to clear up some of the main criticisms. There seem to be three major complaints:1. It is too slow. Do not make the mistake of thinking that this is an action show. While there is a lot of fighting, it is often split up between a ton of politics, history, and character moments. This is a political drama, and the characters come first. I for one really enjoy the "slower" moments and find the dialogue just as interesting as the battles. If you like constant action and battle sequences, this is not a show for you.2. Too much violence and sex. This show is not meant for the squeamish. It deals with many themes that are normally shied away from. The violence isn't constant, but when it arrives it is realistic and gruesome. The blood and gore is meant to emulate real injury and death in order to add realism. There is also a lot of nudity and sex. I will actually agree that the nudity sometimes goes overboard, but again, the show attempts to represent reality, and sex and nudity actually happens in real life (if you can believe it). If you cannot handle nudity and violence, this is not a show for you.3. There are too many characters and plots to keep track of. Yes, there are hundreds of characters, spread out over two huge land masses, each with their own back story, motives, and positions. There is a history to the world that stretches back thousands of years, with epic events and battles. And there are many different kingdoms, all battling to better their own political position. It is not impossible to fallow (as some reviewers will have you believe), but it does require some time and patience to understand all of the people and the history. If you have trouble focusing, this is not a show for you.If you got past these three major criticisms without second guessing yourself, and you like fantasy, there is no reason that you shouldn't like this show. Everything from the story, to music, to set pieces, to wardrobe, to acting and beyond, is top notch. It may take a few episodes to be fully immersed, but once your into the show its hard to get out! 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best TV Show Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been watching the tube since they were small, round and black &amp; white back in the early '50s and Game of Thrones is the best production I have ever seen - by a wide margin. Everything about the show is off the charts from the writing and acting, to the sets, costumes and locations this show just plain keeps you on the edge of seat for the whole time you are watching. And, then you can't wait for the next episode. Fabulous storytelling a Tour de Force in the arts. This is must see TV and TV at its best. You used to have to go to the movies to an "A" movie at that to come anywhere close to the quality of Game of Thrones. This masterpiece of art touches the viewer's emotions in deep places and that is what great performing arts is all about. You either love of hate these characters who are brought to life so vividly by the actors and writers and directors. And, what is very interesting is you see the characters evolve before your eyes and your feelings toward them change as the tug and pull and rejection and revulsion work their way into your consciousness. Viewers feel passionately about Game of Thrones. I can't wait for next season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Top 5 Best TV Shows EVER. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had to make an IMDb account specifically to rate this show. There are a lot of ridiculously harsh reviews of this show that I find absurd.The most common complaint seems to be too much sex. This is an HBO show. Yes, it will have more sex than any show you find on regular cable. But does it really have more sex than The Tudors or Spartacus, two really great premium channel shows? I find a lot of the sex is necessary to define the character's personalities and motives. The writers had to be creative here because it's not as if they can just describe the characters exactly the way the author described them in the book. People tend to show who they really are on the inside when they are having sex.There seems to be a lot of viewers that don't like the show because "it isn't the genre they care for." If you watched this show and expected it to be anything less than an a violent, vulgar, epic, sexy fantasy story, then you must've been prepared to watch Twilight, and not Game of Thrones.What makes this show so great is how quickly the story can change, even when it seems to violate TV show norms (i.e killing off a main role). Unfortunately, we can't really give the writers credit here, as they are just following the story.Game of Thrones almost seems like it was written to be a TV show in the sense that it is entirely unpredictable. If you've never read the books, you will NEVER be able to guess which direction the show will start to go in and just when you think you've got it all figured out, something will change, leaving you guessing again and just dying to know what happens next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cruel, bloody, vulgar, Machiavellian, unrepentant. And that is just the writing. The camera angles, the score, the pacing mesh together for grand storytelling: a mix of horror, swords and sorcery, and endless treachery. And all of that would be somewhat squandered if it wasn't for the best casting I've ever seen. From Lena Headey as soft spoken Cersei to Peter Vaughan as ancient Maester Aemon, each character pulses with depth and believability. Peter Dinklage may have sacrificed a virgin princess to get this role; I've never seen a better fit, not in size (though there is that) but in the way his eyes convey shrewd arrogance coupled with unabashed debauchery.Can't wait for season 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to wait with reviewing the series until I have seen at least a couple of episodes. Today I watched the second to last episode of the first season (episode 9). I am amazed and flabbergasted how incredibly brilliant this show is written, how amazing the actors act and the editing has been done.When watching the first 5 minutes of episode one I already fell in love with it. It feels like you're watching a movie, rather than a series. Although if it had been a movie, it would not have been quite as much detailed as it could have been. Therefore the series are excellent in explaining the complete story.I have not read the books myself (although it had been recommended to me several times over the past few years but I never got around to it. According to other people this stays very true to its original storyline.You can expect gore and sex (elegant and not hardcore porn). Sometimes I would not advise to eat anything or to have a full stomach. It is a very raw storyline about the brutality of medieval times, combined with some fantasy. However in an interview with George R. R. Martin, the writer of the books he states that 'too much magic can ruin a story', and I completely agree. It is a brute, raw, painful and beautiful story to watch.This is by far the best series I have ever seen and would probably be amongst the best movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

They may be pushing the story a little fast but they have not left out anything really crucial. Those who bitch about this show should go read the book, because they wouldn't bitch if they knew what was in store for them. Great Start! Its not always easy to accurately depict stories in books to the screen. I cant wait for the next episode tonight. *edit/update* after watching last nights episode i guess they did put the dire wolves in (musta missed it in episode 1 or something).

		<shortDescription>The Game is Losing its Throne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I have to say that I did not read read any of Mr. Martin's books, and that I watched all five seasons. And, that I do not find this show over-sexed or especially brutal. I do not live in a country where nudity on screen is a problem. Yet graphic violence is, but except in some cases (mostly boring scenes), I never felt the need to fast forward.I enjoyed the first four seasons of GOT (with no real understanding of the hype around it) until the death of Oberyn Martell. The characters were mostly interesting (except that Girl that has only two facial expressions, Daenerys), the story arcs wide and interesting, and the dialogs, precisely most of them with Tyrion involved, razor sharp like no other show I watched before.GOT is basically a family story, and it takes most of its fascination from there. Powerful and powerless families are put together, with their history background lasting over centuries. They are stuck in their age, struggling for survival and power. The Game of Thrones itself seems as a permanent repeated game of success, failure, loss, intrigue, murder, war and humiliation, as history presents itself to us. People want power, are trying to take it like Wolves from their rivals, are succeeding or failing while the only real sure outcome are mountains of dead bodies. It's basically Shakespeare and doesn't add anything to his observations of the human nature, except a bit of Tolkien or Rowlings and Nietzsche. We are allowed to like that (or not).Back to Oberyn. Just when the GOT producers had the luck to bring in another intriguing character - actor Pedro Pascal had the role of his life - they decided to kill him. OK, I have not a very big problem with killing a character, but in this case it was pure waste. Tywin's death actually did make sense, for example, and however we liked Charles Dance, he had to leave eventually.Next, there was the death or disappearance of Sandor Clegane. This character had vast potential and was wasted, too.Together with some other needless things, like the torture and depenitation of Theon Greyjoy, GOT then lost parts of its central themes, particularly the Game itself, and the Family saga aspects, to be a simple series of events, failures and not very interesting stories of fates (Sansa, Arya, Brienne)I put the blame for GOT's current (Season 5) downfall as a reasonable epic equally on both R.R. Martin, the original Author, who lost track of his own creation, and the producers of the the series, who didn't see that their child has to grow up and eventually has to go loose from the author, who cannot handle the complexity anymore and therefore makes the wrong decisions to hold it together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review of Season OneAn outstanding television drama that helps set a new benchmark in terms of quality. Yes, GAME OF THRONES is really that good; it's television on a game-changing level and easily the equal of the similarly brilliant ROME. Based on a series of novels by George R. R. Martin, this is an example of the fantasy genre at its best and I'd even consider it better than the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy! The complex storyline involves the battle for supremacy between various political factions who dominate a worldscape that's as involved and complex as anything Tolkien could muster up. Each episode is riven with treachery, backstabbing, allegiances, betrayals, friendships and battle. Each episode is packed with danger and unlike the cosy TV dramas put out by the BBC, you're never sure if a character you like will make it to the next episode. Many don't.As this is low fantasy rather than high fantasy, the fantastic elements are kept to a minimum; there are some barely-glimpsed moments involving supernatural creatures but the emphasis is purely on the humans involved in the story. One of the reasons I like this series so much is that much of the material is clearly based on moments from our own history; the kind of civil war that brought England to its knees in the Wars of the Roses is evident, while the Dothraki's tribal movements recall the Mongols. Yet the fantasy setting allows Martin to give free rein to his imagination so you never know what's going to happen next, unlike with historical dramas constrained by facts.There are 10 episodes in this first season and every one's a stunner, perfectly paced with a mix of exposition and action. The scripts are intelligent and insightful; each writer knows that it's the characters who make or break a show, and every single one of them is interesting and engaging. Despite the huge cast, it's easy to become familiar with the main players. It's hard to single out any actor for praise: Sean Bean, Lena Headey, Mark Addy, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke, Aiden Gillen, Iain Glen; none of them put a foot wrong, they each inhabit their role with so much depth that you forget about the actor and focus on the character instead. Peter Dinklage is perhaps the luckiest, capturing a truly scene-stealing character with wit and warmth.Review of Season TwoSeason 2 jumps straight into the action and carries on from where we were before. It's impossible to say too much about the many twists, surprises and genuine shocks in the show without spoiling it, but overall GAME OF THRONES remains a realistic, harrowing and exceptionally involving piece of television. A complex tableau of characters is woven and yet despite the complexity of geography, politics, allegiances and history, the viewer is never left confused, not even for a second. Season 2 ups the ante with even more explicit sex and a key climactic battle sequence that wouldn't be out of place in the likes of LORD OF THE RINGS. Despite these cinematic elements, however, the focus remains on intricate characterisation and that's what holds this show together, no matter how many truly fantastic elements are thrown into the mix.Review of Season ThreeSeason 3 offers more of the same, with some particularly vicious torture sequences and lots more twists and turns as the plot develops. And while it's hard to pick out a season that's superior to the others, I can safely say that, when it comes, the Red Wedding is undoubtedly the highlight of the show so far; a stunning, unforgettable set-piece that never lets you go. Strong stuff indeed, just as I'd expect from what is the best thing on television at the moment.Review of Season FourThings remain on a high-quality level with Season 4 of the show, which I think is an improvement on the previous season (as good as it was). There's no long-winded journey here with characters meeting their inevitable fate in episode 9 as there was in Season 3; instead it all feels fresh and inventive, and all of the major story lines are packed with peril and incident. Neil Marshall's epic battle in episode 9 is the highlight, but Peter Dinklage contributes some excellent acting and Rory McCann has never been better as the Hound. By all accounts this is the last season to stick closely to the plot of the Martin novels, so I can't wait to see where Season 5 goes.Review of Season FiveSeason 5 sees the show no longer at the top of its game but it still packs a wallop as a prime piece of TV and it nevertheless knocks spots off the competition. I'd probably give this a 9/10 purely because some of the scripted lines are weak, there's a greater reliance on extraneous sex and nudity than in the previous couple of seasons, and some of the characters could have been written better. It's nonetheless as rousing as ever, with some great twists, some truly shocking character deaths, and stunning production values. The first seven episodes build up to an electric trio at the climax, with the episode 'Hardhome' containing the best set-piece of the entire series so far.Review of Season SixSeason 6 picks up from the previous season to provide a better quality viewing experience all round. Gone are most of the extraneous story lines, with only a handful of dumb humour scenes left in. Things feel more vital here, more important than ever, and more dangerous. I particularly liked the way that the writers go out of their way to re-introduce old characters and tie up loose ends which they do very well. As before, things build to an incredible last couple of episodes, and as ever I'm left eagerly awaiting the next series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will this be another show HBO gets me hooked, before unceromoniously dumping it for inexplicable reasons?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings it ain't... and I mean that most definitely as a compliment to Game of Thrones. Don't get me wrong, I liked Lord of the Rings, but the 'Seven Kingdoms' of Game of Thrones is a spectacularly unpleasant place to live, as any show set in what is essentially the Middle Ages should be. If you find subject matter such as extreme violence, bad language, rape, incest and just generally very unpleasant behaviour unpalatable, maybe give it a miss. It's an HBO 12th century thing with, so far, mild supernatural elements. Two and a Half Men it is not.Sean Bean plays Eddard Stark, the main character and puts in a solid performance, for the moment, never sure how long anyone is going to live in this show. I was always quite fond of the guy, this is by far his beast work to date. Also a shout out to Peter Dinklage, who has the somewhat depressing honour (for all other "dwarfs") of being the first "Dwarf" to receive a decent roll in a film that doesn't mock him. Quite the opposite in fact, he plays an intelligent, womanizing, cunning and witty person who so far is, in my opinion, the most likable, and it has absolutely nothing to do with 'Aww he's a "dwarf" and he's just like us', nah, he's an incredible actor that plays his role with utter class and completely convincingly, and after two episodes was able to make me forget about the brainwashing that Hollywood has inflicted on most people about, and I don't even know what is the politically correct way to say it, so "dwarfs". I apologize to Peter Dinklage if I got that wrong.There are a considerable number of important characters in GOT and at times it can get a little confusing, but you have to stick with it, it's worth it, and you DEFINITELY have to watch it from the beginning. If I missed an episode I'd be totally lost.The investment in everything from costumes to CGI has in no way been short changed, HBO pulled out all the stops on this one, which, I hope, means they're not going to just drop it (at least without giving it some kind of ending, as they DIDN'T with OZ for example).This is my first review, I'm aware it might not be great, but if you have a thick skin and can handle unpleasant content, then this show is definitely worth watching, but again, start from the beginning and watch as intended, don't try to "cheat", you'll only cheat yourself.This and The Walking Dead are the best TV shows currently on TV, but this, so far in my opinion, still has the crown.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to the Book, Excellent, a Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the books (the first three I have read twice, the fourth once). I love the books. So in theory I am pre-disposed to either like the series or hate it because it is not sufficiently like the books. It would be damn near impossible for me to judge the series as if I had not read the books. I have only seen the first two episodes of the series.All that said, I love the series. The casting is phenomenal. The acting better than some of the best mini-series. Tyrion is spot on (a phenomenal acting job and a phenomenal character). Jon Snow is spot on. Arya Stark, Cersei Lannister, Jaime Lannister etc, etc. The series clearly gives the feel for the book and is true in its characterizations. No series will have every plot detail of a book nor will it have every character exactly as every individual sees him/her, it can't, but this series is very true to the book, true to Martin's writing and true to the character of each player. I can't wait for the next episode. I want to own the series on DVD (Blu ray). I want to go back and read the books.This Series is a must see in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On finding Game of Thrones on VHS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard much and more of the popular HBO series Game of Thrones, I decided it was time to journey to Blockbuster and acquire mine own VHS copy of the show. So I loaded up my VHS rack, five of my favorite dogs, and a Costco-sized box of Reese's peanut butter cups into my trusty Honda Accord.The only Blockbuster still in business is way in the South part of town, so I was in for a long quest. If it wasn't for the sugary sustenance provided by the Reese's cups, the companionship provided by my dogs, and the listening pleasure of "The Lord of the Rings" (unabridged) on cassette tape, I could have very easily gone mad.Although many long years had passed, Blockbuster was just the way I remembered it. The same off-white plaster, squarish building, with blocky Blockbuster lettering on the front, and the promise of a plethora of VHS tapes within."I come seeking the Game of Thrones," I told the young man at the counter. "On VHS. Please bring it to me forthwith."The young man, who's naming plate said Scott, was a dubious knave, clearly of lowbirth. He squinted his vacant eyeballs and knitted his bushy, bear-like eyebrows and said, "I'm sorry, but we don't carry that on VHS.""Do not play such games with me, boy," I warned him. "I see your Game of Thrones display right before my own eyes.""Yeah... those are DVDs. I can rent you a DVD?""A DVD? Do you take me for a fool, boy?""Hi, I'm Adam, the manager," said a trollish-looking imp-man. He had long snaggly yellow- brown teeth, and two large, watery eyeballs that seemed way too large for his head. "Is there a problem here sir?""This guy wants to rent some VHS tapes," said Scott, the idiot."Okay. I understand. I am very sorry sir, but we no longer carry VHS tapes at this location," said the imp.What game were they playing here? A video store without videos. A riddle worthy of my late tutor, Brometheus.Clearly they were both liars. For some reason they didn't want to rent me the Game of Thrones, but why? What secrets were they trying to conceal?But I was tired from my long journey. And I was starting to crash from the sugar from all the peanut butter cups I had eaten. And the sound of the dogs howling from the car reminded me that I hadn't fed them or given them water in a great while. I had no choice but to leave this cursed place."Psst." On my way out of the Blockbuster, I heard a strange sound. "Psst. Hey buddy. I heard you want a VHS."There was a hairy, hunchbacked man standing half in the shadows. He was clad in stinking garments. He smelled like a rancid applecart full of old cheese and rotting apples."I got all kinds of VHS-es," he whispered breathily. He opened his cloak to reveal a hidden collection of VHS tapes, more than one could count."Do you have Game of Thrones?" I asked."I have Game of Throats," he replied. "It's basically the same thing.""Fine, I'll take it." I gave him five dollars.After watching Game of Throats several times, I have come to the conclusion that the production values are poor, and the script is pretty weak for an HBO series. But despite all that, it is just as captivating as everyone says.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 6 Reasons to Watch "Game of Thrones"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I too have eagerly been awaiting this show, hoping against hope that it would actually be GOOD. I'd rather shove razors into my eyeballs that watch disappointments like Legend of the Seeker, Robin Hood, or any other pile of recent Hollywood "glop" that is passing itself off as fantasy fiction TV these days. Luckily, Game of Thrones lives up to its hype and, in my humble opinion, may actually change the way fantasy television is made from now on.Reviewers in this thread have already provided the basic outlines of the story, so I am not going to bother with that. What I will do is provide the top six reasons to watch this amazing series:1. It has child actors...and usually I avoid shows with child actors like the plague. They irk me. But Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) and Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark) actually give two of the best performances in the series. They aren't the type of child-actors that you feel like giving a good smack to. 2. It is dirty! That's right. Not everyone wanders around with modern hair-dos from Rodeo Drive, and never gets dusty. People are costumed and adorned as they would have been in medieval times. Does Lady Stark put on a fancy new dress when the king comes to town? NO! Do the villagers all have perfectly-laundered and pressed garments? NO! Are the castles and palaces all sparkling clean? Heck NO! This really just adds to the realism of the whole series.3. Peter Dinklage. Even if the character of Tyrion Lanister had been a regular-sized man, this performance would still be Emmy-worthy. After a while, you begin to forget that Tyrion is a dwarf, until he reminds another character of it in the story. He is the perfect, drunken fool with a brain born for stratagem. 4. The Opening Sequence: The theme song is one of those tunes that will get stuck in your head for days. That's a bit annoying, but having the clockwork map in the opening sets up everything beautifully. A viewer gets an idea of the scope and world of the series.5. The Sex: Some people have been whining about it. Well, this show was never meant for Mormons (no offense to Mormons...I watch Big Love too). Often shows have these boring, long, speeches of people explaining things. They go on and on and are necessary, but DULL AS DITCHWATER. What Game of Thrones does, is allows characters to give these endless expositions that viewers NEED to hear to understand the story, while also throwing in a bit of raunchiness. It works! No longer boring. 6. Lena Headey: I bet everyone thought I was going to mention the performance of Sean Bean. Yes, he is perfect for his role. But I think Ms. Headey really shines as Queen Cersei. She's definitely the villain...yet you can't help but like her a bit. She has this amazing smirk too that almost looks like she is about the laugh and cry at the same time. You can see there's always a lot going on in her head, but can never tell what that she's actually thinking. Where do her actual loyalties lay? It's a mystery...and that makes her character even that much more intriguing. So, those are enough reasons for now. There are countless more. Watch the show. And if you don't like it? Well, you're either dead inside or simply dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never read the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series, so maybe my unbiased opinion can be of use.From what I've seen from the TV show (2 episodes), I can assure you it's up to HBO's high standards.The fantasy elements are minimal in the first episodes, with only the chilling opener and some dragon eggs that seem not entirely dead ;) So what we now essentially have is a dark medieval tale. I'm wondering how they will roll out these elements in the next episodes.The atmosphere is extremely grim to American standards and the storyline will grab you by the throat from the very first scene.It has complex characters, all with their own agenda, which you just can't label "good" or "evil". They behave like normal people would. It is totally believable. No formulaic "comic relief" , no "cute" characters... How confusing this must be for some people :-) This is a series that doesn't threat its viewers as children and entirely lives up to the hype.An excellent job, HBO</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HBO bags another winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only began watching HBO productions a few years ago, so I had some catching up to do. I started with the Sopranos, and a fine choice it was. Ravenous for more of the same high quality, character driven TV, I turned to Deadwood. Again, my selection was rewarded with some absolutely tremendous viewing. Entourage, the Wire, Six Feet Under, Band of Brothers, Oz and Rome all continued to satisfy my viewing hunger. Then all of a sudden around 2009. It all stopped. Nothing new was out there from HBO.Then out of nowhere in 2011, like a Mike Tyson right hook, WHAM! Boardwalk Empire came along. 12 joyous episodes of the highest quality TV around.Then at just about the time I was recovering from the sheer joy of that, Game of Thrones came to air. Not a big fan of this genre, I sat down to watch it with a critical eye.....Eight episodes later, my critical eye has decided that this is probably one of the best scripted, most perfectly cast and absolutely gripping TV series I've ever watched.If like myself, you are a fan of complex human dramas, if you don't mind a bit (well a lot!) of violence and nudity, and if you love a good deal of intrigue, then this is undoubtedly a show you will enjoy.Again, HBO I salute you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It made me go out and buy the books!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And the above comment is high praise indeed from me. See, I had heard of the Song of Ice and Fire books, but most of what I'd heard about them focused on the "political machination". So, not being a terrible fan of politics, I gave them a miss, thinking they might be dry and dull.Then along comes HBO's serialization.....and I'm hooked! First episode has the promise of more traditional fantasy tropes in the form of undead monsters, along with THE most impressive opening credits scene to any show I've watched. To summarize, the credits show you the world of Game of Thrones, with the important areas paused on and expanded. Basically, a camera fly-over of the world. It sounds a lot less impressive than it actually is.Then the story begins. At this point in the first episode I knew absolutely nothing about the setting or characters. However, despite the depth of the setting, I never felt like I was lost, or that I had no idea who was who or what was going on. It explained enough to keep me happy, but did not try and deluge me with information.There is also an energy to the series that was infectious. Although there are (as yet) no major action set-pieces, the show moves along very smartly, feeling neither rushed nor dragging. And the ending of the first show pretty much guarantees the viewer will tune in next week! So it was with me, anyway. Not only that, but after the second show, I ordered the first of George RR Martins Ice and Fire novels. I felt there was more that I could know about certain things that weren't really explained well (such as the tree in the opening credits), and not just could know, but wanted to know.I've now read the first two novels, and have the third to hand. I'm very much impressed by how faithfully the series has adhered to the novels. Yes, there are occasional scenes missing or added, usually to streamline the information flow, but all the characters are there and the plot is, so far, 99% identical to the books.Also impressive, is how adult the series is. The novels never skimp from showing the brutality and sordidness of mediaeval life and neither does the show. I've just watched episode five and the "breastfeeding" scene (which I was sure would not make it into the show having read the book) and it is very creepy to see.As for sets they've not skimped on location shooting, nor have they shied away from other effects. The landscapes are sometimes startling, and the combat effects are gruesome rather than gory.Acting all around is superb, especially given some of the scenes the characters have to act out. A particular favourite is Peter Dinklage who plays Tyrion (perhaps my favourite character from the books) with such wit and dry humour that it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the role.If there is any criticism I can level at the show so far it is that some of the characters have had their motivations telegraphed a little too much so far. But it is a different medium from the novels and the audience does need to know who to root for to a certain extent as there are so many characters.All in all, I'm very impressed with the show and hope that it continues for a long time. I know the second season has already been ordered (presumably following the second novel's story, which will be a riot!) but I'm already hoping for a third season. The show is that good.I don't know how much money HBO have spent on the show, but it does show. There are no Hercules costumes here.If Lord of the Rings is the epitome of fantasy movies, then so far, Game of Thrones is the epitome of fantasy serialisation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having only read the books myself once, but living with a walking encyclopedia on the world of Westeros, I was very, very, very excited when I heard the books would be coming to TV. Hearing that they'd be done by HBO made me even happier because the story wouldn't be glossed over or sugar coated.The first episode in my opinion was definitely a good introduction to the story. You get a general feel of the characters, their back stories and their current situations. However, you're also deeply left wanting to know more about certain characters, like Ned Stark's sister that Robert mentions, or Jon Snow's mother (still an on-going debate between me and my living encyclopedia).As far as the sex, violence and language go, I feel they are totally in line with HBO's standard, and in line with the book. People who complain about there being too much and compare GoT to Rome, may I remind you of all the graphic sex scenes and nudity in that show? At least in GoT (so far) we have not had full frontal nudity shots, like the one received from Octavia (I'm pretty sure that's in the first episode...?).I think this show has real potential and promise. People who aren't familiar with the world of Westeros might have a hard time accepting some of the things in the books, like the Doth'raki wedding scene, but there scenes in Lord of the Rings that can be hard to accept the first time round too ;) All in all, I am happy with the show, I believe it has stuck to the book much better than most book-to-TV adaptations, and wait on pins and needles for the next episode.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 10 for Balance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Minor spoilers ahead. Nothing plot-ruining, I promise.) I don't feel like I could begin this review without first mentioning some of the other reviews I've read on here. Considering it currently carries a 9.4, you don't need me to tell you this is a great show worth watching. But there is something that disturbs me. Just about every 1-star review I read rates it 1-star specifically because "there's too much sex!" (there's another reason that comes in a distant, but related, second which I will get to in a moment) Really? You pathetic busybodies who have never created anything have the audacity to denigrate another person's work because it's too sexual? This is the problem with America-we live in a society full of people so enamored with their hatred of sexuality (and it has to be noted, homosexuality in particular) that they will go out of their way to drag down anything that doesn't appeal to their prudish sensibilities. We're a land of knuckle-draggers and philistines so immature we cannot separate sexually explicit from pornographic.This is a story about intense lusts and passions---the lust for power, lust for revenge, lust for companionship and sex and all manner of things. It's frank and explicit and to eliminate the sexuality is to eliminate all the power of the story. I will be fair and say it may be uncomfortable for some, but those "uncomfortable" moments will comprise hardly 5 minutes of your total viewing time every episode, and if you cannot take 5 minutes of discomfort to enjoy one of the best epics in modern literature (and now television) you're more than free to return to hackneyed, deplorable safe-bets like C.S. Lewis.Secondly, there is a sizable minority of posters who say the show is sexist. A common complaint it's sexist because it reduces women to sex objects with all of the female nudity---which is the worst sort of vapid, can't-see-the-forrest-for-the-trees "feminism". And ignores the several instances of male nudity, including a very explicit (but tastefully done) love scene between two men in the mid-season. But this show also contains some of the strongest female characters on television. Yes, one of the main antagonists is a woman (I cannot say much more without spoiling it) but she is a shrewd, intelligent and well-developed character who is defined by more than deceitfulness.I've wasted too many words in response, so allow me to summarize: This is a brilliant show with an enormous cast and plot full of intrigue. Though the dramatis personae begins large and expands, it is well-trained on just enough main characters to allow us to connect and bond with the stars of the cast.Peter Dinklage's turn as the king's dwarf brother-in-law Tyrion Lannister won both the Emmy and the Golden Globe, and not without merit. He is easily the most compelling character on the program. My only complaint is that Tyrion seems to be the only character not entirely reproduced faithfully from the books. (Although Sansa Stark does undergo some minor personality changes to compensate for a couple of the minor characters from the book who were not included in the television series.) Tyrion's intellectual side is covered in much greater detail in the books, whereas the series somewhat reduces him to a drunken lecher with some intellectual tendencies. I understand it makes for compelling television, but it does sadden me somewhat. I am hoping with the set up for the second season, we will see more of Tyrion from the novels.Particularly bold, in both the movies and the books, is that no matter how central a character is to the plot, it is no guarantee they will survive. Could you imagine of Lord of the Rings had killed Frodo halfway through The Two Towers? Infeasible as it may seem, if George R.R. Martin had written Lord of the Rings, it would be a definite possibility. There is a sense of danger in this world that epic fantasy tends to lack, and everything is better for it. While you may find yourself missing a certain character, a new one will undoubtedly find itself a place in your heart.Just don't get too attached.Overall: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I'd heard of Martin and his work, I came to the series not having read the books. The show so far has lived up to my expectations with a well-assembled cast and the budget to explore the visual depth of a richly-drawn mythos. It is an HBO production and as such nudity and unflinching portrayal of more brutal aspects of their lives was to be expected. People in early history were much more intimately acquainted (no pun intended) with sex, bodily functions and death than many sanitized accounts would lead us to believe, so I find it adds an earthy realness to the story rather than distracting from it as gratuitous. Looking forward to the rest of the season!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent adaptation of an amazing book, with some notable flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the first book was released in 1996, I have been an ardent fan of the Song of Ice and Fire books by George R. R. Martin; the series is one of the best fantasy novel series ever written in my opinion. As such, I have eagerly anticipated the TV adaptation of the books. Now that season one has finished, I feel I am able to give a complete and fair review of this show.Season one of Game of Thrones does an excellent job of staying true to the first book of Martin's series named, not surprisingly, Game of Thrones. The plot of this book revolves around three major story lines: the political tensions on the continent of Westeros that eventually lead to a conflict known as the War of the Five Kings, the exiled princess Daenerys Targaryen who plots to reclaim the rule of Westeros that her family has ruled for nearly the last 300 years until Robert's Rebellion (yes, the same King Robert Baratheon in the show), and the awakening of an ancient evil known as the Others in the north beyond the Wall. The show aptly captures the essence of each of these three story lines, tying them together cleverly so that the audience sees how each of these three threads are being woven into one overarching plot. Given that even 10 hours worth of material is not nearly enough to tell the full story in the book version of Game of Thrones, the writers of the show should be applauded for brilliantly transferring to the small screen all of the foreshadowing, character motivations and personalities, cultures, drama, politics, and emotion of the book.The acting is top notch. Nearly every actor brilliantly portrays their characters just as they are portrayed in the books. It is worth watching these episodes over and over again just to see their performances. Even the children actors do a fantastic job. The sets and costume designs are also very well done - I wonder if there was any collaboration with those who worked on The Tudors, a somewhat similar series on HBO that reminds me of this show in terms of set and costume designs. Now on to the parts of the show that I felt like were disappointing. Even though HBO apparently sunk nearly five million dollars into each episode, the show still felt low budget. Perhaps the most disappointing part of the show was the fact that most of the action scenes from the book were either emitted or harshly truncated in the show. The choreography of the few action scenes that were in the show were mediocre, I felt. Given that the story largely revolves around a war, it is a bit silly to not even attempt to show any of the battles in this war. Budget constraints are no excuse - the History Channel does a fine job of portraying epic historical battles using almost no budget at all.Some other rather disappointing facets of the show that reeked of low budget was the fact that nearly every scene was a scaled down version of the scene from the book (save for the end of episode 9 - now THAT was brilliantly executed). For example, Khal Drogo's khalasar is a horde that consists of about forty thousand warriors alone, and yet no more than about 10-15 are shown at any one time. The result is that the viewer never really realizes how powerful Khal Drogo is and why Daenarys is such an important character. HBO could have used a little bit of creative CGI to easily show the true scope of many scenes from the book. The direwolves were also conspicuously absent throughout the show. In the book, they played a much larger role. I will say that I was pleasantly surprised with the CGI in the final scene of the final episode, however. Now why couldn't such CGI have been used for the direwolves? Budget constraints, I know, but come on, HBO had five million dollars to work with per episode - that's not exactly a shoestring budget (though admittedly, not such a large budget either - consider many one and half hour movies have cost over 100 million dollars to make).Another complaint I have with the show was some of the unnecessary sex sequences. Given the gritty realness of the books, it was certainly necessary to show sex and violence in the show to adequately capture the mood of the books. However, HBO went way overboard here. Given that it's important to squeeze as much plot as possible into every episode, unnecessary and extraneous sexual sequences serve absolutely no purpose other than to mollify desperate and horny teenage boys, and in fact cheapen the importance of the main story lines. I had the same complaint with HBO's The Tudors as well. So overall, this show did an excellent job, with some glaring exceptions. To sum up...PROS: Excellent acting, excellent portrayal of the plot, mood, and characters from the book, excellent sets and costume designCONS: Flagrant lack of action sequences, including failing to show battles in a story that revolves around a war, scaled down scope of many scenes, the direwolves didn't get the screen time they deserved, and unnecessary sex scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being acquainted with Martin, and multiple recommendations of the books by friends of good taste, I have never read the series. I saw trailers for the HBO series, and they looked lovely, but my wife and I never quite found the time to try it.A couple of days ago my wife wasn't feeling well, and we wanted to watch something...and a teaser about the second season caught our eyes. We both admitted to curiosity, so we started the first episode.The next day we finished the last of the ten episodes making up the first season. We never do this kind of viewing marathon, but Game of Thrones grabbed us completely.The acting varies, sometimes by intent and sometimes by the capacity of the actors, but the overall quality is far above average for TV drama. The cinematography is superb. There are visual elements from the season that I'm still processing two days after the marathon. (The last television I saw that had this combination of beauty and quality was Downton Abbey, and I never would have thought to link the two until this moment.) Best of all? There is a strong story, with multiple lines, and I have to think about and figure out the ways in which it works. Nothing is handed to me, and I often have no idea what will happen next. I have a chance to discover this world, and figure out parts, at least, of how it works.I have been delighted by the first season, and now am eagerly waiting until the second season begins. I have a nasty feeling that I have the first book in the series lurking in my bedroom, and I don't know whether I can resist the urge to begin reading....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hater's Beware- For the new viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is not about why this show is so great (see my 10 ranking) but a response to the haters who's comments I can't fully comprehend.If you have never watched this show before and want a true perspective, see below: 1. If you absolutely "in your bones" hate fantasy, then this show is not for you. Even though this show is 95% about people and their attitudes toward power, government and corruption, there is 5% fantasy. If you can't get beyond the 5% then don't bother.2. Yes there is a lot of sex. If this bothers you then don't watch. Is the sex always necessary to the plot? No, but it also doesn't derail the plot either. Pay TV like HBO has a lot of sex. If you are a puritan don't watch. The story and characters are so good that the "overdone" sex scenes are a minor issue.3. Yes there is a lot of violence. If this bothers you don't watch. The violence is there to serve the plot. This show is a fantasy but is more heavily based on Medieval history. Would you be shocked to know that people lived harsh, short and often brutal lives 600 years ago in the real world. If you want PC and sanitary homogenized entertainment, then this is not for you.4. Confusing plot- My response is yes and no. Yes, there are a lot of characters. Yes it is hard to remember all their names. Yes it is hard to follow all of the character interactions, what they are trying to do, who that hate, who they love, etc. If you want a TV show that "spoon feeds" you an easily digestible plot and a few easy to follow characters, then this is not the show for you. If you (like me) like to be challenged by a TV show and forced to think, analyze, guess and scratch your head, then you will love this show.4. The acting is amazing- I've seen reviews that "slam" all of the actors. Are all of these people crazy? Have they ever seen good acting before? Do not believe any of these nay-sayers. Amazing acting and amazing casting.5. The writing is excellent- Is is Shakespeare? No, but its extremely well written as is the source material. Since I originally read the books by George R.R. Martin, I have tried to read other books by authors like Stephen King, Dan Brown, John Grisham, etc. I've found that Martin's writing is far superior to these other authors. The show's writers utilize Martin's prose and often improve on it.6. Stereotyping (typical fantasy stuff)- Wow, I can't believe this criticism. Well yes.. there are dragons. And yes.. there is magic. This is about a stereotypical as it gets. The entire point of the show is to take your typical "fantasy" and turn it upside-down. There are no totally good guys. There are no totally bad guys. Someone you hate in Season one, you may love by Season 3. Characters also act like real people. They are fully fleshed and not just cardboard cut out's. I guess if you are looking for stereotypical fantasy, this isn't it, but there is no way this is stereotypical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasy... Is there a more difficult genre for TV? It is so hard to make a great show, and so very easy to completely ruin it. Experience has taught fans to be cautious as they've dealt with countless disappointments. It also skews opinion for the general audience (whatever that means, I rarely generalize), yet, I believe it somehow does.So, you've been hyped? We all were, which intensifies all positives and negatives. I won't praise it too much, other reviews do that quite well (and not quite so well). Here I'll try to address the people who haven't seen the show and are trying to decide whether to watch it, or have seen some but are still undecided whether to keep watching. Therefore I look at what turned most people away (from what I've read so far). The confusion. There are many characters in A Song of Ice and Fire and really no easy way to introduce them on screen. They all play a significant role and although things will be omitted, it will still be... epic. The first episodes will be the most difficult to follow. HBO know this and are trying to relieve the problem with various features and guides. Go check them out if you were frustrated by the scope of the show. It really has to be given a chance, at least several episodes, in order for it to work. The sex and violence. There is a lot of sex and violence, I agree. But is it really that much different from other shows by networks unconstrained by ratings? Boardwalk Empire, True Blood, The Tudors, and so on and so on. Would it be a different story if this wasn't fantasy? Perhaps. Have in mind that all of this is much more prominent in the books (without being anywhere near a theme), it's not thrown for the sake of it, and it serves a purpose - to build the characters. The plot. Someone said predictable? This is one of the most unpredictable stories ever told. It's big and complex and it goes to places you'd never expect. Or wish. It's not history, so there are no moments like "Anne Boleyn? I know how this one ends... Just a matter of time." It's not fairy-tale like Lord of the Rings where the good guys ride dragons and eventually defeat the bad guys. There it all comes down to how exactly the bad guy will be killed and how many fictitious extraordinary places we'll visit before it happens. Eragon is predictable. A Song of Ice and Fire is shocking, surprising and very, very addictive. Game of Thrones therefore has a huge potential to be just like that. If you are willing to let it do it's magic.Why the hype? Surely some will be disappointed due to it. But the reality is, because of the genre (and the series is not quite what is expected of the genre), HBO needed to bring in as many people as possible and hope that enough of them will go the distance of several episodes I'd assume are needed to achieve the "crack on paper" effect of the source material. So, don't feel cheated. It was expected that some (perhaps many) viewers will not understand and like it.Last point. It is not fair to judge an entire show from a single pilot. I'm sure halfway through the season those who watched without being too involved will not regret it. Those who changed the channel will miss a great fantasy story, and well told at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOVED IT! A Series steeped in Passion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched an encore last night and I was so enthralled with the grit and texture of the piece, so much, that I was emotionally and mentally whisked away into a fantasy world of passion. Passion of love, death, power and life. My lover and I watched it several times in a row last night, until we were totally and absolutely filled with satisfaction. It brought back all the great memories of epic films such as "Braveheart," &amp; "Lawrence of Arabia," that we adored growing up.We felt the acting was spot-on! The men were men...and the women...well, shall I dare say delicious! The costumers surpassed our expectations by again being accurate to the times and yet revealing a subtle teasing of the beautiful women's forms (Lena &amp; Emilia)...and the locations were breath-taking. There aren't many films...and definitely NO American TV Shows that even come close to being as exciting to us, as this one. Lena is possibly the most lushish woman we've ever seen.Being a history nut, I was thrilled with the successful attempt at depicting the brutality of the medieval era, including the sexual scenes. Traditionally, the women were mounted from behind by their lovers, which is accurate to that era...and it was exciting.My lover and I took full advantage of the fantasy and ravaged each other after-wards. Thank you for Producing such an exciting and emotionally thought provoking TV Series.Please...give us more! Especially Lena.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And so, the story begins?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very premature to say much about the series after watching only the first episode, so I'll limit my opinion to the one and only episode that has been broadcasted so far.First of all, I'm a huge fan of George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" saga and I think that it's really a breath of fresh air that the genre needed so badly! I would hate to see this HBO series ruining all the good things that the books have brought to fantasy genre and thankfully it's not happening, at least not with the episode one.Of course, almost immediately, the one that has read the book can see some differences, but they are all understandable (well, almost all of them), since no screen adaptation can follow the written work to the letter!The viewer is gradually introduced in the world of Westeros just like in the book, without 20 pages/minutes of prologue and the narrator explaining all that once was, and all that is today? The main characters are very decently portrayed so far and the careful viewer can, more or less, flair what relationships they have between themselves and what part will they play in the story, at least for the time, just as the writer wanted us in the beginning? Speaking of character relationships, there were some very good sublimations of more than a few pages of the book into just one scene, one sentence or even one screen shot! That's actually desirable in order to keep the pace of the adaptation going! The plot is developing just as it should, not too fast, not too slow and with an omnipresent touch of intrigue and mystery? The production is more than fine. The costumes are good, the scenography is good and the cinematography is good. One can easily immerse in the mix of history facts (considering the gear and the lifestyle of medieval folks) and the fantasy world of "Seven Kingdoms" and the "land across the narrow sea"? And now it's time for some spoiler alert!!! My main concern is about undead! Is it a nighttime or a daytime when the dead girl comes back to "life" and walks the forest, only to spook the young ranger of the Night's Watch in the opening scene? This can mean a whole world of difference between the book and the series?The other is the lack of "dreams" and "flashbacks" the main characters have. Those play the major role in the book (in my opinion, at least) and I only hope that the director and the producers are keeping them for the episodes to come?All the other concerns I'll keep to myself as they are a bit contradictious to the book but they aren't crucial to the storyline. At least, not as I see them right now.On the other side, the writer of the books hasn't finished the saga until now and he's participating in the making of this series, so I hope for the best?All in all, it's a good start! Actually, a very good one I would say. I really prefer series that starts moderately good and develop to an excellent one than ones that start promising and then lose all of their initial appeal along the way, like "Legend of the Seeker" for example. At least, this one has an excellent foundation in R.R. Martin's brilliant work.I'll give it a 10 not because it's spectacular but because I, for once, am an optimist and I really do hope that the screenplay will be able to preserve the original novels' charm. At least, for the first episode, it did?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heard a lot about this show with everyone saying how great it was so I decided to watch it to see if it was as good as I was told. I found the first episode a little boring and slow but figured it was setting up the characters, etc.Well from there it went downhill. I watched all of Season 1 and half of Season 2 and I couldn't stomach it any longer. In my opinion, none of the characters are all that likable and the few I did like get killed off very quickly, usually with much gore.Then there are the numerous and pretty graphic sex scenes which seem to be thrown into the show for the purpose of titillating (pun intended) the audience who I assume to be in the 18-35 bracket. I'm not a prude, but I never saw any tender love scenes, just gay sex, incest and rape. It's pretty much soft porn with a story.By the last episode I watched I couldn't care less about who regained control of "The mythical land of Westeros". I hope parents aren't letting their children watch this debauchery.Everyone has their own opinion of what is a good show and this, in my own opinion is utter garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is based on a series of novels written by the very talented George R. R. Martin. The show contains everything a truly amazing show should. The acting is phenomenal and the accompanying cinematography, story, sets, visual effects, and writing simply can't be found anywhere else. GoT tells human stories in a fantastic world running rampant with magic and otherworldly things that provide thrills and really hook a watcher in. The show is well done and one that shouldn't be passed up. All the characters (even the villains) are nearly impossible not to get extremely attached to. If you think important characters in other movies or television shows have met gruesome deaths your whole view will change after seeing Game of Thrones. Truly no character is safe. In conclusion the show is the best show that there ever has been or will be. A man will always love Game of Thrones. The acting is amazing and the story is gripping beyond belief.

		<shortDescription>The game is on...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a life-long fan of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game, it is a hard thing to not be familiar with the "Game of Thrones" series. And yet it took me five years after the pilot to start watching it. But it should be said, then, that I haven't been able to stop watching it since I started, and I have sat through four of the seasons so far in a very short time.What works for me in "Game of Thrones" is the extensive storyline, with multiple houses working against one another or with one another all in order to obtain power, wealth and the crown to the realm. But also the myriad of intricate and detailed characters that are in the series, that is just spectacular. Especially because anyone of these characters can die on a whim, so you never know who is safe.The costumes are sets are fantastic, especially because there is so much attention to detail, both mundane and flashy. And it really works out so well, because you really think that you are in a medieval fantasy setting with dragons and knights. And also the special effects play a big role in the series, although not the point where the show is dependent on the special effects. Of course, having good CGI is particularly important if the dragons were to be realistic and believable.I like the politics and the alliances and feuds between the different houses and affiliations, because it is played out so well, and it is really well thought through by the creator.One thing that really is a thorn in my side if the excessive amount of nudity in the show, because it really sleazes up the series unnecessarily. The show would work out equally well with much less nudity and done in a more presentable way. But also the constant excessive use of foul language; here I am thinking of the "F-word" and the "C-word" that most of the characters are using frequently. It really seems out of place with the setting and atmosphere of the series, plus is also adds a wholly unnecessary level of unpleasantness. I am not a prude, but I think it is so frequent in the series that it is a downright annoyance.You quickly find your favorite character or characters in the myriad of colorful, quirky, scheming, bold, defiant and lovable characters. And likewise, you also quickly find ones that you most definitely do not like or even downright loathe. For me, the King Joffrey character was one that I instantly despised, he really pulled every wrong string in my being. Nothing against Jack Gleeson as an actor, it was just the character that he portrayed. And as such, when a series manages to instill such a relationship between the viewer and fictional characters, then the series is really worth watching, appealing to you on more than just an entertainment level.The slow build up of various events, and how the events have effects on the various houses and factions like ripples in a pond, really add enjoyment to the show. And you want to see more and learn what will happen next and see how the epic tale unfolds. Who will live and who will die? Who will stand victorious when the dust settles?"Game of Thrones" is really worth watch, especially if you enjoy the fantasy genre. I am rating it a solid eight out of ten stars, and the reason for it not scoring nine or even ten stars from me is solely because of the unnecessary nudity and foul language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the show from the very first episode and i could not stop. after 24 hours i have seen the first season and wanted more. too bad i had to wait a couple of months until season 2 was out. but what happened then was strange. i totally forgot about the show until shortly before the start of season 6. because of that i rewatched season 1 and then continued with season 2 - 5 in less than a week before season 6 started. i was shocked why i waited so long to continue watching it. the characters are interesting, the storyline always surprises you, the list of the great things is endless. the show is very well written and the cast is perfectly chosen. there are characters you immediately love and some you immediately hate. at the beginning its very clear who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. but over a couple of seasons this is getting more and more mixed up since everyone has their own agenda and like in real life no one is really only good or only evil and the actions of the characters are often unpredictable. whats also interesting about this show is that with season 1 it starts incredibly high in terms of quality and storytelling and it stays this way until today. this is quite rare. most shows either improve or decline after a couple of seasons but this one stays always on top which is a very hard thing to pull off, although season 6 might have taken a couple of shortcuts here and there. A realistic Rating would be something like 9.3 to 9.5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly Fantasy == Great Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt many take this show seriously because folks will take anything seriously. Just attend any Star Trek convention to see what I mean. That doesn't mean the show the fans go nuts for isn't enjoyable or that the fans aren't having a great time. Star Trek in its many iterations had and has a lot going for it as does GoT. Many whine and bleat about the sexual content or the violence or both. These complaints have merit in that the fact is that this series is Dark Ages violent and contains enough voyeuristic sex to keep any 12 year old boy going for months. The violence is hardly even up to the level that really has happened here on Earth at most times in human history. The worst we see as warfare is a good deal less than, say, the Vikings inflicted on the rest of Europe for many years. The worst of the violence likely is a veiled slight at religion. At one point, a dad burns his wonderful daughter alive to appease a god. Earlier, he did the same to many others not related to him. In another sub story we get a one on one torture - against nasty but also nothing that even approached what the Inquisition did to its targets. The sex is just silly and childish. The only persistent real romance we have among adults is a long standing incestuous one between a brother and sister. The rest is either male homosexual grab me while I grab you or recreational friction. Women have two states as adults. They can either be arch schemers or sex toys. The series persists in the laughable myth that a woman can be a long term prostitute and then, after 25 or so years of this, still appear to be a fresh as a daisy starlet. They also, for the most part, enjoy themselves immensely while servicing any male who wanders into their place of business. I suppose at graduation from high school girls are offered those two career paths. Most seem to choose being a prostitute.All this goes on while the entire place is under threat of, believe it or don't, a zombie attack unless the dragons attack first. As I said, great fun.</fullReview>

Despite it is independent of the books that are going to release, people is still adoring the series.After George had quit writing the scenario of the series, everyone start getting worried about that because they -and me- thought that they would mess up it and normally we were afraid of that. But fortunately they didn't against long odds. In fact, despite someone said that "they showed only the audience wants.", the sixth season was really awesome and finally some question ,that everyone was wondering, was answered and like the others, I'm very very happy about that.PS: If you haven't watched yet, it's not too late. :)</fullReview>

As you start off watching the show it takes time for the ambiance and setting of the series to sink in so that you can get easily accumulated every time you start watching again , a whole other world you sink into ; as you progress through the show you start to root for different characters and houses. The best thing is that there is no actual villain in the series but instead different houses that take people on different journeys. The only flaw I see for miles is the fact that there are only 10 episodes per season because once you start , you won't be able to stop yourself from wanting more and more....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the most complete comprehensive and epic narrative in the history of television. Adapted from George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" the series takes us through to the land of Westeros where medieval feudalism and misguided chivalry exist in tandem, where five major families fight for the control of the "Iron Throne". Filled with honor and betrayal, complete with dragons to zombies- this show promises to get better even more. When King Robert comes all the way to the North- the ancient kingdom of the Starks to seek help from his best mate Ned Stark, the honorable Lord decides to comply. The Queen is a Lannister- the villainous among the Great Families. Elsewhere the remaining siblings of the deposed Targaryens are also preparing to get their kingdom back. In this whirlwind of events starts the first episode. Truly speaking its very hard to leave your seat from then on. After the Sopranos' comes another masterpiece from HBO. Not seen it yet- well frankly you're really something. Coz' its simply the best.</fullReview>

I would not recommend such a thing because that is not the focal point of this show and its positives far out ways the negatives to you, moreover from what I have gathered from reading the reviews on this site is that such things are original of what is in the books so there you go. I do not normally rate shows that high but this one is worth it and have earned it. The story is unpredictable, the acting is top notch and overwhelming. if you are now about to watch from season one I would ask you to give it time to develop and you would be rewarded later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can have as many big stars in your film or series but it doesn't necessarily make it a winner. If you've seen The Cannonball Run 2 you'll understand where I'm coming from here.I'm sure there are some quite good plots among the series and I won't criticise that, but the acting is unnecessary. When you go to see a play at a theatre the actors will, even if there supposed to emphasize whispering, will shout with much drama. This is so the people at the back of the audience can hear what's being said. You don't need to do this on television, they use microphones and the audience has a remote to control the audible volume. In Game of Thrones however, the actors have obviously forgotten they're no longer on a stage in front of a thousand people, so they carry on in the usual Shakespearean fashion and that for me completely vanquished any interest I may have otherwise had.Now the thing I don't understand is this - the show has been on for about 5 years now, but it's only in the last year/18 months people have started talking about it. No wait, going f***ing mental about it. Why?! Why NOW!? To some people this show has become a religion and that's fine, but they're also folk out there who enjoy voyeurism and that's umm....fine too.</fullReview>

Yes, it is the biggest achievement of the show that how justified it is to the book series.. The originality, detailing and commendable acting, all contributes to making the show an incredible one. Having just watched first season, I'm spell bound by it and really looking forward to next seasons. Indeed, I postponed reading the book series to not spoil the suspense because I definitely know how things are going to be interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wow... where to start?! One of the greatest shows of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exactly what my summary says... Seriously, I could go on for hours about how great this show is and how just mind blowing it is. First of all it is based off of the series of books titled "A song of Ice and Fire" by George R R Martin. These books are better than the show (like most books are) but this is one of the best adaptations of a book that I have ever seen. First things first the acting. The portrayal of these characters and the actors and actresses that play that have an immense amount of talent. Even the children on the show know how to act and that just creates this show. The special effects are top notch and everything looks extremely realistic! The set design is beautiful, just to see this whole other world is truly amazing. The script is sophisticated and it comes together perfectly. And after all those amazing compliments its really hard to find a negative thing about this show because the twists and turns it creates always will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more!!!! This is another one of my MUST WATCH shows because its one of a kind. Even though the nudity can get a little out of hand at points this show is one of the greatest shows of all time. I recommend this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic first season but losing interest due to character deaths and scattered story lines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having got myself right up to date with GoT with a megabinge and finishing on, what is currently Season 4 episode 4 I feel there is enough within 3 and a bit seasons to give it a fair review, but.....for a series that is still going it can only be a review of what it is "So far!" and not as whole because who knows what will come next.First up, Season 1....Magnificent, glorious, stunning, original, daring, explicit, all these words and more I could pour into the season 1 cup and it would not have room for the rest. Every episode is absolutely gripping and you are dying to find out what happens next. All acting is superb and bettered only by the mind blowing production values (Seriously, I have seen Hollywood feature films with cinematography and visual effects that aren't this good!) and thoroughly mesmerising scripts. Make no mistake, this is no Harry Potter, or even Lord Of The Rings and it is absolute NOT for children! The gore is shockingly OTT and the sexuality, constant full frontal nudity and the harshest of expletives makes for a very adult series indeed but this time it has the drama and stories to fully back it up.Seasons 2 and 3 unfortunately sort of meld in with each other and here's where the cracks start to appear and......well you know why really but we'll get to that later.*Spoilers*For a start the shocking end to Season 1 sees the young son Rob march to war for revenge. This march takes over 2 seasons and he never actually gets there and by that time I lost interest in his cause and had to actually remember why he was doing it in the first place. The programme becomes a mish mash of crossed stories following characters around different parts of the world, some I really liked and wished they'd focused on and some I just couldn't have cared less about.Of course the biggest flop for me is the repeated killing off of lead characters. This has been a heated subject on the internet and I am afraid I am on the team that thinks negatively of this. Once was shocking in a good and bad way and really kept you on your toes. Twice, was a little annoying but by the end of the third season there were precious little characters left that I cared about. I know G.R.R. Martin has said he does it for shock value and to be unpredictable which is fine but if you kill off the people that viewers wast to know more about it's also an interest killer too and in that I could feel it happening to me as the cast numbers dwindled. Call me old fashioned but the real world has enough bad people getting away with killing good ones so I like my fantasy a little less grim than that and more heroic. Of course I applaud the rick that has been taken but as I say it's been done a bit too often now and is becoming dangerous to the story.There is still much to watch though, the wonderful Arya Stark branch of the story is amazingly well acted and there is still much to be seen in the Stormborn, section of the tale as is the ever watchable Peter Dinklage as the Imp. Alas the rest just isn't very interesting. Bran Stark's tale is a slow and boring one, Jon Snow's is par at best and there is just far too many separate stories going on to get your teeth into and care about.I can't blame the makers of the TV series though, everything has remained at super high quality throughout and even with the flaws they have managed to keep it watchable but still, they had better be careful with Mr Martin as although he has the perfect right to do with his characters as he chooses it might seriously make some viewers lose interest if he keeps killing off the interest points for the sake of shock.That's it so far, the series could get better or worse but we shall have to wait and see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It will be more a comment than a review - lots of information can be found, also recommendation's. But... I read every book before - 1 season was almost perfect - in mater of keeping script accurate to story from book. Second should be a warning sign for everybody "watch out ! I'm starting to be a different story" Third season was a nail to the coffin - in the middle, about episode 5 or 6 I start to suspect that Elvis Presley with Yeti will jump out from the next corner. Maybe We will see Yoda or Lord Wader in this production soon.I don't want to spoil anything so no further details. I understand the needs of some extra sub stories to build tension or explain some more complicated trails but making complete fiction is a different story.I strongly recommend to everybody - read the book carefully - it's worth it ! You will discover a different , and amazing story.What about HBO production - really good when We are talking about TV entertainment. I watch every episode and I enjoy it. ( apart of script- to-book accuracy )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this review short because I doubt there's anything I can say that hasn't already been said. Basically, I was drawn to this series because it appeared to be a cable TV version of 3/4ths of the video games I play (Skyrim, Dragon Age, etc) and I have to say, I wasn't disappointed. I watched all of the first 3 seasons within a weeks period of time on demand, and it seems that each season only got better. At first I was daunted by the number of characters and locations, but it really didn't take long to get to know the people... at least the important players. The characters have real depth, and it's hard to completely hate or completely love any of them, because most of them have good and bad traits, just as we all do in real life. I recommend this to anyone who is into fantasy stories or RPG video games!</fullReview>

It really had everything, for me it was probably the best Game of Thrones episode along with "Hardhome" and "The Rains of Castamere", although i enjoy every single episode of this amazing TV series. There were three things with this episode that made it so outstanding, Ramsey's death, the long battle scene and the fact that the episode really performed on a level that was expected, especially when the three episodes before this one was very weak. I needed to be reminded of how good Game of Thrones is, and that was exactly what i was.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.There have been a couple of great TV-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale AND quality, 'Game of Thrones' is ? at the moment ? in a league of its own. A joy to watch: breath-taking, epic ? and highly addictive ? Television. 10 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

I thought the first few episodes were a little dull, however they explain a lot about the story and if you plan to watch, i'd suggest you listen to them carefully (Of course I was on my phone and looked up wiki pages to explain what I mist) The overall series is brilliant. If you haven't watched it, i'd suggest you do, it's for everyone, no matter what you like, you'll be hooked on it. I myself a big lover of the whole dragon/sword fighting, my mother who is more into soaps, my girlfriend who loves the likes of Twlightlight and my brother who hates the whole sword/dragon type series all love it, no matter what you like you'll love GoT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is a beautiful adaption of its famous books. Drama at every corner, action at the blink of an eye, this TV show sets the standard for any genre of TV to a new High. The Performances are amazing, the special effects are stunning, and the plot has so many twists and turns you'll be begging for more and more. I started watching this show just to see what all the hype was about and boy did it exceed my expectations. I finished all the seasons in a matter of weeks (I had a lot of free time on my hands). While its a long show (each episode is about an hour or more long) it is well worth the watch and it can turn even the sportiest bro into a warlock-loving nerd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As season conclusions go, "The Children" was more dramatic than previous years. Tyrion escaped King's Landing but not before slaying his father and his former lover. Never before has an act of patricide been more justified. After orchestrating last year's Red Wedding, dying while on the toilet was an apt death for such a vile man.Then there was Bran, who finally reached the three-eyed crow but lost Jojen Reed to a White Walker with a penchant for stabbing. The battle between the rag-tag gang and the undead was an impressive sequence that kept viewers on tenterhooks. Bran's storyline requires a lot of patience but the waiting finally paid off.Overall, season four has best of the best of them, even if "The Children" failed to deliver. The season has also deviated more from the novels compared to previous years, but in most cases these changes have benefited the show and condensed the substantial source text admirably well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid I was fond of Age of Empires, Rome total war and many more strategy games. Have seen many films and series of kingdoms, kings and war. Including the great Indian Mythology 'Mahabharat', but none of them come miles closer to Games of Thrones. The art of kingship along with its struggle, blood and destiny has never been better portrayed. Games of Thrones takes you to a fictitious world in which you start believing and feel as if you are part it. Games of thrones is surely excellent for its cinematography,acting along with raw depiction of truth but its uncertainty and sudden change of events is what makes it the best. Waiting for next season.</fullReview>

This show really has it all. One warning is not to fall too much in love with any particular character or dynamic. Nobody is safe when playing the Game of Thrones.

I know that "A Song of Ice and Fire" is way way better than the show. There is no doubt about that. But can you imagine 20 million people reading 10 chapters of book at a same time and talking about it. No.That is no way possible. So this show has given opportunity to enjoy this EPIC story together. We should be grateful for that. GRRM himself said that "It's like my dream come true." I'm also angry at unnecessary changes from book but prefer to let it go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow this really is an exceptional show. I wasn't sure if it was going to be able to live up to the hype but it far exceeded my expectations. My initial thoughts were that maybe people loved it because of all the sex scenes or maybe it was excessively violent, well it has both but it contributes to the storyline in a way that enforces the barbaric nature of a time long ago. Everything they have done feels calculated and necessary to tell the story properly.Game of Thrones feels like a cross between Lord of the Rings and The Tudors. It is situated in a fantasy world and a historical period drama. The production quality feels like a big budget movie and they have assembled a team who seem to genuinely care about creating a quality show. Out of all the actors, Peter Dinklage is my favourite. He is great in his role and steals the scene from his other cast members. On the other end of the scale I hate the evil b!tch they call a queen and the snivelling prince sh!ts me off. Why does power always have to go to some people's heads. (I'm only 6 episodes in so my opinion could change)At this point I am very happy with the direction of the show and look forward to many more seasons. I may even decide to read the books as I can't help but want more of Games of Thrones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HBO has really outdone themselves this time by ordering 'Game of Thrones'! Several months ago I refused to watch this show because I don't like the fantasy genre, but i decided to buy the first episode on iTunes, then I became addicted. I ordered HBO and watched it on demand. This show has everything: violence, drama, sex, and surprising moments. 'Game of Thrones' is an outstanding idea. The writing, acting, directing, and effects are unbelievable. But a lot of main characters die very upsetting and shocking deaths. I recommend this show to anyone who loves violent dramas. But head's up: there is a lot of graphic sex and nudity. That's why it is on HBO.</fullReview>

It's such an exciting series because you can't anticipate what is going to happen next. there are many twists, shock deaths and retributions keeping the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the series and in my opinion Game of thrones is the best thing on television at the moment, no doubt!</fullReview>

The cuts of the scenes are also terrific, making viewers want more. Possibly the best TV-show as of today.

All above is really above average. I didn't liked the hype either form the start and i started watching in 2013 i think...first two episodes from series one wasn't enough, there was just too much confusion and it was hard for me to concentrate/orient in everything going on the screen. Third(S01E03) was like a bait for fish. It completely hooked me up and just had to watch the rest. After i watched first two seasons ...i couldn't wait any longer and i bought the books. ...rest is not important.Anyway there are some flaws and cliché i think, but as a whole pack this show is on top along with Breaking bad.</fullReview>

The first season starts rather slow as its mainly character introductions but stick with it it takes a while to learn everyones name but you'll get used to it. It doesn't really pick up in action till around episode 6 so i recommend you give the entire season a chance by the end of it you'll be hooked. I've never given a 10/10 to anything but this show comes closest. Season by season there all pretty solid each season seems like a different show due to the large storyline changes. Game of thrones has some top class actors such as Sean Bean, Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Charles Dance, Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and many more i constantly recommend this show to everyone i know and everyone loves it.</fullReview>

Of all things that can be truer to the time they pick vaginas? And what time had magic dragons and beasts? Come on. And they complained about the rape my goodness gracious. First of all not rape. Second of all its a show, if you can't deal with this stuff emotionally don't watch it, simple.And the male castration/mutilation/violence is so much more. I mean the castration of Weak was elaborated on over EPISODES it is sooo much. And after watching all that they complain the women are mistreated.

		<fullReview>The show has brought in some of the most talented children i have ever seen. They are much better actors than a lot of stars today. It deals with real life conflicts, following George Martin's masterpiece. It is a production that you know that they've worked on from the bottom of their hearts. They want to surprise you more. This is one of the most talked about shows in the world, yet the cast and crew always have a sense of improving. They give more and more every season.The only downfall of this show is the presence of some boring episodes. However, these episodes are essential to get the story going. The only thing that i found that some find extremely appealing which others find as a huge turn off is the presence of dragons. But the thing is, those dragons aren't just added for the sake of it. They incorporated well into the story. Plus, the cgi team is working brilliantly on them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>as the summary says, this show is pretty much one of a kind, and anyone who hasn't seen it yet and likes good shows in general should watch a few episodes at least to give it a try at the very least(it simply hooks you in in the first few episodes ). I won't divulge the story or give away spoilers, because I wouldn't won't anyone to spoil it for me as the story simply is so well crafted, that you just want more once you start watching it. To give some of my own input why I really loved it, let me say that it doesn't take the classical route of pretty much 90% of TV series ever made having a main character around whom the whole story evolves (and you know they are immortal or immune to the bad stuff that can happen and should happen in any series in order to give it that drama factor that makes a series draggable for more then a season or 2 to make it worthwhile watching and not bore you to death up until the moment you stop watching it...yeah it happened to me with "Fringe"), but instead it shows you this magnificent non Hollywood world- environment/storyline where anything can happen...and it does!...and this is something that kept me and still does to this series and can't wait to see the next season (if you are wondering about how much I watched, just compare the review date with the series release...I am always up to date watching it :-) )</fullReview>

Its unpredictability is its usp.Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. This is what the plot in short is. We come to see betrayals, seduction, secrets, loyalty etc. There are a lot of people who complain about nudity, but there is not that much. But yes its show meant for the adults.

		<fullReview>Puff, were to start from?!I watched approx. 10.000 movies and about a hundred of TV series, the modesty I know, I know... anyway the reason i write this review is to share with you all my thoughts...Some of you may like it some of you may not, it's a free world and I respect you choice ! If some of you will say it's a matter of taste I support you guys too. Anyway again that being said lets start:THE "GAME OF THRONES" ... (background music: angels singing Halleluiah)The STORYLINE is absolutely epic, the strength point of this series is that the intrigue levels are so deep you need a big flowchart or a map to fully understand how the characters evolve, involve, interact, disappear, experience the unknown and so on, i can take any of the characters and subtracts lots of connections with other characters, and this web of intrigue levels makes this Series a gamble. A gamble in what sense, well this complex net makes an Achilles weak point, if the director of this film would not make a good directing, all this complex relations between the characters will fall over his work and BOOM, disaster! Is like building a space ship for the first time or so, you want the reach the stars but you have to think to 1000 things on every step, that's challenging and i respect the director for his work, Good Job !Characters, a very good acting skills, they are not flawless, but i think everyone contributes to this grater good, the good of the film, and overall they do a wonderful job. I like and think the idea of the undead, to be more specific the frozen undead, to be an Blizzard Idea from the Warcraft I guess (only a thought). It's a bit bloody in the actions and wars but hey it's a damn realistic for that era. Good costumes, acceptable CGI(dragons are a bit Celisse), but hey overall captures you attention fully. Mystical symbols, raven , trees, wolves, swords of some material and so on, makes the series catchy and easy to remember. I think people are very susceptible to this sort of symbols and like them, as a marketing view point its the smart choice that adds commercial value to the movie although i personalty think its kinda silly.I will not spoil anything, maybe some of you haven't see all the series, but i liked the acting of Theon Greyjoy (very good acting skill).Sounds and music are very carefully selected and it matches perfectly the mood of the series every episode. I personally don't like the long intro but, I can pas over it. I like the fact that conversation generally doesn't stack over the background sounds, this is a simple and a clean idea which i appreciate, it shows that your attention should be focused on the conversation, and every conversation adds value and new meaning on the evolution of the characters and the story.Things I don't like: 1.Long intro, damn it's long start already i want to see... (I think every time i look at new episode) 2.Dragons, raven, rituals, and other smoked symbols (Celisse my opinion) 3.Lack of big and more open spaces (usually fields, castles and sea)Things I like: 1.Acting 2.The stories and scenes 3.Characters, lots of races and types, complex connection between them 4.Sound and music pops the interest 5.Everything else.If you have another opinion feel free to get the f__k off! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dinklage makes a better Tyrion than one in the books!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a Game of Thrones fan way before I saw the actual series. I have had the privilege to read the books (some more than once) and I find the series one of the best written works ever. The TV series on the other hand digresses (naturally) from some topics. Even then, it is one of the best series I have ever watched! Tyrion Lannister for me is by far the best character on the show. He is witty, charming and multifaceted; the fact that Peter Dinklage has successfully managed to capture and emulate. There are several other characters; Cersai, Jon Snow, Arya and Danyerys who stand out.All in all, the one of the best series to watch!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This show has almost every possible element to attract fans from all ages. A political drama in a mythical backdrop this show is so captivating and keeps you on your toes the entire time and one keeps asking for more. One won't even realize 50 minutes can get over so fast! The show doesn't necessarily divert from the book, but when it does, one can find it to be a pleasant surprise. Performances. Brilliant. Storyline. Brilliant. The supernatural element is an interesting mix, and surprisingly doesn't disappoint the viewers. Though the cast is enormous and its easy for a fan to forget some characters and minor story lines easily.. a true fan will find that the little things matter and add onto the spice. The show doesn't hold back in any form of nudity (male or female) neither on gruesome and torturous scenes. All I can say is, if you've not watched the show, give it one episode. It's enough to capture your minds and hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to start off by saying that I haven't read the books and I definitely am going to start reading them once I have finished my exams. So this review is coming from someone who hasn't read the book. The first thing I'm going to talk about is the acting. I see shows like the walking dead that are action filled and have a decent story-line, but unfortunately the acting is where it falls flat. Now, I'm not saying I don't like the walking dead; I am just stating that it would be a better show if the acting was to be improved. Fortunately, this acting annoyance doesn't occur in game of thrones. The makers of the show seem to be a lot less careless when deciding who to pick and they haven't seemed to make any mistakes when deciding big roles. Tyrion's trial scene In season four was one example of how good the acting is and it remains as my favourite scene throughout all seasons. Second of all, the story-line. I haven't read the books and so I couldn't comment on how they have changed the story-line from the books to the show, but what I can say, is that the show has a story-line that gets you to check how many minutes you've watched of each episode in hope there is still lots left to go. Sadly, time flies by when watching quality television and so the Game of thrones episodes feel way too short. Finally, I'm going to talk landscapes. Now I'm not sure where they film everything, but it makes you think it's on an entirely different planet when you see the stunning imagery. There are many more things I could point out in this show, but I'm running out of time. To summarise, this show is action filled, has a good story-line, has strong characters from both genders and the acting is perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch for everyone with an imagination!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its heartwarming to finally see the budgets that go into blockbuster movies finally making its way to TV series.Game of thrones is addictive to say the least, the vast amount of important charterers (not even the nerdiest of nerds could name them all) and each character having a detailed plot line and plenty of screen time means there are plenty of favorites to pick from. But don't start latching onto your favorite just yet because what keeps Game of Thrones so griping is that no character is safe. George R.R. Martin has had me at many occasions saying "what the ef just happened" or "shouting NO NO NOOOO!" as i watch my favorite character whom i thought was invincible getting the Axe. Anyway overall i would recommend this series to anyone and everyone (I have) because it is truly one of the greats and will sit on the top 5 TV series list for quite some time - 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The uproar on the internet intrigued me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasy is not a genre I usually on well with. S03E09 'The Rains of Castamere' caused so much uproar on the internet that it was hard not to intrigue me. I gave the show a second chance, it took a while for me to think it as more than mediocre (I think this was because it takes a while to learn who everyone is and what they are related to / trying to achieve in the show - it's a big cast), but when I did, oh god, did the TV shock me. There's a few moments where your jaw will drop. but after a while - the mistreatment of characters becomes second nature, despite this, this show still finds way to cause dismay. The end of Season 1 with Jason Momoas' character, the beginning of Season 2 (with the babies), oh and let's not forget S03E09. I mean, holy s*** - what happened. It's just. I'm not going to give an explanation about this episode, or this show because, one didn't sell it for me. It's very popular. it has comical and witty dialogue. There are so many story-lines and characters, intertwining to satisfy your thirst. Fabulous TV. Peter Dinklage was my favourite part about the show in episode 1 and that is still the case at the end of the 3rd Season. Daenerys a close second. She's 'bad*ss'. I'm still thinking about that episode. Roll on S04!</fullReview>

Quite plainly, if I was on my deathbed- and could only recommend a SINGLE piece of media once and for all time -- this would be it. Its the best TV show I've ever seen....best books I've ever read.....best story ever told....and its not even over. If you Don't like it...?...well you're just wrong and that's all there is to it.I could write 1000 more lines but I simply don't feel I need to...my recommendations are as good as guarantees....I will work to try and establish that reputation I have in the real world, here on IMDb. Figured I would first establish the top of the list and the ''commandments'', if you will, before I wage a crusade about things like how Adam Sandlers performance in 'punch drunk love' is one of the most underrated of all time. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible, one of the best works of modern fantasy fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just joining the choir in saying that this is a truly amazing show. There is very little negative to say about it. Everything clicks together: the acting is beyond fantastic, the production values massive, the visual design convincing yet just otherworldly enough to feel unlike our reality. The dialogue is truly exceptional: In this series simply watching two characters talk can be just as, if even more, exciting as any swordfight or heroic quest. All the major characters are well-rounded and excellently cast. A special mention must go to the child actors, all of whom are simply fantastic in their roles. Despite there being a ton of characters they all have a part in the story, and the individual stories rarely drag on.It's actually easier to list the few nitpicks one might have about this series than try to explain all that is good about it. First, some of the characters sometimes border on caricatures, especially King Joffrey. Second, the massive amount of nudity and sex feels at times gratuitous, sometimes hanging on the edge of good taste and can make you feel slightly dirty watching it. Third, though not much of a criticism, more of a thing to be told is that there is some grisly stuff on display in the series which can be hard to watch, especially during the second season.But beyond those three tiny nitpicks, one can find very little to criticise about this series. This is, quite simply, one masterful series, and is showing no signs of slowing down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great work based on the best book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had very high expectations from this series and I believed that it will (like most TV series) absolutely ruin the book. And I couldn't have been more wrong! Where do I start...The cast is great, though not amazing with one exception - Sean Bean is perfect for the role of cold master of the North, Eddard Stark. The setting, the atmosphere is perfect and not boring at all! Some scenes are just amazing and are exactly as written in the book - for example the scene where they find the wolves, the nature and the dialogues are just as they should be. Now to get to the part most people are interested in: What is this? What can I expect of the series?This is a great TV presentation of Martins epic books. However if you have read the book than you can be disappointed if some characters are not nearly as what you have imagined them by reading. There are two main problems - Red Viper Martel of Dorne and Sir Loris Tyrell who are the best heroes of their fractions manly characters who we gay in TV which is disgusting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winter Is Coming, and with it a New Era for Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasy has, for many years, been regarded as a genre for mostly children. A few notable exceptions being The Lord Of The Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien , His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman and Wheel Of Time by Robert Jordan , have defied this bias by providing imaginative and emotionally as well as intellectually resonant stories that stand among the best in English Literature.Genre Television too, has suffered from a similar bias,turning off many viewers who have little love for complex fantasy story lines and many long,confusing names. Elements such as magic or fantasy creatures have been dismissed as "childish" and 'simplistic".These two would, in theory, produce a poor mix.Game Of Thrones defies these notions even more resoundly than any work of epic fantasy before it. A staggering show full of lavish production values, dazzling visual sound effects, and above all, a raft of extremely memorable characters with their own story lines and ideals.Based on George R. R. Martin's "A Song Of Ice And Fire" novels, the main story focuses on 3 major story lines: The eternal conflict and power struggle between the Great Houses of Westeroes known as the titular "Game Of Thrones", The Oncoming threat of Winter and the mysterious ancient creatures it brings and the chronicle of a young girl named Danaerys Targaryen, last of an ancient family, and her return to Westeros to exact revenge for the death of her family and downfall of her house.Here we see that medieval politics,dark fantasy and classic drama are intertwined to produce a rare cross-genre hybrid. Genre blending in general is risky as it can tend to produce shows that lack proper identity and purpose. Game Of Thrones avoids these pitfalls by toning down some of the pure fantasy elements (magic, mythical creatures)and focuses more on it's political subplots and character drama, resulting in a show that appeals to both hardcore fantasy fans as well as most non-genre viewers.The writing is magnificent across the board. Martin himself heavily influences the production of the show, in both managing story lines as well as the writing of the characters. Much credit must be given to D.B. Weiss and David Benioff, showrunners on GoT, for extracting the best dialogue from the books for the characters to work with. Given that at the time of writing of this review , the show has indeed surpassed the books' storyline, how the showrunners can continue to produce high quality drama without the great authors prose behind them remains to be seen.The Acting is among the best in TV. The anchor of it all is Peter Dinklage's powerhouse performance as Tyrion Lannister, a character often described as the main reason for the show's continuing success. Dinklage brings weight, dimension and humanity to a complex, riveting character that would have otherwise been wasted on any other actor. Lena Headey continues to shine as Cersei, along with Emillia Clarke, Maisie Williams, Aidan Gillen and a host of other actors turning in great performances.Warning to those who have yet to see the show: The show is dark in many ways more than one. The World of Westeros is a parallel of the real world during the dark ages, filled with corruption, cruelty and vice. Nudity, language and violence are core elements of the shown, seen in every episode. While little to none of it is tasteless, a strong stomach and a very open mind is required to truly appreciate Game Of Thrones. The graphic and disturbing nature of the show has overwhelmed many in the past and will continue to do so. Traumatic is often used to describe Game Of Thrones, as many characters the audience comes to identify with can be and often are, brutally and unexpectedly murdered. The show can be harsh and unforgiving, a mirror of the world it portrays.Game Of Thrones is dark. It is brutal. It asks sophisticated questions and denies us easy answers. And it is also beautiful, witty, complex and breathtaking. Whatever your views on fantasy or dark drama or TV in general, it is a show that demands to be experienced.It has heralded a new age of Fantasy Television. We may never see the likes of it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You need a lot of patience to watch this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please note that I have not read the books. So this review is completely based on the TV show.My my! What a show this is. It has a brilliant story, character development which is done very well (some movies / TV shows don't even care about this), and a whole lot of sex scenes and gore!Yes,yes. I know. The first 4 episodes of the 1st season are boring as hell. It takes quite sometime in introducing all the characters, it confuses you as to who is what, but after a point of time it all gets fine. This show knows who must you hate, and who must you root for. It does this job perfectly. (Tyrion Lannister is my favourite. Peter Dinklage, you are an awesome actor!) There is the element of suspense, the action, the tension, the politics, the drama...so whats not to like about this?Probably because of its slow start, loads of sex scenes, and confusing characters. I mean, come on. The sex scenes are unnecessary. I do agree with that. But whats to complain about it? When you have hot actresses like Emilia Clarke and Rose Leslie, why are you complaining? The books probably had them. So if they are staying true to the books, then what is wrong in that?You will get used to the characters in due course. So be a little patient about that. All the characters are well-acted by some really good actors. It was good that they shot some scenes in the Dothraki or the Valyrian language instead of everything in English. It instills that feeling of that medieval age thing in you.The main reason why i did not give this a full 10 was because of its very very slow start and that some parts of it that are still boring me. I really don't care about Stannis Baratheon or that Red Woman or the Greyjoys. Which is a bummer, coz if they start focusing more on someone who you don't like much, then you might probably start skipping their parts. You start to feel as if their parts could have been fast forwarded in terms of their storyline. One good example i can think of is the White Walkers. i don't hate them in terms of their character, but they have not done much damage at all other than the opening scene in Season 1 Episode 1. I want to see them to do more damage to someone at least. They take so much time to cross the wall itself!!Overall, this is a great show with a few flaws. And just because i gave it a 8 does not mean i don't like it. I love it. If you can imagine, I sat 4 hours a day watching 4 episodes each day and finished watching 4 seasons in just 2 weeks! Its that interesting sometimes.So do not Google it, or even YouTube about this show. Coz there are idiots over there who have put so many spoilers here and there. So just go to some torrent website, download this and have fun.!I've tried my best to give a spoiler-free review. Thanks for Reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! Seriously, wow! I never thought I would say this even though this show does get political sometimes (I never understood politics so there's no reason to be invested) but this is the most intriguing, shocking, heart pounding suspenseful, intense, hardcore, gut-wrenching dramatic, fantasy drama series I have ever witnesses in my entire life! I see why it trumps the Sopranos. I just adore how heavy and dark this show gets every time I watch it. It's a show about seven noble families battling their way to take the Throne in Westeros. It's slow at times but it's a long journey, it''s supposed to be slow. There's a lot of focus on the characters--which are a lot, by the way--but my favorites are Tyrion Lannister played by Peter Dinklage, Arya Stark played by Maisie Williams, and most of all the gorgeous mother of the dragons who steals the show, Daenerys Targaryen played by Emilia Clarke. There are other interesting characters but those three are my personal favorites. Tyrion is a dwarf but a very intelligent, smart-ass, Shakespearean member of the Lannister family, the most hated people in the entire show. He knows his family's a group of evil people and they are his family but he doesn't agree with their methods very much. He's the only Lannister in the family who's close to being almost good, regarding him as more of an antihero. Arya is a very young, strong, courageous child who is more of a fighter than a child and fights with her thin sword called the Needle, though she is still a learner, but brave nonetheless. It's so admirable that a child this young (probably 14) could be so daring and tough. And Daenerys is a girl (probably in her twenty's, she looks young) who becomes the mother of dragons--which, to the special effects' credit, look really impressive--and uses them to fulfill her goal: reclaim the Throne of Westeros. She's basically a conqueror with legitimate motivations which also makes her an antihero/hero. There really is no MAIN character which makes the show more intriguing, but those are my personal favorite characters of all time. I won't give too much, it's better if you go to www.cokeandpopcorn.ch and watch it. Aside from the fact that it get's political sometimes, there are other intriguing stories and characters that I think you would thoroughly enjoy. It's so dark, dramatic, exciting, brutal, and unpredictable. Game of Thrones, one of my favorite shows ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This series has wittily aggregated ancient and medieval history of mankind - mostly focusing on aristocracy, but this is the history we know, through the eyes of wealthy and powerful people of those times. Both the novelist and screenwriters have done a great job, creating a credible atmosphere and focusing on different "ordinary" persons, not powerful creatures with supernatural forces. Of course, the viewers can recognize various books, sagas and epics of different times and nations, but references, patterns or profiles are not "modernized" copies too often available in the U.S. movies depicting ancient or medieval events. The other strength is the use of different filming locations in different countries, creating a real picture and avoiding intensive use of digital effects. Viewers who have traveled in Europe have nice joy of recognition. And of course, the cast - from several countries, including character actors from Great Britain, and giftedly chosen child actors. As for personal contribution, the most imposing to me were Sean Bean as Ned Stark, Peter Dinklage as Turion (won Golden Globe for his performance) and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister - a Brit, an American, and a Dane, respectively. But even smaller supporting roles were deliberated and well performed. As for the use of violence or erotica, I cannot agree with them who think it was unnecessary or too much; those thinking so are apparently not good at history :)For the sake of the best comprehension, you should see all the episodes and preferably more frequently than once a week. And it is better to have a graph of characters at hand as - throughout the series - there are several hundreds of them opening their mouth at least once, and most of the names and places are not easy to memorize either.Anyway, I am looking forward to the Season 3 already, although it seems that the weight of fantasy/magic increases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones may be the best book-to-movie(/TV show) adaptation I have ever seen and is also the best fantasy I had the chance to enjoy. Not being able to calm myself until season 3 came up, I started reading the books (at the moment I'm at "A dance with dragons which is the latest volume in this series of so far) and can't say how happy I am to see that the TV adaptation stays very close to its roots - not only because the author of the books also helps writing the scripts for the episodes. Of course there are many events which had need to be cut or even left out but as a reader of the books I assure anyone that watching the series does not leave you with mere impression of what is delivered on written paper. "A game of thrones" aka "A song of ice and fire" is: clever in its narrative; entertaining and really complex but therefor way more satisfying than anything I ever watched; brings up political and even ethical questions in a way which doesn't make them look cheap;.... just puts a shame on every single badly-delivered fantasy series out there ...If you haven't watched it yet - even if you're not in fantasy or knights and swords - you may want to give this series a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an addict. I love movies as I love TV series, drama, comedy, war ? all genres. As long as a production has something to give, to pass to its audience, I watch it.I'll start by saying that Lord of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movie series ever made. It made me drift into this fantasy world, full of magic and beauty complemented by blood and hate. Game of Thrones is the single TV series that has brought me close to that feeling of warmth and for that, THANK YOU! It tells a story on many planes that always intercept at some point, it links the power of name and blood to the will of the people, it gives meaning to the word 'honor' and it surely makes you step into another dimension, that of kings and magic. I'm not talking about real magic, or not the 'Harry Potter' type at least, but about the magic of life, love and power. You barely can handle the week between the episodes, keen to see what comes next, what will that lord do and how will that prisoner escape, keeps you on your toes. It gives you the feeling of 'everlasting', wishing that it will actually last forever because: IT'S THAT GOOD!I will end by saying that this series is unique compared to all TV series I've seen, better than Rome, Spartacus, The Tudors, etc? It's the closest you can get to the 'nobleness' it stands for so proudly.</fullReview>

Having both played The Elder Scrolls series of computer games, Morrowind, Oblivion and the latest Skyrim ,dragons included, we were both struck as to how similar it was. However it is in every way a superior example of the genre brought to life on the screen. The acting is superb, costumes, sets and CGI all blend seamlessly into a visual feast for the eyes. I would recommend this to anyone who has even a passing interest in this sort of medieval fantasy world. All I can say is HBO better not do a DEADWOOD or ROME and just wander off to pastures new leaving the fans all wanting more.Just wait until those dragons reach adolescence!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones can't be qualified as a typical TV show. It can be easy defined as an exceptional work made for TV. HBO once again showed us how TV show can be made like the best in movie world. After Sopranos and with Boardwalk Empire they gave us real pleasure and enjoyment in front of TV screens that don't look like TV show, but rather quality long running movies.I did not read a book that series are based on, but as a freshmen to the theme I can only express true pleasure with this TV show.The plot breeds in tradition of any medieval fantasy story, reminds me partly on Lord of the Rings with old classic movies scent, like it is Ivanhoe or Robin Hood for example. Also the smell of Merlin and Boorman's Excalibur are strong here.From cinematography to direction, everything is a first class, and actors are wonderful. Sean Bean is at his best here unlike some movies where he lacks his true potential.I am kind of impatient to see next season, but I am sure it will be pure pleasure. I can tell you this, after watching such a show and other I mentioned here, you will never again watch at so many TV commercial crap that exist today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment from a lover of the books</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought and read Game of Thrones the year it came out. I was hooked, bought and read each book the week it came out. Book 4 left us wondering what was going on, where we were going, but book 5 put us right back on track.Martin is an extraordinary writer, with extraordinary vision. But as a lover of the book series, i cannot love the HBO series.As a stand alone series its second to none, with incredible characters, story and acting, but it has begun to stray so far from the books now, it has destroyed the books.The first series stayed very true, as did the second, but after that it strayed, and the latest series, well, i could not finish watching it.I would not recommend reading the books if you watched the series, or watch the series if you read the books. Now i understand that most books do not convert directly to the screen. LoTR was a classic example of this, and Peter Jackson (barring a couple of epic failures) did an incredible job (though he murdered the hobbit). But Game of Thrones you could have converted 99% to screen and not deviate almost at all.Sadly i wish i had not watched the series now, as i feel i will not enjoy book six as much (if it ever arrives).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Dinklage and Charles Dance...absolutely brilliant, My boys kept on at me to watch this show for a few years so I obliged by sitting down and watching episode 1 of Season 1. A week later I had got through to the end of Season 4. I am just about to watch Season 5. I have to say this has been one of the best TV shows I have ever watched. I cant emphasis enough the brilliant acting of Peter Dinklage who for me absolutely steals every scene..with the exception on occasions of Charles Dance. The CGI is fantastic and the action sequences are excellent. It took me a while to fathom out who was who with all the Names/Houses etc but once I got my head around them it was brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay i admit it, i never thought i'd be watching a series such as this. I only started watching it because one of my favourite footballers watched it! And i was so addicted, an amazing show with a great storyline. I love how some of the characters are so lovable and others are not. My favourite definitely has to be Tyrion Lannister, Arya Stark and Jon Snow. Its so hard waiting nearly a year for the new season to start again but I'm glad there are books which i am hoping to read soon. It can be quite difficult to grasp the storyline at time especially because i am not used to shows such as this, but listening carefully and sometimes just googling stuff i don't understand really helps. I finished all four seasons in four days which as you can tell i was very much addicted. I would recommend all viewers to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best TV series of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing this as I am re-watching the first season On Demand in preparation for the April 1 premier of the second season. Currently the original series is rated at 9.4 stars with 94,807 votes; I don't recall ever seeing a show rated so high, and with so many votes. This was a fantastic production, and I'm looking forward to the next installment.I originally watched the series when it first aired. I had not read the books, and to be honest, didn't exactly know what I was getting into. I had thought it was set in medieval Britain, but I quickly realized the story is set in the mythical land of Westeros. This mythical setting allowed Mr. Martin the flexibility to write a fantastic tale of human lives, with love, hate, honor, betrayal, sex, lust, war, and other struggles that would have been something less had it been set on Earth. I did download an app for my iPad that was called the GoT companion, and this provided me much of the back-story that was not explained in the series. I thought the production was so good that I purchased the books once the series ended.It seems most of the low ratings and poor reviews disliked the show because of the sex and violence. I find this humorous for a few reasons, the first being that the show is clearly rated AC, AL, N, V (AKA: Adult Content, Adult Language, Nudity, Violence). They show the ratings at the beginning of the program so that children, young and old, will not have their delicate sensibilities infringed upon. Secondly, the story is set in another time, on another world, with other gods and religions; from what we've seen so far, it appears that their gods and religions are not obsessed with human sexual practices, unlike several of our Earthy religions. That seems like a highly civilized concept if you ask me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As this is not necessarily my genre (sci-fi being more my type of interest), I was sceptic about getting hooked on such a medieval/fantasy series. Especially during the pilot, I wasn't sure if I would watch it until the end.Though the captivating storyline, the excellent cast, the breathtaking images and landscape, the soundtrack and especially the suspense and almost subtle but suffocating twists did the trick for me.Games of Thrones is a gem of a series and I am hoping to watch many more seasons!Thank you for such an excellent production!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow!!! This is a series you won't regret watching, it was amazing from start to finish, each episode was superb. When GoT aired on Sky Atlantic here in the UK I couldn't watch it because like 60% of the population I don't have Sky TV but another digital TV provider.But I am so glad I made the effort to watch this online. I was hooked and spent three days watching the whole 10 episodes last month. This lead me to buy and read all of the books released so far. I am eagerly awaiting season 2 and even though I've read the books it wont diminish my pleasure as I know the producers can and will do justice to this epic tale.Thank you HBO, well done and please don't stop until George RR Martin writes the last book and you have delivered us the entire story, I look forward to a few years of good TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no word to explain my gratitude to the Directors and George Martin for not messing with the main story in the books and adapting the show right as it should be, no like the mokery named "Legend of the Seeker".For newcomers, this show is unlike what you normally see on TV, much as the books are. Everything is so real and every decision and turn of events is like what could've happen if this story was in the real world.Every episode is a great feast for the eyes and must be seen if you are a fan of fantasy series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You did not fight nobly!" "No... (Points to the chasm he pushed his opponent into) He did!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we think of fantasy novels, classic myths, and epic stories in general, a consistent theme in all them is that basic, easy-to-identify good is fighting against basic, easy-to-identify evil. Think of Beowulf fighting Grendel and his mother, or Frodo trying to destroy the one ring, or Odysseus trying to get back to Greece. The heroes are instantly obvious because they are all handsome, smart, and wielding some sort of blessed weapon against their ugly, brutish and stupid opponents. Game of Thrones completely throws away these preconceptions and creates a world where there are plenty of easy to identify villains but a terrible shortage of easy to identify heroes. The series takes place in a Middle- Earthish world where seasons last for years; the summers are times of plentiful food, sunshine, and peace, but the winters are brutal, nasty, and infested with armies of creatures called "white walkers" that consume everything in their reach. Fortunately, they sleep in the far north behind a great wall of ice during the summer. The series takes place during a nine year summer that is about to end; white walkers are said to have been spotted rising from their slumber, but the wall is maintained by bands of poorly supplied soldiers that are either too old or too incompetent to fight them off. The human kingdoms to the south aren't prepared either, for enormous amounts of court intrigue and corruption constantly threatens to explode into civil war. As if all this weren't enough, the descendants of a mad line of kings overthrown decades earlier have settled into a wild land across the sea, and are building an army of ravenous horsemen to retake their throne...If you don't want your innocence ruined, don't watch this series. But if you want a bloody, seductive, and much more realistic version of the fantasy genre, the Game of Thrones was hand made for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no fan of history shows, whatever type it be. Yet i do enjoy this show. And that's no little thing, especially when it be coming from a startrek/stargate addict. It's purely fictional, yet it ressembles Middle Age England. I admire screenplayers and actors for using a pretty strong language sometimes, yet i have no criticism on that, i believe it makes the show more real. Truly brits. I wish i had a detailed map of the Realm and a genetic map of all the characters. There are so many distinct characters, sometimes is hard to keep track on who's related to whom. I don't know why IMDb.com is forcing me to write at least 10 lines of text on this subject! If i'd write 10 pages on it, it still wouldn't be enough.

		<shortDescription>A great HBO producer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only let yourself go, sit back and enjoy the magnificent history that gives us the great maker HBO series that for many years (The Wire, The Sopranos, True Blood, Band of Brothers, The Pacific, Generation Kill, Treme, Boardwalk Empire, makes Carnivale, Oz, Rome, Six Feet Under, Sex and the City) has given us one of the best television products ever. For many years they have dared everything: Mafia, crime, prison dramas, even met them well with vampires, but not content with that, after signing, to my three best exponents of war films, namely, "The Pacific", "Band of Brothers" and "Generation Kill", or the extraordinary series "The Wire", decided that a medieval set in a dark and gloomy world drama was something they had to do and they did. They took an expert on the subject, Timothy Van Patten and began directing.They issued the first chapters highlight especially for its magnificent setting, something that Jackson achieved with Tolkien's work, and although the magical element is not yet developed as will, sure, this new series goes on to become the must of the season for fans of the work and unaware of it, it is not necessary to know the continuous struggles of the noble houses of the continent invented by the power to sack enjoy a mix of "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Pillars of the Earth" by instance.Houses "Stark", "Baratheon", "Lannister" and "Targaryen" are already more than outlined in the first deliveries and although it will be impossible to fully adapt all the work, the result is truly more than promising. Betrayal, jealousy, revenge marriages of convenience and populate our screens, in a magical and fantastic setting slightly reminiscent of medieval Europe or even to Middle-earth in dark times.Extraordinary work of the actors, especially Sean Bean. Anyone with cinematic memory remembers how much he did enjoy his role as "Boromir" in the trilogy of "The Lord of the Rings". Magnificent setting. Credible, very style of Peter Jackson's trilogy, but less bright and colorful scenes. Good script, carrying a ponderous plot that teaches you step by step what life is like in that world, the viewer leaves much work. I like that. Just it needs to see a few chapters to certify that we have a great series only available to HBO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This show is damn awesome. The location, the characters, the targeriyans, the king's road, the dragon egg's, the mad king, the loyal friend, the bastards, the dwarfs, the traitors, the plotters, the unholy lovers, the pet- wolves, the night's watch, the WALL, the blue eyed spirits of the haunted forest, the noob who becomes the king, the cunning lannisters, the prince with blonde hair, the tyranny surrounding the word Khal Drogo, the gulf of grief, the chameleon Baelish, and much much more!I don't generally prefer TV shows because they run too long and the story keeps never ends. Luckily my friend recommended that since entire season 1 is out there, why not watch it all? Here's the twist, each episode is a master-piece. I watched first episode, my mind blew-off in bewilderment of the 'pure' violence &amp; love, the characters displayed to play the Game of Thrones. The Baratheon King is a extremely cunning character, who never takes the center stage and yet remains purely in power. The Starks are the most lovable family with an unfathomable family pride. The all- powerful Lannisters, a family or kingdom in themselves. The bastard dwarf is one of best characters I have ever seen in any TV show. A character so tiny yet so powerful. Tyrion Lannister's dialogue delivery &amp; portrayal of 'the bastards' is absolutely stunning. He is chatty and witty, probably the only Lannister without the trademark characteristics of a Lannister!and I could go on and on about the other characters!More than anything, all episodes remains absolutely loyal to the title, 'Game of Thrones'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never read the books so had no idea what to expect when I started watching this series. But everyone I knew who had read the books raved about them, so I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I don't know that I would've stuck with the books if I'd started those first, with some subjects, I find visual images more interesting than printed versions. I have to say, I'm officially hooked, and have just finished the fourth series. I've never been disappointed with most of the acting, some of the leads are particularly good. The people you're meant to despise do an epic job of making you feel exactly the right way. But then again, some of those I hated at first have now become my favourites, the character development has been excellent. I found some story lines truly shocking and upsetting, since I'd grown to really care about the people involved. It has a lot of fantasy elements also, which make the story even more interesting for me. The CG is really good and hasn't disappointed. The violence is quite extreme and very convincing, and has made me gag a little now and then, but it just adds to the realism. Some of the sex scenes are also a bit gratuitous, but nothing I'd really complain about. There's only one main character who's got on my nerves to the point where I hate her scenes, she's so smug and self-entitled, but seems to be a favourite among fans. I'm hoping she either gets knocked off her high horse (or rather her dragon), or she develops some humility and grows on me. I'd highly recommend this show to anyone. I never believed I'd get so immersed, but I can't wait for the next season.</fullReview>

For example there are characters that even though we know they're just acting we either hate them with all our might, we cry when great characters die, and we feel connected with these well crafted characters.The story is on a very large scale that at first seems impossible to keep track of because it's so large but eventually when you adapt to the show you know exactly who's who and what's what. Once you get there the show is a non stop enjoyment with some of the most memorable moments in television.There's lots of sex, graphic violence, and so on and some complain about it being a "porno" but to me it wouldn't feel right without all the exploited things in this show. If you are into a show you can hinge nearly nonstop without getting bored here you go.</fullReview>

Generally i don't watch fantasy and drama genres but started to watch it then season begins between two royal families and kept on watching season by season that made me worth to watch its twists and waiting others to come.In this show every character has equal importance with a nice screenplay.Main theme song is nicely composed. After watching three seasons i can plot it in single line, main aim to capture the throne but having lot of depth involved mainly in betrayal. Be patient to watch the show then only it will be interest if not don't judge it by seeing two to three episodes. Till know there is no flaw in the show hope not will be in coming seasons also.

		<fullReview>Perhaps I'm not being as objective as i could, even then this amazing series is one of the most stunning TV shows, don't know in the future, but right now its possible and probably the best TV series.GOT haven't point of comparison with other series like breaking bad, homeland, mad men, I'm sorry for those who like this series but they just not as good as GOT, don't matter what the EMMY's says, i like to believe that we already know how the EMMY's usually works for the benefit of just a few. talking about braking bad, or mad men that i also enjoy, are a really good TV shows but also are more popular, made with the objective of make more people to like it without being too risky or controversial, or mature, I know that GOT its some times harder to watch (for some people) because this series wasn't made for everyone, was made to be the best show, something like no other TV show, epic, savage, crude, and surprisingly real in the human behavior, of course attached to a fantasy story with dragons, magic, epic battles, and so many secrets to discover.I literally don't have all the correct adjectives or words to describe it (english is not my native language) and even if i loose some objectivity rating this a 10 over 10, the great work that all the people involved put in this series deserves no less than a 9 rate in a movie/series rater website, considering that if u give it a 9 that will mean that there is no other series capable to have the same rate.In all aspect, from technical, sound, video, editing, mixing, direction, cast, actresses and actors, story, plot, script... in every single aspect it's a flawless piece of work.Just want to say Thanks! to George R. R. Martin for write this great story., and to Emilia Clarke just thank you for existing and being part of GOT.Thank you to all of you in Game of Thrones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do people always compare series with books?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My title says it all. Why do people compare series or movies with the books? Series or a movie can NEVER be as good as a book! I almost never read books but when you read a book you use your imagination and your imagination is ALWAYS better then seeing series. Just to say that the comparison is pure rubbish. You can compare series to series, movies to movies and books to books but not compare a series to a movie or a book to movie, etc.. Some of the critics here say that the cast is bad. I dare people to make a better cast for this show, especially Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister is superb. I never read the books and I think Game of Thrones is awesome. Maybe it's because I never read the books, maybe it's because it's just a brilliant show. But only for the opening credits you can give this show a point or 2 extra. I say this without any doubt in my mind that that is the best opening of a show ever made.For the people who compare this to LOTR. Yes, it's a bit of the same scenery with the knights and the fortresses but except for that they has no similarities. LOTR is mostly known for their epic battles were Game of thrones is more about honor, love, betrayal,... . And as I said movies can't be compared with series. This is a perfect example. In series it's much more about character building with lot's of characters were movies focus more on one character or like in LOTR they focus more on the mission of destroying the ring and the story around that. You can say that the ring is the main character in those movies. Game of thrones has lot's of main characters (The Lannisters, The Starks, Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, Theon Greyjoy, etc.).What I think about this show is that it's the second best series I've ever watched (except from breaking bad). If you like a well written, well acted fantasy series with lot's of drama, action and humor you should watch this show. You WILL like it !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is easily one of the best shows on TV at the moment along with Breaking Bad, and is perhaps one of the finest ever. The detail is incredible and every episode is superb. Peter Dinklage is entertaining as are the rest of the cast, but with such great detail into the whole world of Westeros it's easy to understand why every character is so enigmatic and wonderful- whether their evil like the tyrannical King Joffrey or kind-hearted like Emelia Clarke's Daenerys Targaryen. Season 1 is probably it's best so far, but with episodes like 'Blackwater' and 'The Rains of Castamere' each season is assured to be a thrilling watch, worthy of your attention. Any show that can fearlessly kill off some of its best characters and maintain the same level of class like Game of Thrones does deserves attention and this series, despite taking a while to reach a pivotal point, is continually intense and never, ever boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As many people have mentioned, it is great to see a book to film adaptation that really stays true to the book. The books are so amazing in their depth, and the complexity of the world was unlike anything I had ever read. In a way it was almost like a dramatized version of a true story. The fact that the series has stayed so close to the books is rather surprising since even books with much simpler stories tend to lose a lot going to film. One thing I find very amusing is that most of the negative reviews that I read (and I read quite a few) were written by people who never read the books. It makes me wonder if they would have hated the books, or just hated the series because they didn't know what to expect, and the story doesn't fit the typical fantasy movie/series mold. ( Let me add that starting a bad review of a fantasy series saying that you hate fantasy stories makes no sense. If you know you don't like something, don't watch it!) Anyway, for a story as complex as this one to be adapted so well as this is a rare thing, and I am very glad to see such a great series of books turn into such a great series on film.I do recommend that if you are totally new to this series you read the books, or at least the first book before watching the series. While it is not absolutely necessary, I think you will get more out of it, and enjoy it much more.</fullReview>

I have never been so hooked up to a show.The story is extremely captivating. There are a lot of subplots, more or less interconnected to each other, each having its own characteristic "color". One can tell immediately that it is based on a good book.The characters are complex. A good versus evil split between them is hard to draw, since you can easily relate to them through different situations. This is very pleasantly surprising, given the fact that the show depicts a fantasy world, which would automatically lead to the good/evil split like in so many fantasy worlds (e.g. Lord Of The Rings, Harry Potter, Chronicles Of Narnia...). But not this show. Here you can see a fantasy world which is closer to the real one, where people act as driven by different reasons, beliefs or desires.The plot is often breathtaking, and the show is filled with shocking events, which make you question you expectations a lot. The drama is so good, there were a couple of big moments throughout the show where the major goosebumps I experienced were accompanied by trembling hands and wet eyes.If you haven't watched this show yet, you don't know what you're missing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The casting, acting, story-line, fantasy - well I could keep describing the outline of the show but there is no need for that, this is a great show, never before have I given a 10/10 but I have to admit this show deserves it, I hope it goes for further than 3-4 seasons, shows like this deserve to continue and I'm pretty sure everyone who has seen it would agree. Season 3 is something I've been awaiting for quite a while and my expectations are to be met, I am pretty sure of that, as so far game of thrones hasn't let me down, season 1-2 were amazing, specially how they twist the story and play with the cast, overall amazing. -latinohabanero :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Game Of Thrones" is becoming one of a legendary TV Show because of its PerfectionStory, Direction and Acting are just quite Marvelous and accurate, each episode have something entertaining to show, I would like to say that an hour wasting of watching "Game of Thrones" is not a quite wasting,Because You can't realize how smoothly this hour passes. Story Line is just Wonderful and unique. People are trying to compare it with "Lords of the Ring" But trust me, Here's no Comparison. As "Lord Of the Rings" was Legendary On Big Screen, In the same Manner "Game Of Thrones" is becoming Legendary on Small Screen, Only Two seasons have shown Quite things. Sometimes it seems now what is left to make? But as New Episode releases,prevails entertainment more and more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the first two episodes of Spartacus and I am unsure if I want to bother watching any more of that series. In stark (no pun intended) contrast, I was absolutely captivated by Game of Thrones by the first episode of the first season. I am pretty critical and up to the latest episode, I cannot say anything negative about Game of Thrones. It sets the bar impossibly high for all TV series. Game of Thrones represents the epitome of classiness, quality, character development, and it has successfully included sex and violence in a manner that is necessary for the story line.Kudos to all those involved! It is everything that Spartacus is not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the books and a chronic cynic; I had many concerns when I heard they were making the series; how would they bring these books to film and do them justice. My largest concern was the difficult task the actors were handed. The books are written from the POV's of numerous characters; each chapter having a designated character. So you are inside the head of a character for all the events in the books. You learn the character's traits and motivations through his or her thoughts. This obviously cannot be done on film, so it comes down to the actors to portray what these characters are going through without the audience being able to hear their thoughts. I cannot name a single actor that fails at this. This cast is exceptional. Some notable shout outs go to the young members of the cast who are so essential to the story. Cudos to Jack Gleeson, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, and Isaac Hempstead Wright for pulling off Joffrey, Sansa, Arya, and Bran so successfully. Another shout out to Jason Momoa for Khal Drogo. When your character speaks a language created for the show; it becomes even more difficult to portray that character. Mr Momoa does it so successfully you want to stop reading the subtitles and watch him perform.Another thing I was concerned about was the scope of the world and giving an accurate portrayal on film. There are so many descriptive locations in the books that needed to be shown to tell the stories. The locations were amazing. Most impressive to me were the Wall and The Eyrie; both whose features are not only difficult to portray; but vital to the story. The Sky Prison was just as I pictured.My only critique is how difficult it is to take large book with a large cast and portray all the important details within the stories. I watched the series with my wife (who has not read the books) and at least once an episode had to explain some things that got glossed over. But over all an amazing vision of an amazing series of books. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game Of Thrones- You Win or You Die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words cannot describe how amazing this show is. If you love medieval fantasy and are a huge fan of the "A Song Of Ice And Fire" series, this is definitely a faithful adaption.As mentioned above, the series is based on the fantasy saga "A Song Of Ice And Fire" by New York Times bestselling author George R.R. Martin. Each book has reached number one or close to it, respectfully. Set in a world reminiscent of medieval Europe, where winters can span decades, and summers can last a month, noble families vie for the Iron Throne and kingship over Westeros.The first season is phenomenal, and conveys mostly everything from the first book in the series, "A Game Of Thrones". Every actor chosen fits the character so well, you believe they ARE their character. Sean Bean, my favorite actor of all time, is phenomenal is Eddard "Ned" Stark, the protagonist of the first book. He conveys the emotions in Ned perfectly, and he the scene where.... Well, I won't spoil anything for you. It is really hard to praise just one actor with this show, as everything feels so believable.The sets and props are OUTSTANDING. Each weapon, each piece of clothing, has such detail, you just want to pause the show and look at it up close to admire the craftsmanship that went into such work. The sets, beautiful. Northern Ireland and Malta are the perfect places for this show to be filmed in. Every environment looks so natural, and fits the books very well.Now the special effects for a show with a budget of %50 million or so are.... Honestly, I can't find words to describe how amazing they are. Want to know how real they look? Go to YouTube and search "Game Of Thrones visual effects".If you are a fan of the books of medieval things in general, this show is DEFINITELY worth checking out. Some say it starts off slow, and yes, it somewhat does, but you will NOT be disappointed, since the show is only going uphill from here as it suits up for its second action packed season. Winter is coming, and by the Seven, I hope it continues to stay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is a great series, not mainly because of it's great visual effects, fast action and cinematic looks (although those are pretty good too...), but because of it's characters. They are all extremely believable and interesting, they really are the heart of this series. Should those characters be taken away, then everything collapses dramatically, for sure. Almost every line, every moment and every scene is filled with complicated and intriguing emotions and situations. With every episode the characters grow bigger and bigger, creating a realism and depth you rarely see in today's television series. The only thing that i found irritating from time to time was the fact that the environment (and perspective) changes a lot, giving you the feeling of hopping through the world, every time a scene gets really interesting, the camera hops away to another perspective. But that's a detail and doesn't nearly compare to the greatness of this series. I really recommend giving it a chance, you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HBO did a great job with this show. I was afraid they may not follow the source material (like AMC did with "The walking dead") or that their depiction of certain events and people/creatures would suck) but I was pleasantly surprised. All of the cast members did a great job and most of them really fit the characters their were assigned. The production values are excellent, everything looks as if this were a big budget film, it really must have cost them a fortune to make this show. Except for a few (mostly minor) exceptions they were really true to the book and all of the major events were shown with as much detail as they were in the book. However there were some changes I didn't like. The biggest one is the age of the "children" (the Starks, Baratheons and Daenerys). Almost every single one (except maybe Arya) is way too old. Rob and Jon are 14 in the books. Here they look to be in their late teens or early twenties. The same goes for Daenerys, she is supposed to be 13, here she looks like 20. In her case it would be somewhat understandable since the producers were probably concerned about showing a 13 year old girl f*cking like she does, but in the case of the boys I see no valid reason for the change, and considering that the events in the books so far span a few years where you see the characters growing older the decision to cast older actors seems rather nearsighted. The biggest age difference is from Rickon (also known in the show as the invisible Stark :P). In the book he is about 2. Here he must be 6 or 7 at least. Another thing I didn't like were the scenes that weren't in the book, like the ones with The Spider and Littlefinger or the homo-erotic scene between Stannis and Loras Tyrell and the ones that are in the book but not in the show, namely the battles. There are only 2 battles in the first book but we only see their aftermath in the show (and in one of them an important fact -certain deaths- is not mentioned). I can understand that this may have been due to a time constraint (they were trying to fit the entire book in a mere 10 episodes) but if it was due to budget constraints one has to wonder what are they going to do in he following seasons? Books 3 to 4 (I haven't read 5 yet) have dozens of battles, some very large (including a naval battle), that are essential to the plot. If they choose to only show their aftermaths that will certainly detract from the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Miracle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have finally found a modern TV series that genuinely deserves its IMDb score (9.5). When I was first told of Game of Thrones, I was very sceptical - mostly due to everyone going on about the sex scenes and violence. That's usually an indicator that the writers are compensating for a poor story / script (like most gangster films and shows). But here, it's being done to reach out to the more mindless among us and boost ratings further (which I think is a terrible mistake, because this excellent show would be even better with less gratuitous nonsense).So that's my one main criticism. Some people are defending the show from this and need to stop doing it. The sex, swearing, and violence are, at times, totally gratuitous; they are there simply for shock value. I think that's a real shame, too, because it devalues the work as a whole and dramatic impact relies on clever use of such scenes/language - to use it when needed. Like with the book, the use of the word 'cunt' (for example) is ridiculous. A word's impact on its audience is easily lost when it's used every single time and all the time. It's not clever, people. Please learn this.With that out of the way, let me tell you why Game of Thrones is the greatest thing I have watched since Babylon 5: 1. Main characters are not protected from death or serious injury. This makes situations far more believable and takes us away from mindless predictability (like Star Trek La-la Land). Things are far more exciting, aren't they, when you are not sure if a character is safe? It makes you care more about the story. I have been waiting a LONG time for a writer to realize this and execute it properly. 2. The story is interesting and multi-dimensional. I don't like to use the word "deep", but if it were ever being applied to something, this would deserve it. We follow multiple characters and situations across the fictional world - we aren't stuck in one place, following a predictable linear plot. It works absolutely. In the books, some characters are 'point of view' and you can follow their stories individually, if you want to. The TV show does a superlative job in weaving all these plots together and maintaining a good pace. The characters are well developed and interesting. I can't find a single criticism of the story, other than certain things have been changed from the books that should not have been.3. Dramatic tension is more or less sustained. And very effectively. So many other TV shows get this wrong by having ridiculous and unrealistic feats at every turn, without a care for believability.4. The acting The acting is top drawer and the characters are well portrayed. Joffrey, for example, was expertly captured both in script, acting and appearance. It's a ridiculously professional job all round.5. The pacing As I said, the pacing is great (and that is despite of a complicated set of branching plots and sub-plots). The decision to have a smaller number of episodes per season than other shows is exactly what is needed for it to work well. The tendency for some shows is to try and churn out as many episodes as possible, wrecking the pace, but the plan here is perfectly executed and the enormous budget well distributed.6. The music Most great films/games/TV shows have good soundtracks and music, and this is no exception. From the very first time you hear the theme tune, you'll know that effort has gone into this department.7. Set design The budget is well used to make the fictional world come alive and look incredibly realistic. The characters costumes, too, are well designed. I am not sure how much CGI is being used here, but the graphics do not come across as phony or stupid as was the case in The Hobbit by Jackson or the Star Wars Prequels.I have watched the first 4 seasons of Game of Thrones and, so far, there has been no sign of decline. Almost all other shows I have watched (including The Big Bang Theory, I am sorry to say) have all blown themselves out because of a lack of plan and their appeal to larger audiences - that isn't the case here. I really hope the books and the TV show keep to this standard and give the story the justice it deserves. The signs look promising, but only time will tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I say anything; I used to despise Game of Thrones. I hated when everybody talked about it. I hated when I saw it mentioned on Facebook or TV. Then I actually watched it. Never before have I been so immersed in a series. Although I have not read the books, I have heard that the show follows the books better than nearly every adaption, and that amazes me. To me, the storyline of Game of Thrones is great; it has action, drama, love, and comedy. The only flaws I find in the show is the overuse of pointless sex scenes. They're completely fine with, but because of the nudity the show gets a bad reputation with some people, and it annoys me that they don't actually hear how good the show is. All in all, Game of Thrones is a must watch series, and in my opinion, the best show in TV history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always used to see many TV shows, but when, on April 2014, I saw Game Of Thrones for the first time, I realized that it is much more than just a TV show: maybe, someday this will became EPIC, and children will study GOT instead of ancient Greek mythology etc.I don't like to read the book after I've seen the movie or see the movie after I've liked a book, but this time I'm reading all the books, I'm already at the third one, also if I have a busy life!Landscapes are wonderful, such as the show is based on real middle-age history and customs. It is called fantasy, and I've heard many guys saying that GOT it's just violence and nudes, but it is not. There is just a few magic, but the real wars are fought with brains, and as the show goes on, you won't care anymore of blood and sexuality.There is not any main character, anyone could die in every single moment, this is sometimes sad, but I've never seen anything like that!Perfect casting, George R.R. Martin is a master of suspense...what else do I have to say? Just see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch this... No show you view will ever affect you the same way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the summary states, do yourself a favor and do NOT watch this "TV show." What I mean by this is that Game of Thrones will spoil you to the point of making you sick. Nothing else you watch, on television or otherwise, will provide the gut-wrenching, tear- jerking, soul shattering moments that Game of Thrones causes one to feel on a regular basis. Many of the emotions you experience are simply indescribable. As you watch it, it is akin riding your first roller coaster. The way that first hill makes you realize with dread that you are at the mercy of a beast; the plunge that follows, causing your insides to rise from your stomach to your throat; the countless twists and turns which momentarily lull you into a false sense of safety before jerking your body in a new direction; and, finally, when the ride is over and you struggle to regain your composure, staggering uncontrollably to return to reality's homeostasis. As an avid Braveheart/Gladiator/Saving Private Ryan movie buff, this show easily rises to those levels. And, in some ways, because it is essentially a multi-hour cinema experience, Game of Thrones surpasses them in theatric quality. Like I said, please don't watch the show. It makes you wonder all over again which rock Mel Gibson, Ridley Scott, and Steven Spielberg are hiding under.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a violently graphic and strong retelling about facing off among various families in an undetermined time . Nine noble families battle for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) , King of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard ¨Ned¨(Sean Bean), Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of the King, or highest official. When Ned returned to Winterfell at the end of Robert's Rebellion, he had a bastard son, Jon Snow, by an unknown woman he had met in the South. He raised Jon alongside his five trueborn children Robb (Richard Madden) , Sansa (Sophie Turner) , Arya (Maisie Williams) , Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) , and Rickon (Art Parkinson) . Along with the Stark family is Theon (Alfie Allen), he became a ward of Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark at Winterfell, and he became close with Robb . Although Ned is secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further . Meanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to take power . There appears Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) the third and youngest son of Lord Tywin (Charles Dance) and Lady Joanna Lannister. Because of his unusual stature Tyrion has been a victim of mockery his entire life, with people overlooking his noble birth in order to tease and taunt him. Tyrion's mother died giving birth to him and his father and older sister Cersei (Lena Headey) have despised him all his life as a result. He has always maintained a close relationship with his elder brother Ser Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), Cersei's twin . Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne . As Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) is the only daughter of Aerys II Targaryen and Rhaella Targaryen , she is now a princess living in exile, the last of the Targaryens . But Daenerys grows into a supremely confident warrior women with perhaps the most stringent code of ethics in all the Seven Kingdoms. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond . There finds Jon Snow (Kit Harington) , the bastard Son of Lord Ned Stark by an unknown mother , it is here that the skills that were passed on to him by Ned come to light as Jon becomes a natural born leader with a strong code of ethics and an effective warrior when battling at and beyond the Wall. This is a spectacular epic dealing with friction between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn,Tyrell and Martell and in which political and sexual intrigue is pervasive ; all of them lead to full-scale war . Breathtaking epic version based on George RR Martin novels with exciting drama and overwhelming combats , his stories are imaginatively brought to life on groundbreaking images with great production values and outstanding scenarios . Sword cross , intense drama , nudism , sexual scenes , and bloody fights abound in this spellbinding adaptation . Magnificent climatic battle scenes and struggles including lots of blood and gore ; and adding colorful computer generator images including heinous dragons . The series is well written by an excellent plethora of screenwriters as David Benioff , D.B. Weiss , Vanessa Taylor under supervision by the great creator George R.R. Martin . This author was asked if he had a resolution or ending to the seemingly endless conflict , he replied that the end would be a cloud of dust or snow being driven by the wind across a vast graveyard full of tombstones. The series takes its name from the first novel in the book series "A Game of Thrones" - which is actually known as "A Song of Ice and Fire",and most of the show is largely faithful to the books . George R.R. Martin's story credit acknowledges the entire series under this title, rather than the title of individual volumes. George R.R. Martin has stated that the infamous "Red Wedding" was the hardest chapter for him to write in "A Storm of Swords." He was so emotionally attached to the characters that he actually wrote the rest of the book first, and then that chapter last .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And that says a lot. After watching the first two seasons my opinion about this show was somewhere between very great and absolutely amazing. It was totally mesmerizing watch with dozens of memorable scenes, but I was still puzzled whether Game of Thrones is on the same level as some of my other favorites like Breaking Bad and The Wire. After season three, I can only say that Game of Thrones blows every other series I have ever seen out of the water.After the first season I had to pick up the ASOIAF books and blasted through them in one summer. Having seen the first season and how well the book translated to the screen, I was extremely excited yet slightly nervous to see the rest of the story come alive on Game of Thrones. Nervous because the first season already was so well made, I was afraid if the show can keep up with the standard it had set. Not only did it do that, but it just kept getting better! The casting is perfect, the acting is amazing and I simply can't praise this series enough. The story George R.R. Martin wrote keeps you on the edge for every moment of it, and the changes they made for the Game of Thrones have so far been only for the better. It definitely deserves all the hype. I'm feeling awkward writing a review that turns out into a praise, but I simply can't find anything bad to say about it. If there ever were some little mistakes I didn't like, the rest of the awesomeness made me forgot about it as if it never happened. There were few scenes on season three that alone would've made me give this series 10/10. Only thing I can complain about is having to wait a year for the next season. And a year more after that.I don't think TV series could get any better than this. Except maybe the fourth season.</fullReview>

I appreciate that Tolkien is not for everyone but, my God, GoT has something for everyone without a doubt! Debates around the faithfulness of the series to the books, is a purely philological discussion with very little value. The series is amazing anyway!BEST PART: You never know what will happen.

		<fullReview>Television as a medium rarely rises above mediocre levels of quality, concerned only with ratings to up its publicity income. Yet, every once in a while a truly remarkable achievement flashes briefly before the eyes of those carefully looking. Game of Thrones is such an achievement. Its carefully chosen location and cast, the seamlessness of its narrative and character development and its unrestrained but cautious building of its own fantastical world work so well together that a viewer could not be blamed for thinking it all came together magically.Fantasy is a complicated genre. So much of it is clichés and replaying of old ideas, and yet, when done right, its worlds can successfully reshape our entire thinking of our own. Game of thrones begins with a beautiful introduction of its world in its opening credits, which in these days tends to be reduced in so many shows to the series titles and the producer and director credits. In the opening, we understand the layout of the terrain, and immediately perceive the importance of the divide of the map by "The Wall". This introduction is very clever, as it helps to visualize all the movements of the many character in the game of thrones.As for the characters, rich in detail and significant and intertwined story lines, they are one of the biggest treats. You care about them the moment they come on the screen, and even if most can be identified as good or bad the moment you see them, the narrative manipulates both them and viewer enough to carry us constantly into unforeseen narrative developments.Without spoiling its hard to speak of its themes, but all that is common in fantastical stories you will find here, from betrayal and honor, and manipulation and love, but with a more brutal and uncompromising view than most other shows. Even if dragons play a part, this is not a child's show. It's themes are that of adults.The winter is coming, and it will be a long wait until the next season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Shocking Episode Endings Rule!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen a complete HBO series before. A colleague convinced me to try "Game of Thrones." I did watch the first episode and never looked back. Over the past days, I watched one episode a day until I completed all 10 episodes of the first season. It was that good. You'd never want to be kept hanging.The series brings us back to a medieval time with kings and queens, lords and ladies. It showed things as they probably were back then, grimy, rough and violent. There was very little of the glitz and glamor that mark modern royalty nowadays. It shows the political intrigues of the aristocracy, as well as their advisers, whores and knights behind them. It is also about family. The central family were the Starks. Eddard was picked by his good friend King Robert (family Baratheon) to be his Hand (or executive officer). This threw the Stark family (wife, five kids and one bastard) into the political fray after after their long quiet existence in the North. There is also the Lannister family of the Queen Cersei (a nebulously sinister Lena Headey), constantly waiting for an opportunity to grab power. And finally, the very blond Targaryen family who ruled the realm before Robert, now down to their last two members, the crazy Viserys (Harry Lloyd) and his meek sister Daenerys (Emilia Clarke).As you can envision, the action in the battles, sword fights, and jousting scenes were very graphic and bloody. We were not spared the sight of gushing severed arteries, festering wounds, impaled heads and animal attacks. This is definitely not for the faint of heart! You can just look away and the sound effects do just as well to convey the gore on screen. On the other end of the Rated MA spectrum are the occasional sex scenes with both female and male members on display. These may be called gratuitous for TV, but I do gather these are also part of the books. Nevertheless, the sight of a 10-year old boy breastfeeding from his mother was still very disturbing, even in these days.For someone who had not yet read the books, the way the story was written for TV and the directorial execution were very good. The ending scene of the first episode alone will make you want to be back for more. Love those endings for most episodes, aside from Episode 1, those of 7 and 9 will really shock you! There are things that happen that you would never predict. The fates of the characters were very unpredictable up to the very last episode. The ending of the last episode gives the series another dimension, whetting our appetite for the next season.The writing may be archaic in vocabulary and construction, but yet they are crisp and witty, especially those that uttered by the dwarf Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage in his Emmy-nominated role). The set design of the the throne room, the dungeons that open into cliffs, the war camps were excellent. The cinematography was sweeping when it needs to be majestic, and intimate where it was necessary to be claustrophobic. I did not know most of the actors here, but they will affect you as they portray their characters were portrayed, be it hero, villain or double-agent. Aside from Bean, Headey and Dinklage, special mention go to Michelle Fairley (as Eddard's strong wife Catelyn), Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau (as the rogue Jamie Lannister) and Jason Momoa (as the imposing Khal Drogo).This show deserves its Emmy nomination for Best Drama. Definitely, I will be back to watch the second season. I will also be reading the novels by George RR Martin that inspired this sweeping epic series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great on the surface...ran into the ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This show is extremely well produced, which is something that I appreciate...the setting and major plot lines are also quite excellent. The problem lies in the direction these great things have been taken. Let me first say that I have not read the books...so if you want to argue "it was in the books!"; well, then my criticisms to come are of the books too. A) While it has slowed down somewhat in season 5, the gratuitous nudity and violence is wholly unnecessary. In most cases, it is necessary to convey the brutality of the universe, however, a lot of times its done as a cheap way to shock the viewer. Did we really need that last scene of Lady Stark being gored on screen? A cut to black and slicing sound would have been fine, but they seem to want to spit on the good work they have done. And did we really need 8 minutes of the queen regent walking naked? B) There are many great characters...and while I don't like "good always triumphs", four of the five characters I have really been interested have died (Tyrion being the lone holdout). A lot of them dying just for the sake of shocking the viewer. C) The plots are divergent and mostly interesting, but to get invested in any of them leads straight to them getting slaughtered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After Watching 5 seasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At First I gave this series 10 out of 10 and was happy with it. Show started strong and the at the end of 1st season I was really angry when they killed NED like they did!! But it was OK I mean I was waiting to see some pay back as they(Wolf and company) were no sheep, Wolf will hit back somehow. Following season was some more disappointment in terms of my aspirations lol(Robb dead and others in following season -Oberyn, stannis etc). Well still there were some sparks that made me feel that there is still some hope and things will change but NO!!! There are so many reasons people liked the show at First but then the way it is going I really don't want to watch that. Bran and Arya Stark is left who are very young and Sansa I hate that girl lol, I wish they killed her instead!! Tyrion is a very good and interesting character who is left other than Starks. But rest all i was rooting for are dead. Not that its anybody's fault or am blaming them for anything but I don't want to watch a TV show and get angry every time at the end of every season and wait to get furthermore disappointment. Only few things to enjoy and many things to annoy is the crux of this Series!!! I don't care about that Dragon born girl Dany, or other lannisters, or Tyrells and other such kind of houses. Devious and cheaters do win but not all the time! SO something is wrong here. It has tuned into those kind of shows which are so sad all the time and joyful rarely. I am not a hater but they took my joy away and I really don't like Game of Thrones now. Am not here to watch cersie and Tyrells playing house, or Bolton Bastard doing tortures and stuff. Dumb night watcher killing Jon snow. Its so sad every time this series progresses. Some people might like that kind of stuff but I will rather play counter strike or Football or listen music. Anyway I posted this so if anyone just don't wanna see good guys die all the time over and over They can read this and stay away lol :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is the best TV i have ever seen in TV history. the story is very deep and the character as well. the soundtrack is epic.Game of thrones has drama , action , comedy , tragedy and very emotional moment that the fans will never can forget.the quality of the production is very high and the directors know what they should do to make the series amazing as same as the books. there are many actors that i like them such as John snow , Robert stark, Oberyn Martel and so on. i highly recommended game of thrones for all people who like drama and action as this is Epic which can't happen again for the long time. While I watched the first episode I had the same excitement as the time when I first read the book. HBO has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. Sean Bean was born for the role of Eddard Stark. Costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. Actors are perfect for the role they play in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes everything else look Amateur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thought on my mind once the first season got over was, " Damn.. When will April, 2012 come ??" This show is a totally different genre in TV series. This is not a romantic comedy of 5 friends, nor is it a story of detectives.Who could think of a TV Series based on Medieval ages and pull it off in such style.The Best thing about the series is the cast. There is incredible detail in each scene, given that it has some big names in the cast.This series sets an example on how to base something on a book. Bold and powerful, you will not realize that 60 minutes have flown by after each episode.Once you watch this, go back and watch your favorite TV Series again. I guarantee, you will realize how amateur they actually are compared to The Game Of Thrones. By the way, the ending of season 1 for sure will chill you out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely fantastic...from an "outsider's" perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just so you know where I'm coming from, I've never heard of "Game of Thrones"(not the board game, books, etc) until the show was released. In fact, the only time I heard it even mentioned was when my friends discussed the previous night's TV shows. Prior to watching the show, the only thing I knew about it was that it was fantasy. I should also mention that I hate fantasy books and movies.However, "Game of Thrones" totally blew me away. Even for HBO's standards, this show is just epic. I rate this show an firm 10/10.A little about the show: the show takes place in an alternate world that is so meticulously set out that one would think that it's real. Each house's history is so complex, the characters so realistically dimensional that I'm not sure I was watching a documentary or a fictional show. This, however, is not a series about fighting and bloodshed. This show is all politics and relationships between people, classes, and races.What I like about the show: HBO really outdid itself with "Game of Thrones." $5 million dollars per episode...and every penny worth its price. The physical settings could not have been more realistic. Castles and deserts, city streets and tundra, every backdrop was absolutely convincing, and this only serves to underline one of the shows greatest strengths: the depth of the "Game of Thrones" universe. I also must mention the strength of the acting of the whole cast, not just Peter Dinklage (who was particularly brilliant). I'd even say that each actor was born to play their GoT character (not really, but you get my point). Again, I have to commend HBO, this time for selecting an effective cast. I would not be surprised if several of these actors go on to become premier TV stars, if not A-List movie actors.So now, after watching one season of this show, I am a total Song of Fire and Ice junkie and I have gotten my whole family hooked on this show as well. Do I recommend this TV show? Well, only if you are not scared of being blinded at the brilliance of this show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I stumbled on this show while flipping through the channels one evening, and was pleasantly surprised to find a fantasy genre show that isn't completely worthless. In fact, this show is so good I went out and bought all the books, which are extremely well written themselves. This show reminded me why I loved Lord of the Rings so much as a kid, and seeing Sean Bean's familiar face added to that effect as well. Each character in this series seems exquisitely crafted, not one major character is dull or flat and keeps you constantly guessing on how things will turn out at the end of every episode. The production value of this show is very high, the acting is fantastic, and the plot is altogether enthralling. I highly recommend it even if you aren't a fantasy genre fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing ever beats a book...but this is damn close so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well done writers, cast and crew. This is a brilliant adaptation of what is for me the best fantasy read I have ever had. Whilst some of the negative reviews have mentioned the vast array of characters and events in only the first few episodes, I on the other hand am amazed at just how well the massive amount of characters and descriptions have managed to be so well filtered or captured for TV. This is a massive undertaking and as someone who has read the book it is very difficult to judge just how understandable the plot is thus far if you haven't. This a tale of the human trait of tribalism, loyalty and betrayal set in the magical world created by a great author where seven kingdoms lie in constant fear of the evil that winter may bring and Winter is Coming. To understand the plot is to move in stealth from one land to another, one clan to another, one bed to another, weaving a thread that creates the patchwork of this intricate yet barbarically woven material. What I can say, is do not worry yourself too much about understanding who, what and where each character fits in, just watch it. You will become familiar with them as the story unfolds. That said, for those who have read the books, the series has had a lot to live up to and that is its biggest test, passed so far as far as this reader/watcher is concerned. I'm hooked, again and I'm loving it. The acting is readily acceptable if not very good and whilst I was anxious about the selection, I feel so far that every actor chosen has physically fit the character described in the book very well with the possible exception of Catelyn Stark played by Michelle Fairley (who should have been a little better looking) and John Snow played by Kit Harrington (although I can't quite put my finger on why). The detestable Tyrion Lannister, my favourite character, played brilliantly by Peter Drinklage is just perfect and as for Arya Stark (Maisie Williams), well they stole her right out of my imagination. I am writing this at episode 5 and may update it again at episode 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Book Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read Game of Thrones more than once, and I am exceptionally pleased with the HBO adaptation thus far. I just finished watching Episode 2. I find the actors to be nearly perfectly suited for the book's characters. The book is rather slow, with a lot of character complexity and social intrigue. The television series adapts this very well by presenting the most poignant moments from the book, the ones that capture the essence of a character or the mood of a scene. My wife does not like fantasy, but she is completely captivated by this series. The story is more true to the many shades of human nature than, say, "Lord of the Rings" or other popular fantasy fare. Therefore it transcends the limits of its genre and will appeal to fantasy aficionados and non-geeks alike. It is also dark, raw, and realistic. Therefore trees don't whistle tunes and good guys don't always end up on top. As a fan of the books, based on the first two episodes alone, I believe that HBO has done an outstanding job of adapting George R.R. Martin's "Game of Thrones" to television. I highly recommend watching this series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best show on television. Hands down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? There is no other show like Game of Thrones. It is simply the best.Where do I start? Well, I would like to first point out that of all the TV shows out there, very few of them I watch and even fewer are the ones that I legitimately love. It is not like the majority of other shows are bad or terribly made, it is simply the fact that with so many TV shows out there, patterns become evident, story lines become uncreative and repetitive and once you've seen enough shows, other ones become predictable. A handful, such as 24, Psych, Vikings, Black Sails and of course, Game of Thrones, truly pique my interest. With that said, Game of Thrones is stunning in basically every aspect. Wonderfully adapted from George R. R. Martin's incredible novels, Game of Thrones brings to life the world of Westeros (and Essos). I am a huge fan of the books as well and I can say that the show stays very faithful to the books. Of course, slight changes are made, but this has to happen on occasion, and I have rather enjoyed most of the changes. Things I love about the show: The plot line. This is the cornerstone of Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice and Fire. The plot line is what makes the show so amazing and intriguing. It is a masterfully written story about kings and queens, lord and ladies, knights and warriors, children and adults, love and betrayal, politics and war and good and evil. The characters take it to a whole other level. The characters are so diverse yet so realistic. I'm sure each one of us can find one character we can relate to or at least sympathize with. Characters are loved while others are hated and furthermore, others remain neutral, fooling even the most dedicated audience to what they might do next (looking at you Petyr Baelish). Apart from the books, the show is able to bring all the visual aspects forward in stunning display. Namely the filming locations and costume designs. Croatia, Ireland, Morocco and Iceland provide for most of the scenery and man if it isn't beautiful. It is authentic and rugged and provides the perfect opportunity for bringing the World of Ice and Fire to life. The acting is incredible and performed by an amazing cast. Peter Dinklage, Jack Gleeson, Lena Headey, Charles Dance, Kit Harington, Sean Bean and Iain Glen are among the best. Finally, the action scenes are wonderfully done. Realistic and gritty yet still intense and a joy to watch. Who doesn't like big battles and epic scenes of single combat fights? Now, if there is one thing that I do not like about the show, it is the sexual content/nudity. While I admit some of it is necessary, I think it is a little over the top. I know this is HBO and HBO specifically caters to adults, but extended brothel scenes with nudity for the sake of nudity? Not exactly a fan of that. It certainly takes away from the bigger and more important events going on elsewhere in Westeros. Despite my dislike for the unnecessary nudity, the show as a whole has my rating of a 9.5! But since that is not an option, I'll have to give it a 10. I will always love this show and I cannot wait for the upcoming seasons! Remember, Winter is coming.Favorite characters: Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Ned Stark and Ser Jorah Mormont (close behind them is Arya, Varys, Jaime and Samwell). Favorite episode(s): Watchers on the Wall and Rains of Castamere. The Children is another amazing one.Keep up the good work GRRM, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little nudity goes a long way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave Game of Thrones a try on the recommendation of several friends, who'd read the books and were up to date as of Season 4. Presently, I'm around the middle of Season 3, so I've given it a fair go. My overall opinion is that whilst it's not the worst show I've ever seen, it'll never be amongst my favourite programmes.Good aspects include Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister: he's a dwarf who, despite his physical disadvantages, manages to best most of those he comes up against via a mixture of guile, humour, bravery and people skills. Jerome Flynn also has some good lines as his partner in crime. They're both Billy Connolly -esque in their use of swearing to comedic effect. I'm still chuckling at some of Peter Dinklage's wryly-delivered one-liners. The locations and cinematography are also very well done. Everything from the CGI opening sequence (which flies around a map, introducing locations that will play a part in the upcoming episode) to the in-episode CGI is flawless.Bad aspects of the show include the gratuitous fanservice that is crammed, it seems, into at least every second episode. There seems to be no end of two-dimensional young female characters who appear in the buff, frequently for one scene only, purely it would seem to add appeal for the adolescent male contingent of the audience. I'm not averse to a little nudity, but when it's as clumsily done as in this production it detracts from the underlying material considerably and wrenches you out of the story. There was one scene in which a person being tortured stopped to have a dalliance, FFS. How much do you need to be able to bend a narrative to be able to interject that type of scene into that type of material? Had the people behind Game of Thrones also been responsible for Lord of the Rings, I imagine there would have been rather more scenes of Gandalf frolicking with nameless female elves, and rather less battles with Orcs and slaying of Balrogs.Besides being clumsy, the way-too-frequent and almost exclusively female nudity also makes this show inappropriate for viewing on public transport, etc. So, if like me you enjoy catching up on your viewing on the commute to work, this show may not be for you. At this point in the story arc, there has been precisely one (highly watchable) battle, compared with around 10-15 fully-nude sex scenes, mostly involving characters that never play a part in the plot again. All but one of those nude characters has been female. If you've ever seen that episode of Extras with Patrick Stewart as a lecherous version of himself portrayed as an actor-would-be-writer-and-director that keeps trying to inject his personal fantasies into the scenes he's writing/directing, you'll have experienced what a production planning session for GOT must be like.But I digress. Other than the so-clumsy-it-borders-on-1970s-arthouse-porn nature of the frequent sex scenes, the underlying story is so-so. Certain characters (Paul Kaye's Thoros of Myr, Jermone Flynn's Bron, Peter Dinklage's Tyrion and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's Jaime Lannister) are watchable antiheroes owing to the ambiguous morality of their characters. Others (every nameless nude extra, Jack Gleeson's Joffrey Baratheon, and Sean Bean's Ned Stark) are two-dimensional caricatures that are patronising to the audience.The story itself takes a fairly obvious arc. Most of the audience will have worked out how it's all going to end by episode two, even though they may be surprised by how much intercourse it takes to get there.So, worth a watch just to say that you've seen it and to understand the memes surrounding it. That being the case, I'll probably give it at least until the end of Season 4. But, overall, it's not one I'll watch again afterwards. And that I'll be making use of the fast-forward button with frequently during those tedious and distracting cheap porn scenes whilst watching the remainder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the whole they have done the book justice. The male characters for the most part were played well and certainly Eddard was portrayed accurately. I felt that both Catelyn and Cersei were not portrayed in enough depth to do the characters in the books justice nor to allow them to develop as the series goes on.The story line was accurate although it did feel rushed and as if they were trying to catch everyone who has not read the book up. I did not feel that we needed to be introduced to Daenerys at this point as her story only becomes central later in the books. It would have been better to allow viewers to build connections with the characters from Westeros first.In light of all the review complaining about the sex or nudity in the series, I can only guess that they are not readers of the books. The use of sex and violence as means to gain and keep power are central themes in the stories and it would be difficult to portray these if they could not be depicted. It must be remembered that this was created for an adult audience and therefore will have adult content just as the book have.All in all I was far more impressed than I thought I would be as I am a fan on the books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read most of the reviews and find it staggering to read some of the negative rubbish posted by people in regards to the offensive and deborturous scenes in this series. this is set in a time similar to the dark ages where they didn't have people to sensure every bloody thing they did and the show portrays this beautifully. read the books, they are full of bad language, violence and sex and the series is true to the books. this may come as a shock, but some of us don't like toned-down, sterile, politicly correct, lets-all-play-nicely harry potter rubbish we actually like to be taken to a world that is realistic of the period in time. its a world of under-handedness, violence, war-mongering and social turbulence and to make it feel realistic these scenes are required. i mean seriously, do you think manners and correctness was a requirement in the setting? if bad guys all spoke nicely and no one got the odd dagger in the eye and the whores god forbid didn't show the odd bit of tit would the viewer really find that realistic? instead, what we get is an in-your-face no holds-barred series that is true to the book. for those of you that find the sex scenes a "ratings grab" i suggest you read the book and you will find many pages filled with descriptive sex scenes. HBO is simply being true to the books. for those of you who have a problem with the violence, ITS SET IN A BLOODY TIME OF WAR! what do you think is going to happen if you joust against a sadistic 7ft tall giant? your going to get a lance in the neck is what! to sensure it would be to kill it by taking away the realism. to those of you that find all this too confronting i say take a step out of your sterile plastic bubble full of pixies and and cute little bunnies and other assorted non-confronting, politically correct cuddley things and change the frigging channel!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the first episodes I could ramble on about how visually stimulating it all is, how the script is brilliantly interlaced to suite scene composition and the mood, how the sounds and scores multiply the intensity of the setting. I could also ramble on about how great the cast is, how every character looks as if they were born to play this one role, or how from the opening credits you are immediately aware that you are going to be taken deep into this world that you know nothing about and that it will be one heck of a journey.But I won't ramble on about any of that, because in the end, once its all said and done, you will only remember how that movie, that show, that book made you feel. All of the above enthralls you and literally drags you into King's Landing, into Winterfell or (God forbid) into the icy realms of the North.Every character is interlaced with something else, whether this be another character, another place, another being. When something impacts one you immediately feel for them because you understand exactly where they are situated in the grander scheme of things. This systematic entanglement of characters will serve as the backdrop for the script throughout the series. As we hear the knife slit the throat of Lady we see the young Stark awake, you know that something has changed, you know that with every passing breath the young Stark will never be the same.If you want pure fantasy this isn't for you, supernatural elements make appearances throughout the show but they aren't fundamental, they merely serve as a detached entity, something outside the bounds of the world of man, something to understand but not to approach, much like the Great Wall leading to the north.If you want to watch a show which places importance on character interaction and plot composition, then this is for you. The medieval backdrop only amplifies what is sure to become a great television spectacle.Game of Thrones, deserved of the throne, but can it keep it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the first episode i was so impressed and impatient that i decided to read the book immediately to see what happens next. Then i thought that i should wait at least for a couple more weeks to see how the adaption goes before i write the review - i found no need because, hence small changes for the sake of the show, it is excellent.This show is amazing. The plot is very, very good and complex and has so many different layers that only it should keep people wanting to see what comes in the future. I won't even start with the characters: they are brilliant and so different that everyone should find someone to root for. And thanks to this being TV-series, we can have true and believable character development, something that many fantasy films lack these days. Constant plot twists and sudden deaths are heartbreaking to say the least, but after every shock the show just manages to keep the grip on the viewers even tighter.The cinematography. Nothing to say except praise. The medieval-like era and wintery aura give the story a grim and dark background, which suits, again, very well. The special effects are splendid, just take a look at the Wall or the large cities, or the dragons and white walkers in the later seasons.The acting is very good as well. The cast itself is splendid, with most of it coming from the British theater scene. Sean Bean captures Eddard Stark impressively and Peter Dinklage as Tyrion or newcomer Kit Harington as Jon Snow are just a few examples.After the fifth season the show will undoubtedly take a new path and will still have us waiting eagerly for the next episode. As for the show, just sit back, enjoy, and let yourself be taken over by this magnificent world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality HBO production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fantasy fan, but I am a bit of a sucker for anything Brit-flavored and anything period, even if I can't always choke them down in the end. With historical productions, disappointment often comes with too many liberties taken with the facts. Literary adaptations suffer the same problem for those who have read the books. I hadn't read the Martin books when I gave this series a try, so I had no expectations. However I was wary because Starz's Pillars of the Earth, which I also had no expectations for, turned out to be such an overwrought bag of cheese, full of bad writing and direction and what must have been a closeout purchase of chicken-bladder neck-blood- spurters. Then Camelot (also Starz) lost me in the first 20 minutes, and after that I had no stomach to even check out The Borgias after seeing what Showtime did with The Tudors. But with Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage, I thought Game of Thrones was worth a try, and it has been.The production values are fantastic, and the acting and writing are very good, with only occasional forays into excess. The violence and gore are kept in context, although the sex and nudity are a little heavy-handed at times, probably as a safeguard in case the plot lines turned out to be too complex for some viewers. I found the story compelling enough to download "A Song of Ice and Fire" to my e-reader after watching a couple of episodes. It's not a perfect creation, but it's very well done and as others have said, each episode makes you anxious for the next, and without the need for cliffhangers and sensational devices, just a desire to keep going. Bean and Dinklage are indeed both great as Ned Stark and Tyrion Lannister, and Mark Addy unfolds as an impressive and flawed King Robert. Having liked Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau in the short-lived New Amsterdam, it's good to see him back at work as the arrogant Jaime Lannister. Michelle Fairley is a formidable Catelyn, and Maisie Williams as young Arya Stark clearly has a great career ahead of her. In fact, most of the acting is solid-to-excellent. Sometimes the story line with the Targaryens and Dothrakis seems a little too over the top to match up with the very naturalistic feel of the rest of the series, but it's still interesting, and I look forward to seeing how it intersects with the rest of the tale. Although it's not vital to the story, the opening sequence is beautifully done and worthy of mention. HBO generally doesn't half-*** their projects, and they certainly didn't skimp on this one. Worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love this show, love this show, love this show! Action, betrayal, strong women, handsome men, realistic costuming, great casting, great story . . . The only thing wrong with this show is the pacing. My husband and I DVR what we want to watch so we can watch at our schedule and half way into the second episode my head is still spinning from the information-overload. I'm beginning to make the connections in and between the families and it is beginning to come together. I know that "Game of Thrones" is book-based - hopefully, they will not stop at the end of this first book of A Song of Fire and Ice series. I have not read these books, but plan to now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will first present to you my circumstances so that you can judge whether this review may accurately reflect your own opinion. After all, we read reviews so that we know whether to watch/read or not. So here goes; 23, read the books, enjoy fantasy, but hate it when fantasy fiction is turned into fairytale. Movies about the uglier side of humanity should be ugly. I also like sushi.Now - the series.It's ugly. And perfect. It is so wonderfully realistic, I'd say, that one's understanding of medieval life is altered forever.While not breath-taking, the visuals are satisfying. Fantasy essentials such as the stone architecture and feudal attire are presented superbly. Action-scenes are kept short and precise and none of the gory details are left out. The prettier aspects of the film - some of which having read the book, I naively envisaged more gloriously - are done to perfection, even to the corny physical depiction of Jaime, whom in my opinion resembles Prince Charming from Shrek.The principles of the series are also done very well. Barbarism and lust are portrayed very effectively. The nudity is not eye-candy, and much like the gore, it has you cringing at its vulgarity. Loyalty and friendship dominate the emotional landscape, as do their evil twins, betrayal and hatred. Most significantly however, the theme of family is put into the limelight and tested. All in all, feudal relationships and values are explored by the Game of Thrones to a level of quality only matched by the novels.A quick word on the plot. Having seen only the inaugural episode, I cannot accurately gauge its whole quality, but having read the book, I can safely attest that if the series continues to present the story as faithfully as it has so far, it will leave the viewer breathless and deeply furious at the weekly nature of delivery of television viewing.Perhaps the only thing not meeting the sublime standard of the whole, is the score. The music is dull, quite frankly. Perhaps in this aspect, the overly realistic nature of the series is damaging. I mean, sure, the barbaric Horselords are synonymous with tribal drum beats, but a guitar riff to emphasize their bad-assness could not have gone wrong, in my opinion.In summary however, this series has made the perfect start. With some luck, and under the careful guidance of George RR Martin, it will hopefully continue on its epic journey in the same manner it has so far, awesomely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How is this show not number one. I mean I'm a massive fan of Breaking Bad. But Game of Thrones is on a completely different level to any other show out there. Including Breaking Bad. It has proper developing and unfolding story lines that are planned out from the beginning. It's unbelievably gritty and the character development is astonishing. The characters are real and you feel real emotion when something happens to one of them. Game of Thrones treads where no other show ever has, it's full of twists and it lulls you into a false sense of security before stabbing you in the back. You really have no idea what will happen, and it's the unpredictability combined with the shear boldness that makes this show so much better that any other. Where other shows have main characters that you know won't die because that would be the end of the show, Game of Thrones doesn't have any one main character. So they could do anything.</fullReview>

Nobody, and I mean nobody, could play Tyrion that well. That's a critical role to this series too. Well done Peter. Keep up the great work.Casting and performances are really good across the board. Some of this probably makes no sense to people who haven't read the books, but to them I say "GO READ THE BOOKS!!!". Best series of books ever written, and this series is VERY good so far.I'll be purchasing the box set when it comes out. I hope they keep it going throughout the series. I might have to go read the entire series again after I get my hands on A Dance With Dragons.Don't miss this one folks, and read the books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GoT used to be the show I couldn't wait for but now i find it stale, repetitive and the story just isn't moving forward since the end of season three. Gratuitous violence doesn't bother me if the violence portrayed is integral to the story or helping to move it forward but now its just shock and awe meant to appeal to the simple minded. Season 5 droned on for 7 damn episodes of nothing really happening other than rape, attempted rape, watching a small girl scrub a floor till she goes blind, barbequing another small girl, more small girls get tortured by a pedophile in a brothel and the queen is forced to walk naked through the streets (wow, martin and/or the show writers must really hate women). I get that the writers want to have intrigue and develop the political story but they squeezed all the action into the last three episodes and then it was so predictable, Stanis dies, Jon snow dies (everybody likes him so of course he has to die), Jamies daughter would die, Kalesi's flying fire chicken would save her and despite it all the story has barely moved anywhere in five seasons.GoT is one of the highest production value shows ever made without a doubt but if HBO seems intent on relying way too much on a set recipe of shock and awe, naked people, over the top violent situations (not necessarily violent scenes) and making the audience guess which key characters are going to die instead of an actual progressive story that people can remember from season to season I'm gonna tune out just from pure boredom.Actually I think I'm done with this crap show, I won't support shows written by pedophiles. Seriously anybody who writes that much sadistic sex and bad things on women into a story should be checked up on by the police. Red flag anybody? Ramsey Bolton should peel the skin off the parents of the child actors for their greed to allow their kids to participate in such scenes. I know they're actors and it's a TV show but they are also children! For Christ sake HBO, pushing the envelope doesn't mean abandoning the last vestiges of human morality for the sake of ratings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I even begin? Game of Thrones is simply brilliant.There is only one other television series which has managed to get me so emotionally involved, but I will not name it, for doing so would draw the focus away from this masterpiece. Game of Thrones sends you to bed at night fearing for the life of your favourite character; you just don't know if next week's episode will be their last.The writing is superb. I cannot stress enough how clever the writers are. It is a rare thing for someone like me to sit back and smile at so many of the bold, powerful and often double-edged one-liners the characters have. Here are a few examples:"When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die.""If you thought this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.""A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you'll know the debt is paid.""DRACARYS!"I get so excited just reciting some of those quotes in my head! Do you see what this series does to you?! Those one-liners are SO POWERFUL - and the best part is that they're all-throughout the series! Those lines alone are capable of exciting me beyond belief for the next season.The characters are also phenomenal. Take Varys and Littlefinger for example: two unbelievably complicated, sharp, and quick-witted characters which when put together make for some truly marvellous dialogue. Dialogue? YES! Dialogue! They make otherwise trivial conversation oh-so-interesting because their words always carry many meanings. Or perhaps Cersei and Joffrey: how is it even possible for one to loathe them both so much yet love them at the same time? I don't know, but I love/hate them so much!The setting deserves a review on its own! Breathtaking! You truly do feel immersed in Westeros when you watch Game of Thrones. Oh and can we just take a minute to worship George R.R. Martin? Thanks. I'm petrified of what that evil man will do in season five but at the same time I can't wait. Oh, and another reason this show is brilliant: dragons. And Daenerys. Oh I could go on for days about Daenerys...HODOR!This show has everything you could possibly hope for: there is never a dip in quality - the show achieves a high-quality consistency throughout; the characters and cast are absolutely incredible; the plot is ever-so-complicated and ingenious with many different layers and sub-plots; the setting and cinematography are utterly fantastic; the show never loses pace or interest; and you are emotionally ENGAGED.In a nutshell, if you haven't seen Game of Thrones, then you need to. But be warned: your emotions will be toyed with, your heart torn in two, and on the day that you are finally happy, "your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth." Oh, also, if you dislike nudity, gore, being upset, not-so-happy endings, or quality television and you'd rather watch people cook meth...look elsewhere.WINTER IS COMING!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Overrated Show in History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily the most overrated television program in history. It is the Forrest Gump of TV: a bunch of assorted vignettes, shot using actors who (on the whole) lack any notable prowess, and then haphazardly forced together with minimal connective substance, all with the intent to quickly evoke and dispel fleeting and superficial emotional responses from an audience whose attention span is about as long as your average commercial advertisement. No scene is particularly visually stunning, no storyline is particularly compelling, and not much of the dialog is particularly well-written.If good film making allows the viewer to be drawn in to empathize with characters and fully experience each scene, Game of Thrones is a nightmare. It's difficult to make sense of the overall experience of the characters or really feel much of anything because Game of Thrones is such a desensitizing roller coaster. For instance, the show reached a point where the writers had to kill off nearly the entire family of protagonists because they couldn't find any meaningful plot twist they hadn't already used. This heavy-handed amateurism rewards the voyeurs and sensationalists at the cost of desensitizing everyone else to any events that could still evoke an emotional response.Yes, there are a ton of characters and story lines. But, every character seems generic, because there's not enough time spent on any character in particular. Yes, there are many layers to the story. But, no, none of the story lines are very deep, nor do they demonstrate the patient hand required of a great writer or director. Why is this the highest-rated thing I've ever seen on IMDb? I struggle to make sense of this.The only insight I can glean from listening to the people that religiously watch this show is that the fantasy elements of Game of Thrones bring in the Lord of the Rings Crowd, the Marvel Comics crowd, people who are happy with whatever schlock you throw in their face as long as it has to do with something mythical or a super hero. These are the people that made The Avengers one of the most successful movies of all time - despite the fact that the only good acting in the entire movie comes from Robert Downey, Jr. These are the people that keep Scarlett Johansson employed - despite the fact that she isn't really good at ANYTHING, whether acting, stage fighting acrobatics, being likable, OR even just looking pretty on film.Game of Thrones is essentially an amalgam of The Tudors and Spartacus with mildly better acting and effects. If you can't accept that, go make another stupid meme or internet game about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misogynistic Snuff Gorefest Showcasing GOT Creator's Anger Issue &amp; Tiny Little Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summing up... Plenty of female body parts rivaling French soft porn but WITHOUT the French's artfulness or equal showing of male organs. Plenty of blood and exposed putrid rotting flesh and corpses without meaning or humor or joy. End result: a feudal-era porn and modern-day snuff offering, by the jaded, for the jaded.Sure. This show has emotional intensity and well-paced plot. Overall top notch, coherent screen writing, directing, art direction, and editing. Superb, world class, diverse, highly talented cast. Regardless, there are still characters to root for, John Snow, Arya among others. With all these top ingredients in place, Game of Thrones could have easily been enthroned a 21st century classic in decades to come. But it's already rotting from inside out.Intelligent viewers know there are so many ways to show the act of killing, copulation, psychological evil and human depravity. They also know when they are being manipulated a d assaulted by the story-teller.Why stoop so low, dear writers and producers? Truth is the Game of Thrones writing team could've been more confident, more selective and artful. They should realize by the 6th episode they don't have to stoop to the level of the lowest common denominator to get attention. Yet they continue to choose the easiest and shortest path: aggressive, sadistic, full-frontal, in-your-face gratuitous vomit-inducing scenes of rotting flesh, endless explicit images of female debasement and equally vicious performance of male castration. Game of Thrones has become primary about how far to push the envelope of tastelessness, "creativity" in sadistic ideas and imagery, flaunting of the ugliest human depravity, while great story-telling has become secondary. Oh and I say this as an non-religious sort and fan of Dexter and Breaking Bad with their ample blood and gore and explicit sex violence and psychological darkness. Key female characters had to strip to be on the show, in compromising and demeaning positions, so why stop there? Why not go all the way? Why are male organs spared? Why are some females in the show spared the fate of unceremonious nudity, others had to go on all fours and banged like mere beasts? The writers acted like they spare no-one in this story universe, enjoyed having the power to rip off clothes from all the actresses they cast because they can, because majority of male audience would supposedly cheer them on. But the celebratory and bloody multiple stabbing of a pregnant defenseless woman through her late term fetus in the womb in explicit detail is our idea of fun and entertainment? Men enjoy it? Really? If the writer directors had fun writing, constructing and witnessing that scene, the devil has gotten to them. The devil grinned at the audience many times during the Red Wedding, through the creators who have long crossed the line of decency.By design these *UNNECESSARY* EXHIBITION of sadistic inhumanity and psychological filth will attract a certain kind of audience - the blood-thirsty, filth-lusting, repressed sadist sorts. They will deify this show, for their beastly lusts are being reflected right on prime time TV. We will never know if GOT is popular because it is a piece of great timeless art because, GOT Writer-directors have sold out long ago. Shame. This show could have been a 21st century cultural legend, outdoing Lord of the Rings and everything in the genre. Could have been.15 Apr 2014 UPDATE Just watched the latest... Dialogs becoming more current-day urban Londoner street slang and unnatural for GOT world. More naked female bodies on cheap display, while male vital body parts remain cowardly hidden. 3X jump in females being debased and slaughtered, and scenes starring young girl corpses. That's GOT writer's idea of boundary-pushing.Everyday misogynists and child snuff consumers shall rejoice. Minus 2 more stars. Hey the cowardly GOT creators - might as well go for male organ full-frontal, pedophilia and full-on incest orgies. Come on, don't be such cowards. What you guys are doing is not real boundary-pushing, but merely going way back to the most regressive and cannibalistic era of feudal Rome.Borrowing from fantasized TV story Rome or the real Romans is not very creative is it? GOT is supposed to be a fantasy, not a humorless documentary featuring *historical studies in female subjugation &amp; male sadism*?Lame...and progressively lamer...</fullReview>

I've suffered through 5 season of this garbage so far and I simply cannot understand why anyone would ever like this show. You can sum up the whole show in one word: violence. This show basically shows people get physically and emotionally tortured and killed for five seasons. That's it. Nothing else is happening. They're trying to make it look like a political thriller full of intrigue, betrayal and plot twists. But it's not. All the scheming and colluding the characters do leads to nothing, because they all eventually get tortured and brutally killed. There is no action, there are no battles, there is no strategy, there is no mystery, there is no magic. Although they keep promising all of that since s01e01. There's just pointless violence.Watch this only if you've already watched every other show ever made ever.</fullReview>

Game of thrones is without comparison the best of those two.To begin with I thought it was another over-hyped show, until i read some of the reviews and the user ratings on IMDb, then I gave it a chance. By the end of the first episode, i was already hooked. There is so much going on at the same time and you will never bored watching this masterpiece of a TV show. The characters are all amazing. One of the best part is (like breaking bad) you can't really figure out what is going to happen. If you want to watch a TV show that contains it all; love, war, greed, treachery, violence, suspense and much more, then you have come to the perfect place. You will find many characters that you will either hate or love, and George R.R. Martin is not afraid of killing one or two of your favorite characters.

		<shortDescription>Did you read the books?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the reviews here, I was very amused, mostly about the strong contrast in positive and negative opinions. First of all, just to clarify, I agree with the majority. I love the show, and it's great. As good and as mindblowing awesome as Breaking Bad? No, probably not. That is just not possible. Therefore I gave it only a 9, and it's anyway a bad idea to compare shows with each other. When you review GoT, or read reviews, or watch it, or plan to watch it, there is one thing you have to keep in mind. Have you read the books? People are complaining about the plot, the enormous amount of characters, the constant dying of those characters, and the slow pace. Well, considering that this show is based on literature of epic dimensions, the show is doing a great job adapting to it. If you haven't read the book, the amount of characters and the storyline, might be confusing to you. Although the story has been already simplified. The slow pace is just a huge build-up, for the last books to come, what I expect to be one hell of a showdown. If you don't like nudity and violence, don't watch the show and don't read the books. If you think it's to much to see an actor brother and sister pretending to have sex, well, don't watch the show. My advice to anyone out there is to read the books. I did, and the show for me is now a tightly packed summary of them. Does it bother me? No, because I know how difficult and complicated it must be, to produce this show. So when forming your own opinion about GoT, keep one thing in mind. The books. Have you read them, or not?</fullReview>

Though I will say that Arya Stark and Jon Snow (whose character reminded me of Ender, from Ender's Game) are also to my liking. Also there are hateful and evil, but without them there would be a good story. Among the negative things I've found, I note that, despite the maps, I struggled to follow the routes of the characters at times. I was also like that it was not necessary to describe the costumes of all the characters every time they appeared.

		<fullReview>Well, i really enjoyed the first 4 seasons. Some interesting characters and also character development within credible plots and some twists. At first I didn't like Game of Thrones and needed a second attempt to watch it. Once I get into the world of GoT i really like how the story was told and only a few faults I noticed. With the start of season 5 and continuation in season 6 the show lost me, just a few good scenes and developments. I didn't read the books, just started the first one. And I think the TV show writers did a good job on the original material by GRRM. Well, till they come to season 5 and 6. In season 6 they speed up some story lines and I don't really care about most characters, how can I if I see them only a few moments in a season? Now the characters don't develop (no time for that) anymore, they just have to operate. And the writing lost it's subtle brilliance, but we get a better production value instead. I don't want to spoil and go into details, but there a some plot developments and character actions which are just poorly written, but it looks great. Obvious the makers switched focus, for me the show lost it's high value and there are better shows to watch but as I can see among my friends and reactions on the internet most people agree with the show and where it is going. For me just the bran plot line could be interesting in the future and also the white walker part and the rest seems to be predictable. In the sixth season I started reading fan theories and reviews and found more interesting plot developments among the fans than the actual TV writers. To give it a rating: 8 of 10 because of the first 4 Seasons, for season 5 and 6 I would give a 6 and 7 (of 10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review of "Game of Thrones," Season 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Season 1 of "Game of Thrones;" I really did. I don't yet love the show in the same way that so many other people do, however, and I'd honestly rate this 10-episode season an 8 out of 10. If that sounds like faint praise for a show that seems universally loved, I concede that my criticisms really reflect my own personal tastes, not to mention my admittedly narrow attention span.It's an undeniably well made show, in terms of everything from acting to set design. Its densely plotted story (with so many characters!) suggests to me that it is probably true to George R. R. Martin's books, which I have not read. The show seems like an authentic adaptation that respects the viewer's intelligence and consequently demands a lot of him or her.There is a lot to admire, such as the show's attention to a myriad of details in order to meticulously render Martin's fantasy universe. Peter Dinklage is consistently wonderful to watch as Tyrion Lannister. Aidan Gillen and Conleth Hill are both downright Shakespearian as Littlefinger and Varys, the two duplicitous members of the Court at King's Landing. Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) and Iain Glen (Jorah Mormont) are also all favorites of mine. (Glen is none other than the "Resident Evil" films' original Wesker! And he has such a damn cool voice.)The script, direction and production values all usually seem quite good. The show even has moments of brilliance -- the first episode's opening teaser, in which we witness an attack on the border wall by the icy "White Walker" monsters, was scarier than a hell of a lot of horror movies I've seen.Which brings us to my frustrations, and, yes, they are mostly subjective. I actually did bring certain appetites as an audience member that weren't met. I craved more action, and greater emotional payoff for the dialogue-heavy story arcs that built tension throughout the first season. (Caveat: I am a fan of both horror movies and war films, and I suspect I'm not exactly the target audience for what is essentially a political thriller in a fantasy context.)The inaugural episode's White Walkers were what I was dying to see the most. And I do think they should have been featured more prominently, from a storytelling perspective. Otherwise they shouldn't have served as the teaser-opener for the entire season. Nor should they have been the plot driver for the story lines connected with the Wall and The Night's Watch.We also see extensive preparations for war, and military maneuvering -- we even have important scenes taking place at troop encampments. But there is absolutely no climax for these steadily building plot developments. I know I sound like a 13 year old, and maybe I am just not sophisticated enough to enjoy the show on its current levels, but I wanted see a battle. From a storytelling perspective, I suggest it's a bad creative decision to end the season without allowing us to truly witness a major land engagement. I do realize that we indeed see one house's brutal invasion of another's castle, and that it's well done. But it was too brief. Again, while "Game of Thrones" has all the trappings of a period war series, this is a political thriller in a fantasy context.As for the Machiavellian politics, I am embarrassed to admit that I got lost early on. Yes, I'm fully aware that others are able to follow these plot threads quite easily. (My college chums can.) I'd just advise another viewer of average intelligence that their enjoyment might be affected by an unusually detailed story that requires their strict attention.Finally, I do feel that there is a dearth of likable and identifiable characters. Nearly every major player is motivated by an ignoble goal (power). Many betray one another; that's the show's favorite plot point. Sean Bean's Eddard Stark is only a putative hero, to me. Yes, he's fighting for the rightful heir to the throne, but he's still serving a monarchy; he's not sticking up for the common man or anything. (We see loyalty among various characters to various noblemen, but nobody seems to care about the peasants.) Furthermore, Stark's actions toward a scared subordinate in the first episode made me unsympathetic to him. (I don't care who has vowed to do what -- his action in the series premier was unwarranted.)Jon Snow is well scripted as a "good" character, but the actor portraying him needs to work on his range. Kit Harrington is decent in the role, but he too often looks like a sad, spurned poet. (Hey, it's okay, Snowman, I've been there myself.)Daenerys Targaryen appears to be a "good" character, and I do like her. She's thinly rendered, though, despite what seems like an inordinate amount of screen time devoted to her major subplot. (And this subplot, with its legions of bare-chested barbarians, seems like a slowly paced cousin of the 1990's "Xena: Warrior Princess.") Daenerys seems like an obvious power-fantasy for victimized women. (Yeah, I know there's nothing wrong with that. And, yeah, I know that people say something similar about my beloved comic book movies.)With all of these criticisms, it may sound as though I didn't enjoy "Game of Thrones." To the contrary, I did. If you like fantasy and are looking for something well made and different, I'd recommend you try this. I think maybe I'm just trying to justify my more modest enthusiasm for one of contemporary pop culture's sacred cows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a tremendous show this is ? I would give a 10/10 to this show and the best one I have seen. HBO produces shows that last in memories for a long time. My favorite character is Daenerys Stormborn. She came out of no where and just gave an inspirational journey to remember. Its been just 4 seasons and I simply can't wait for the 5th. The show follows the book in a great way although there are some changes but its alright as books and shows cannot be completely same. I love this show and would urge HBO to produce epic fantasy shows like "GAME OF THRONES". If shows like GAME OF THRONES, BREAKING BAD , DEXTER and PRISON BREAK continue though they are the masterpieces of different channels people would have nothing to do in the world except blow their minds of with such tremendous performances of the actors, the direction of the directors and definitely the writers . George R R Martin is a class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly one of the best, if not the best, TV-shows I have ever seen. It mixes great drama with powerful action. The actors are all very well casted and their performances are topnotch! The storyline is very fresh from other TV series, of course we all know that George R.R. Martin kills a lot of main characters but that is what makes the series different, there are still lots of unexpected plot twists and great dialogues in this series. The only thing what keeps me from rating this series a 10 is the fact that they change directors every few episodes, all directors are great but they film in a different way therefor making each episode with a different director slightly "different" than the others.But this is still one of the best series ever made and I will encourage everyone to see it!</fullReview>

From characters like Joffrey and Littlefinger and even minor characters like yoren and bronn have their own background and story you can invest in. I strongly recommend this show to anyone who has never seen it and have to say that even Breaking Bad is trumped by this show. Not only is there interesting characters and even more interesting story lines there is also Dragons and White Walkers. My personal favourite characters are the villains such as both the boltons and Karl Tanner and of course Joffrey but my favourite character is arguably the hero of the show,Jon Snow.I very strongly recommend anyone to try this show.

		<shortDescription>Amazing - I absolutely love it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can honestly not fault the Game of Thrones. It took me along time to give in to all the people telling me to watch it, as i thought I would hate a show that focused around the years of Kings and Queens and dragons. I have never been interested in a show that is situated in a completely different time to our own. But i was SO wrong in thinking that I would hate it, in fact i'd go as far as to say I love this show. It is honestly brilliant. While I have not read the books, I have read many reviews and apparently the show is very very similar to the books. Which proves it is true to the story and obviously a great adaptation of George Martins brilliant books ( he seriously needs to hurry up and finish the books). The only negative comment I have of this story is the fact that Rob Stark and his wife and baby died.... Rob was my favourite character and I hate how easily he was killed off. But honestly while I hate they did this, I like how it depicts this time, and how no one is safe... because in most shows our favourite characters usually survive, but in Game of Thrones that is just not true. It doesn't matter who the character is, in fact Im sure all the main characters will die. And while its sad, it makes you forget you are watching a TV show, and you easily lose yourself in the story. Without a doubt in my mind, I would highly recommend this show! It is completely brilliant and a nice change from so many shows we watch today. It has changed my preferences of TV shows and movies so much, that now I am searching for shows that are a little similar to it. Right now I'm watching the show Reign, and i can't wait to introduce myself to a whole new genre of books, movies and TV shows. It really does change your opinion on what you think you like, all the while making you feel about 100000 emotions while you're watching it.If you have any doubts, don't. You will not be disappointed in watching this show :) I give it about 10000 thumbs up. Happy reading/watching.</fullReview>

Cersei wants revenge because Ned discovers her plotting and later on because she's stripped of her clothes and seen by the whole kingdom ? Tyrion wants revenge because he has been mistreated ? Ned wants revenge because he's the only good guy(and likable) in the show, and wants to show the whole kingdom what an a**holes the Lannisters are, to bad he doesn't have the time necessary ? Robb wants revenge cause his father is dead, oh wait was that a spoiler? Sorry, now you know the whole season 1. ? Daenerys wants revenge because Mad King was assassinated ? Jon Snow doesn't want revenge, or does he? ? Stannis wants revenge because he doesn't have the throne ? Littlefinger is annoying, so is Joffrey ? No explanation on what the walkers are in reality ? No background on the general story, the show begins on a muddy foundation of things that happen and we didn't see... Every character in this show is interested on revenge, but I was never convinced by anyone of them, there is no real motivation for these characters, or for us to root for them and to like them, I didn't even hated Joffrey, he was rather annoying than evil. Want an evil character: Gus Fring, Ben Linus, Scofield's mother, hell even the Master in Doctor Who and so on... There is no substance here and the characters don't fight for freedom or for others, they fight for themselves(OK maybe Jon Snow fights for his family) or to get revenge on someone, and it's really sad, that you as a viewer are only entertained by this "revenge" thing, brutality, sex, blood and violence, but the characters are not well developed and likable to really care for them when they die. Basically this show is all about revenge, death and sex, nothing more nothing less. And yes it's the best at what it does, but that's not mature or human, it's animalistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Updated after Season 6)Set in a fantasy land (though, in many ways, very similar to Earth in the Middle ages) the stories of several families and individuals and their quest for power. In particular, they all want the Iron Throne...Great, epic fantasy drama, based on the books by George RR Martin. Though focusing on several individuals, it contains clever interlocking story lines, weaving family feuds, power trips and pure greed and malice. Superb cinematography, settings and scenery. Performances are spot- on too.On the negative side, there are possibly too many stories being told simultaneously. Too many characters in the story I don't care about. This is particularly so in Seasons 3 and 4.Characters, often heroes and seemingly there for the long haul, get killed off in the blink of an eye, and out of the blue. This is good and bad. Good in that it shows that, as in life, there are no certainties and "heroes" / very likable characters with depth aren't necessarily immortal (this is definitely not Disney!). On the other hand, it leaves you feeling distant and unengaged. It's difficult to support a character when they could be killed off at any moment.Also, too many plot twists and gruesome killings, just for shock value. Not that I have an issue with watching killings, they just seem gratuitous and over-indulgent at times. While the plot is good and the characters have depth, it isn't all substance - style plays its part and sometimes the dial is too much over to the style side.This all said, it does start to come together from Season 5 onwards. Seasons 1 and 2 were good, and set up the story for some great development in Season 3. Unfortunately, Seasons 3 and 4 drifted somewhat. Season 5 gets us back on track and Season 6 propels the story forward in a big way. Season 6 would the best of the lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched countless shows over the years, but Game of Thrones is the show that impacted me the most. It's an obsession and in my opinion it is literally the best show ever made! From the characters to the plot, from the huge world to every little backstory, everything is just so amazing. Its hard to describe in words. Game of thrones isn't afraid to challenge its viewers to hang on while it twists and turns like an angry beast, you will be challenged, but if you are able to endure, you will be in for one heck of a ride. The world of Westeros has consumed me, I think about Game of Thrones even when I'm busy doing other things, this is the first time a TV show or movie has done this to me. Watch this show, if you are a fan of fantasy, i guarantee you, you will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

I caught up from the very beginning and watched the last episode of Season 3 the night it was aired.Totally hooked on the show and eager to watch each episode as it was aired.2015 held high hopes and I already knew after watching episode 1 and Throne Cast on Sky that the writers hadn't written ahead for the TV series so stories were changing. The 2015 season did have some great story lines, but it didn't capture you like the previous seasons. No mention of the 3 eyed raven at all in the whole season. When it finally finished I was left without that same feeling of wanting the next season to appear so quickly. I think the screen writers have now spoilt the series and although I would continue to watch them until they finally wrote of the series it wouldn't bother me now if the series is shelved.Lets just hope that they up the game in 2016 and concentrate on the storyline rather than the special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent show, has been carrying higher potential, funny death scenes and unnecessary nudity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the first 4 seasons I've decided to give GOT 9 stars. But for all the unnecessary and awkward nudity, I'm talking away one star.GOT is about the iron throne of the 7 kingdoms. And people who are trying to control get comfortable on the iron throne. So they wage wars, people die. "King"s fall. Noble families decays. And all these unfortunate incidents are originated from "incest".This show is all about tragedy. It preys on your addiction to sadness. Without tragedy, it would have not been a great success. But they could at least make the death scenes more emotional. I mean when I watched the show with my brother, we both laughed during the death scenes. So come on be more serious.The show is shot in 4-5 different European countries. And all of them offers beautiful views. It's one of the great thing about the show. The beautiful soundtracks will make get yourself lost inside the TV. The cast of GOT is very large and quite powerful. Beside they need new casting members each season because a significant number of characters die each season.The show offers a great deal of violence and gore, which is acceptable for a show set in medieval time. But they really don't need to show these much nudity. I don't want to watch porn.GOT had the stuffs that makes a "Best TV Show of all time". It still has. But unless they stop playing it safe GOT won't reach it's full potential.</fullReview>

You could argue Breaking Bad possibly but Bad and i had a falling out, it became boring to me at points up until the series finale....Holy crap!!But it still does not compare to GOT. Yes True detective was amazing but not as big or as epic as GOT. I was a huge fan even before the show started. I have read all the books and when i heard HBO was going to do the GOT series I lost my mind and was so stoked so i read all the books again to catch up before the show started. I have not missed an episode and do not plan to. I recommend this show very much. It has everything; drama, action, romance and crazy plot twists. George R.R. Martin has no problem killing off main characters which just adds to the excitement and suspense because no one is safe....</fullReview>

Bad things happen to good people in Game of Thrones. That's part of the beauty of Game of Thrones, your feelings aren't spared in the least. The series will break your heart, shake you up and leave you disillusioned. Once you become immersed in the story and allow yourself to feel for the characters there's no turning back regardless of what happens.I've ready all the books, will own all the DVDs.

		<shortDescription>Great Casting and Visually Stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series I was thrilled when HBO announced this series, but also somewhat ill-at-ease after having seen so many other much loved books ruined in screen adaptations.Overall I think HBO have done an outstanding job, especially in the area of casting. The characters come across almost exactly as I imagined them in the books, and some even better. In particular I've been hugely impressed with the work of Jack Gleeson as Joffrey. I seriously want to strangle that little $%^* - which is kinda the point!The visuals are also stunning, with dragons, giants, and white walkers seamlessly integrated into the scenes.Of course, as with any die-hard fan I have my gripes. The replacement of Jeyne Westerling with Talisa Maegyr, seemed clumsy and unnecessary. It appears that the producers wanted a more "romantic" storyline.The omission of Strong Belwas is also disappointing, and leaves me wondering how they will cover some of his role in future parts of the story.But these complaints are minor, and certainly do little to diminish the overall mastery of this story by the cast and crew, for what is surely one of the most talked about TV shows in history, inspiring a multitude of only fan sites - and even an online coloring book (http://www.gameofthronescoloringbook.com)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most imaginative series...yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Game of Thrones" to me right now is the best show on TV by a long way. To me, it would hold it's own even against the great shows of HBO from the last decade, which (at least to me) is quite an achievement for a series which has just concluded it's second season.This it achieves due to it's complete form as a piece of art. It has the best cast ensemble where character development is achieved with a fluidity that is hard to attain when you have so many major players crunched into ten episode seasons. It's writing is mesmerizing as the prose brings to the forefront many aspects which not only provides an intricate look into this fantastical world, but insights into the human mind in our world. There are great performances provided from it's cast coming from actors of all ages with the greatest turn provided by Peter Dinklage, who right now is probably the most favorite TV character and Jack Gleeson who delves into the evil side of a young king, who is a sociopath, with a realism you would not expect from an actor so young. It has at it's disposal some of the most accomplished TV Directors who have directed numerous episodes in great shows such as "The Sopranos", "Deadwood", "Six Feet Under", "The Wire" just to name a few. The greatest asset of the show, however, is the vision of the writer of the Best-selling novel it is based on, George R. Martin and the visionary adaptation done by it's two creators, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss who have brought Martin's magical world to screen with enviable perfection.The series deals with the struggle of many different factions who wish to control the Iron Throne which sits at King's Landing in Westeros. Like any form of art which deals with power, it deals with many varying characters with different methods and motives in achieving their own needs and wants to ensure survival, power and other aims depending on the needs of the player who plays this dangerous game. It is immersed in a world filled with magic but it provides a realistic look into the thin line maintained between good and evil and who's validity is influenced by the ones who control the definitions through victory rather than with reason. Even though the central plot to the series is the struggle towards holding or achieving the Iron throne, there is another significant war without which this struggle would never go on. This "other" war is fought by the unknown and the rejected of society who hold the wall against civilization and are not accorded with the glory which is showered on warriors they protect. They live their lives in anonymity despite their sacrifices. The realm of the true unsung hero is portrayed through these guardians who are not how you would picture them to be and who invalidate all our definitions about heroes despite performing actions which being called heroic would trivialize their sacrifices.For all of you who have not seen this show, I have tried to keep the information to it's bare minimum because it is a MUST-SEE for every adult and it would be a crime for me to spoil it for you. If you want to watch something which is provocative, smart and unique, this show is bound to be your cup of tea. "Game of Thrones" to me is the most imaginative series of all time and has raised the bar on television like the select few shows that came before it and which shaped the quality of the medium during their existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I admit, I hadn't read "A Song Of Ice And Fire" before watching the first episode. I was worried the books would ruin my enjoyment of watching the show. I was wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the trailers for months, being a fan of sword and sorcery fantasy I was looking forward to this new series. I wasn't disappointed. By the last episode I had made up my mind to read the books. I was amazed to see how close the producers stayed to Martins writing. The actors really felt their parts. Peter Dinklage, Michelle Fairly Emilia Clarke are all stand outs, not to mention all the Stark children. The dialog was almost word for word. From page to screen, Martins prose brought to life, almost exactly like he wrote it. It wasn't really till my second viewing that I really fell in love with Game Of Thrones. Although, I must be honest I missed a lot of the details they left out. Things like Daenerys being dressed before her meeting Kal Drogo, being told that the Kal is so rich even his slaves wear golden collars. Then, her hand maid puts a golden choker around her neck. Daenerys' and Bran's dreams, and the flashbacks to the rebellion that won Robert Baratheon the iron throne just to name a few. I understand sometime its necessary to omit certain things when making an adaptation, but it would have been so easy to include most of this things, but I digress. Now the second season has begun. Having now read the first 4 books I can only hope they can keep true to the VERY complex narrative. So far its only 4 episodes in, and even though they have already advanced the pacing of several story lines and changed many details such as Tywin Lanister being the ruling lord at Harrenhal instead of Roose Bolton, I still find the show a very enjoyable watch. I have read online that HBO has included things from book 3 in season 2. I can only pray they did not have to remove plot lines for book 2 to cram in whatever bits they took from book 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the series a lot and got interested enough to read the books. The series depict intrigues and drama, mostly accurately following the books story line. Of course some minor characters and events are left out since it is impossible to show on the screen all the broad scope of the books. People who say the show is not moving forward obviously didn't read the books (about 1000 pages each). The acting is good on the most part - especially Peter Dinklage who is brilliant as Tyrion, and Sean Bean. Other well-played characters are Catelyn Stark, Littlefinger, Bronn, Pycelle, Varys, Hound, Theon and Daenarys. Joffrey is very annoying as he is smiling all the time, and his facial expressions don't match his cruelty.Some casting problems - the actor who is playing Robb has frozen expression, and a very thick accent. Brienne is not ugly enough. She should be ugly as in the book, because this is one of her motives to be a warrior. Asha Greyjoy is supposed to be sexy and attractive - the actress is not. Margaery should be younger. There is too much sex and gay sex - some scenes were invented and never appeared in the books: the lesbian scene in the brothel, Margaery and Renly on their wedding night, Renly and Loras, Joffrey and the whores. I don't think that people watch this show for the sex and nudity, so why to throw in even more than necessary by the plot. Overall - great entertainment despite some shortcomings. I hope there will be third and forth seasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The show is pretty entertaining, for most of the time, but I don't get it why people don't admit that after season 4, is just a major drop. By the end of season 4, some of the more interesting characters die( and the actors playing them really helped making them interesting) - YGRITTE, Shae, OBERYN, TYWIN LANNISTER, JOFFREY , NED STARK, Robb Stark, etcAnd you are then left with, for example, - the awful Arya storyline(the many faced god-cmon), - the Daenerys forever boring storyline which I never cared for since she is not that good of an actor to me, - Tyrion Lannister is not that interesting anymore because he is not at the castle, - Jaime becomes kinda hmmm... even if i wanna like it.. he becomes dull , - Littlefinger with his annoying way of speaking, - the religious fanatics at the castle - are you kidding, when the other kings smashed people just for fun, and then comes some random small group of people that all of a sudden has power over everything, that is pathetic in line with the show, - the Ramsay part is interesting at the beginning but after that I just think it takes to much unnecessary screen time And after season 4 seeing people just die over and over you just don't care anymore for no one, especially at the end of season 6. The Jon Snow storyline is still interesting, and there are still some good parts and really good characters in the show, but what remains tends to be more annoying.I think season 2, 3 and 4 are really great, season 1 has some crappy parts where everything seems to happen from the smallest reasons(the king dies from a boar, a boy just dies because Arya played with him and Joffrey is annoyed, Bran is pushed from the tower and miraculously not dies, etc), well and season 5 and 6 are terrible for me, except for the battles and the great characters that still remain in the show (like Davos Seaworth, Jon Snow, Bronn, Brienne of Tarth, Jorah and maybe some bits of Jaime, Cersei, Sansa, Theon and maybe some other that don't come to mind just now)</fullReview>

The show takes you on an amazing ride. Some says it's boring?

		<fullReview>I felt the need to add my two cents simply because of the (somewhat few) negative reviews posted on IMDb. The only criticism I can accept is the fact of much female nudity, compared with no full frontal male nudity, a strange yet common phenomenon not in any way limited to this series. Other than that, GOT is what so many others have accurately described: possibly the most beautifully filmed, addictive TV show ever produced. The acting is simply superb, on all levels. This is one show that could be truly described as having an ensemble cast, and to that end, no actor/actress seems to outshine the others. All are excellent and seem to truly understand their character's motivations. I have also read the books which were truly fantastic, although at times long. I could not even have imagined it possible that a TV show could be so true to the books and yet almost exceeding the quality of the books. The few plot variations from book to show tend to make sense in terms of making the series watchable and in light of the time restrictions for each season. The people responsible for casting show really deserve a lot of credit. I am absolutely blown away by how well each character is translated to the screen and which actors are chosen for each part. In addition, as other reviewers have noted, the production values and special effects are second to none. Of course, a lot of people die in the show and I was sad to that Sean Bean had only one season. But, oh, did he make good use of it! I'm sure everyone has their favorites, I personally think the actors who play Lord Baelish (Littlefinger), Lord Varys and Stannis Baratheon are just amazing. But then, who isn't, on GOT? Ultimately, the real reason for the brilliance of this series is some truly unforgettable moments. So many movies and TV shows are enjoyable, but I end up not thinking much about them after they have ended. Not so with GOT. I laud the producers for taking it seriously enough to produce a truly meaningful, important work of art. There will always be haters and naysayers, I am glad that so many people appreciate this show. Thanks HBO, for making me so happy!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Feel Obligated to Review This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually do not review television series' until the end, because anything can happen, but I've been tempted for a very long time with this masterpiece. My God, I have never went through so many emotions during a show. This show is the top of the cake for me and Breaking Bad is second... Which is bad, because that isn't even on the cake compared to how amazing this show is. A great TV show has characters you are interested in and a story structure that doesn't get old. Game of Thrones takes that bottom-line goal of all TV shows and exceeds to the max with characters you genuinely believe in. You love some to death, you hate some with a passion, you feel bad for some, and overall... You care what happens to these fictitious people. That is what's important. Since, George R.R. Martin is such a fantastic, twisted writer he knows how to create amazing characters. We're introduced to many throughout the series and they all bring a story that somehow circulates into the main plot. It seems like shows like Walking Dead tries to mimic that, but it doesn't work for me, because there are many characters on Walking Dead I do not care for. Both series have something obvious to expect between them. And that is death. At any moment in both shows, anyone can die. With Walking Dead, you would be upset if a few die. The rest could die and it's whatever. The plot not even change. With Game of Thrones, every death is a blow, because you have time to really get to know these people. The plot spins out control with each death. That is quality television. Television is the only medium where you can truly capture a character's growth without it being too rushed or too slow. Game of Thrones really uses that to its advantage. Everything that's good about this show is that it takes the advantage of being a show that can last years and it is shot and presented like a damn movie. There's a reason it's the most pirated show in history. It is literally the perfect show. To think, the two producers that started it really didn't have any experience with television or film and they are doing such a wonderful job. If that's not inspiring, I don't know what is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All i really want to say about game of thrones is that i Love it! I really didn't think i would. I'm normally not in to the fantasy type stuff. When trees started walking in lord of the rings, i walked away from my TV! Its also safe to say i am now totally in love with Daenerys(Emelia Clarke)Another thing i love about GoT is the emotions it seem to evoke! I found myself genuinely angry after season 3 episode 9 and had to take some time to calm down!! Why did i care so much!? The characters are amazing, you find yourself really rooting for certain people, and actually caring about others, and of course hoping others get what they deserved!I normally like to save TV series up and watch them at my own pace, but with this i have to watch each episode as soon as its on TV! The only reason this doesn't get 10 stars from me is because i still can't fully get over the fantasy bits, fire gods, monsters north of the wall etc i clearly just don't have the imagination!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quick Review - No spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I held out on Game Of Thrones for quite some time for a few reasons..If I had read the novels , I most likely wouldn't have (to be completely honest , medieval fantasy fiction has never really been my thing).. George RR Martin may have just changed all of that... The show has stricken a chord with some folks, which just lends it even more credibility if you ask me..It is brutal. beastly . revolting. disgusting and heartbreaking. it's also beautiful , spirited, uplifting, soulful and inspirational..watching it is an experience- one that seems to resonate. this show does , in a way, what Breaking Bad is also doing for me - engaging me in such a way that I revel in what is my own sense of what it is to be human..and needless to say, I am entirely invested in the characters - which leaves me even further in suspense, as NOBODY is safe!The casting team and the acting crew also deserve props for this one as well.. With the exception of just a few independent scenes , the acting is superb..it would really easy to chew up the scenery , yet they walk the line extremely well. The production is , of course, outstanding. Everything from costume design to the invention of the languages used was well prepared and executed brilliantly. It is a bit ironic to think of how skeptical I was of the show , given my initial reluctance to sit down and watch it, and now, how much I enjoy it . Matter of fact, I don't think I could trust a person who has watched three episodes and does't thoroughly enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I haven't read the books</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Im not a big fan of reading books. Don't like it all. But, as I watched how good reviews Game of the Thrones I just thought for myself "Allright, I deeply hope that IMDb doesn't screw this up nor the voters, so I give it a try".I started to watch. Maybe a bit slow start, didn't catch up everything, but as the Series went on, I became more and more stuck. The characters are great in most part. Many fit in their role very good. Now I've finished the first Season and all I can say is: Wow! Amazing. Much nudity and curses, but that doesn't mean that these series sucks, its not that way! Its a really great series and I like it much.Hmh, Im sure that its because I haven't read the books I don't understand completely everything, or I hope at least I understand most of the series (becouse this was my first Season, gonna watch the second now) so.. I could've give this a 10/10 but I stick with a 8/10. One of the best series I've ever watched....So far, I hope Season 2 is as good as this one, or Better..I'll edit my post after Season 2. So far 8/10I must say that Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister is a superb character (and actor of course) There is no words to describe, no words. Peter nailed it as Tyrion. Just simply amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Season 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can say, that Game of Thrones is the best TV show I ever watched. Better than, House, Heroes, 24 or even Dexter. Although, I have to admit, that by the first episode I wasn't really fond of the show, it even annoyed me little, because I expected it more to be like Lord of the Rings. If you want to watch the series because you liked Sean Bean in Peter Jackson's trilogy, then Game of Thrones will be disappointing for you. It is something entirely different, and although it is, as well, in the fantasy genre, its style can not be compared to The Lord of the Rings. It's much darker, bloodier, has a lot more swearing and nudity. So, if you expect to see some fun adventure like the movie trilogy stated above, avoid this show. Because, I have to say, I hated the first episode, because it disappointed me so much. I ceased watching the show even, but when I learned it was nominated for Golden Globe, I thought I'd give it a second chance. And I'm glad I did.The story is good, the actors are fantastic, the intro and theme music are amazing and the art direction and costume designs are also masterful. My favorites in the show were Tyrion Lannister (the amazing Peter Dinklage), Eddard Stark (the always great Sean Bean) and Daenerys Targarien (the fantastic Emilia Clarke). The two people I literally loathed were Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey whom I don't really like) and her annoying little brat, Joffrey Baratheon (played by Jack Gleeson, that kid with the annoying face from Batman Begins). Mark Addy was very funny, also Aidan Gillen and Kit Harington did very good jobs as well.I didn't read the book, but I liked the story and the drama very much. It was interesting to see a fantasy more about politics and the relationship of people, than the actual adventure. I would've liked more action though, I hated when they faded out of a whole battle scene just because Tyrion fell unconscious, but that's maybe because that's how it was done in the book or the creators didn't have enough money or time. Anyway, it's a great show, but it needs a bit more of fighting and battle. And a little less nudity wouldn't go amiss either. I don't see the need for it, so why show cocks and tits in every episode? If I wanted to see that, I'd go watch porn. Maybe the director was just horny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An addictive adult fantasy series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who love fantasy watching game of thrones is essential, and for the stereotypes who view fantasy as a tale of magic and princes, thrones will change your ideas completely. Game of thrones is an epic fantasy with an incredible character driven narrative and set against an epic backdrop of violence, nudity and sex. It's essentially a tale between 7 feuding families fighting for dominion over the mythical land of Westeros and the fascinating struggle for power that ensues. The plot is full of twists and turns that makes for a compelling drama, that is set in some of the most stunning locations witnessed on TV. Breathtaking location like the frozen fortress of the Nights Watch and the rats nest of a capital that is Kings Landing, provide the viewer with plenty of eye candy, whilst confirming this shows status as the most ambitious piece of work ever to grace TV. The production values and high quality script writing both contribute to the overall quality of the show, with quotes like "Try to penetrate the enigma that is me" and "Winter is coming" soon becoming common household phrases and typifying the quality of the people who work on the show. However it's the characters and actors who portray them, that make this show truly great. From the witty dwarf Tyrion Lannister played by the excellent Peter Dinklage, to the noble Ned Stark played by the legendary Sean Bean,to the feisty Daenerys Targaeryan played by the beautiful Emilia Clarke, thrones oozes quality in the character and acting department. Even some of the supposedly minor characters like the slippery informant Varys,the loudmouthed GreatJohn Umber, the mindless oaf Hodor and the infamous mercenary Bronn all manage to be intriguing in their own way, which highlights the vast array of unique characters thrones has. Thrones manages to keep the audience emotionally invested in its various characters, whether you are rooting for the honorable Ned or cursing at the scheming Lord Baelish,there is a character everyone can relate to. Overall thrones is a sophisticated adult fantasy that doesn't hold back, and HBO must be commended for their faithful adaptation of the a song of ice and fire series of books. The sheer gore and sexual activities encompassed in the series makes it a uniquely entertaining experience and not one for the feint hearted. Lord of the rings this certainly isn't, game of thrones reinvents the fantasy genre in a stylish sort of way, which is a credit to author George RR Martin and show runners David Benioff and Dan Weiss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every episode contains drama, and excitement!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This show is one in a million. The difference between Game Of Thrones and other shows is simply this. Every episode is grabbing, i found that in Breaking Bad, or in Sons Of Anarchy, or in True Detective that the episodes are not reeling you in every time. But in this masterpiece, i find that i am always interested to watch. One aspect of brilliance includes the dispersion of the various character story lines. E.g. Daenerys Targarean, or Jamie Lannister, or Arya Stark etc. This technique enhances the viewers attention, and gives the audience something new to look forward to, rather than three or four characters that are followed the whole episode (like other TV shows). Overall, this is my favourite show, and is excellent. No other show competes with GOT, Winter Is Coming!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do I think this series is currently the best on TV? Yes I do. Every aspect is spot on. I haven't even touched the books, but this show makes me feel like I don't even need to. The characters all have an extreme amount of depth (despite the massive cast), and the plot leaves you wanting more with each and every episode. I've turned several friends onto this series and have yet to have one not fall in love with it. We've gotten to the point that each year after the season finally we become deeply depressed until the new season begins. That may not be healthy, but this obsession is just another testament to how amazing GoT really is.I don't really want to give anything away, so I'll stop here. If anyone is debating whether to start watching, don't hesitate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game Of Thrones, what a show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY REVIEW CONTAIN A HUGE AMOUNT OF SPOILERS FROM BOTH BOOK AND SHOW Be aware WHEN READING:D I started to watch Game Of Thrones after the fourth season had ended, cause I has wanted to watch it ever since I knew it about the storyline, it was a couple days after the third season had just finished that I found out it was not based in this world or time(aka : Fiction and I love me some fiction). So after I found that out I went to its wikia page and there I saw a picture with Dany and Drogo it looked as if her boobs were being shown, I then went and looked up "parental guide for game of throne", to my knowing there was a huge amount of nudity and sex(Me : since I am 14 I don't want to see that kinda stuff).So after the fourth season was done I looked at the parental guide on IMDb and it said "no nudity" on the last episode, so I downloaded and watched it, I did not know who was who, what was what, where was where I only knew Dany, Sansa, and Jon, I was so clueless before I thought Jon falls in love with Sansa, not knowing that its his half-sister and still I oddly liked the episode. So again I went to its Wikia and and went to the first episode of the entire show(Winter Is Coming) page and scrolled down and saw "recap for winter is coming, scene by scene" opened that, can back to IMDb's parents guide read the nudity in episode one, read to recap over and over again tell a knew when and where the sex/nudity scene appears(in even the same second)and when it ended both pages(IMDb guide and Wikia's page. I finally had everything I need for my watching of the first 5 episodes of the first season I just need to download them, I downloaded them and I watched them (skipping the sex/nudity scenes) and I loved every minute of each episode I watched of Game Of Thrones.Now I am on season 4 episode 6, and so far my favorite characters are The Golden Twins(Cersei and Jamie Lannister), Tryion Lannister, Sansa and Arya Stark, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen(aka Stormborn and shes my main favorite), Reek(Theon Greyjoy), and last Margaery Tyrell.My favorite part about the show is it is not those book turned show where they changed so much about the show that it puts you off it, that never changed that much from the book and when you get a twist like if they do bring in what if Jon Snow is the bastard son of Lyanna and Rhaegar cause readers remember Ned saying she "died in a bed of blood" and her last words were a promise she made him keep,a promise like protect my son, the people who say this theory isn't right bring that fact that he has a dire-wolf(sigil for House Stark)but the people who believe its true give a fact cause since Lyanna is Ned Starks full sister and he to would also have a wolf and all the other dire-wolfs(Shaggy-dog, Summer ,Lady, Grey Wolf , and last Nymeri ) all have dark like-fur because both of their parents Tully and Stark have dark hair, on the other hand Ghost(Jon Snows dire-wolf)has white(a color often made with a Targaryen features)fur and since the wolfs were made for stark children he to would get one since his mother is a Stark if this theory is right, they also bring in that in order for you to have a surname if your a bastard you need to know where your mother is from (i.e. where the mother is from, not where the father is from. For example, a noble lord from the Storm-lands could father one bastard child in the Vale, and another in the River-lands, but neither would use the surname "Storm": the first bastard would use the surname "Stone", and the second would use the surname "Rivers." credit to the Wikia page for Bastards ) Jon Snow, as a result of the mystery surrounding his mother's identity he came to use the name Snow but Ned didn't seem have a problem with this hence the idea he knows his sister is the mother to "his" supposed bastard son cause if it is her son he would use the name Snow but not by default Overall don't let nudity/sex, profanity get in the way of you watching the perfect show</fullReview>

Loved Sean Bean in the role of Ned Stark as the King's Hand. Lena Headey has come a long way from the "Sarah Connor Chronicles"! Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister was outstanding and immensely enjoyable to watch. The integrity of every cast member's role was maintained to the finish of the season.

They clearly don't understand that this happens in an alternative universe where anything and everything is possible, F-Words and Porn, having sex with whores is an extremely important for explaining how character's are, they're attitudes and actions say everything.I watched the first episode and was very surprised, got myself the next 9 hours and watched it in 9 hours, I was left astounded. Now I did not read the books, which made it very difficult for me to understand the story and plot the first viewing, I was confused some of the time and things didn't make sense to me. I made myself familiar with the characters and the history of the land of Westeros, the Houses and families, the second viewing of the entire season I was even more astounded. This is the type of production that makes you connect with the characters, extremely good writing this is.Give yourself a look at Game of Thrones, with an open mind, focus and a taste for good storytelling, you will not be left disappointed. Unless of course this whole type of thing simply doesn't enter your taste of genre, but then again, why are you here?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones (GoT) is a large-scale fantasy series; the first part of the trilogy "A Song of Ice and Fire" written by G.R.R. Martin.Basically, GoT is about several noble houses in the fantasy realm of Westeros that struggle to keep or to gain power. The king, Robert of the house Baratheon, currently occupies the so-called Iron Throne, the seat of power in Westeros. House Lannister is rich, ruthless and power-hungry and is directly involved in the important political decisions, as Cersei Lannister is the wife of King Robert.The Starks of Winterfell are rather loyal to the king and honorable in their duties. As the Lord of Winterfell, Eddard "Ned" Stark, is called to serve the king, he and his family are thrown into a maelstrom of political intrigue and devious and dangerous people around the king's court.The house of Targaryen is almost extinct, thanks to a war several years ago where Robert Baratheon claimed the throne in a rebellion against the king Aerys Targaryen. But 2 siblings, Danaerys and Viserys Targaryen, managed to flee across the "Narrow Sea" escaping certain death. Now they hatch plans to return to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne.HBO took the challenge to put the 800 pages of the first novel to screen with 10 one-hour-episodes. And they did it brilliantly!What makes this TV series so interesting and fun to watch (besides the really good story) are the actors. Almost all of them are great, especially the children (who play a vital role in the story). Maisie Williams (Arya), Jack Gleeson (wonderful evil Joffrey), Richard Madden (Robb), Isaac Hempstead-Wright (Bran) and Emilia Clarke (Danaerys) should be nominated for an Emmy! A storyline, that didn't interest me that much while reading the books, is brought to life by Emilia Clarke's portrayal of Danaerys Targaryen. That says a lot about the quality of her performance.The "adults" are also well cast, special mention goes to Sean Bean as Eddard "Ned" Stark and Michelle Fairley as his wife Catelyn. Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister is awesome, he really IS Tyrion.Yes, there are maaany characters in the show; all the more it is stunning to see them blend in easily and interact with each other so well.So many story lines to follow and so many characters to remember, that can be difficult. But it's worth it, absolutely. The decisions the characters (sometimes have to) make result from a rather quiet beginning and stand-off between the houses to outright war and murder. At the end of season 1, the realm stands on the brink of chaos, as there are now several people who lay claim to the throne. The opening credits also deserve mentioning: They are gorgeous and come with an epic musical score. This intro changes in some episodes according to the locations where the current episode is playing. Great idea.Thank you HBO, and all people involved, for bringing this book alive on the TV-screen.I highly recommend watching this series and I'm looking forward to season 2!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, The season is over and I have read several reviews here so now I guess it's my turn simply because I have been overwhelmed by this series.First, I have never read the books prior to watching this. I rarely watch TV so I missed the hype. I actually stumbled across a mention of this online while surfing the web on the day that the premiere aired. The name sounded familiar and sure enough, I had heard of the books but never read them, not being a huge fantasy fan. So I thought I'd try it.Wow, am I ever glad I did! This is the most astounding TV show I have seen since the first season of "Lost." The characters are entertaining, the story is gripping and the acting is fantastic. For the first time in years I eagerly awaited the next episode of a TV show and was never disappointed.This isn't your typical fantasy story. First, Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings this DEFINITELY is not. This is for adults! There is a lot of violence, some gory some just shocking, and a lot of sex. Someone else mentioned they were upset because the people who were mentioning the sex didn't mention the incest involved. Well that's probably because it's an integral part of the story and could be considered a SPOILER! Others also mention that it's too weird for a "historical" piece. Umm, no. This is NOT a historical piece, ala "Camelot." This takes place in a fictional universe in a fictional time. This is NOT our Earth.If you have not seen it and have HBO then go to On Demand or HBO GO and watch it. If you don't have HBO then order the DVD's when they become available. This is EPIC. 10 stars.Oh, and Peter Dinklage deserves an Emmy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, hrmm.. I loved this show when it first started. Couldn't wait to see the next episode the following week and week after that.Season after season I enjoyed this series. The flow of the characters and action (except the torture scenes of Reek - that bored me senseless), the costumes, character dynamics and intrigue, it was awesome. Then this latest season started and I feel none of the usual vigor and excitement.I find myself wondering why this show is being drawn-out. It's labored and not at all what I have come to expect from years of past viewing.Episode 7 has aired recently and I didn't watch it. I'm waiting until someone else who has the desire to view it, tells me something exciting is going on, instead of the sad bluster it's been spewing forth this year.Thanks, but no thanks. I wish they'd have kept up the momentum and had the show for less seasons, rather than drag it out and become like so many other sad shows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best shows on TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the best television shows out right now. Everybody has heard about Game of Thrones. It is quite possibly one of the most famous and well known TV shows out and everybody knows at least 1 person that watches it. I started watching when the show was on season 2 after a lot of my friends were talking about how great it was. I have not read the books. I'll be honest, the show is pretty tough to keep up with at first. If you haven't read the books, be prepared to do a bunch of recap readings because you will be confused in the first two or three episodes. There are a LOT of characters introduced, and becoming familiar with who everyone is and the relationships takes some getting used to. However, after the first three episodes, I was quite accustomed with who people were and how they were related to each other.The plot is amazing. It is a very good complex in-depth story, and the pacing is fantastic. I am never bored during an episode. Especially considering that nobody is safe on this episode. Every character is disposable. There were important characters who I thought would never die that get killed off randomly. And these characters aren't just unimportant side characters. There have been a ton of main characters that have been killed off. It just makes the stakes that much higher and each episode is made so much more interesting because of that. The acting is superb. Every actor does a great job. I especially love Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Maisie WIlliams and Kit Harington. Their performances are outstanding. However, every other performance is also fantastic. The actors clearly really care about their performances.The effects are also marvelous. The big battles look epic and really nice especially for a television show. The white walkers and dragons also look really nice. The settings are also all beautifully crafted and look gorgeous.This is not a show for the weak hearted. There is a ton of gruesome violence and a ton of graphic nudity. Many people say that Game of Thrones is basically a porno and it pretty much is. There is nudity in almost every episode whether it be topless girls or full frontal. GoT does not hold back. However, there are some absolute gorgeous ladies that have gotten nude on this show like Daenarys, Shae, Ygritte, Margaery, Melisandre, and many many more. For me, this is just icing on the cake of a very good show.As my friend described it, this show has everything a guy could want from a TV show: an amazing story, tons of violence, tons of nudity and sex, dragons, magic, and zombies. It is an absolutely amazing show that really does deserve all the praise, and I simply cannot wait for season 5 to come out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of a kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read any of the books and therefore I wasn't a fan of this series beforehand. This means that my review is based purely on the television series itself, regardless whether or not it stays true to the books.When I watched the first episode of "Game of Thrones" on HBO I immediately knew this was going to be a one of a kind. First of all the magnitude of this production is nothing less than what you'd expect from a Hollywood blockbuster epic. Although episode one begins with interweaving events which happen in various locations within the fictional continent of Westeros, the characters begin to emerge rather early in the story, and the likable ones are easy to engage with.Most of the actors are very good at portraying their character, and it's only the odd one here and there who seems a little bit off, but having said that with such a large cast and so many day players it is expected. One of my personal favorite actors in this series is Sean Bean as Ned Stark, and it's a real shame that we don't get to see more of him after season one. Peter Dinklage is simply great as Tyrion Lannister, and I quite liked Jason Momoa's character, Khal Drogo.What's beautiful about this series is that you truly never know what's going to happen next. Anyone could be killed, there are no "heroes" in this story, everyone is vulnerable in some way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Series Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot remember a time when I've given something 10/10 but Game of Thrones deserves it. Set in the backdrop of a fantasy land, where there are power struggles for supremacy galore! The characters are well developed and you feel you slowly get to know everyone. The beauty of this is the characters grow and you get to find out more and more about them, they become deep and intricate.You have to stay on the ball as there are many story lines and there is much to follow, but it's worth it. It is gripping, really gripping. The author isn't afraid to shock you, to take characters out and there's always something unexpected. Story lines continue over each episode, and it takes a while to work out what is going on in some cases, which all adds to its mystique.I love this series, I cannot recommend it enough! Be aware there's lots of bad language, sexual scenes etc, but strangely you don't mind as it adds to realism of the story and its setting. Truly amazing work and the actors are epic in their roles, every one of them believable.Go and watch! :-)</fullReview>

If you're sat reading this review wondering weather or not you want to sit down and watch this then stop reading and watch it.For those of you that have chosen to carry on reading then let me just try and begin to tell you just how good this show is.From the very first moment you watch this show and see the opening credits you will be propelled into a world of betrayal, love, honour, adultery, blood, guts, war, dragons, mystery, and a vast army of different characters bringing this all together for you on your screen.It truly is a feast for the eyes. If you want all the above in one TV show then is it.So go out, buy it and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just about everything in this series is phenomenal. It is geared for adults so the nudity, violence and gore might offend viewers. Some gory scenes could have been left out. My wife is not into scifi, but she loves the Renaissance aspect of the series.The plot is great and you may have to watch a couple of times to get it sorted out. Casting is phenomenal. The actors play their part well. Tyrion is intelligent and witty. The villains are evil, heros are commendable, and the inept and insane are just that.A lot on the naughty side, I enjoy the "all natural" women. I was actually surprised at the amount of flesh is shown, but sex sells.We await season 2 and hope it is as good as the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen by accident that the novel was turned into a TV series. I watched all parts in in two rows and now i'm unhappy, of course April is that far away.I don't want to give a summary, i just want to say this: As i read the books, i thought that would be great as a movie like Lord of the rings. As series it's even better, of course the story isn't shortened. All fantasy series i've seen so far, are made cheap and lack of a good story. And with fantasy, i mean real fantasy, sword fighting and dragons. This is the adaption of a very good novel and it's realized well.For all fans of fantasy a MUST SEE. For all others ... forget what you have seen so far (except for rare stuff like Lord of the rings and Willow), try this out. May you will find your way to fantasy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic story with visually-amazing sequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have finished the first season of Game of Thrones and all I can say is that it was simply fantastic! Boardwalk Empire has been the HBO series that has gained the most attention, but in all honesty I felt a little disappointed by that one. Here, it's anything but.First off, for a medieval fantasy television series, the performances are all fantastic. Every single performer steps up to the plate. Sean Benn and Michelle Fairley are as perfect protagonists as one could hope for. Yet the ones that even outshined them at times include Lena Headey (who at times you feel her pain and at times you just want to cut her head off), Nikolaj Coaster is also pretty fantastic, as is Peter Dinklage (who is the most likable Lannister!). Kit Harrington and Richard Madden are pretty incredible as well and show great future potential. The directing and writing are not over-dramatic and the story lines are actually pretty unpredictable after a while. Yet there are still many melodramatic moments, but for the better.The art direction is superb, as is the cinematography as expected. This is basically watching a film. I don't want to overdo these statements since I am sure everyone pretty much knows it, but overall, this was fantastic season. Oh, and the music score and opening credits are the best on TV!</fullReview>

I first came across "Game of Thrones" when someone posted on their Facebook page that they were watching it. I then looked it up and it had such a good rating on IMDb I decided to watch it myself. I went to my local TESCO and found season 1 and purchased it. I didn't think I'd be much into it, but after half of episode 1, I found myself hooked. I feel the same way after every episode. I wan't more and more and more. I've just recently purchased season 2 and plan to start watching it very soon..... IF YOU'RE READING THIS AND HAVEN'T SEEN GAME OF THRONES YET....

		<fullReview>After personally reading each book, the Game of Thrones series was incredulously close to the works written of in the books.The author is an incredibly talented writer and the dramatisation regards the stories told with the precision of a sniper. Screenplay adaptations are very hard to make, especially those done properly and the only other fantasy work of art that has been produced correctly, in my opinion was 'The Lord of the Rings'. 'Martin's books evoke a powerful image within the reader's mind about the transcending story and the screen play adaptation was true to the novel's idea's and story. Great praise to all cast and crew especially Mr Benioff and Mr Weiss for the work of art on-screen. Special thanks to Peter Dinklage who added a brilliantly comic performance to his own role.Definitely dying to watch the next series unfold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm probably in a minority in my views of the Game of Thrones, but I have to say that it really wasn't for me. I know a lot of people who love this programme and rate it as one of the best television shows that they have ever watched. For this reason, I have attempted to watch it several times and each time have found myself disinterested.I would, however, say that the acting is superb and convincing but the characters were just too unlikeable. This, for me, is a major fault in any TV series. Nothing about them grabbed me and for this reason, it was doomed from the start. I also found the incestuous scenes uncomfortable, it felt like it was intended to titillate as well as be a part of the story, which is why I felt so much discomfort. The scene with Daenerys being one of them (first episode) I think that the various mise-en-scene of the Game of Thrones is amazing and I think that the filming locations that were chosen were on point. The visuals of this television show could have sold it to me if what was happening was actually interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>outstanding, but, I'm afraid, most likely popular for the wrong reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Game of Thrones" is an absorbing soap opera that combines elements of high adventure; realistic, gritty medieval lives and mindsets; and a touch of black magic. It is utterly clear to me that--ranging from names of characters to detailed settings and physical artifacts--much material is generously lifted from the likes of J. R. R. Tolkien, R. E. Howard, C. S. Lewis, and C. A. Smith, but, just perhaps, borrowing (inadvertently or otherwise) from the titans of sword and sorcery is not intrinsically evil.I was just a tad disappointed to find that our coming third season is going to rely upon zombies as a major plot contrivance: while a bit of black magic or supernaturalism (e.g., dragons; and persons immune to fire) is fine--even thrilling--here and there, I fear that the show will degenerate into too much dependency upon "Walking Dead"-style tactics that rank firmly among the "been there, done that." Time will tell whether my fears are (hopefully) unfounded.But I fear, most of all, that the show is popular for the wrong reasons. Fundamentally, I have profoundly little faith in the ability of the American populace to appreciate what is valuable in a show. I'll be brutally frank: I don't believe the show is popular because the characters are engaging, or because the swordplay is interesting, or because Tyrion engages in fascinating tactics or because Joffrey is full of sadistic surprises: I believe it's popular because characters routinely spout the "F" word; characters are continually shown engaging in frontal nudity, full-body sex (everything just short of an XXX rating being shown)--to include both gay and lesbian sex; and characters are routinely beheaded and tortured in full view. Indeed, I am dead-certain that the average Joe who does, in fact, watch this with his beer buddies does so so that he can (a) appear to be awfully mature when a nude woman or a heterosexual full contact scene appears; (b) demonstrate to his adolescent-minded cronies how disapproving he is (yeah, sure) when characters engage in gay sex (although--double-standard wise--I'm sure he'll hoot and holler when girl-on-girl contact is featured); and (c) laugh along like one of the tavern crowd when bawdy songs are sung or necrophiliac slogans are shouted.Sorry, guys: the show is fantastic, but--in my ultimate opinion--much of the popularity of "Game of Thrones" is due to the American audience's fascination with sex and gore, not because of its intrinsic excellence, which is most considerable.</fullReview>

From the start this was always going to be a very difficult series to move from page to whatever it is that they record films on these days! Having watched the first two episodes, it is loyal to the book, no doubt due to George RR Martin acting as a consultant. It will be pacey because the books are so vivid and descriptive. Those that have not read the books may well wonder what is going on and actually be inspired to read them. A very gritty HBO drama with the usual gratuitous nudity, but hey! Thats what we wanted isn't it? The casting of Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister is inspired and he plays the part brilliantly. Thoroughly enjoyable and I look forward to the next episode.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert is only for people who have not seen the first episode. We all had high expectations for Game of Thrones. Many have called it the most anticipated TV Show of 2011. Well the show did not disappoint. I went 5 minutes into that first, and was loving it. In the words of the old man who explains golf to Marge in that episode of the Simpsons where Homer won't stop bothering Marge, 'All it takes is one shot and your hooked for life'. Everything about is just phenomenal. The writing, the music, the costumes, the sets, the acting. Its all just perfect. But probably the best thing about it is the atmosphere it creates. The chilling moments in the beginning of the first episode where we meet the dreaded WhiteWalkers. It makes you feel as if you are the people on screen. HBO has really outdone itself this time, you couldn't have asked for a better fantasy drama in the world. In short it is gripping, dazzling, sexy and smart and is made purely out of absolute excellence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting is excellent, the character casting is perfect to hold true to the books.The story is a bit fast, but anyone who has read the books will tell you that it was a bit confusing reading them too. Martin creates a very complicated world, and there are avid readers of the books, who still wonder what the heck is going on even after reading the books.There is no clear cut explanation for a lot of things, and a lot of things happen as they might have really happened, not as the audience would predict them. And I promise, not as Hollywood would normally do them. That's why this project is so big, and unique. Without spoiling, I will say that this story is extremely unpredictable, and a lot of that comes from the confusion that Martin creates. In the end, you will fall in love with some characters, hate others, and misunderstand some more. But when it's finished, if it sticks true to the books, you will feel VERY rewarded for having tuned in.--------This series seems to really separate people :) All the "I hate this, girls are exploited, and it's crap" people are being absolutely hammered by fans. Book readers ALL love it. I have not seen a single bad book reader review, anywhere, so far, ever. What book has ever been put to big screen, where 100% of the readers absolutely love the transition? Never. Ever. Until this.And mostly, new watchers, are intrigued, and loving it.Finally, a series that makes the "I'm so important what I say should matter even if I'm just looking for bad things to create controversy" people, have met their match.Martin for President!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best show currently airing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest I haven't watched especially many shows in my life, TV has never really been my cup of tea. But I still believe that Game of Thrones has to be the best show airing right now, there is no way that any other show could reach this level of awesomeness.The best part of Game of Thrones are the characters, although there are so many of them that at times it is hard to remember all their names. However, they are all very unique and the actors portraying them do it really well, it is very hard imagining someone else than Peter Dinklage playing the role of Tyrion. The atmosphere is very varied during the different parts of the show, we have the political intrigues in Kings Landing, the great battles and the supernatural elements.Game of Thrones compiles everything great with all the previous fantasy films and shows, mashes them together to form something truly unique. The epicness of the Lord of the Rings franchise and the realism and darkness of Pan's Labyrinth. The fact that it is made for adults is probably its greatest strength when compared to other fantasy shows or movies made in the last 5-10 years. It is not full of CGI, the show is very graphic when it comes to language/nudity/violence and it gives a lot of time for character development. The show is also very unpredictable, the characters are never far from being killed off, something that separates it from most other shows/movies in the fantasy genre. I would recommend this series to anyone interested in fantasy, politics or general awesomeness but beware, this is not for the light hearted! Having watched all four seasons, I gladly give this 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best fantasy series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First i must warn you i'm a book-fan and could be biased in this review.Since i've read books first, i've eagerly awaited this show and followed it from the start of the production, with inside views, teasers and trailers and all i can say it's - great. Although i was skeptical ahead of the first season, my fears were without reason, HBO did great job with it, and all i can hope for is that they'll continue doing it in next season(s).One thing has to be pointed out, story is very complex, with a lot of details, something you cannot transfer to the screen easily. Series lack certain information and it'll be obvious even to common viewer that it's only the tip of the ice berg, and hopefully he/she will get interested in a books. That's a plus, as you can only enrich your viewing experience by reading the books (and books have re-read value as well, just then you get all the smaller hints author has weaved in the story). So, in that matter, series cannot entirely reflect the books, but it's one of the best adaptations i've ever seen.Second, cast has been amazingly done, from young and perspective Maisie Williams who is a total discovery to me, to already proved Sean Bean or Peter Dinklage. There're only few roles in which i would cast different actors, and neither of it is main character. Jerome Flynn (Bronn) has made his character even better (or should i say "more notable") then in the books, totally my vision of it.As authors of the series had great story to tell us, cast has been magnificent as well and costumes and CGI effects were fine at least, i cannot find a reason to give smaller mark here. First season (book) was just introduction to the world of Westeros and it's people and i can only hope series will keep it's quality in the future. With that said, i'll point out few things i didn't liked. First, and the biggest, is absolute absence of battles. There were two important ones in first season and we haven't seen anything of it. Not that it bothers me at current stage, but later on battles will be integral part of the storyline and HBO won't be able to avoid it. I know it's to lower the cost, but that would reduce the quality and make harm to the series in my opinion. Second is small number of episodes, so most of the scenes are hasted. That's especially obvious in "important" scenes which should be given more screen time, when there's no time at all. I'm well aware it's budget problem, and if there's place for improvement, then that's budget. Raise it and series will get even better. Third, and last, is absence of flashbacks to the period of time before Robert ruled. That period is important and i thought it'll get some time, but they've decided to totally remove it from first season, hopefully in second season it'll change and we'll get to see how House Targaryen got to rule, and some Lyanna Stark flashbacks too.With more episodes series could be even more improved, adding more depth to story and characters, but even if it keeps it's current level it's already my personal favorite fantasy series out there. If you want to get more insight to the Westeros world you'll need to read the books, but even without it you get the picture and can enjoy the best and most accurate book adaption there is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Tudors and Rome were going to be almost impossible to top. Camelot has been attempting to make an attempt. It passes the time.Game Of Thrones has me wanting more each week in the same way "The Wire" did. The multi-threaded story lines, terrific writing and acting, Lord of the Rings-like fantasy but remaining serious enough to get your anxiety up about what happens next.HBO - promote the person who greenlit this. You have enough story to run several seasons. Including a big screen 2 or 3 part, (each part 2+ hours) movie to cover the pre-stories before Game of Thrones starts. Let's see how the Dragons were used, Let's see how Kahl came to be Leader, Let's see the battles of Jamie Lannister, .... HBO, you could spend the next 10 years on this story if you want.Its awesome. Well done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I am a fan of fantasy stories (LOTR, Earthsea) I must say I have never heard of "a song of ice and fire" on which game of Thrones is based. For the moment I am glad I didn't, it makes the series just the more compelling not knowing what comes next, because so far it is one of the best TV series i've ever seen. From the brilliant opening sequence (with Ramin Djawadi's beautiful music) to the great acting, some very memorable evil characters and especially the unpredictability of the story, I for the moment have no clue where it all will end, a bit of the Lord of Rings with a pinch of the Sopranos, very refreshing indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a big fan of George R. R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" series, I had very high hopes when I heard that HBO were turning it into a T.V series, and was expecting to be disappointed. As it turned out, disappointment didn't even cross my mind whilst watching the first episode.Two episodes shown so far and "Game of Thrones" is already in my top 10 T.V shows of all time.The acting is superb, with no actor/actress delivering an unsatisfactory performance - they stay completely loyal to the characters George R. R. Martin created, and the results are always fantastic. The dialog and attitudes of each character are very typical of a medieval fantasy series, which shows that the actors and developers alike have managed to perfectly capture the atmosphere of such a time and place. The setting is exactly as I imagined it would be after reading the books published so far, with the Haunted Forest being particularly unsettling at the start of episode 1. So, top marks for that as well.The effects used are never over-the-top, which I always like to see in either a movie or T.V show, as some movies have to rely solely on good visuals to win over an audience (Avatar springs to mind here...).Perhaps the best thing about the T.V show yet is how loyal it remains to the first book of the series. Every important scene, and some of the great witty remarks of certain characters, are played out to great effect exactly as they are written. The one thing that the T.V show does NOT remain loyal to is the age of the Stark children, Lannister children and of Dany. However, this is perfectly understandable, due to some of the scenes the children are involved in (no spoilers, but suffice it to say, they are pretty shocking at times, particularly in Dany's case).All in all, I have to give "Game of Thrones" 10 out of 10, but not just because I am a huge fan of the book series; because it is a superb show, with excellent acting, a great realistic atmosphere, terrific sets... and it manages to remain loyal to its written counterpart amidst all the inspiring greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides the very interesting and complex story the landscape is fantastic, the costumes impressing and detailed. The actors are first rate and the story is not for the faint of heart. Definitely no children's book! The special effects are very good for a TV show and they don't overdo it. I never saw anything like it and I'm glad that for once I did not read the books first, which can be a bummer if you have a vivid imagination and the director has a different one. The High Definition makes every detail stand out beautifully, even too detailed for some scenes. For example the little girl's rapier, named 'Needle' has a clearly visible round security tip at the supposedly pointy end, which is the only complaint I have.:-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new dimension to an old story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have now watched the first 3 episodes of what will maybe be known in the future as the Season 1 of the Game of Thrones TV mini-series - or, if fate would have it, the "Game of Thrones" season of the "Song of Ice and Fire" series.Yes, i do hope that all the books will be brought to life on the small screen, because the first episodes have been enjoyable to watch.When I finished the last book of the series written so far, i felt.. sad. A truly wonderful experience had ended, and the words just stopped, never again forming into new adventures, but instead staying the same on the pages. But now, we are given a new, somewhat compressed, but nevertheless enjoyable way of reliving the story. With no changes to make it a different tale, but instead with something extra - a new dimension of faces, places and voices. Its a bit like looking through an old picture album with pictures from the good old days - the memories, the fantasy is your own, the pics are just there to help you remember. Only that in this case, all the pictures might not be exactly as you remember them..Well, in my head, Ned was more noble-looking, Kings Landing never as sunny and Catelyn Stark younger. These self-made constructs are however fading and being replaced by the characters on the screen. Im willing to sacrifice that for the reward of enjoying the good old story one more time, anew.And by the way, Tyrion is just perfect!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came across this show today while browsing the internet for general fantasy films. During this search, I came across the books this series is based on, then I saw the reference to this show, which I immediately watched. I had no prior knowledge of this show, hadn't seen commercials, nothing. There was no "hype" for me.But as a fantasy genre fan, I absolutely love this show so far. I haven't read the books so I don't know how close the adaptation follows the original story.I have read lots of reviews and many rave just as I am, but I also read some negative reviews. Mostly, I was wanting to know how other people felt about all the incest in the show. I noticed that this is not mentioned by anyone! People are talking about the "sex and violence," but don't really say what it is that probably bothers them. Like to even acknowledge the incest, may make one suspect to liking it or something? Anyway, there is incest in this show and lots of it. Maybe the people that read the books are numb to that or something, but it is in abundance. I'm really shocked that people are pretending to not notice this because I'm sure, since it's a major part of the story, that the incest is what is making this show such a huge hit. It's a bit controversial, hence some calling it more "adult." I would agree, but one could be more specific. The violence is nothing you've never seen before, but it's good. There is some female nudity that is just unnecessary sometimes as if they are doing it just because they can. That's probably the only thing that may be a little irritating, but it's certainly not so 'chocked full of sex that it's unwatchable' or even comparable to porn. I think this is why reading reviews can be sometimes confusing or complicating because things are not clarified or not too specific. To further add, I think those that were distracted by the sex enough to not like the show, may have blushed/were offended during one of the abundant incest scenes. As for the people that loved it, the incest is a vital part of the story and I wish people would be more comfortable with pointing that out for the rest of us. Good show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unjustified negativity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, to dispel the views of many a reviewer, I am not a fan boy of either fantasy nor the books from which this television series are adapted from.Secondly, I would like to spend a paragraph addressing the views on violence and nudity. I cannot for the life of me understand the accusations of sexually explicit content and hideous violence being completely unfounded, doing nothing for the show. In that accusation alone you disprove your claim. By admitting your repulsion, you have simultaneously admitted that the tone and setting have worked perfectly. You are supposed to be repulsed. You are meant to think these scenes are common place, and against your will or not, they absolutely do add to the tone that the writer was attempting to achieve. A time of different morals, casual exploitation, and a world where men rule and women are objects. This only makes the leading female characters of the show all the more enthralling when they dominate a scene and act as a catalyst for huge plot twists. Joffrey's mother is a constant schemer and her character contrasts perfectly with the "hundreds" of naked women on screen (a gross over-exaggeration).To comment on the violence and nudity in such a manner only depicts to a viewer like myself that this show, simply put, does not adhere perfectly to your tastes. Personally, without the violence and adult themes, this show really would be about as gritty as silky knickers. Grow up and accept the fact that in this day an age, you cannot get the budget to produce an adult-aimed TV show and omit violence. Where it differs from Lord of the Rings is that it attempts to at least partly set itself against the back drop of the notoriously gritty middle ages. What were you expecting? Fairy's? Every single act of violence serves to remind you that this is a vicious age. It comes from all characters, sometimes feeling forced, sometimes feeling gratuitous. More often than not however, it comes from the characters who themselves love violence (the hound, Joffrey etc...) Given the sheer volume of plots, sub-plots, characters and material to process, I think you are being completely unreasonable expecting some critic friendly genius masterpiece that equals the sopranos for complexity and realistic drama. The sopranos is set in a real city, in the current age, don't be so ridiculous as to cast the same eye over these two shows.I saw a review whereby somebody had watched "6 minutes" and dismissed it as drivel. You honestly expect somebody to take your review seriously!? It is without doubt a slow burner, the characters are not given enough screen time per episode... maybe because it is an hour long and there are 7 divisions of character to depict. Rest assured early viewer, the characters screen time will add up by the second series. You will begin to understand in greater detail the motives and development of them, and if you can stomach the odd bit of violence and sex- hell, if you are even enough of a shameful human being to actually enjoy these things on screen (as I am) then you WILL love this show, you will appreciate its place on the television today, and you will ignore the opinionated television snobs who have watched two episodes and feel it necessary to moan about the adult content, on an adult themed TV show. Don't watch it, don't give a review on it. I have never felt it necessary to watch sex in the city, I know it does not appeal to my taste. If I did, I would comment that it is shameful rubbish that warps the minds of human beings far more than an epic fantasy drama set a thousand years ago does. But I don't, because it is not a show that is MEANT to appeal to me. It is not made for people like me.Game of thrones is well worth a chance. I gave it a chance and I do not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no shield surfing here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter how good something is (and no matter how terrible)? you always have a small group of people who will disagree with the majority. Even when a show like Game of Thrones comes along there are still people who will inexplicably give it one star reviews. That's just nuts. Myself, I hate generic brainless TV shows like CSI but, being fair I think I would rate CSI Miami five out of ten. It's ridiculous tosh, but it's still has some positive elements to it. One of the fundamental problems with IMDb is people vote in an almost political way by unfairly giving a movie or TV show one star or for that matter ten stars, in an attempt to lower or raise the overall score. I thought of giving Game of thrones a nine because I very rarely ever give anything a ten. But then, despite not being perfect, it is one of the best and possibly most important TV series ever made. For me the Sopranos is currently the most important TV show of my generation. Not just because it was great, but because every episode had the production values of a high budget movie. It made people realise that TV can not only be as good as a movie, but it can actually be better due the fact that you only spend ninety minutes with the characters of most movies as opposed to perhaps ten hours to the average HBO series. Then there's also the unscrupulous nature of Hollywood and it's grab the cash and run policies. A TV series gives you the time needed for a complex plot to unravel and to actually care about three dimensional and detailed characters as in a book. How many movies have failed to live up to the greatness of a book? I would argue most of them. Cloud Atlas being a recent example of a novel failing to have the same impact on the big screen. Even the Lord of the Rings saga (which I still think are great) look suddenly dated and thin when put side by side with Game of Thrones. Even with the extended editions, Peter Jackson and his team struggled to fit everything in. Despite plenty of positive changes, Lord of the Rings contained plenty of silly Hollywood 'additions'. I'm talking of things like Legolas doing some shield surfing in the battle of Helm's Deep. There's no shield surfing in Game of thrones. If anybody tried to mount a shield and surf it down some steps in battle there would be someone like Sandor Clegane to grimly cut his head off and stick it on a spike for trying to be a smart arse. So Game of Thrones is important? really important. It obviously has a large budget, that whilst not as high as Hollywood blockbuster, is still sufficient to make every episode look movie quality and to bring in an accomplished ensemble cast. You may never have heard of plenty of them. But they can certainly show some of those overpaid Hollywood A-listers a thing or two.So what's so good? - Well we have a great cast from Sean Bean, Peter Dinklage, Liam Cunnigham, Michelle Fairley, Aiden Gillen, James Cosmo to name but a few. These may not be household names but you will recognise many faces and perhaps all the better for not being pampered A-listers. Sean Bean seems like he was born to play Ned Stark. I said that of him when he played Sharpe. But hey, he plays a grim northerner really well.- We have great costumes, sets and backdrops which bring the world of Westeros to life in ways I wouldn't have thought possible. One minute we are the miserable frozen north, the next we are in beautiful sunny climes of Kings Landing. - The series sticks close to the books and doesn't deviate for 'a larger audience' or try to simply the complex and deviating plot. There's some simplifying here and there as the plot is so complex and often confusing it requires is when being condensed from such huge novels. - There are no good guys and bad guys, everyone is a shade of grey (Except for queen Cersei? She's a wench!) But the story is not the same old generic nonsense that Hollywood, and TV companies around the world churn out again and again and again. This is actually trying to be, you know, different. Further, allies and friends on all sides or unreliable depending which way they the wind is blowing. - Characters develop throughout the story dramatically. It's hard not to go into detail and give away spoilers. But for better or worse all of the characters go through a lot and we feel like we've been through it with them. Just look at Jaime Lanister from series one and then at the end of series three. It looks like a different actor is playing him. - It can have a massive emotional impact of you life! Again, not to reveal any spoilers but there are some dramatic moments. I'm not the kind of person to usually let it bother me. But after some episodes I have felt greatly affected by the events on screen to the characters I have come to like so much. Season three has just ended a couple of weeks ago and I still feel a little emotional looking back at recent events. - There are some legendary characters, quotes, places... the list goes on. The word's of Game of Thrones have officially blasted their way into popular culture. - The soundtrack is brilliant. Ramin Djawadi has produced some of the finest classical music in years.So, if you've made it all the way here, well done and thanks for reading. Now, Seven Hells, go and watch Game of Thrones for the night is dark and full of terrors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first time I have watched something cinematic, and been so blown away that I had to read the books. FIRST TIME. EVAR.Normally you read the books, and then you watch the movie and you're so disappointed, right? Not this time.I watched the series and was amazed. I went out and bought all the books immediately, and finished them in a couple of weeks. ALL 5 BOOKS.Basically, the series entails struggles between the bourgeoisie of the kingdom of Westeros. It's a relatively new country (notice how I said relative?) and the story mainly focuses on the family of Starks. There is an overarching battle brewing, involving strange creatures from the north. However, the threats are frustratingly ignored due to all the tensions within the kingdom.The story is realistic, and gives the each of the characters astounding depth. It has twists and turns that literally make you gasp and flip out. There is sex and gore, and to be honest, I like the sex and gore. The show has enough that it makes it realistic. In fact, it's the most realistic killings that I've seen. Ever. If you stab a guy through his jugular with a lance, yes blood is going to come spurting out. Yes, it's in medieval times. People have sex for kicks, and there are prostitutes. DEAL WITH IT. The best part is that the show had just the right amount of it, without using it as a crutch. The characters are portrayed so beautifully. That's the only thing I can really say. Basically, you'll love it.And this is coming from a teenage girl who does not even look like she reads fantasy, much less watches it, or talks about it.</fullReview>

From the lead characters to the peasants, wanderers, and barbarians every role in the whole show is excellent. Which I think adds vastly to it's depth. The scenery, the environment, the atmosphere - awe inspiring, breathless, and at times just magical.This is by far the top TV series, the only thing I can see topping this anytime soon, is season 2. Which trust me, can't come soon enough. After this 10 hour marathon, I could probably watch another 50 hours straight. It's that engrossing, and with the way they left the ending of season one with so many questions unanswered and the plot developing, the second season should be even more amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Plebe Show:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is a poorly adapted show that is well suited for plebes. It is not a faithful adaptation of Song of Ice &amp; Fire series. This show had lots of unnecessary changes that infuriated me. The showrunners replace many important scenes with meaningless garbage. GoT ends up missing important scenes and dialogue from the books. GoT lacks any substance, and creativity. The showrunners made too many mistakes. GoT does not deserve praise, but scrutiny. Critics should be embarrassed for praising Game of Thrones. No reviewer is that stupid. This show has too many problems to be praised. I personally think that the showrunners simply bribed the critics into giving the show a positive review. No reviewer would ever give a 9.5 average rating on IMDb for this sh@t. Unless he was bought. GoT List of Problems: 1. Poorly written characters (Dull, &amp; boring generic characters). 2. Lack of foresight when writing these characters. 3. Lack of development. 4. Poorly structured story. 5. Each season is crammed into one book. The seasons should have focused on one book. We would have ended up with better written characters and a fleshed out story. 6. Miscast characters. 7. Missed scenes: many key details missed. 8. Not a cohesive story. GoT masquerades as a good series. The truth is that Game of Thrones is nothing but an overrated pile of sh@t. All GoT has going for it is sex and violence. The success of Game of Thrones is attributed largely to the plebes' lack of taste. This show is made to entertain plebes. If you doubt the review I had written. Please go back and read the books. You would see that Game of Thrones is nothing but a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heads up for GAME OF THRONES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has begun! The much touted HBO miniseries A GAME OF THRONES arrived with Episode 1, and though the entire series cannot be judged on one episode, this initial hour has all the promise of an involving and visually stunning adaptation of the 1996 George R.R. Martin series of books of adult fantasy fiction titled 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. The 'game' is played by seven families - Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell - and what we find in the initial episode is a taste of the intrigue to come. In this first episode Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) is the patriarch of House Stark, one of the major noble houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and ancestral rulers of the North. Near the castle of Winterfell, Eddard's children discover a dead direwolf and five of its pups still alive. As the direwolf is the symbol of the Starks, Eddard allows each of his five children to keep one of the pups as pet. A sixth pup is discovered a short distance away from the others. It is a mute albino, and this one is given to Jon Snow (Kit Harington), the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark. King Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) , Eddard's childhood friend, journeys to Winterfell with his family to ask Eddard to become Hand of the King, the top adviser and military commander in the realm, due to the death of the previous Hand, Lord Jon Arryn. Eddard's wife, Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley), receives a letter from her sister Lysa Arryn, stating that Jon Arryn's death was a murder plotted by Queen Cersei (Lena Headey) and her powerful family, the Lannisters. Though reluctant to leave his duties and family, Eddard is convinced by his wife to accept the position in order to investigate Jon Arryn's death. Eddard's middle son Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) is engaging in climbing Winterfell castle's walls and towers accidentally sees Queen Cersei and her twin brother Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) having incestuous relations. To protect their secret affair, Jaime throws the boy out of a tower window. Where the story goes form here will follow throughout the remaining episodes. Though some would criticize an early report on a series merely at its inception, it seems only fitting that offering a word on encouragement to pay attention to this new series is warranted. We can only hope that the series continues to build as it progresses. The cast is filled with excellent actors, both seasoned and refreshingly new. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start with, I read the books once only, got into it thanks to my friend(bless him) and when I learned that TV show is being made by HBO we all cheered, since we always said it is impossible to convert this epic story into a 2 and a half hour movie.To start the review now.The Hand of the King Jon Arryn mysteriously died at the Capitol of the Seven Kingdoms, making King Robert Baratheon travel to the most northern region of the Seven Kingdoms to its capitol Winterfell to ask his loyal friend Eddard ''Ned'' Stark to become his next Hand of the King.The Prologue, although not faithful enough to the book(yes i personally thought Prologue was the best part of first book) is done good enough for audience to hook it up thinking who the hell are those things.The introduction of all the characters is done great, establishing some of relations quite well and subtle.The Music is average, but it will not interfere with the whole show if it will be done the same as in first episode, The visual is stunning enough to suck you into show.The characters are well acted and nailed most of the book characters and their core. There are some minor relationship changes but its very close to the book.The newcomers will have to be patient and not give up to soon since the amount of characters and story lines might feel overwhelming but don't give up stay and a magical world of Westeros will come to life infront of your own eyes Conclusion: A Dark Fantasy world, full of realistic stories, at its best. A book in motion almost. The spirit of the story is mainly captured.Overall Score: 9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who don't know by now The Game of Thrones on HBO is a TV adaption of George R.R. Martin's books, a Song of Ice and Fire.If you've never read or watched fantasy and you hate the genre you should give A Game of Thrones a Chance anyway Because Unlike most fantasy Books and shows this isn't packed with magic and magical creatures expect for the "others" and one or two other creatures this Series is more like a Drama/Thriller with plenty of backstabbing,double and triple crosses the political intrigue will leave you wanting more and more.for those who think the story line is too complex it shouldn't be it's actually quite simple and clean.yes there are a lot of characters to keep up with but once you've watched the first season you will slide into to it comfortably.only advice I can give someone who is watching for the first time is to start with season 1 episode 1 because you will be lost if you don't.PS:I would try not to get too attached to any "one" character. In other words try and pick out four or five to be your favorite......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The TV series is one of the best i have seen in a long time. I have read all the books in the Fire and Ice Series and the TV series remains true to the books in most parts. Not disappointed one bit. My favorite character in the series is Tyrion Lannister and Peter Dinklage plays the character to the hilt. Me a little disappointed that George R R Martin does not belt out books as fast as i would want him to. But i guess it takes a lot of effort to come up with story of this magnitude and imagination. The story gets better as narrative continues. What is most fascinating about the story is the contrast in behaviour,attitude, morals of the different central characters example:Arya Stark and Sansa Stark.Nobody is good or bad they are just different shades of grey , some closer to white like Lord Eddard Stark and some closer to black like Jamie Lanister. Waiting/watching how HBO will out do itself in the next season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am out of words for this series. This is the best that was ever made and I am saying that after I have watched almost all of the high rated sitcoms. I loved FRIENDS but nothing come close enough to this George R.R. Martin masterpiece. It open your eyes and makes you realize the truth of Kingdom era in almost any part of the world. The world is full of shrewd, mean politics, people filled with lust and twisted loves. It may sound cynical to few but in spite of being classified as a Fiction, nothing can better depict the true human nature. I am loving this series so much that I started reading the novel from season 2 onwards and found that the book is even more intriguing than the series itself (as is the case with almost all of the great novels). Still I can't wait for season 3 and watching what I read in the book on the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Addictive and amazing must watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all who have doubts of this show is missing a lot; i've seen the first season and finishing the second season but I am wanting more.A story that compelling leaves you with wanting to know what will happen next. known as an nominee for an all round spectacular show it shows kings for power but power is earned not taken. For those who take power it does not mean it is received but unfortunately it is given. But this element gives the edge that the show needs to be moving steadily as the most popular show on TV today. The climax is effective from episode to episode; personally I would like joffrey head on a spike. I am sure it won't cause usually he is well protected. For those who are looking for constant fight scenes and fruity ending it is not. It explores the human side and that is what I crave. Transitionally the story works with how it goes from almost every character especially Joffrey well played. Others that got me going was the first season finale I mean you cannot argue with that. Each episode has a sexual element and that also gives more true to the story of the gender role of the male and female in society. Overall I will continue watching and season three is not to far hopefully they come out with fireworks in such a confusing period time power and absolution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW!! Amazing show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best TV show I've watch. Haven't read the book but heard enough about them to know that the show is well written and stay true to the original writing. What is amazing in this show is that it has plot twist, lots of different story and there is no real good and evil. Everyone is looking for his own personal goal and that is what make this story amazing. It's not a fight between good and evil. And even better, every single character can die even the main character. Like Eddard Stark who died at the end. You feel the fear of the character and are really worried about what happen to them. It's realistic as the good guy will not always win and live happy.The show is amazing the cast is amazing, i find nothing wrong about the show. Everything is perfect and it will probably be the only 10/10 I will give ever for a show or a movie. It's a must watch!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good visuals, actors and atmosphere, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...I don't understand why is it so special. My friend gave me the first 2 books as a present years ago (knowing I like fantasy and good sci-fi), with his personal recommendation. I couldn't get through the first half of the first book. Now my other half got the series, and we have watched the first 2 seasons, so you can say I don't have the full picture yet, but on the other hand I feel I have had more than a glimpse. With so many positive reviews, I'm sure I'm the odd egg...but my issues are the following: 1) The balance always seems to be off for me (example: Winterfell is a capital, but it can be taken by 20 men, when even without garrison they say there were 200 "northeners" inside...it looks like the size of a family farm in one set when showing the inner courtyard, then in the next set showing from the outside it's like the size of the Castle of Dover...decide already, please: either is fine, just be consistent). 2) Politics are way too prominent for my taste (but, if one likes that kind of storytelling, I can understand its popularity). 3) Nudity and sex again is much in front, and while I have absolutely no issues with sex, in a fantasy show I find it excessive (and so cheap) that half of the story seems to revolve around it (yes, of course it is important, but this much? Really? What are we, 13?) 4) So many twisted characters, so little sanity. I wonder how this whole realms survived at all with so little common sense and ground, but it might be again a personal thing...for me, it is difficult to like a show with so few likable characters (and having some more characters with a bit more sanity or moral composure wouldn't make them or the story "one-dimensional", I think) 5) Magic on the other hand (in general) is way too much in the background. Example: they said the birth of the 3 dragons are the most important and relevant happening in the last x hundred years, and yet in the entire 2nd season the same dragons (including scenes when they are talking about them) got maybe 10 minutes of screen time (if that - but we have lots of tits instead, every 10 minutes or so).That being said, it is transparent that a lot of effort went into the show: most of the actors are doing a fabulous job (and the rest are still good, at least in my view), the visuals (including attention to details) are great, the music is excellent and contributes to the overall atmosphere (which is the main reason I'm still watching this and will continue to season 3). I just wish it would be more fantasy and more storytelling, with less cheap sex/sexual references and fewer "imbalanced" (to put it mildly) characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed about Arya's story line (may contain some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arya revelation is so dumb. There is no twist in what happened so far and what I remain with is the feeling that all her story was for nothing actually. Only cheap tricks on the audience to create something interesting on her story line, when in fact there is nothing deep behind that: she walks carelessly on the streets when she knows she.s followed by an assassin, then her wounds which at first seem deadly, miraculously heals almost entirely over night. All these only to run away from what she was meant to be. So unless HBO comes up with more on the background of her story and a continuity of her training as a black assassin in the next series, it would be sad.Edit after ep 10, Season 6: Arya finally came up with something to back her story up, but sill there are some gaps in how she really left House of Black and White with no repercussions.. Jaqen H'ghar once said: " she is meant to be more than a faceless" . So is she becoming more than that or he forgot about his statement. Was all of that a plan for her or just a coincidence ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing storytelling, a harsh reality and an excellent adaptation of the books</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This show is absolutely stunning, HBO has completely captured the essence of George R.R. Martins books, a song of ice and fire, and turned it into a fascinating on-screen perception.The reason this series is so captivating is because its never clear what will happen in each episode to come along with the absolute genius storytelling. Before you know it, you see your favorite characters killed off or plotted against in a manner which leaves the viewer shocked and keeps them itching for more, no-one is safe at any point during the series bringing a harsh but true reality to the show, to draw a quote 'when you play the game of thrones you win or you die'.The first few episodes will be confusing for those unfamiliar to the series and may put them off from continuing to watch, but if you stick through it and keep watching there will come a point in the first season where the show clicks with you and causes you binge watch the entire series up until the point when you've caught up with where the show currently is and then on after to look forward to each new installment every week.To summarize, with the series intelligent plot lines and unpredictability i would strongly recommend to anyone.A solid 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This show is not only the best show I've ever seen, it is always like watching a cinematic movie. From moment to moment, sides change and people you love may die. It never leaves you disappointed and there are no bad episodes...just some that may change your complete attitude for another character; always changing loyalties and building new alliances. And that is where the show always surprises and shocks. You never know, but you'll never forget. The actors/actresses are so skilled in making this show a gem. They can go from good to bad to worst. The rotten ones will blow your mind with their talents. You will most probably watch each episode several times to sync your mind with the names of all the characters...I never get bored watching the older episodes. You will find things you missed, and covert operations between kingdoms that will shock and thrill you. I'm not giving anything away, as you will want to discover each episode and character for yourself. Plenty of loved ones and people who you wish to die...sometimes shortly before they do. This story could go on forever, and you will want it to. Don't miss this...you will want to get involved immediately!Valar Marghulis. Valar Dohaeris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is such a beautiful and uplifting twist seeing Jon Snow coming back to life! It is getting more exciting and really can't wait for more episodes. The strong characters of every individual role complement each other which will hook you up till the end. Jon Snow is the hot topic at the comeback of Season 6. He's presence making a positive view from the audience. His vital contribution to the whole story is really needed and you can't get him out. The fact that the previously very-dead Jon Snow is now very not-dead on Game of Thrones is perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in the show's six-year history. But that didn't stop the production team from trying to keep his return under wraps?and they went to some pretty crazy lengths to do so, like banning his name.Game of Thrones is now getting powerful, vibrant, exciting, and the game is always on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Season by Season review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHOLE: This show is mind-blowing. There is no other way to put it. And the reason for that is because in most shows and most movies, you feel confident that your favorite character, or the protagonist, is going to be safe (or at least until the very end of the show/movie). This show is like real world. No one is safe. Anything can happen to anyone. The second reason it is mind-blowing is because this show (or the books it is derivative of) has created a whole new world, and I mean that literally. With new history, new religions, new species, new geography, new medicines, this is a different earth. Couple that with a plethora of characters with such intricate personalities and motives, this show is a masterpiece. SEASON 1: The first season of the show is extremely faithful to the book. It follows it almost exactly. It is a fairly slow season, with a lot of world building. It, however, is very interesting as you get a good look at every character you are dealing with, and shows the growing tension between every character. I thought this was a fairly decent season, however, started of a bit boring. I guarantee if you stick with it, it will be worth your time.SEASON 2: This is where the show starts splitting away from the books a bit. This season started picking up from season 1 and actually started showing the war in action. More characters are introduced, more world building, more tension, more action. It gave some characters more spotlight and really showed us what drives them.SEASON 3: This is where the show gets really interesting. There are so many factors at play everywhere, and all the characters start falling apart. This is where we start seeing a change in every character. It is one of the best seasons in the entire show.SEASON 4: Hands down, best season. The other 3 seasons have been building up a lot of tension and this where every thing goes down. Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat, and now we see all hell break loose.SEASON 5: This is where the show truly turns away from the books. The show has started going down its own path, and many things that never happened in the books are happening. The first half of this season was fairly crap, with barely anything happening, and very sloppy dialogue, but as always it payed off in the second half with some of the best episodes in the entire show. CONCLUSION: Overall, definitely worth watching. Though it may be slow at times, it always pays off. Many book-readers are upset at how different this show has become to the books, but I am actually happy about that, as the show could never be as intricate as the books and hence following it exactly would not pay off. By following their own story the writers can make the show appropriate to its medium. Lastly, THIS SHOW REQUIRES SERIOUS COMMITMENT. If you are not paying attention, and are not aware of all the numerous things going on, you wont truly understand how great the show is. I recommend watching the History&amp;Lore series to help you understand this world better and learn more context.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story line, even if it progresses slowly, it does not become boring at all. In every episode, there will be an event you could not have ever guessed, while every episode finishes in a point where you want to see the other one asap! The plot is definitely exciting and meticulously planned so as not to leave any gaps, but still putting you in the position of googling more about the characters' backgrounds to understand the mindset of them, as well as try to predict their next moves.My favorite character is John Snow and I cannot wait to see what happened with him. Seems that the author J.R.Martin is willing to kill everyone until the end of the show. Having seen all the seasons, some of them in a single day (!), I am a big fan of Game of Thrones, even without having read the books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best "Fantasy" Show up to date??..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The series is based on George R.R. Martin's novel about a fantasy world where royal houses battle for the Iron Throne.Like Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Ring" trilogy, this series captures the tone and the emotion of the books perfectly and as well as its HUGE budget emasculates its audition into the Fantasy realm of blood, war, sex and full blown action. Another HBO successful adaptations - and if asked what is best show on television - it's a surprise if the answer is not "Game of Thrones". It is every Actor's dream to be cast in this production but personally I would appreciate the low budget 'Artistic' successes of shows like 'FARGO" airing at the same time. It has a fine richness in dialogue. The casting is near exceptional??.and with each season new characters immerse. The subject matter often bold - incest at its best. It has taken the Fantasy genre to the next level and is seen as a "Masterpiece", yet I would call that an overstatement. Martin's novel's are somewhat extraordinary but the show has had its flaws, my personal favorite being what on God's earth happened to Aidan Gillen's accent: a quote from The Daily Edge: "AS MASTERFUL AN actor as Aiden Gillen is and as much as we love him, his Game of Thrones accent is sliding all over the shop of late. Fans are complaining that Littlefinger is going from Oirish to vaguely British and back again." Yes the last season was terrific but Gillen's decision to characteristically change Littlefinger, - - I quote "he thought he should sound "patriarchal"???ruined one of the most pivotal story lines. So for such a Masterful Show - Don't get me wrong I love it ?? but it's perception as "near perfect" Fantasy fiction I'd question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is a great series, not mainly because of it's great visual effects, fast action and cinematic looks (although those are pretty good too...), but because of it's characters. They are all extremely believable and interesting, they really are the heart of this series. Should those characters be taken away, then everything collapses dramatically, for sure. Almost every line, every moment and every scene is filled with complicated and intriguing emotions and situations. With every episode the characters grow bigger and bigger, creating a realism and depth you rarely see in today's television series. The only thing that i found irritating from time to time was the fact that the environment (and perspective) changes a lot, giving you the feeling of hopping through the world, every time a scene gets really interesting, the camera hops away to another perspective. But that's a detail and doesn't nearly compare to the greatness of this series. I really recommend giving it a chance, you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is a great series to follow up, specially when it highlights the importance of our past and history. The character engage and show how the settlement and growth of the ion throne is caught. The lifestyle stands in the evolution. The royalty of the movie is well done how it shows the social stratification. At the end my rating is 10/10 and would tell the director and actors to keep up the good work from Canada. The other thing i would like to point out is however game of throne does it , they make the series end with this feeling of you wanting to watch and want to wonder what will happen the episode after. They should correlate the kings like Khalisi with Joffrey. Seriously Jeffrey is such an character, which you really want to beat up and hate. They should've not killed the lord at the beginning because the lord dragged me to watch this movie. That scene was not fair at all. and also the Son of the lord and the wife of the lord. They should've kept creating more troops and army to takeover and make the Lanisters suffer. I really wonder which time period does this movie aim at, and also they should really have a better sense of geography. locations are very important, and that is barely shown in the movie. The movements are very important. and it's very hard to find out.ThanksGreat series to watch. One of my favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Graphic Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent drama show that I would recommend to everyone who can handle it's explicit content. Game of Thrones is produced by HBO so this should be expected. However, despite it's explicit content it is still an outstanding drama show. Game of Thrones is a series that requires patience when it comes to plot development, despite this the show can easily hook you with cliffhangers and brilliant acting. The effort and detail put into this show visually really pays out creating a show that feels real, gripping and enthralling. This show is centred around the conflicts and interactions between the many houses in Westeros. Centering around secrets and betrayal, war and family-ties, this show is more than just a fantasy series. The highlight of this show is the interactions between it's many characters and the complexity of the plot. Because of this complexity keeping up with plot lines and characters can often get confusing, but eventually things begin to work themselves out as you watch more. I enjoy how well the writers have adapted the novels, even with the plot lines differing in minor ways. This however, is mainly to help with the budget and also to help out the viewer since there are even more characters in the books which, if added, would likely confuse the already sprawling and complex storyline. All in all Game of Thrones is a series I highly recommend to anyone who likes a brilliant plot, fantastic actors and great writing.</fullReview>

But what some people write here is just stupidity. I mean, referring to an IQ of the people who watch a show to distract themselves and want to be entertained is just pure ignorance.For me it's one of the best shows ever made although I prefer the books. For me, as a native German, the books are harder to understand than the show actually is, but still. Images come while reading. Yet, I have to admit that the show/series is very close to the books and the pictures match.I always tell my friends if GoT would run for 24/7, I would take holidays for that.Keep it going.

I have no clue at all what this series about.So my curiosity got me better, and I continued watching the whole season with laptop nearby so that I could google more about the characters and their history. And after a while I realised, these actors are superb, I appreciate the beautiful back ground, the script, the directions, the DOPs, the sound mixing, the plot... every element in this series is well concocted. No wonder it could deliver one of the best TV series I have ever watched satisfyingly... the author is involved as well. *I wish if there is a Harry Potter TV series the author would be involved as well with the script* Anyways, my fave female character so far is Daenerys. Emilia Clarke's performance is simply great. And fave male character is either Tyrion or Petyr. But then again, all actors did a very good job, no body delivers a bad performance.And my fave episode is Blackwater... the best battle episode in my history of watching TV series!</fullReview>

When I heard about the books being made into a television show, I was new to it. I was one of many, coming to the world of Westeros by the TV show first and not the books. The decision paid off well, and Game of Thrones amazed me until the final episode of the first season before I bought all the books and began to read them.Game of Thrones incorporates, what many fantasy shows such as Earthsea and shows portraying the King Arthur legends; the simple tact of darkness we all possess inside us to become the worst we can be. Greedy, bloodthirsty, brutal and ambition. Game of Thrones gives us what The Sopranos would have been in a fantasy, medieval setting such as The Borgias is as well.Depicting plots to take over the throne of Westeros, ambition by Princes, Lords and lowly soldiers is always present as everyone has their own sense of what is owed to them and what is there's to take. A sense of being owed something by their subjects, and their people. Simple individual men and women, who's ambitions cost the lives of thousands in the struggle for dominance.This is perfectly portrayed by HBO, and the writers of the show as every noble house have their own plans for the land who are just waiting for their opportunity to put their plans into action. The sets and design department, have got everything about the show to perfection and what most fans of the books imagine seeing is what they do see. Characters are portrayed as they are in the books, and appear to embody their roles well.Now with season two finished, and awaiting season three coming in 2013 we have a while to wait. But the show is simply, The Sopranos or The Wire in a mythical fantasy world. It's dark, gory and deeply seated in politics and religion as medieval times were similar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when I thought that I would never discover a medieval-themed TV series that was worth watching, I stumbled upon the Game of Thrones.I have always wanted to buy the Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin, but never got to, which meant that my only idea regarding the show was that it would be like every other medieval-set series. Boy, was I wrong. Here are some reasons:The sets are wonderful, and could easily be differentiated. You'll never confuse Winterfell with the Wall, or King's Landing with any other location. The combined elements of sex, violence, greed, love, etc, makes it very real. The absence of censorship is also good, because it removes the limits of the show, resulting to a very good series. Lastly, the key actors are simply superb. (After watching the first season, I have made it a point to ensure that I will be the one who kills all the Lannisters, especially Joffrey - the antagonists are so antagonizing that whenever I remember them, I actually feel a sense of hatred surging inside of me.I can't wait for more! Well done, HBO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just started watching the series what a week back (4/14/2012) may be, so I got to see he the complete season 1 and I loved it.I like movies/TV series which are multi plotted and if you add the medieval touch that is a classic and that is what Game of Thrones is.I am not an big fan of TV series but this is one of the few I have watched and loved others being Rome, Prison Break, American Horror Story &amp; The Walking dead.The Game of Thrones has very good characters and good actors for those characters, none of them are what they seem. The Game of Thrones is about struggle of power and what men/women can do get power.I would Strongly recommend this TV Series from HBO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Would Not Typically Watch A Show Like This and I Love It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took a lot of convincing for me to give GOT a shot. Halfway through the 1st episode I was motivated enough to spend an hour on the internet trying to understand the universe of Westeros and the relationships between the main characters. If you have not read the books then a little study can add significantly to your enjoyment of GOT. Although I enjoyed Lord of the Rings, I would not consider myself either a buff of fantasy or of the Dark/Middle Ages. Kings and castles tend to make me move on to something else. But, for me, GOT has turned out to be my favorite show currently on TV. The 1st is Breaking Bad. So if you think you may not like this program despite it's high ratings PLEASE give it a try. I hope this show gains a broad audience and can survive at least as long as Breaking Bad or the Sopranos. One last thing - GOT shows that hints of the fantastic and supernatural can be as powerful as the bazzilions of fantastical creatures that inhabited Middle Earth of LOTR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GoH - True to the Last Minute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing a lot of hype involved with this recent new series that HBO released, I decided to check it out for myself. Having read the first two books in the series (Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings), I was curious as to how true to the "feel" of the first book would transpose to ten 50-55 minute blocks. Like previous reviewers have noted, most attempts at visually bringing a book to life are usually met with dire results or fail to live up to expectations for the whole season. However, I can say with absolute certainty that this series has lived up to that hype and more.Everything from the casting to the dialogue and non-verbal imagery to the set designs are spot-on to how Martin described each environment in his book. Sean Bean, Lena Headyey, Emilia Clarke, and Peter Dinklage, among the other fine actors, do a superb job of making their characters their own, especially Dinklage's portrayal of Tyrion (my favorite character of the book series so far). The environments capture the air of tense conflict as the story unfolds in each episode, and the dialogue, although not always delivered well with some of the characters, was refreshing to hear overall. It was nice to see each actor take their respective roles very seriously.Some folks would complain about the amount of nudity, sexuality, and gore seen throughout the series. I respond by simply saying that they perhaps toned it down a bit from much of what is described in the books and that those folks should be grateful that they aren't visually representing the book in this fashion TO THE WORD. Still, this is a series for mature audiences and if sex, gratuitous violence, and bloodshed aren't your cup of tea, I would stay away from this series, both on HBO and in the books.Overall, this is a great adaptation to George R. R. Martin's first book in his epic series and I cannot wait to see what they do for the next season's adventure "A Clash of Kings."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grand sweeping Epic - truly breath-taking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George R R Martin, has done quite a job with his series of books, based around the 7 kingdoms and the fight for the iron Throne. All I can say is thank goodness HBO got the rights to film this and not a bunch of pansies who would have made this into a watered down shadow of it's rightful self. This is war, this is death, this is sex and violence and family feuds and long held memories. It is fantasy and drama and comedy and wine and song. I will admit the acting isn't always perfect, and the budget forbids grandiose battle scenes or a cast of thousands! But still Martin's vision shines through, the story is compelling to any fan of LOTR , you know who you are, it also appeals to any medievalists or people who dreamed of lands beyond this Earth. I am waiting the next season, and I truly hope this series gains in popularity and word of mouth until the whole saga has been translated onto screen. Down with the Lannisters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>potentially good show completely destroyed by over-rating and poor storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>well what a waste of my time. I've watched 3 episodes of the walking dead and each episode of them is better than anything I've watched here. Game of Thrones is fairly well acted (despite some series regulars copping out in certain scenes) but from the amount of praise the acting got, i was a bit confused because it has to be some of the worst i have ever seen, and Jesus some of the child actors (if you can call them that) were just annoying because they couldn't act, not just because they were written poorly.And my main problem with the show is that it is just so confusing. and yeah, maybe i should have paid more attention, but the times i wasn't paying attention was when i was having to research things that i was confused about!! and anyway, it should be the shows problem to engage me, the viewer, i shouldn't have to feel engaged myself. Another issue with this show is the ensemble cast that every praises, for unknown reasons. I mean seriously, i just watched the season 6 finale when the sept of baelor was destroyed, and then i saw my mom watching scenes from season 1 and there were characters who i didn't even realise had been in it since the start! and how can you praise a show with its ensemble cast when it decides to just completely write out characters for a season (Bran, Osha, Rickon (what was the point of him) Hodor (same issue with Rickon)). I just found it almost too difficult to be invested in the characters because only the lannisters, Daenerys (awful actress) and occasionally a Stark are the only ones to get plenty of screen time. and the only characters i like on this show are Cersei and Jaime and sometimes Arya. Am i supposed to like Tyrion just because the actor who plays him is a dwarf? does being a dwarf instantly make him a badass? the only thing i saw resembling badass in Tyrion was when he shot Tywin, but even then killing your incest dad doesn't make you badass. One of the reasons i believe this show to be overrated is because it has a death near enough every episode. CHARACTERS DYING DOES NOT EQUAL GOOD STORYTELLING. e.g the red wedding, the episode was awfully/averagely written, with 2 main character deaths, but this some how received 9.9. twd first episode only received a 9.2? wtf???However, with all its flaws, the show does have its benefits that kept me watching all the way till the current episode (i don't quit watching a TV show even if i don't like it, its an hour long, I'm sure i have 1 hour a week to watch something with potential). the best part of the show is without a doubt CGI. Especially the battle sequences in Watchers on the Wall and Hardhome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize I'm part of a painfully small minority, but nevertheless, here goes. I only managed to get through the first season and even that took a lot of energy. I love fantasy as a genre, so it's not like I started out with preconceptions, but the initial exhilaration turned quickly into disappointment once I realized the whole series was based on a very simple structure: 90% of each episode sees two people, sometimes three or more, in a room, a hall, a hut or in a garden, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking.... and then talking some more, mainly about past deeds and dead rulers. And the whole concoction is made so much more arduous to watch by the amateurish direction, which relies on the "artistic" choice of showing a close up of the speaking character, then switching to a close up of the next character talking, then back once more, over and over again. Every now and then there a horseback ride and sometimes, all too seldom I might add, there's a brief sword fight. That's it - that's the big show everybody's so giddy about. I don't get it.</fullReview>

Reading through the stories as I waited for each episode from season 1 up to season 6 has made me understand the story better. I love how carefully they had planned out the details of the show. Actors were chosen carefully, however, it did not sit well for me when the show announced that they would changing one actor back after changing another again. I won't go into specifics on this one, so if your curious-- well, I would suggest that you have to look it up through the details posted here on IMDd. In overall, despite the story line in a different era-- it was indeed timely and exhilarating to watch. I look forward to more episodes of GOT until the very end!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The HBO masterpiece, Game of Thrones, is truly one of the greatest shows that has ever been created. Set in the fantasy world of Westeros, GOT presents audiences with a very mature and unpredictable story about war, politics, family, and death.-PROS: The story of this show is best of any show that I've seen. The main plot is intense, interesting, and ever evolving. The show features many great and memorable characters (some you will love, and rest you will hate). The lives and deaths of many of the characters are very emotional and deep. The show is incredibly unpredictable, with many unexpected twists and turns. GOT makes excellent use of its HBO budget, featuring set pieces and CG that rival many Hollywood movies. The cinematography is absolute excellent and visually appealing. Acting is fantastic and the show paces very well. You do not need to have read the books or be a fantasy nerd to enjoy this amazing series. The amazing story, great characters, and beautiful cinematography make this one of the greatest shows ever created.-CONS: This series is not for the faint of heart, as it contains brutal violence and graphic nudity. I wouldn't recommend this show to anybody under the age of 18 as it is an adult oriented show. This is not really a bad thing, but it does put restrictions on those who can watch it. The show contains no significant flaws other than the occasional slow episode (which is expected from time to time).I would give a GOT a solid 10/10 as it is indeed a masterpiece that all TV watchers should watch, regardless of what genre they prefer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every generation had a defining series, but this one has Game of Thrones. A fantastical world of Westeros, not unlike our own medieval Europe, is beset by different problems and riddled with court intrigue as well as plots. Families struggle either to maintain their position or to dominate Westeros. The soundtrack is excellent, the story-line and narrative is superb, the characters are fully three-dimensional, morality is realistic and the show's many plot-twists are shocking, yet realistic enough not to cause the "shock for shock-value's sake" feeling. Actors, although many are not well known, are memorable and they possess some real acting skill. Simply an excellent, tense series keeping you constantly on the edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read every book in Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire (a Game of Thrones) and let me say so far the show does a good job in keeping the spirit alive with only slight adaptations. The characters are very well casted and portray the characters from the book series brilliantly. The rawness and edginess of the show is fitting for that time period and brings the viewer back to the medieval times. The only advice I can give is that to truly understand the show (as well as the book series) is to study and remember the details, the characters, and their allegiance. This is a very dynamic story with many characters all of whom share an important part of the story.</fullReview>

Even Those who have read the books and know what is going to happen, still experienced excitement and thrill through the watch. Speaking of myself, what got me hooked to the show is the character of Daenerys Targaryen, probably the most empowering female fictional character of all time. Emilia Clarke have done a fantastic job with her. The rest of the characters which are multiple and very different are as interesting too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly remarkable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone cared...This series is an onion, the layers peel away with each viewing. I am fortunate to have viewed the blu-ray version. What a treat I had. I won't go into technical detail, I 'will' attempt to convey some thoughts and feelings on this remarkable piece of television. A Game of Thrones is not best described as 'epic'. It will not entertain those looking for another Lord of the Rings. Being of the TV variety, 'Thrones' does not thrill with wide screen scenery. The camera is closer, yet not too close to be unmindful of the need to 'sell' the rich setting that is Westeros. For those who like myself, are enamored of the characters, and who caught our own hearts in our mouths at various stages of the novel- 'Thrones' excels. Judicious is the trimming, yet clever and thoughtful are the presented scenes. The characters are given their literary dimensions, and in some cases, namely minor characters- much more so. Thus we can forgive when certain scenes and well remembered slices of dialog are handled somewhat differently in order to portray a living vision, and version of literary events. My personal indulgence is in *details*. Details are *everything* in the geek world. Thus there are pleasant surprises in store for those prepared to sacrifice epic for clever writing and budget handling. There is a particular scene I will not spoil. but one that the knowing will acknowledge. It reads roughly-'Jaime's sword was ripped from its sheathe.'- That particular segment was handled a little differently, yet that tiny detail was not neglected :) For the affiliated a greater majority of the characters can be seen and named. Most deliver solid to outstanding performances, some are only realised towards the end of the series. In the novel my favourite is Tyrion Lanniser, in the TV series I'll say that although Tyrion is indeed brilliantly portrayed, stands outs include 'Arya', 'Robert Baratheon' and Cat's sister 'Lysa'. These actors I feel really projected their talent. If I am to be objective and critical I would say that in my personal opinion the weakest link is Catelyn Stark. The performance is good, but at times I was a little unconvinced, as though I could see the effort, but I was not completely sold. Sean Bean does 'Eddard' proud, I just have to switch off a little to see him has a Lord of the North when he opens his mouth, the lines spoken in his native dialect. At times I had to suspend disbelief when father spoke to daughters, who spoke as high born princesses without that distinct northern tongue. Regarding the nudity. 'Thrones' is, as I believe I stated above a very clever accomplishment. It lives and breathes with honesty. There is nudity, and sex aplenty. It should not however be considered pornography. These were times without the luxury of technology, where serf and Lord alike took pleasures of the flesh. Within every scene there is character growth and rounding, regardless of the content or activity. George R R Martin did not shy away from 'whoring' and partnered sex- neither did the makers of 'Thrones' :) Looking forward to season 2.</fullReview>

I really enjoyed Emilia Clark"s part. She is beautiful and acts really well. THe show is closely related to everyday life and struggle of different part of the world tries to get a piece of action (just like the present situation of the World where all countries are trying to get upper hand on others ).

		<fullReview>*** SPOILER ALERT *** Game of Thrones is lush, beautiful, gritty, harsh, bloody, and incredible. I love every character, bad or good, but Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister is superb (and deserves every accolade he received for the role), and Sean Bean was transcendent as Lord Eddard Stark - rough, weary, stoic and quietly noble. I was heartbroken when Ned was killed.All the 'bad' Lannisters are deliciously so, and I've enjoyed watching the evolution of Daenerys Targaryen from a meek little pawn of her brother's into a rising leader. I like Iain Glen's character as the exile who protects Daenerys and keeps her(and the viewer) up to speed on the ins and outs of Dothraki society. I liked the boozing, womanizing King Robert, though I would have liked to kick him in the knee for being so obnoxious, and I even like that little jerk, Little Finger.The Stark children with significant roles are also excellent, especially Arya. Now that the killing of potential Robert Baratheon heirs has begun, and the one we were introduced to last season being on the path to the Watch with Arya, their relationship will be interesting to watch.Game of Thrones has one of the strongest ensemble casts of any size I've ever seen in a program. Though it took watching the episodes a few times before I could start keeping all the intrigues straight, it was well worth it.Though I'm still smarting over Ned Stark's execution (but I'm biased because I'm a fan of SB's work going back several years), it was enough of a surprise to be refreshing in this age of done-to-death plot twists, and as the story evolves it seems clear that there's no more room in the game for a Ned Stark.Thank you, HBO, for delivering yet another truly outstanding original series into our homes on Sunday nights. I bought season 1 on DVD, and I've bought the first book in the "Song of Fire &amp; Ice" series. Rarely does a television show have such an effect on me.9/10 stars. A bit heavy on the gratuitous sex, and all the F-bombs seem out of place in that world, but if I can be hooked in spite of those things, and willing to keep watching even after my favorite character is knocked off, by god it must be a damn good show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Convincing sword and sorcery franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones dodges the title of just another sword and sorcery franchise.It does so primarily by refusing to believe in heroes. There are no characters who are beyond harm or human failings. Everyone in this series has their strengths and weaknesses.Its this sense of reality that balances and makes plausible the otherworldly aspects of the series, such as magic and dragons. The acting is in many cases excellent too, with a strong cast who know their craft. That said, at times the medieval cruelty is a little hard to take. It often feels too, as if the medieval torture is used as a vehicle to inject a sense of realism into the franchise. What it does instead, is become distasteful and tiresome. Just as tiring is the rather drawn out and predictable story lines that, in and of themselves, are not too different to any other found in this genre. For me Game of Thrones is different but only just manages to stand out from the crowd. Its popular but then series of this kind tap into a genre with a strong, well established tradition and following. For me however, this fact doesn't justify elevating the series to the lofty status many other reviewers have given it. Seven out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly unique, brilliant show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Game of Thrones" (2011-) is arguably the best current show in a world. It has everything to be on top, and it is. I won't say nothing new that wasn't already said before, but still... This is brilliant show from start till finish, in every direction. Probably there wasn't a show before with this big, rich ambitious scope. Yes, it's based on amazing material, but realize it on the screen takes a guts, money and talent. No other network couldn't pull it of, except HBO. You can clearly see every dollar that was spent on screen, and usually, not in directly way - i mean the locations, settings, costumes, art design, special effects - it's all there, you can almost feel it. I won't lie, i don't like fantasy genre in general, but "Game of Thrones" sucks you in from the opening scene and doesn't let go. To appreciate this show you don't have read books - just enjoy the beat, small things on screen - when you will see them, the whole picture will come itself. I could talk for hours of how brilliant this thing is, but you have to see it by yourself to understand.Overall, 4 seasons have gone, and it's a solid 10/10 for "Game of Thrones" - a truly unique and almost flawless adventure in every direction - it's dark, gruesome, gritty and unforgettable, a must see for everyone and even those who don't like fantasy - you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This show is amazing, I've read the books and even knowing what's coming it STILL sticks with you (it's been over a month at this point and I find myself still thinking of S4E08) and that's the mark of a great story. Just be warned it's a very harsh story and not for anyone who's squeamish. The characterization is very deep and there are not really any one note 'good' or 'evil' characters just people dealing with life in a brutal, violent world. Peter Dinklage stands out from the start as he put's on a master class of a performance as Tyrion Lannister, he's an absolute joy to watch.If you decide to take this journey just keep the title of this review in mind.

		<shortDescription>A show which will stand the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best season that has ever been aired for a long long time.What makes it so special is that every person who sees this season can gaze in its vast ocean of characters and find the one character that echos his personality that is the mirror image of his own self.Rather than being showing a romantic,hollow and masked portrayal it is rude,bold,passionate,naked and above all the true depiction of the world.Where the wars are not as simple as it seems and love is not happy endings, marriages are held together not by love but by fear,anger,lust and children.Where kingdoms rise and fall on the deceit of men hungry for either power,glory or gold.Where honor to some means more than life but to others just a bunch of hollow words.This season is a masterclass and i can easily say it is the Mozart of television.This season will pass the test of time for generations to watch the curious ways of the Game of Thrones</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the books !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw series one &amp; was SO impressed by the quality of the plot &amp; the acting that i went straight out &amp; bought the series of books (6 with 2 still to be written). Unfortunately, from book 2 onwards the books do not keep up any sort of pace &amp; could easily have been condensed into 2 or 3 volumes. So, enjoy the TV series which is very true to the books (except that most of the main characters are portrayed as being twice as old as they were written). Yes there is lots of sex &amp; violence, but not more than would be expected at that time in (fictional) history. This is "Sparticus blood &amp; sand" NOT "Zena warrior princess" Series 2 is looking just as good. Hope this helps.</fullReview>

Now that you have figured it out HBO, how about doing Guy Gavriel Kay's ''Tigana''? That would be a blockbuster for sure!!! Who has the rights?? Well, whomever you may be, you've just been shown how to do it and do it well.About time the TV land producers understood that we actually don't want any more mindless pap. And let's face it, a political drama/thriller is always a winner, no matter what world it's happening in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HBO raise the bar once again with this magnificent offering. Undoubtedly the best TV show of 2011. From the inventive and beautifully executed opening sequence GOT will have you gripped and take you on a roller-coaster of intrigue, deception and treachery. All beautifully set and shot, and acted by an outstanding and well cast ensemble.GOT contains an excellent spread of heroes and villains, all of whom you will empathise with (apart from maybe Catelyn who was a bit 'meh'). While the story has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing throughout.One special mention of Peter Dinklage, in an extremely well acted series his performance towers above the rest. Bravo Sir, and not a bad English accent for a Yank as well! It's a cliché, but if you are going to watch one serialisation of a widely loved series of fantasy novels this year: make it HBO's 'Game of Thrones'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only watched two episodes of this show but I felt I needed to comment on it. It has great potential the second episode was far superior to the pilot. The show looks great, the acting is solid and this show could pull off a surprise at the Emmy's this year.It could take best drama series, although I do need to watch all ten episodes before I can really say whether it deserves it or not.Sean Bean is probably the best actor in this show. I also like Lena Headly a lot. I loved her in Terminator:Sarah Conner Chronicles and 300 she is very sexy and a solid actress. As always with HBO there are some sex scenes which are interesting and not exploitative. I am looking forward to watching the rest of season 1</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to watch this series, in its first season, back-to-back, because of its respectable status here on IMDb. simply put, you wont be disappointed. at first, it might remind you of lord of the rings because of the genre, but the world of Game of Thrones is much more realistic, gritty, and unforgiving. It has magic, but the real magic is the dynamic relationships between the characters and the events that occur. it has great writing, and the pacing of the series when seen continuously is perfect. by the end of the series you'll be familiar with all of the families, kingdoms, and history of the Realm. the acting is superb; the characters you like, you love, and the characters you don't like, you HATE. the worst thing about this series is that it ends right when you want it to continue the most! i actually had to read the wikis on the books because i wanted to know what happened to the characters. season two should be even better and hopefully they will continue the series for sevens seasons, or however long it needs to be to cover all of the books.this TV series/book series is EPIC storytelling. and its only season 1/book 1.little advice: don't fast forward through the intro. it helps teach you the land of Westeros!watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intrigue, action, perfect portrays of characters, vivid acting. It required all my attention since the dialogs were linked throughout the whole story and playback would have made me ruin the awesome epic flow of narration. 10 lines of review would be quite demanding in terms of praising possibilities to depict the hunger I had for watching the next episode during the whole of this 1st series. Watch this as it is not only meant to be a lesson in taste for viewers but also a masterpiece that probably won't be equaled for many years, a grindstone for film directors and aspiring movie stars. Do not watch it all at once as it requires your eyes and ears to be wide open. I bow to the ART.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First of all, I have to start out by saying that Game of Thrones will probably rank up there with LOST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've heard my thoughts on the plot elements of Game of Thrones' first season (and believe me, there are still thoughts to be had), but today I'm here to share my opinion on the season and why I thought it was so great.First of all, I have to start out by saying that Game of Thrones will probably rank up there with LOST as far as game-changing genre shows go. Sure, it doesn't change the field as drastically as LOST did, but it's a show about dragons and sword fighting that is appealing to a mass audience. It'll be fun to watch the success of the series influence the shows that other networks put out in the future. What further influence Game of Thrones will have on our culture, I don't know quite yet. I'd love for it to instigate a resurgence of fantasy into the pop culture bloodstream. It has the potential to do just that, if its numbers keep going up with the second season.Game of Thrones might just urge on other, just as faithful adaptations of books to the small screen. Shows like True Blood and The Walking Dead follow their source material loosely, to varying degrees of success. Game of Thrones, on the other hand, adhered its source material (A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin) so closely that even the pickiest fans could only gather complaints such as "Jon's dire-wolf isn't supposed to bark!" and "Sansa and the Hound are supposed to have a rapport by now!" (Yes, I admit it, I'm picky.) With Neil Gaiman's American Gods adaptation coming down the pike at HBO, could we be seeing another such faithful adaptation in the future? It's entirely possible.The series did a masterful job at bringing us wonderful characters, through both writing and acting. Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister was an obvious standout with wonderful dialog delivered with witty sarcasm or believable poignancy, whichever was required. The newcomers that the show introduced us to, from Emilia Clarke (pictured above) to Kit Harington to Maisie Williams, were all absolutely spectacular in their roles. The casting department chose well enough to satisfy the most dedicated fans of the source material while creating a cast that would market to the HBO television audience (Sean Bean was the sausage they dangled to hook fans before he was - literally - cut away).Speaking of Sean Bean being cut away, the series also had an uncanny ability to unbalance the audience, whether with the shocking death of Sansa's dire-wolf in the second episode or the more subtle scene in which a troubled Ned watched as his youngest daughter learned sword fighting techniques. It wasn't a typical episode cliffhanger, but it set the tone for the rest of the series all the same. Perhaps subconsciously, it prepared us for the inevitable: as written in the books, Ned Stark was beheaded at the end of the penultimate episode of the season, "Baelor." Fan reaction was sharply divided, as anticipated, a fact that only lends credence to the emotional power of the series (Maisie Williams, who portrays Arya Stark, made the scene heartbreakingly real). The show's inability - or refusal - to compromise with what viewers wanted as opposed to what the story demanded made it difficult to watch at times, but emotionally rewarding in the end.Even the sex was difficult to watch at times, such as the scene that occurred at the end of the first episode, during the forceful consummation of the marriage between Daenerys and Khal Drogo, or the deliberately taboo lovemaking of Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime. Sometimes the sex could be gratuitous -- Littlefinger's perfectly delivered monologue at the beginning of the episode "You Win Or You Die" was set during a decidedly sleazy lesbian sex scene -- but it always seemed to stay within the show's own gratuitous, indulgent world, never going so far as to pander to the audience.The world itself was so well constructed, so brilliantly designed, that it can easily be said to be unique on television. There's no show that looks like Game of Thrones, and the more I watch the series, the more I'm convinced that no show should try to look like Game of Thrones, because any attempt would obviously fall short of the lavish and varied colors of Westeros.Perhaps I've gone on long enough. My opinion of the first season is painfully clear: it's my favorite new show of the year so far, and one of my favorite of all time. I couldn't possibly ask for a fantasy series more unlike anything I've ever seen. The juxtaposition of the fantasy genre with a storyline more akin to The Sopranos or The Wire is something I never expected to see on television, but I'm so glad it's here. Season two can't come quickly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a series! And the richness and depth of its characters! This gets my vote as one of the best TV series of all time. At the same time, I've been watching that drivel called "Camelot" (no more, though) and this fantasy series is what good viewing is all about and deserves an award.Having read the books, I know that the story has been streamlined for television and it has probably been criticised for that reason but the essence is still there. It would be a mammoth undertaking, but I can only hope the producers of the series continues with all the books ( there are four in print with one due out next month and two more forthcoming). Keep up the good work, George!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent television adaptation from excellent books.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have only read the 1st book, "Game of Thrones" because I wanted to read after I saw the first few episodes of the series. First of all, putting a face to the characters is worth it. HBO and the actors have done an amazing job making every single person exact to how their character is in the book. Dialog is, for the most part, word for word and it's pretty simple to divide the book into ten parts and read accordingly.Overall its a fantastic fantasy series that most people will relate to Lord of the Rings, even though it really is NOTHING like it aside from it being grand-scale, having Sean Bean, and having funny sounding names for things.Each episode is better than the one before it and even if you think the first few are a little slow, you'll relish them compared to the intense, often breathtaking pace the series jumps to during the latter half of episode 4.Finally, its HBO...there will be nudity, swearing, and violence....of the 3 I will say the nudity is a tad overdone...while exposition is revealed during most of the scenes and is very important, it boarders on late-night cinemax, especially during episode 7.10/10, for story, acting, cinematography, and being faithful to the origin. Even if you don't like LoTR (I don't), its just fun to watch.</fullReview>

Brilliant choice of cast, I can't pick or criticize any of them, as if they were made for this role throughout their lives and Sean Bean, isn't he the greatest? Can't wait to see more and more, i m in episode 6 now and looks very promising and each episode gets better ..

		<shortDescription>Quite simply the best new TV series ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is the best TV series ever devised. There can be no competitors for its sheer scale, rich tapestry of characters, story, and wealth of talent on display.Its almost an amusing slice of irony that a show of this scale, in all its enormous budget, sets, that the absolute best character and actor is the smallest of them all in the superb Peter Dinklage.Some of the scenes may seem shocking in their graphic nature, indeed some may even seem gratuitous in their almost gleeful portrayal but this just lends to increasing the unerring fascination that series has generated in its fanbase.The only drawback, if you could really call it that is the seeming penchant that the author George RR Martin has for killing off some of the best and most beloved characters before you really have a chance to explore what could happen with their development.A sure sign of a excellent series with absolutely spot on casting is the ability to create characters that can genuinely stir up deep dislike, almost loathing in their total evil natures.King Joffrey, portrayed by the excellent Jack Gleeson has generated such hatred that he has publicly stated his occasional run ins with fans who seem to struggle with detaching the character from the actor.Following on from Joffrey are other equally despicable characters such as Cercei Lannister (Lena Headey) and Melisandre The Scarlet Witch (Carice Van Houten) that also deliciously bestow their characters with seemingly limitless cruelty and all round nastiness.To counterbalance however have been such brilliant characters portrayed by established stars such as Sean Bean, Iain Glen, Charles Dance and Aiden Gillian.To go through a thorough review of all the characters that are so incredibly portrayed would take far too long to cover with any kind of depth.What has been an extremely smart move by the producers has been the casting of young and previously unknowns such as Kit Harrington and Maisie Williams who clearly have impressive careers ahead of them, almost solely due to Game of thrones being a springboard for their careers. As is always the case there is a fear that Thrones may not last long enough, seemingly Hollywood has an unhealthy fetish for all good series to last no more than 7 seasons. This is one of those shows that could genuinely be a far longer running story that would continue to enthrall an enormous fan base that would only ever grow with each subsequent episode.I am an extremely harsh reviewer and don't pull any punches when I feel a movie or TV show has ballsed up or not followed anything near to what the fans want or expect, however in this rare circumstance I cant find a single fault with this superb TV show. If you watch it in a Blu Ray boxset (I recommend you do, this show is worth investing in the tech to watch in good quality High Definition) then make sure you set aside a full weekend because once you start, you'll be hooked before you know it.Seriously, Game Of Thrones is just that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about this show is how close it brings fantasy to reality, keeping in touch with the imagination and exhilaration of Dragons. The thing I personally hate about Movies or shows that are based on novels or books is how much they leave behind, but GOT not only appreciate George's (Author of The Song of Ice and Fire; The books the show is based on) work but takes it a step further by adding a sense of surprise even for the book lovers.There are plot twists and treachery at every corner, and this is not your every day show where the protagonist gets away with almost anything. The show is the best ensemble of politics, war, fantasy and every thing else (including Dragons, you just cant get enough of them). The cast and creators have done a fantastic job. The cast is the best set of actors that make you love or hate the character in an instant. You will see dwarfs in a completely different light after this show. And you just cant hate Joffrey and Cersi enough. And if all the above doesn't get you hooked to the show ... there are boobies and a lot of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, a disclaimer.....1. I have not read any of the books this series is based on, nor was I aware of the author until the release of this series.2. I was NOT attracted to this series until almost the end of the second season.Why? Simply because the genre is usually not done well on T.V.. USUALLY it's pretty cheesy, campy, with a low budget, and terrible writing.That about covers it, now for the rest.DESPITE having absolutely NO desire to watch this show, I opted to give it a try due to the overwhelming number of my acquaintances who claimed the show was worth a watch.They were right. I was wrong. TERRIBLY wrong.The production values are excellent, the acting is excellent, and the story is well written, intriguing, and has a universal appeal that practically anyone can appreciate and relate to on a personal level.I would highly recommend this series to anyone who appreciates a well produced, acted, and compelling story, as this series is one of THE best, if not THE best, series ever put out on TV, or film alike.10 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This series is definitely a fantasy piece. The locales are outstanding, there are knightly games and battles, and the costumes are what you'd expect for a Dark Ages period story.But don't let any of that lull you into a sense that you'll be seeing a "Lord of the Rings" copy cat. Game of Thrones is a political intrigue story about several Houses (clans, family groups) and their struggle for dominance. The story is very engaging and quite well scripted. It is very easy to imagine something like this had actually happened in history.The acting is standard for the genre. Expect to hear generic English accents from most of the cast, although the story specific language is spoken very well. It sounds like a mix of Elvish and Arabic; the actors must have practiced it a lot. There are a few moments where the acting is stiff or forced but all in all it's good.It should be noted that this is an HBO original series, and like other series from HBO and Showtime you can expect the cookie-cutter formula for "risky and shocking". What it amounts to is an abundance of nudity (male and female) and strong language (F-bombs) that isn't actually necessary. In several places it actually slows the progression as the episode stops for a moment to allow naked people to randomly pop into the scene. If full frontal nudity is a major turn off for you then you will not enjoy the series as it pervades every episode.The only complaint I have is that it seems like something has been left out, most likely for timing. There are a few minor arcs that are introduced and then disappear for quite a while, only to jump back in at an odd time. For example: in the first episode there is a lot of emphasis put on the dire wolves. They get a bit of screen time in the first two episodes then disappear except for parts where it's necessary to move the story forward. I know I'm supposed to care about the critters as much as the characters (apparently) do, but they don't get enough screen time to be more than furry props.Still, this is a very good series. I'd recommend it to anyone who can stomach HBO shows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Television show I Have ever seen.. And thats saying Something!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read Game of Thrones back in 2000 it was amazing i made all my friends run out and get it as well. I just recently got the chance to see game of thrones threw HBO go and it brought back all my fond memories with ten times the amount i couldn't have even envisioned in my own head. Its true to the book and the visuals are breathtaking.Sean bean just happens to be one of my favorite actors of all time but honestly all the acting is so good i cant believe how good it is. Even though i love Seans skills i have to give it up to Kit Harington as he pulls off Snow so brilliantly, although i shouldn't say that because there has been not one person within all episodes that has not done a top notch job. The music is fantastic and the sound effects divine, except on one occasion one the first episode where it showed horses being rode in the snow, the sound effect was that of horses walking on a road rather than a forest with snow (should of been soft followed by crunches fellas lol) anyway this show is an easy 11 out of 10.I hope this series goes on forever. Game of Thrones was the only reason i picked up HBO and if it stays on HBO, HBO will forever be purchased in this household.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend brought me A Game of Thrones for my birthday many years ago, and I promptly read that and every other book in A Song of Ice and Fire; just about the best books I have ever read, utterly immersive and spectacular. When I heard the series was coming to the telly I was so excited I could hardly wait, and having now watched the entire series, I am really pleased about the way it was adapted, and can't wait for the second season. I would recommend the series to anyone; there will be some who don't like it, but I think they'd have to miss a few pretty big points, or be rather narrow-minded to do so.Pros Stays true to the books, amazing scenery and atmosphere, very gritty, superb cast **SPOILERS AHOY** Cons Some of the characters are not at all like I imagined them. Catelyn looks too frumpy, the actress is a beautiful woman, but I imagined Catelyn to be more girlish. Drogo should have been bigger, what's-his-name is a big bloke, but I had Drogo down to be properly massive. Rob, Jon, Bran, Rickon are too old. Robb and Bran especially, they grow up during the books. Sandor could have been a bit burlier. Finally, I imagined Renly to broader and more dashing, and... not gay.A lot of that is subjective, but my it leads me to a bigger gripe: Drogo's Khalasar. In the book it was 40000 horse warriors and a train of civvies, decimating entire cities and cultures and enslaving the populace. In this it's more like a group of 50 or so bandits who go around bullying the odd farm. Come on, HBO, chuck some CGI in there if you must but let's have something a bit more epic! And Vaes Dothrak is a massive settlement with the plundered gods of countless civilisations lining the main approach, not a camp site.**SPOILERS OVER** And gripes over as well, as despite the niggling discrepancies, this is a series I loved, and if you've not watched it yet, then you must, immediately. Oh, and as a guide, I also loved Rome, Firefly, Spartacus, Buffy, and Walking dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the Spartacus : Gods of the Arena series I saw this was advertised. Immediately attracted to the scene of Sean Bean (Eddard Stark) wielding a huge clay-more I knew I had to watch it. At first I called it "The Lord of the Rings, but different" only because of Ned Stark's striking resemblance to Sean Bean's other famous role Boromir. However after a mere few minutes into watching the series I realised this was in it's entirely different world.As the characters progressed and loved and hated each other each episode I was even more drawn in. Upon watching the series a second time I loved it only more.The saga leaves us with an epic cliffhanger in the series' penultimate episode and in the final episode, which I will obviously not disclose here but, it left me in awe and I could not wait for the next episode/season. When the series finished I could not wait for the next season so began watching again, as well as purchasing all the books.I have never been so in love with something I have so many hates for. I do not consider these flaws but only interesting and new writing styles. It makes it more realistic the way you are screaming at the screen going "WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!" and etc. Hating and loving some characters and plot devices is exactly what the writers wanted me to do.This is one of the best television series I have ever seen. Probably the best. If I were a producer I would be throwing my money at this to make more and more. I would even pay off George Martin to write more books just so I am entertained for the next 40 years. This combines love, hate, gore, sex, evil, good, and adventure perfectly into a fine mix which should be savoured. Truly I hope I haven't bigged it up to much. However it is incredible</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazingly strong cast of Britains best actors and actresses work alongside some of their quality Stateside fellows. A strong script taken from a well loved series of books, weaves and creates a place populated by real people where the cut and thrust of normal life plays alongside the Epic nature of the Royal and Knightly families. Scenery, wardrobe, CGI, etc all maintain the highest of HBO's standard.I am sure there are some, aka the "Twighlight" type audience, who will find this story too complex, too "wordy" and too epic to grasp. But those of us who loved HBO's "ROME" and the screen epic "LOTR", watch this series with wonder and a big smile on our faces.......Raymond E Feist's "Magician" next please.All at HBO take a bloody well deserved bow.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intricate and compelling, very well written. There is probably not more I could say that haven't already being said.I just want to remark on how well developed all the characters are, even the bad guys which is rare. I especially enjoyed the women characters of the show, all portrayed as exceptional and strong-willed. You may disapprove of their actions, like the queen's incestuous relation, Lady Stark's prejudice against her husband's bastard son, or Daenerys Targaryen's submissiveness at the beginning of the show, but you must admire the strength, ambition, and determination of these ladies. Not like other shows where women are simply weak, victims, or crazy cartoonish evil. And my absolute favourite character is the imp, Lord Tyrion Lannister, quick-witted and clever. What a refreshing show.There better be a season 2 or I will cancel HBO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never read the books, but after finishing season 1, I think I will.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am completely blown away by this series. After spending my fourth of July finishing all ten episodes (No, I am not a recluse, I was just so hooked that I found nothing else worthwhile of my time), and finding out that the next season won't be released for another year, I've been obsessively looking at posts on the discussion board in hopes of putting my impatience and restlessness at ease. Seeing as that was unproductive use of my time, I decided to write this review instead so that I could at least get some final thoughts off my chest and hopefully get some sleep afterward. The beginning of episode one was a little slow, as they are with all TV series- they need to introduce characters and set the framework for the entire show, rest assured it picks up quickly. A lot of people seem to have a basis of comparison for this show, having been avid readers of the books by GRRM. For the large majority of readers, they haven't been disappointed with this adaptation. To those of you who haven't read the books, coming from a non-reader herself, the show will have the same brilliant effect. Yes, there are a lot of characters, but after episode 1, you slowly get the hang of it, and each episode leaves you craving for more. The acting is superb and incredibly believable, even the minor characters play their part exceptionally well. HBO has never disappointed me with their quality productions, and Game of Thrones is yet another masterpiece. My only hope is that it doesn't meet the same fate as Rome and Deadwood, because, boy would that be a shame.</fullReview>

I have enjoyed this series more than any series HBO has done since the Sopranos and Rome. HBO did a great job of transferring the viewer in to the seven kingdoms. It appears that the writers for the series took every 80 pages of the novel and used them to each episode. Very true the books and may be the best series adaptation ever done. It is truly my hope that HBO continues this series in the same manner. If they continue to stay true to the novel and use 70 to 90 pages as an episode I will not miss an episode. Thanks again HBO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For far too long did I put off watching this series because of my pre-conceived notion that it was a re-hashed Lord of the Rings rip-off. I have a feeling that many people who have not yet experienced Game of Thrones are those who have the same misconceptions that I had. I did enjoy The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but I found this TV series to be on a completely different level.Sean Bean's performance as the steely-eyed Lord Eddard Stark is commendable, but it is Peter Dinklage and his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister, the witty and wise dwarf born in to privilege, that steals the show for me. It is very rare that a TV show can truly give the viewer a roller-coaster of emotions, but Game of Thrones certainly lives up to that billing. There are scenes that will make you laugh (though this is far from a comedy), scenes that will leave you sobbing, and scenes that will have you screaming at the action on the screen. Episodes will finish and leave you with your jaw on the floor, eager to find out what happens next time. In short, you do not have to be a fan of epic fantasy to enjoy this series. If you are a fan of emotive story lines and fantastic acting along with some amazing special effects, then this is definitely for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start, I must first say that George R.R. Martin's books in this series, "A Song of Ice and Fire," are the best novels I've ever read. Martin has a talent that most writers don't have. He's unpredictable. In a world of writers that rely on twists and needless complexity to keep the reader guessing, with few exceptions, Martin treats his characters with ruthless indifference. You may never know if a character you've grown to love will survive the next page. This is not a fantasy series in the traditional sense. While there is magic in Martin's books, it is generally kept to the fringes of the storyline. There is no Gandolf in "A Game of Thrones." The books are largely based around intrigue and the workings of powerful families vying for power amidst a world in turmoil. There are a LOT of characters in these novels, but this was never a problem as the central characters number maybe a dozen and Martin creates very believable and memorable personalities. You will never confuse Cersei Lannister for Catelyn Stark, and don't dismiss this offhand for Catelyn can be every bit as ruthless as Cersei is. This is another of Martin's gifts. He doesn't create archetype characters. Jamie Lannister, as you've seen at the end of the pilot episode, is a despicable human being, but later in the series, there is something very pathetic and appealing about him. Tyrion, by far my favorite character in the books, is foul, underhanded, pathetic and for some reason... utterly brilliant. This brings up my first problem with the casting though.In the books, Tyrion is not only a dwarf, but his visage is almost sickening. This is the driving force behind his motivations and the reason he chooses to pay for lovers. Peter Dinklage may be a dwarf / midget, but he's not ugly. He's just little. I was impressed by his acting ability though and have high hopes for the character.I was very impressed with the pilot episode. It stuck largely to the book, though some of the scenes differed a bit. The conversation between Cersei and Jamie at John Arryns services did happen, but not in that setting nor in that sequence of events. The scene between Cal Drogo and Daenerys following the marriage did not occur in this way. In the book, Cal Drogo was amazingly tender with Daenerys and did not force her in the way that it appears in the pilot. There are a number of these minor deviations throughout the pilot, which, of course, is to be expected. My biggest complaint though is the treatment of the prologue, the ranging that takes place at the beginning of the pilot. The pilot makes it seem as if the ranging takes place mere hours after passing through the Wall, yet they were around a week or two into the ranging when they come upon the dead wildlings. In addition, there is an odd deviation here in which Will survives and Gared dies. In the books, Will actually dies at the hands of an undead Waymar Royce while Gared escapes and ends up beheaded by Ned Stark. The scene was cool in the prologue, but it is so much more intense in the book. All in all though, a great start to the series. Most of the characters are cast quite well and the characters are largely in keeping with Martin's creations.One last point I want to make..., you probably already know that A Game of Thrones is set in an alternate world. A world in which summers can last for years and winters can last for decades. I've read a number of reviews that pan this as some kind of environmental message. This isn't the case. In fact, this is scientifically plausible in a world having more than one moon, which this world does have. We're lucky here on Earth that our single moon keeps us in a stable orbit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really wasn't very interesting. I'd recommend not wasting your money on watching it if you can avoid it. The characters are great actors, but the plot line is actually very basic in the end. Good guy wants justice, bad guy wins. With so many stories of so many kingdoms, one would think something decent and happy was going on. Granted, they pop a wedding or two in now and then, but even those end up in massacre and death. So...I end my review with explaining the next chapters of the game: Part 1 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 2 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 3 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 4 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 5 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Get the point?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be the best show EVER of television</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I am going to sound like a total fanboy, but what a spectacular job they have done with game of thrones!! The casting is like plucking the imagery, that author Martin has so richly set, straight from my brain. Normally, with any book adaptations, the expectation of the characters and their core traits, both physically and emotionally, is a rare probability. HBO has absolutely nailed it. The acting is top notch, the set design pinnacle (pause your dvr sometime and notice the intricacies of the various elements within each set), and the script does exquisite justice to Martin's imagery. I can only anticipate the growing intricacies of the plot lines to come, and cannot wait to see each character develop as the story unfolds. I have thought for several years that no show could give me the rush of emotion and anxiety as I experienced watching "Band of Brothers", HBO has trumped themselves, and I believe have created the greatest production of a show ever to graced television. I also give the earliest possible prediction that Peter Dinklage will get nominated for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for either best actor or best supporting, and he should win one if not both. I urge anyone who has not done so to watch this series, and enjoy getting lost in a tapestry of richly woven threads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words cannot describe the entire run- time of the Game of thrones TV show. But numbers can. 0/10.The entire f u c k i n g show could have been the seven awful minutes of this; People get naked, lazy camera, lazy effects, some fan-service here and there with a bit of terrible acting on top, wiggling eyebrows and Emilia Clarke's boobs, since beyond that her acting has nothing to offer. End of story. Seriously, the inhabitants of earth have spent 8 million dollars for that s h i t, and it&nbsp;s u c k e d!&nbsp;Immensely.&nbsp;Game of thrones (The c o c k -s u c k i n g showcrap, not the outstandingly written book)&nbsp;was such a gigantic failure on all fronts that I can't even nitpick it properly. The best part of this clusterf*ck were the subtitles. "Directed by Some H a c k and starring Overpaid Jack A s s and Talentless but Fun to J e r k Off To So and So." Big shows like this tend to bring out the worst in people. It is still beyond me how anyone can genuinely defend the Dornish plot and stand for what the show-runners did to beloved book characters. There is no human on planet earth that would have been able to discern the needy screams of a child from the cacophony of b u l l s h i t loudly blasting out of the speakers and the screen. And for him to have the world rooting for him, pushing for him to succeed and then failing so utterly and entirely is just a reaffirmation of the endless fallibility of the human creature and the sheer pointlessness of life. Game of thrones was, really, comparable to a fourteen- years old teenager being called by an unknown attractive girl for 'fun time', but after arriving finding an obese, fifty- years old drooling pedo on her place. Only instead of raping little boys, DnD are content to rape our minds (though I'm sure they would find either equally satisfying). In the end, they have your money and you are left with nothing save want. Every single new character the writers added for whatever reason from down to Ros to the worthless c u m stain called Olly was empty, lifeless and dull as f u c k. Pointless, insulting and stupid, too. Talk about cashing in on other people's s h i t... What's that? You liked Malko and Myranda? Grow up, t w a t. You are a r e t a r d. And a dork. And s c u m.But that's just the start. We all know what plot armour is. We all hate it. And Game of thrones shoves it down our throats. Frankly, what else could we have expected? They hired the dude who wrote X-Men Origins: Wolverine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, this started like most HBO crap: lots of blood, "in your face" nudity to remind you why you pay the extra instead of settling for the basic cable package, and sex more sleazy than the average Hustler vid.Except that the women of Thrones aren't "amazing". They look like what the porn industry throws on the "amateur" flicks. And thats WITH the make-up. The sex was boring; there's more chemistry in a math class than on these sets. And the fighting and blood were clearly done by someone that hasn't seen combat or held any of those weapons or armor. Oh, and the gay pandering is so blatant, Im surprised it isn't being boycotted. Im serious, until season 5 they cant do an episode without grinding your face in gay sex. It seems like the few rare scenes that Don't involve homosexual sex in some way are the incest scenes. I've heard of "blaxploitation" as a category, but what do we call this? "gaysploitation"? "homosploitation"? Should it be more insultive, as the "blax" is, to show contempt for the disrespect it does to the minority pandered to?I guess the "kill a named character every two episodes" mantra actually comes from the books, which is all the more reason not to read the books, to me. If I want some pompous jackwagon that spends 2 pages introducing me to the character just to immediately kill off said character, I'll go back to Victorian authors like dickens, who were paid by the letter, rather than for content. We're in season 5, and the only character left from the beginning that you might care about is Ari. The screen-writers have gotten so desperate Cersi is naked. I realize there's an audience for middle-aged women with buzz-cuts getting pelted with garbage and sewage, I just figured it was mostly centralized in German fetishism, not HBO "mainstream" audience. Or maybe the two are really one and the same?The only central plots across the seasons are "winter is coming", because apparently in this world that doesn't happen every year? IDK, they never address why its so important that seasons, ya know, change and stuff... Oh, and the other is, "if you do good, your gonna get screwed". Every character that tries to "do the right thing", or act good, whether in character or not, pays for it. And in GoT, there's only one way you pay: death. Often with a little creepy-border-line rapey-time as well, especially in the later seasons.Do yourself a favor. If you want to watch porn, watch porn. If you want to watch TV, watch TV. Avoid this hybrid abortion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The producers of this series have, so far, done a spectacular job. As a fan of the books (yes, I've read them all), the visual depictions of the characters and the scenery are spot-on with with how I had imagined they would appear (except Jamie Lannister and I don't know why!). However, I am amazed at the popularity of this series. I say this because, as I watch each episode, I couldn't imagine anyone truly being able to follow the storyline unless they've read the books. There is such a mountain of internal dialog and details that are not conveyed by film -- which is true with most book-to-film renditions. Watching the series after having read the books makes for a highly entertaining experience. George R. R. Martin is, without a doubt, a master of his craft. If not, THE master of his craft. 'Genius' and 'masterful' are the words I use to describe Martin's masterpiece of literature {and film}.The HBO series should easily be enjoyed on its own merit, but I highly recommend that everyone read the books before watching the series -- it will greatly enhance the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOTR of the small screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I would urge those of you who haven't read the book to do so. The series is a dark and violent fantasy epic for the ages. The characters are mostly human( though the book does mention a few other sentient species). Unlike the wildly extravagant magical creatures in LOTR, the main theme here is intrigue and political power struggle in the continent of Westeros. The power rests with the royal houses of Arryn, Stark, Baratheon, Lannister, Tully, Targaryen and others who are all embroiled in this war. The action is sporadic and understated and more is implied than said.The author of the book series George RR Martin is also closely involved with the production of the show and thus has kept it close to his books. The special effects are decent and the narrative is brilliant. I personally believe this show will do more justice to it's parent books than the LOTR trilogy since there is no time limitation in a TV show and all the events can be covered well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long Live the Seven Kingdoms of Westeroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who are not familiar with "A Song of Ice and Fire" fantasy series comprising of 4 novels till date by George R. R. Martin, HBO presents to you an opportunity to indulge in a medieval fantasy drama, an epic tale of seven noble families of a continent "Westeroes", fighting amongst themselves to control the Iron throne. George R. R. Martin had conceptualized the fantasy novel, a saga of warfare among the various tribes of Westeroes, after working for various television shows in the 1980s such as Beauty and Beast, Twilight Zone etc, as screenwriter. The writer after publishing 4 novels surrounding the throne, considered the conception of a television series a rare possibility, since the channels had argued that novel involves a large number of characters and possibly, requires a high budget. However, the premiere has been appreciated by Martin, who applauded the impeccable depiction of the world by creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss.The series has been appreciated widespread after an extensive promotion, for instance, U.K. viewers clumped to the debut on Sky Atlantic of "Game of Thrones", and acknowledged the series better than earlier signature show "Boardwalk Empire". According to a wide majority of viewers, the series may not be comparable to "Lord of Rings" as was speculated, but definitely regarded it as an excellent adaptation of the novel and further complemented the work of biggie "Sean Bean" who plays Lord Eddard Stark.HBO has further renewed the series for a second season. The pilot titled "Winter is Coming" was slow and introductory, an indication to the superb series that will follow. The episode illustrated how King Baratheon suspected an uprising against him following the death of his adviser, and calls for the help of Lord Eddard. The start of the episode was thrilling, nerve-reeking by the presence of "White Walkers", the "others" you know, if you have read the novel, the first in the series. The man who survived and later executed as a deserter was one of the night watchers who guarded the wall which barred the passage of "others". Since, the others were not seen for thousands of years, Lord Eddard played by Sean regarded the man's claim to have seen them baseless and utter madness. The last scene where Jamie pushes the boy off the tower after he saw him with Queen Cersei would have totally put viewers on edge. I adored the last shot, and is definitely a good move to retain and bring back viewers.I loved the first episode, it gave me the feeling that series will be awesome, and would eventually get better. Since, the creators have stuck to the original story, supported by exemplary acting, and art direction, it will propel. It is a high budget series by HBO with a season estimation of US$60 million, even greater than Rome, and good for HBO the series has received positive reviews, with the pilot suspected to have fetched US$2.5 million overseas. Thus, the series promises umpteen entertainment for adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HBO Does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start from the expectations which grew as soon as i heard that they are making a TV series on book (thanks GOD not a movie). Then came the poster with Sean Bean sitting on a throne and that said it all.If you are looking for some real medieval epic adventure this show is for you, even if not do watch it and you will be amazed by the way it is presented. I loved the pilot and desperately looking forward to the next episodes( wish it will not discontinued). Direction is brilliant, locations are amazing, acting does justice to the show. A dark show with very serious theme, background score is great by Ramin Djawadi (prison break). All in all a great new show on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>like most American series, this has now gone on long enough, it was OK for maybe the first couple of seasons, by season three it had begun to fade, more dialogue, more characters that come and go and with no end in sight. it is now a game of bores,i don't really care about anyone, just like battlestar galactica, this is liked by people who normally would run a mile from fantasy, as with galactica this is really a soap opera with locations and costumes, the fantasy elements virtually gone, with galactica there was no sci fi but just boring soap scenarios. the fact that the author cannot find a way to end this says a lot, as with soaps again there are no endings just stuff that goes on and on and on and on. this not shakespearen nor does it say much about the human condition, there is nothing we have not seen before, done a whole lot better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the HELL does this have a 9.5 on IMDb?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just going to say it: Game of Thrones is a grossly, grossly, GROSSLY overrated series. People act like this is one of the greatest series ever made. I say that's bullshit! Game of Thrones is so f*cking boring. The plot lines are everything we've seen in this type of story before. Every episode feels formulaic. It drags along often. The acting is subpar. Sometimes the actors seem more interested in the money they are about to get than the roll they are portraying. Other times they are WAY overacting to where it just gets annoying. The set design, while nice looking, is still generic as all hell. It is the same forest and "mythological environments that we've seen in Lord of the Rings or Princess Bride. I cannot believe this lasted more than a season and has a rating of a NINE POINT F*CKING FIVE on IMDb! It's not the worst show ever but it should not be grouped with shows like Breaking Bad. Oh, and did I mention that the fanbase is almost as bad as the bronies?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading the book you get into a really grim world. This did not happen in the first episode. To be honest, based on this series of book you should be able to cast a masterpiece in TV history. However, this did not happen. Hopefully the following episodes shall be more grim, as is the series of books, the ages and situations portrayed in those. There should be less focus on the graphics and more on the characters and acting to display the tough emotions and situations they are going through (Hint: make the actors read the books).Nevertheless I am very happy that HBO is doing the series and being a fan of the books I shall be looking forward for the new episodes.

DEAD SERIOUS parades of FEMALE BODY HUMILIATION !!Very fair distribution of female hatred and humiliations too: all classes of all age group of females are covered: prepubescent girls, peasant sisters, princesses, exotic escorts, mommy queen...all stripped, poked, stabbed, sliced open, hung, paraded, trashed, spat on, MERCILESSLY DISFIGURED WITH all sorts of sharp hard weapons and stinkiest filth and vilest concepts one can think of. Great achievements...The uglier and more gruesome the spectacle, the pettier and meaner the torture scenes and female disfigurement, the louder the planet of the apes cheer from probably some kind of orgasmic catharsis! 11 out of 10!!!Oh yes, it has a plot. Nice sets. Good actors. Long story arc, yada yada.Please don't censor this show though. Let the raging hatred and toxic bile flow. Let it all out. so that the evolved ones could use this as a barometer to filter out chimps from supposedly civilized potential mates. So that one day in the future, we could use this as a text book to teach our great grand children about our residual-chimpanzee legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched GoT until the end of the 4th season. It's about nothing but soft porn and uncensored disgusting deaths. The story is much slower than by LotR (which is slow), and there are no great battle scenes which could make it better. There is just talking, sometimes sword fight, torturing, that's all, no one to empathize with, nothing to learn from, nothing exciting. Even watching ants is more fun (I guess). It is like a bubble, shiny, full of colors, but there is nothing inside, there is no value in it. I guess people who don't want to think, just watch, can really enjoy it. Good for them, but not for me. I decided not to waste my time with this series ever again. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst storyline I will ever encounter...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that the realization of this series is astonishing. Acting is great, image is great, music is great. The story on the other hand is worst trash. Nobody knows how it will end, but I can tell you, ...unfortunately. It will have no particular meaningful end. Everybody will be killed or die in some disturbing way, and at the end you will not remember how and why it all started, which is actually true for the last few seasons even now. The whole world desperately awaits for a meaning but there will never be one. Whenever the story will end, it could have ended equally well after the 1st season. Even in Chinese movies the tragedy has some deepness, there is honor, sacrifice, values, and death has purpose, in this one if something resembles to anything, one can be certain it is just a vessel for surprising the viewer with another unexpected random death. A pattern emerged and after 5 seasons any hope for a decent story is long dead. The worst part is millions of people are disturbed by the story but they keep looking for the hope it will get better. It never will. When people wait starts to obviously become annoying the author just kills the main character, does not matter how, and this way makes the story unexpected, again. It is so dumb when you actually think of it, that no one put that before on paper, with success at least. You will probably continue to watch, and only the end will show you what an incredible waste of time this TV series was.</fullReview>

The story line keeps dragging on and on with seemingly only new angles on just what different and graphic forms of killing and mutilation can be devised and delivered with optimum special effects. It is a game of thrones and a game where not only nobody wins but just how badly everyone loses, one at a time, told in layered story groupings, episode after episode. Enough already. Apparently this is what keeps the series ratings high and I just no longer want to be a part of this feed so goodbye Game of Thrones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where Game of Thrones stumbles is it's (dis)ability to properly handle characters and a story at once. The creators of this show are apparently bound on showing needless scenes of naked woman belittling themselves in every episode. Nothing is right with that statement. Just because your show is on HBO doesn't mean nudity needs to appear whenever possible. See Silicon Valley, why can't all HBO shows handle nudity like that? Oh yeah, because Game of Thrones needs an audience. Strip the nudity and you have a worthless show that may be the most atrocious thing to ever exist. Perhaps you will all see come the final season, because eventually the writers have to stop daydreaming of women and actually make a television show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a masterpiece but it neither a trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This show is a hard one for me and I haven't been so ambivalent about a show or a movie like I'm with GOT. I've only seen first two seasons but I'm full with mixed emotions writing this review. From one side there few elements that I like but on the other side so many redundant details/characters bad acting and pseudo cleverness that some times I've straggled to finish an episode appalled from seeing something pretentious, partially baked and not genuine. But at the same time I do enjoy part of the story lines and some of the characters, which are played and developed brilliantly. I'll try to list my biggest cons and pros which may contain some spoilers (only for first and second seasons). So, firstly the whole "dragons/savages" story line is completely ridiculous and utterly bad played by practically every character. I've actually hardly overcome and proceed seeing the show after the bad taste the first episode leaved because of all the hideous acting and filming involved in this story line. Second major thing is the general confusion about where the action taking place and the fact that the show couldn't crate (or maybe didn't intend to) a real imaginary/fantasy world. Most of the times you could definitely make a parallel to our reality and place the event somewhere in British Island since the landscape, people (how they talk, dress, look and behave) and rule system is very similar. Some other smaller details contribute to this dissonance for example characters like fencing teacher with an Italian name and accent. This all made me wonder not once whether I'm watching a fantasy or a fiction story about middle ages. I also have an issue with the mass scenes ? there are many of them in the GoT and practically all of them are unrealistic. Scenes like military camps or people gathering are very common in GoT and many times you hear estimation for number of troops, but what you see in reality is very small crowd on the set or simply a camp with many tents but no soldiers. This leads me to conclusion that the wide range of story lines (which I actually like) made the producers to not give every one of them enough attention. Additionally to these but probably less noticeable to most are the sometimes pretentious dialogues about power and higher matters. None of them I actually find hideously banal and indigestible but they are there to contribute to a general mediocrity impression. Despite these major cons and few small ones which I want mention, the show manages to present many brilliant performances and colourful characters. All Lanister's are very well cast and played especially Tyrrion. Jon Snow and Rob Stark are very easy to relate and sympathize. I also consider the brutality and sexual content, although at times redundant, but rather a good tool to characterize human morals and manners at a particular time and place, which is as far as I'm concern is a medieval Britain. As a conclusion I would suggest that the ability to present multiple great heroes and anti-heroes is the essence of the success of GoT. It's not a masterpiece but it neither a trash. It's easy to watch if you neglect some of the story lines and don't care for some recycled dialogues. The tension is building up as the winter is coming and multiple power are about to clash. So, I do eager to follow GoT to the 3 season but I also feel that I may lose interest in it as the cons may prevail over the pros.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting is superb. The scenes are great. They can get really gruesome though. According to other reviews, this show stays true to the books, However, how can you watch a show if all of the likable characters are being killed of one/two/three by one/two/three per episode? The evil people in this series don't get back what they give while the good people are getting what they don't deserve. King joffery died of poisoning. Quite a light death sentence for the things he has done. While John snow gets stabbed multiple times. On the other hand, The Queens punishment was magnificent. I really hope the remaining living Starks rise to power and it lasts and I hope the friends turning into enemies happen less often. Seriously, I understand you cannot trust anyone, but this show literally shoves it in your face. Can some people remain loyal friends? They really don't need to kill off another stark for a while. Another thing, it's been 5 seasons and winter is still coming. Still? I would like to see more of Arya's story as well.</fullReview>

Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.^^The series follows the books very closely, so its no surprise that the movie seems "gloomy" as the books have been given reviews along this same path. There are a few sections that drag, like any book, but for the most part it moves pretty fast, and beware, Martin has zero allegiance to his character, hint, hint, and the last episode is proving of that. Again, the story follows the books well, I guess this explains why we Martin book readers were pulling our hair out waiting for the next book, because he is HELPING make the dang thing...er...I fear the next book is going to be just as painfully long away in making!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9.5 for Game of Thrones? That can't be right...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the show is good, no discussion there but a 9.5 (July 3rd 2016) is quite overrated to my opinion. Ratings like that are more echoes of the past that lack present reality.The first 3 seasons I would give 9 out of 10, unfortunately the show got a bit lost from there on as it slowly collapsed under its own weight while trying to become something legendary... The many story-lines got messier with new ones unnecessary added without any real need to do so and the intelligent script got quite a bit less intelligent while going along.SPOILERS: The whole season of Arya going to the Faceless God was a waste of time. No added value of going there, staying there and then on a blue Monday suddenly she suddenly decided to go back for no real particular reason. A whole season filled with nothing and then after returning in just a few minutes she does something that could have filled a whole season... sighs... where's the logic there...Furthermore, out of the blue the High Sparrow pops up and takes over control reducing Cercei to a pawn...?? Who ever invented that totally illogical twist? As if the most mighty wealthy powerful house Lannister would ever bend for a bunch of priests... let alone after Cercei has got full power after her father died. Sorry, that really makes no sense at all.Just two examples of how messy the story-lines got and in my opinion there is by now a long list of inconsistencies so I would say the quality of script writing needs to go up a lot as soon as possible because Game of Thrones had a great start in the early years but now slowly is becoming an empty shell that still shines glamorous on the outside but gets more and more hollow on the inside.On a side note, Samwell Tarly is a nice character, but there really was no need to make this (again) another parallel story-line. You see, this is what I mean, an overdoses on story-lines and things just get messier by doing so.Dragons -how spectacular they might be- can't cover up for the lack of an intelligent story. I would say get a focus, get a grip, hire some good writers and bring it back to the quality it had in the beginning.As it is right now: 8 out of 10 and only because I'm in a good mood and hope things will get better... ;-)René</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about GoT, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I hadn't previously read the books, so I knew nothing. (lol) With that said, GoT blends fantasy, action, sexuality, and a little comedy here and there. As the seasons progress, the series leans mostly toward the darker side. But never-the-less, the series is definitely one to check out! Think Lord of the Rings but on a much larger much more in-depth scale.I will say that the violence and sexuality should be noted. GoT holds nothing back, and you will be submersed in a world of no shame or modesty.That aside, the first season focuses mainly on one family, but eventually more characters come, and the story begins to follow several different stories in several different places all at once by bouncing back and forth, just like the book.The story can sometimes be difficult to keep up with, with the amount of story change, and 'back and forth'-ness. This would be the only real downside. The situations each character is faced with, the action, costume and set designs, the acting, and of course the landscape all make up for that! You will be at the edge of your seat through 98% of the series, and when the season is over you will go through GoT withdraws as you beg for more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Contains Spoilers*Somewhere in the middle we expected a huge alliance between two great families that would end as peaceful bounds. We were waiting to see that it would be a grand celebration full of joy and reaching the long-awaiting revenge and winning a great war. But suddenly there were bloods everywhere, where every single member of present family was brutally killed and stabbed. That was horrifying and that was a Red Wedding. After that particular scene the interest grew to Game of Thrones making it a first classic recent novel and TV-Show where unusually main characters either die or face the injustice. This is kingdom of Westeros where brutality, cruelty, injustice, betrayal and hardships take place. This is a kingdom where brutal man rule and only the strongest survive. A place where you should be no more than a cunning bastard to survive everything by luring a young girl into a marriage against her will whereas to protect her. It's a world where no one pity you, no one feels sorry for anything. It's a place where a little girl survives on her own by taking life for granted. A family who's blind to see that power isn't everything. Children gets the answer for the actions of their parents, a man who protects his brother gets his father killed, a whore who betrays, a devoted man gets killed for planning defense his own men. This is not just a drama, romance, crime or adventure. This is everything. Every little scene, every little talk, even a gesture matters to understand Game of Thrones. Every viewer may expect everything from the show. Cause anything can happen. This is what makes it so incredibly exciting to follow. Each episode is assured to be thrilling and captivating to watch. For those who will start watching it: it's so perfect and entertaining that you will be craving for more! This is a series that stays true to the book. The depth, the complexity and drama is very well captured in the Series. It's very rare nowadays to see the film adaptation which is so close to the book. It's remarkable indeed. In every perspective it's bold, powerful and fantastic. And it's a fantasy that bites!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable and mostly faithful version of the books with some plot changes but the characters certainly in character and looks standing up to the books except that Tyrion is more repulsive physically in the books with each eye of a different color and a waddle lacking in the film. He is the kindest of the Lannisters in both media and a clever strategist.The archery, approaching ships with drums and wildfire at the Battle of Blackwater, the undead walking past Samwell Tarly are excellently done. Characters such as the Clegane's are well realized whilst Charles Dance is perfect as Tywin Lannister. Cersei, Joffrey, Arya and Sansa are spot on.Winterfell is not well served in the film. It looks a very small place with a handful of filthy townsfolk muttering in a tiny courtyard and reminding one of Blackadder. The soldiers might be out and about but what has happened to the populace? This is not the mighty stronghold of Eddard Stark. Compare King's Landing's treatment - a citadel of comparable might.Those like the books will find the film's portrayals of the characters appearing in their mind's eye; not a bad tribute to a film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure this is one of the best TV Series ever! Every thing is good and even close to the perfection, but the thing is that it is not even close to the original books! I'm just finished the first part of the book three an I love it! Although I rate this TV Series 9/10 (I think it is even deserve 10/10) but unfortunately it is not good as the books! I think if this Serial was made more like the original book, it could have became even much better! These casts and this story, have more potential than this and I believe they can do even greater than this! I like this TV Series but in compare to the George R.R. Martin's books it is nothing! As I said I gave 9/10 ( even 10/10) to this TV Series but when I compare it with the book,it is 4/10!! I really suggest to anyone whom can read the book, to read it! It is really something different! It's really magnificent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amazing medieval fantasy and well written and directed.......HBO is great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is the most amazing TV series i have ever seen in my life. its greatly written and well directed. thanks to george martin who is so good in taking us to the world of fantasy land. the characters in this show is so rich and each one has its own story. right from 8000 yrs ago in westeores before the wall to aegons landing and after 300 yrs later how Robert rebellion broke out and 17 yrs later how game of thrones events happen and the king rode to north to ask for his best friends help to look after his kingdom. most of the TV shows are very slow in stories but this one have good pace and twist in every episode. i loved the way the george martin created all seven kingdoms, the major houses and minor ,their culture, their sigil,the family tree their appearances such as traits like their looks,hair, eyes and their words. and mainly wall of north and what lies beyond.also they have shown nice scenic landscapes and scenic beauty of the nature and did great job to show how westeroes look like. i m also very excited about the seasons the way it happens in westeroes and the winter with long night. it takes best directors and filmmakers to understand this book and transform it into great entertainment and truly they lived it upto the standards. also the music track is such overwhelming and deep. right from best opening sequence which takes to different part of westeroes and neighbor continent with moving veiw map representation with such powerful electrifying soundtrack.when u see game of thrones u must have some of the knowledge about book song of ice and fire and should know about some past history and events then u will enjoy this shows a lot. this show is not just about blood, violence and swords. but about understanding each and every character and their importance.u will love each and every scene of the every episode and duologue's and conversation and will get drawn in each and every character.i just culdnt hold myself to watch the next season of the game of thrones even though i read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game of Thrones Season 6</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This happens to be the best written, produced, and filmed series to ever come to television. Now that there is no book to follow, the producers have gained the same vision as George RR Martin, the author of The Fire and Ice Game of Thrones books. Each episode has been full of epic story lines, all having an effect on the ultimate story. Viewers are treated with a cinematic masterpiece each and every week. Each story-line is full of unique characters who keep your attention throughout each episode. However, the series is not for the weak hearted. Each episode is full of adult language, nudity, and over the top violence. However, what brings people back is the writing. HBO and the production has truly spent a great deal of time producing the most visually striking series of this century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest TV Series of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones!!! Loosely based on the English War of Roses, writer Martin added many outside elements to create an awe-inspiring fantasy series. His books were adopted into TV series.It is the political story about an in-power family and other noble families in the fantasy land of Westerros to control the continent.This series is full of twists and turns and it is hard to fit this in a particular genre. Many moves were not on the expected lines with new surprises in every episode.The directors leave each and every season at cliff hangers and audience has to wait almost an year to know the fate of their favorite characters.It hold an IMDb rating of 9.5 as of now (End of Season 5), which by no means a smaller achievement. The rating it hold in IMDb tells it all!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite show is back for season six!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catching up with the multitude of character both alive in dead where we left in season 5 leads to a bunch of short segments that inform of where most of the characters are at the beginning of this new sixth season. The story picks up with the most pertinent mystery of Jon Snow's death. The show does not give into the rumor mill, so far Kit Harington only plays a corpse, and tell us whether he will come back now or ever. I was a bit worried that he would rise from the dead as a white walker. The show moves from their to the other North residents including the Boltons who are still scheming for the throne but have a problem with a now missing Sansa Stark, played by Sophie Turner. Her situation looks dire until Brienne of Tarth, played by the increasingly popular Gwendoline Christie, shows up to finally fulfill her promise to Catelyn Stark.After the sixth season: Game of Thrones is the greatest show on television flying high above some very healthy competition because it never fails to raise the stakes and creates a world that viewers can dive into. The twists were numerous and totally unexpected despite the spoiler atmosphere of the internet. This HBO Show based on the novel by George R. R. Martin has shown the potential of fantasy and set a high watermark for what television hopes to achieve.This sixth season began with many of the characters either in dire situations or recovering from a trauma.

		<fullReview>I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.'Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. Every "country", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. Of course, that was all already there in the books ? but translating that so perfectly to a TV-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement.Yet for all its grandeur, scale and breath-taking visuals, what really makes Martin's outstanding work come to life on the small screen is the fantastic ensemble of actors. At the core of this show (any show, really) are the characters. Tyrion, Cersei, Dany, Jamie and John (and all the ? many ? others) don't lose anything of their complexity; the amazing cast succeeds in showing all their respective characters' inner conflicts and often questionable motivations and virtually no one comes across as one-dimensional (except maybe for Joffrey).There have been a couple of great TV-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale AND quality, 'Game of Thrones' is ? at the moment ? in a league of its own. A joy to watch: breath-taking, epic ? and highly addictive ? Television. 10 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

Even the misses who isn't a fan of fantasy like story's at all is in love with the show. Started reading the books because of the show. The best thing the story does is making you think that certaing things won't happen or that the story is impossible to evolve into something else from certain points. And yet you keep getting surprised and the storyline keeps evolving and getting better and better. Besides the gread in depth story lines of the characters, the actors really know to play out the character. Afther you watched the first season it won't take long before you have watched everything.

		<fullReview>Game of thrones is the best TV Series till date. It is the best thing ever happened to the Television. It has everything Fantasy, Horror, Action, Advanture, Dragons, Sexual content, Love. I started watching this TV Series last month. It had characters like Ned Stark, Khal Drogo. When they died I felt like How can they die? They were the most effective characters in season one. And after the death of Robb Stark and his Mother I don't think any of the character is safe. They can kill anyone at anytime. No matter how effective character is that. The suspense is increasing as time is passing. The White Walkers, one of the best mystery creatures I have ever watched. It was the last episode of season 5 and they killed Jon Snow. Like seriously. He was the most focused character in season 4 and 5. After watching that Now I can't wait for season 6. Who will get the throne Khaleesi or House of Starks (Jon Snow, Bran Stark and Arya Stark) or The Lannisters or The White Walkers. Waiting for season 6 dreadfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally hooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think there is much else that can be written here about this incredible series. But I thought of adding my personal angle on the experience, as I am totally, irrevocably hooked on this show and cannot wait to see the rest of it. When I first started to watch it I actually found it a bit boring. I was never a real fan of fantasy, disliked the Lord of the Rings series and thought this would not escalate on my priority list. Bt so many friends were talking about it that I thought of giving it a chance. I had a similar experience with Breaking Bad, so it was worth trying. It took 5 or 6 episodes of season 1 to get there, but very soon I became completely addicted to the show, to its characters, to its unbelievable and unpredictable twists to the point that now I am literally FEARING who, after losing so many of our beloved protagonists, will be up next. Just a fantastic show that I hope will continue for a long time and that I wish did non have such a broad hiatus between seasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than a cake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start with saying that all these initial reviews on IMDb by the users are laughable - people had watched just one or few episodes and were dull enough to think they have tasted the full cake. Onwards with the show - first episodes feel indeed leaving you very much puzzled about who is who, what is going on, who are the persons mentioned in ascribed events and how precisely were they involved. For the people like me who haven't read the novel there is so much of story to soak up that it's easily to get lost and to be left with a need to rewatch the episode to fully grasp the big picture. But as the series continue and plotting of characters (that you are already familiar with from the first episode) progress you will start to clue the puzzling threads together. And as events also progress the main characters become more and more interesting, fascinating, sympathetic or abominable. I'd just recently started watching the series and I don't regret making through first few episodes. Each episode adds more and more to the table leaving you wondering and wanting to see next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some fair criticisms but still lords over so many TV shows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin I am irritated by some of the negative reviews.Unlike so many 'less-than-average' productions churned out these days Game of Thrones does not patronize its audience by spelling out its plot or playing grim music to identify the bad guys and the sweet whistle of bird song to glorify our heroes.I will concede the point that the sex is excessive but not always needlessly so. The scenes with lord Baelish for example do set the contrast of the characters life in court with his main profession.So many of the negative reviews criticise the pace of the story and claim that it is disjointed with too many characters. Indeed a 2 hour film would have to get to the point but a series has the luxury of developing the story and characters slowly and over the course of time. We are deliberately mislead to believe that Rob Stark's march south would give the audience the justice that the Lanister's deserve. But if we carry that forward and Rob had claimed victory, then when the Mother of Dragons inevitably reached the shores of Kings Landing, would it be Rob Stark's Kingdom that she would be burning? Basically the Bad guys need to win for now so that we can enjoy Daenerys' sacking of the south ensuring that their will be plenty of Dragon Fodder.More on this point, to those who lack the patients to understand the logic of the story-line. If Winterfell is the most northerly town then it would surely be the first to fall in either a Wildling attack of the Kingdoms or the advance of the white-walkers. With the rangers withered the Wilding army under Mance Rayder will be the first fodder that the audience cares nothing about and will hold the wall and take the brunt of the White Walker attack. We now have a foe in Lord Brighton as warden of the north who we can happily watch die at Winterfell with a sense of justice.Thus the story will play out as the seven kingdoms, repressed by their kings and wars flock to the Queen of Dragons and her liberated slaves to raise an army to march North to reclaim civilization from the White walkers.Bran, Rickon and Arya will rise to give us the relief from the injustices done the the noble Stark family by surviving the war and they all live happily ever after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a must watch medieval, supernatural, TV Series :))</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"king" is but a mere title the people are the country The Game of Thrones received high ratings during its first season of airing, it had a story that gives life to our imagination of our childhood mythical bedtime stories.The setting is in a medieval time where vikings were ruling the northern seas and were the most powerful in Europe during their reign. The story revolves around the (royal family) Baratheon, (overthrown royals) Targaryen, the Stark's, Lanister's, witches and gods.GOT, first started of with the story in northern territory of the kingdom that is made up of 7 kingdoms, the story begins with Ned Stark beheading a runaway knight watch member who happens to witness the white walkers reviving the dead. The story progresses on as the late king, Robert Baratheon, dies and his wife's son who happens to be the son of Jaime Lannister who is the Queen's brother, takes over as king and beheads Ned Stark sparking a war between the Northen territory, Winterfell, who proclaimed themselves an independent kingdom after the death of Ned.The Stark children are all separated, Arya in the good hands of people whom she meets along the way, Sansa in the royal city, Robb preparing for war with the other kingdoms who stands in his conquest of freeing them from Baratheon/Lanister rule, Jon Snow (half-blood, Stark) in the far north up beyond the wall as a Knight Watch, Bran now a limp, try to find their way back to restore their broken family.Season 3 is much anticipated by viewers, because of the sudden climax of the appearance of the White Walkers which seem to be pretty nasty opponents. I just hope that there would be more story on Daenerys Taygaryen and her dragon children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Series that Transcends Typical Genres</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My philosophy for the structure of a perfect movie holds true in the realm of TV shows, as Emmy Award-winning Game of Thrones brilliantly illustrates. The series transcends the simple and traditional genres of fantasy or myth as its deeply complex story and large, strong cast of rich, colorful, and layered characters convey themes that apply more often to the politics and society of today's world than the mystical Middle Ages. Once you watch Game of Thrones, you quickly lose the sense that you're watching a fantasy as you're engrossed in the characters' epic stories of a struggle for power, love, loss, betrayal, the quest for justice, identity, coming of age, and so many others. This series is truly one that can easily satisfy any and every viewer. 9.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I recommend a strong and mature mind to follow the story line, the series is fantastic. From blood to deceit to sex, to whispered secrets and false allies, to secretive passageways and clever plot lines; the series is a grand masterpiece. The characters themselves make the stories just marvellous. There's so many, yet none are the same. Some are good, some are strong, some are honest, some are clever, and some are stupid. Their actions can make you cringe or scream out in delight, or you find yourself cheering on some and hating others, just like any other good TV series. The actions that are taken, and how events evolve into something more, is just so cleverly done, by both the author and the creator of the TV series. (Would that be the author too?)And though the story takes place in a medieval time period, with fantasy creatures and knights with swords, the language is not all that difficult to understand.The only con to this series is that there are SO MANY CHARACTERS. Though I know each and every one, maybe read the books before so you have an idea of who every one is. I know some people sometimes mix other characters up, and the story moves quickly, so you MUST PAY ATTENTION TO EVERY EPISODE.Either way, to any one who loves blood sex and drama, this series is right up in your alley.For me, I can't imagine this story/series getting any better. And the actors are fantastic, they make the story so much more real. They really stick true to the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Show. Believe Me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game Of Thrones is an excellent show. I didn't start watching until the second season started. There was so much hype for this show I had to see it myself. From the end of the first episode I was hooked. There are a lot of surprises and I get emotional when watching. Now the biggest issue people have with this show is nudity. It's an adult show. There can be nudity. The people who think it isn't appropriate for TV are nitwits because it's HBO and HBO tends to deal with mature themes so you should know what you are getting yourself into. I find it funny that people say that this is very derogatory towards women. Um yea obviously. This is set in medieval times. Women weren't treated like they are now. It's called being factually accurate. If it was different the haters would nag on the fact that it isn't historically accurate. Secondly, people criticize the violence. Again, medieval times, historically accurate, so on and so forth. Thirdly, people think the acting is bad. I disagree. The acting is superb. Sure it isn't amazing every second, but what show is? Also people think that it ruined the books. No. That's just wrong. Martin wouldn't be executive producer and partial writer on the show if he didn't like it. As long as he is there, he enjoys it. Also I will agree that the original source (the books) are mostly much better because there is a lot more detail and description, like every book that turns into a movie/TV show. People will always complain about that but it is impossible to change. There just isn't enough time in a season to show it all. Also people who complain about the characters being different from what they should be, those are your opinions. That's what YOU thought they should look like. You can't use that as an argument. That's just dumb. This was the artists vision. Martin obviously had a say in who was chosen for the roles and he chose what he thought was the ideal person to match the character. It's his vision and his art so if you have a problem with it, deal with it. I mean sure it has it's flaws but for a TV show it is damn near perfection. Give it a chance. If you like it, great. If you don't, that's OK too at least you tried.</fullReview>

If you are taking it seriously, then you would get to know what the writer wants to convey. THE REALITY of humans! The show is about two clans, 1 in North and other in south. First season deals largely with North clan and there battles with themselves. Main character is a Lord, Eddard Stark, whose family lives in a cold region called Winterfell. There is boundary in the city called as Wall, outside which White Walkers live, supernatural characters. King Robert comes to meet stark and ask for his help and ask him to go with him to his land and set matters right. Ultimately the kings wife gets all the bad work done and be the reason to start a war with the Starks.

		<shortDescription>Game of Thrones is more than a mere TV show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George R.R. Martin's magnum opus, A Song of Ice and Fire, has been adapted into one of the finest television shows in recent memory and is quickly and easily pushing the boundaries of television production and its own network, HBO. Like most HBO productions, the stories are like film serials that show us stories that would be too much any single 2- hour movie to tell. Game of Thrones is a world-encompassing epic of heroes, anti-heroes, magic, bastards and dragons, and the best dwarf on television: Tyrion Lannister.If I were to put to words how to describe this magnificent show, I would say just this one: Grand! Everything about Game of Thrones is masterfully done with hardly any fault. The world of Westeros is incredibly dense and not full of your black-and-white locations in a typical television drama; many of the places are different, sharing their own beauties and terrors, like The Wall, and King's Landing. The same traits can also be said about this show's cast of characters, which is still an ever- growing plethora of protagonists and antagonists to root for or against them. Yet even with this ever-growing patch, you realise in the end that they're all still inhabiting the same world, like a true epic fantasy story does so wonderfully.Game of Thrones is the show of the generation, the magnum opus of the small screen and an unsurpassed world-builder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- Game of Thrones, 2011. Nine noble families fight for control of the mythical land of 'Westeros'. Political and sexual intrigue is commonly used to gain control. Robert Baratheon, King of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard, Lord Stark, to serve as 'Hand of the King', or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous 'Hand' was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate the assassination further. Meanwhile the Queen's family, the 'Lannisters', may be hatching a plot to take power. Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the 'Targaryens', are also scheming to regain the throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses, 'Greyjoy', 'Tully', 'Arryn', 'Tyrell' and 'Martell' leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, 'The Night's Watch', is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors that live beyond.*Special Stars- Cersei Lannister, Tyrion Lannister, Emilia Clarke, Arya Stark.*Theme- Society can protect it's members, when it understands the stakes.*Trivia/location/goofs- TV series. Episodic. Author George R.R. Martin was asked if he had a resolution or ending to the seemingly endless conflict. He replied that the end would be a cloud of dust or snow being driven by the wind across a vast graveyard full of tombstones. Features actors from two different adaptations of The Lord of the Rings: Peter Vaughan, who played Denethor in the BBC Radio adaptation; and Sean Bean, who played the character's son Boromir in the Peter Jackson films.*Emotion- A dark violent Conan-like sword and sorcerer plot with hundreds of lead characters than involve political intrigue and war. Some of the more interesting characters involve woolly mastodons, giants, cannibalism, and zombies with other fantasy races fighting and existing in this human society. You had better seen the first episode and keep watching in order because your understanding of the plot points is counting on this to make sense out of the plot. I was lost and uninterested finally.*Based On- Medieval and renaissance political history of the Dark ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so I just finish watching both season 1&amp;2 wow!!! wonderful excellent movie. So where is season three? my god! how do I get to season 3? As for the story line, it is better than Lords of the ring, don't get me wrong that was a good show too. But this show just make u sit there glued to the TV and not want to get up for fear u would miss something. So I ask again: where is season 3 or the rest of the show?????? The actors must be commended they did a wonderful job, you can see the heart and soul in this movie. Why did EDD Stark have to die so soon??? but why did EDD send his son Jon Snow to the knight's watch in the first place? and how does jon fit into the stealing of the iron throne since every1 wants to steal it, i guess his men of the knight's watch wants throne too</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it, NOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often I see fantasy shows or movies on television, and as an avid reader, set out with very high expectations, hoping the show or movie will live up to the high standards set out by the book. Sadly, it is often the case that the producers have either chosen a bad book (terrible to watch, but easy to make into a production), or a long book (amazing to read, but cringe- worthy when seen on screen). George R.R. Martin's books are perfect in that they are the right size (per book) for a 10 hour series, and that they also contain the right mix of politics, sex and violence as plot devices. Too much politics will result in a boring drama-fest, too much sex results in a story-lacking, poorly made porn film aimed at enticing male viewers only, and too much violence results in a hideous gore-fest that begins to become repetitive and almost boring, making the viewer tired of seeing the colour red. Game of Thrones successfully incorporates all three of these 'touchy' elements into a watchable and incredibly enjoyable television series, one of the best, possibly THE best TV series I have ever seen. Having read all the books, I can safely say that most, if not all the content in the series matches up neatly to the content in the books. The producers don't overdo anything, keeping to what is written and favouring a complex plot in the place of aimless special effects and video tomfoolery. If you are reading this review, unsure of whether you want to devote 70 hours of your life to this series (because once you start, you won't be able to stop until episode 10 of season 7, at which point you'll be crying because the series has ended), I would have to wholeheartedly advocate the series as one of the best you'll ever see. Watch it, NOW.</fullReview>

I don't think the book is very special but the film making is. I give credit to the film director and the crew. I wish they make more TV series like this one. I remember people kept the ratings at 7.5 until the 5 th episode and suddenly lot of fans are born. I was giving this 10 stars from the day 1. The story builds enough tension for you to be very fearful. At the same time some joy. But mostly keep you on the edge. There is few magic around here but mostly this is close to reality.

		<shortDescription>Game of Thrones - A 'to-be' cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is the new epic series from HBO(Flight of the Conchords, Band of Brothers, The Pacific, Entourage). As most productions from this network, high quality and high production value is always on top. Game of Thrones is no exception. Based on the book "A Song of Fire and Ice' by George R.R. Martin.Set in the fantasy world known as 'The Seven Kingdoms', we get to follow the Stark family. They live in a world where Winters can be as long as a lifetime and summers last several years. However, "Winter is coming". However, tales of White Walkers, dead who rises from their graves, used to scare the children might turn out to be true.As the people hurry to prepare for the coming cold, there is a rivalry between the ruling families in the kingdom. The Starks and the Lannisters are long time enemies, only the King's rule have kept them at bay. Lannisters, the riches faction in the kingdom, has claims on the throne. Meanwhile, Eddard Stark rushes to the capital, King's Landing, to help his old friend and the King to ensure the peace is kept. But that might be harder than expected when Lannisters plot for the throne. Tension is high to say the least.A cross the sea, the old ruler, the family Targaryen, also plots for the throne. They allies with the mighty Dothrakie. Together, they march for King's Landing, for war and for the throne. Let the game of thrones begin.There is a lot to say about Game of Thrones - The amazing story, incredible settings and production. The costumes, scenery, dialogs, make-up and CGI. What stands out the most, however, is the cast.Scratch that. Peter Dinklage. This is one of those rare moments in television when you realize that this person has been born with one purpose - To play this part. Like Alan Rickman was born to play Professor Snape, Brad Pitt to play Tyler Durden and Johnny Depp to play Jack Sparrow, Peter Dinklage is so realistic and true to his role it's scary. I am truly glad he won the Emmy. Cudos, Peter!! All in all, it is in many aspects the perfect series. I would have given it a full ten, but I find the Dothrakie(I can admit, I don't know how it is spelled) language annoying. And some of the sex scenes is completely irrelevant. Perhaps they will tone it done till the next season.This is a "Must Watch". So, watch it. And enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great epic fantasy finally comes to television</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although there have been a few tweaks here and there from the first book in the series, everything about the first series of "Game of Thrones" lived up to my expectations and exceeded it. That's what great TV is about. The writers, cast, directors and everyone else have done a superb job with the source material. My only complaint is the second series is also to be called "Game of Thrones". 'A Clash of Kings' needs to be its subtitle or, the series should've been titled after the full name of the novel series 'A Song of Ice and Fire' and then with the subtitles of the different novels beneath. Now, the torture of waiting until April 2012 begins. I have high expectations for series two including the epic skirmish the Battle of Blackwater Bay. That should be a thrill though due to budgetary reasons they may have to whittle it down. Let the "Clash" begin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the bestselling fantasy book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin ? often referred to as "the American Tolkien" ? HBO is betting that fans of The Lord of the Rings will come to this for a sprawling, interwoven tale of feuding families, swords, sex, carnage, beasts, frayed loyalties, deception, intrigue and the pursuit of power. As well they should. Game of Thrones has all the elements (many described above) that lure viewers to shows like The Sopranos, et al. That it's a fantasy series shouldn't scare anyone away, because ? like Lord of the Rings ? there's a real allure to costume-dramas that pair dense mythology with all of the crowd-pleasing elements of war, honor, pride, lust, power and, yes, even humor. Thrones has all of those in spades and supports them with exceptional storytelling, strong writing, superb acting and some stunning visual effects!!!Must watch for everyone!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>like its inspiration material the lord of the rings the game of thrones is much ado about nothing .and here is why, where in lord of the rings the story relied upon magic, luck and eagles saving the day , the game of thrones in itself does not have a real story. characters are introduced in flooding way and all of them seem one dimensional , and here is why. take eddard stark for example, this man is head of an ancient family who have survived so many things , he must have inherited some political savvy eh ? no, he is stupid of course his idiocy is painted as honor. joffrey is pure evil there is no background for him he is just evil, cersei is evil, Jamie is evil, balon Gregory? evil , his children? evil, stark children either cruel and dumb like Robb or just evil like arya, the one that is not evil is related to magic dany ? don't even want to start on that one she is evil , cruel and a hypocrite to the bone i can go on and on but why bother the truth to be told every one in this story is evil and more importantly dumb , like how can tywin lannister a shrewd and calculating politician make so many mistake and create so many enemies? the other thing that bothers me and makes this series unwatchable is the amount of sex and nudity , like how many times do have watch prostitutes of westeros ? how come women have show us their boobs five times in a minutes? what is so appealing about sexual deviance? for me the answer is non. and finally o come back to my starting point, the series ( books and TV series )have no story at all . try to picture it a lot of people have been killing each other and now most of them are dead , so what ? where is the point in that ? and the others or white walkers story is so dumb that can not be taken seriously it seems the writer of the books and the series as well couldn't come up with anything special as major turning event so he went on to right about dragons and ice zombies and people with silver hair and purple eyes and sex .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Each week during "Game of Thrones" season, millions wait until Sunday nights to enter a world full of lust, violence, politics, power, and fantasy. This series is unlike anything ever done in the history of television, captivating audiences across the globe due to its magnificent content, brilliant writing, and highly entertaining medium. "Game of Thrones" is an adaptation of George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" series, a ferociously original fantasy series that twists and turns away from traditional fantasy and creates a more authentic and genuine portrayal of a diverse and creative medieval fantasy universe. Set in Westeros and Essos, two mythical kingdoms, HBO delivers us a world unlike anything. Not only does the network offer groundbreaking visual elements such as CGI dragons, ice zombies, large-scale battles and state of the art costume and production, but they manage to make it feel real. You hardly realize you're watching a fantasy show. You get so engrossed in all the families and characters that it's hard to not care about everyone everywhere during every episode. With phenomenal performances and legendary characters, it's safe to say that there will never be a TV series this amazing ever made. "Game of Thrones" isn't just a show or a story. It's a culture that takes us far away and lets us experience a diverse amount of people in unthinkable locations, yet stays close to home with something everyone can relate to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of, if not the best show on television. Think Lord of the Rings, but in television form, based more in reality and less in fantasy (near the beginning at least), and a lot more unpredictable. When you watch other movies and shows, you can probably tell that Batman, James Bond, and Frodo are all going to live, but with this you never know who will get offed next with main characters dropping like flies all the time.Another amazing thing about this show is its multiple, intertwined story lines constantly putting main characters on edge. If the main character does not feel tension, then the audience will get bored because nothing is happening. Spoiler example ahead! In Season four when Bran is heading passed the wall, he sees his half-brother John Snow on the way, and he has to make a hard decision of whether to go to his brother, who will stop him from going passed the wall, or continue on and ignore Snow. Throughout the scene, the viewer is on edge, waiting to see what Bran will do. Will he give in to the safe feeling family gives him, or will he continue on the dangerous path to find out his destiny?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is an intense, action packed, twisted TV series that goes against all rules of a TV show. Main Characters die left right and center anywhere and at anytime. The unpredictable nature of the show makes every episode intense, that kept me captivated and eager to watch the next episode. The vast array of characters and factions creates good discussion as most of the characters are likable and it is hard to pick favorite. The amount of story lines, characters, places, factions, names, people is huge and always kept me on my toes. To truly understand the story you have to understand the back story as well, which makes it all the more complicated. This is why I loved the show, as there is so much you can talk about, discuss and argue over. Overall I think Game of Thrones is an amazing show, the characters, the plot depth, the action, the interaction and relationships between characters, the character development. Everything about the show is brilliant. The show is captivating, interesting and if it starts to get boring there is always something big about to happen just around the corner. The unpredictability of the show always keeps the viewers on edge, as you don't know who will die next or what will happen in the next episode. I think this is one of the best TV series at the moment with superb acting and one heck of a story line. Overall I give Game of Thrones my tick of approval and I would recommend anyone and everyone to watch it if they haven't already.</fullReview>

I don't get into TV shows that much, but from the time I even heard the name "Game of Thrones", I knew it'd be amazing, because HBO just does an amazing job with shows.This show doesn't hold anything back, sex and violence play a huge part in this masterpiece. The sheer, unflinching brutality of this show brought back a feeling which I only had when I watched Wolf Creek for the first time!If you enjoyed the books, the show is even better. People say that Breaking Bad would have to be the best show on TV, well they musn't have watched Game of Thrones, because all elements that one would look for in a show is here.

		<shortDescription>epic fantasy for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me a couple of episodes to start liking Game of Thrones. Probable reason is that i expected "Tolkien for adults". Well, there's definitely a lot of adults' stuff here, although closer to reality of Middle Ages, if this might apply to a fantasy novel about an imaginary world turned TV show. Since i haven't read the book(s), i was free to enjoy the show as it is.At certain points Game of Thrones might have passed for a historical reenactment. Magic and other fantasy elements were introduced at a slow pace which adds to the realism mentioned above. The production and sets were impressive and the cast delivered and exquisite performance.Overall, Game of Thrones was television's logical answer to Lord of the Rings. Together with the latter title it has set the bar for fantasy films and TV shows very high. I would even say that they've spoiled the audiences. Any new venture in the genre will have to fulfill very high expectations.EDIT after Season 5My enthusiasm waned although the appreciation remains. My recap would be: Good Season 1, solid Season 2, rather eventless Season 3 and somewhat redeeming season 4. Season 5 was an obvious management decision in an attempt to create the most massive cliffhanger finale in the history of TV. There is one for every story line in the show.What became apparent already in Season 3 is what some fans complained about when discussing G.R.R. Martin's writing. There is a clear lack of direction, what some might label narrative fiction. During Season 5 we've reached the end of plots in the books published so far. This, in turn, enabled the writers to write as they well pleased and stretch the audience's attention span until the end of Season 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Done Fantasy Series. A Dramatic Tour-de-Force!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD!This review will only be for the first season of the program, as I haven't yet seen any of the second season episodes; that being said, I think it's fair to review the series based on what i have seen only from the first season.Of late, HBO has scored a sting of victories in the eyes of viewers and critics alike with their original series. If "Game of Thrones" is typical of the HBO original series, then the channel is well worth the premium cost for cable subscribers. "Game of Thrones" succeeds mostly because of its three-dimensional and engaging characters, dark themes, and riveting plot line; the fantasy setting, in my view, is incidental to the series' success, but it is not entirely irrelevant, as the setting provides a framework for an exciting plot involving murder, betrayal, and byzantine court intrigues and power struggles.The series is based on a series of fantasy novels that seem inspired by "The Lord of the Rings" and the general mythos of Middle-Earth, but is far more naturalistic in style than Tolkien's works (for example, the "Game of Thrones" series involves graphic sex and violence, coupled with a grim and cynical tone missing from the more optimistic story presented in "Lord of the Rings"). The setting is located in a fictional world based closely on medieval Europe, and the first season storyline centers around a feudal lord named Eddard Stark. Lord Stark acts as the adviser to an ineffectual king, and is presented with a conflict that forces him to choose between an honorable and ethical course of action, or more pragmatic choices which are not in themselves ethical. The tragic flaw of Lord Stark--which I have read from other online comments about the series-- is his blind allegiance to honor and morality over pragmatism. Stark will invariably follow his conscience in every decision he makes, without viewing the the bigger picture. While Lord Stark thinks he is in the right with his course of action, he unthinkingly steers the kingdom into a disastrous course of events in the long run. This classic irony speaks well of the intelligence behind the creation of the "Game of Thrones" series. Not all viewers will appreciate the dark and cynical themes present in the series, two of which seem to be that "sometimes the ends justify the means" and "good men are no match for those who place power above morality and justice". Nevertheless, many viewers will nonetheless be moved by the tragedy of the series' main protagonist; while I am not going so far as to claim "Game of Thrones" is great literature, the series works because, it, like great works of literature, engages the audience with the believable and palpable tragedy of a powerful protagonist. Other characters also prove compelling, the most notable of whom is the cunning and witty Tyrion Lannister, a member of a rival noble house. Also known as "the Imp" (both for his diminutive stature and his wily demeanor), this character, who is able to use his silver tongue to persuade other characters to get him out of unfavorable situations, has become a fan favorite, and rightfully so. Peter Dinklage, the actor playing Tyrion, breathes life into a character who is able to overcome his status as an outsider in a discriminatory feudal society and become a key player in the politics of the kingdom. While Tyrion's family is defined by their amoral lust for power, Tyrion, while far from being pure-hearted, does seem to abide by a personal code of ethics and morals, although he is much more pragmatic and less rigidly bound by this code than Lord Stark. Not everything about the series is worth praising. While the screenwriters aim for a paradoxically realistic approach in a fantasy setting, they sometimes take it too far with gratuitous T &amp; A (a feature of which many HBO shows are guilty). I understand why some reviewers were disgusted with the excessive amount of graphic sex, nudity and violence displayed on the show, much of which is not necessary to furthering the plot, and seems to be there only to titillate the audience. Unlike "Harry Potter" or even "Lord of the Rings", "Game of Thrones" is definitely not a fantasy series the whole family can enjoy. I would go so far as to say that the soft-core sex detracts from the mature themes and brilliantly-crafted tragedy present in the story.My misgivings about the sex and violence in the series notwithstanding, I find "Game of Thrones" to be a quality work of art, an exception to the banal reality shows proliferating television today. I hope HBO keeps "Game of Thrones" running for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Season is Great. Second Season not so great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The First Season of 'Game of Thrones' is some of the best television I've ever seen. It's as compelling as it is moving. The characters are well fleshed out. Even the villains, as you learn to like them before you learn to hate them. Unusually even the children have a rich, well-developed characters. The stories, actors, story telling and art direction are amazing. I applaud HBO for their guts and commitment to quality in making a TV series to such a high standard. It puts movies to shame, and we get to enjoy it for much longer.The Second Season is a let down. The high-quality production values are still there, but the story grinds to a halt for most of it. Although there is supposed to be a war going on with the Starks winning and the Lannisters losing, you wouldn't know it. Both sides spend nearly all their screen time sitting in camps, talking. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the dialog lacks the power of the First Season. The problem is one of pacing: A lot happens in the last two episodes, but nothing much in the first eight. The story of the Kahlissi and Kahl in the First Season was, to me, touching and epic. When the Kahl finally died I felt I'd spent a lifetime with them. At the end of the First Season as her loyal tribe and knight Jorah knelt before her and the baby dragons, I thought the Second Season was going to be a treat.Instead they wandered around the desert a bit, then headed to a big city to stand around eating nibblies at parties. I wondered who was minding the dragons. And when her Dothraki tribe was eventually slaughtered and dragons stolen, I though, well, duh. There's no convincing explanation for her sudden blinding obsession with claiming the Iron Throne, or why her fierce Dothraki warriors are so easily defeated. It's sad to see such a promising storyline languish.When the awesome men of the Night Watch rode north I was expecting some gripping drama. Instead John Snow gets lost and hangs out with a Wildling chick. The Wildling's were a major disappointment: I imagined them fierce and well, wild, like Celtic warriors or the Picts of Robert E. Howard's Conan series. Instead there is nothing wild about the Wildlings at all. They're too clean, well-spoken, well-mannered and despite being separated from the south for 8,000 years haven't even developed an accent.Some of the characters suffer from the "Idiot in the Attic" Syndrome. After Yoren of the Night's Watch dies so that plucky Arya can escape, she stands there and lets herself get captured. I'm finding Lady Catelyn Stark a little hard to take. She speaks rudely to people whose help she needs, and let's face it: She started this whole war by falsely imprisoning Tyrion Lannister when it was clear to all he had nothing to do with it: 'Who would use their own knife for an assassination?'Perhaps to keep production costs down or not turn off its female fans, there is very little fighting on screen until the Finale. Yet they replace it with, of all things, infanticide. Yes, I know many Royal Families have been historically vile and throughout history it was common place, but it's still disturbing viewing especially if you are a parent. The Second Season isn't all bad by any means and those who stick through to the Finale will be rewarded. The entertaining Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister steps into the role as the lead protagonist. The plotting and machinations at King's Landing are still well told. Rob Stark has quickly grown into a man. Bran despite his young age rises to the challenge of ruling Winterfell fairly and justly in his family's absence. His step family of Osha and Hodor are endearing, as is his relationship with Maester Luwin. The Greyjoy's rebellion is tragic to watch. Game of Thrones is not a series that you enjoy because so much of what goes on is so unpleasant, but it will immerse and suck you into another world for an hour a week.There's enough here to keep you entertained, though the Second Season is not of a standard that will attract new viewers. To be fair, I'm told the problem is with the source material in that the second book on which the Second Season is based is nowhere near the caliber of the first. I only hope with the third series we see Game of Thrones return to it's original high form.First Season: 10 / 10. Second Season: 7 / 10. Third Season: ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know why people complain of too much skin and no plot....so maybe just maybe the sex is too much but it,in no way interferes with the plot or the storyline in such a way that the viewer loses interest in the show, The show gathered up so many unexperienced actors (with the exception of Sean Bean,Lena Headey,Nikolaj-Costau Waldow and Peter Dinklage) and made it one of the best acted and vastly storylined TV shows of all time,following the books written by George Martin (dubbed by many as the successor of J.R.R Tolkien) but if you are a fan of fairy tales this show is not for you. I cannot believe why this show is shut out in almost all the award shows as it obviously deserves to win a lot more awards than it already has as it is THE highest ranked TV series still continuing,along with Breaking Bad (another must watch show) in IMDb. 10/10 an unbelievably awesome TV show</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment, though it falls somewhat short of being a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This HBO series, somewhat reminiscent of The Lords of the Ring in plot and style, is based on the popular medieval fantasy books by George Martin (not the Beatles producer) and is basically about the struggle for power in the mythical Seven Kingdoms between two families, the evil Lannisters headed by the wife of the King, Queen Cersei (a fine performance by Lena Headey) and the more honorable Starks, who rule in the north of the realm, led by Ned Stark (a good turn as well by Sean Bean). There is a third dynasty as well, the Targaryen, related to the previous, murdered king, whose two survivors are the evil, bleach blond Viserys (a magnetic Harry Lloyd) and his beautiful, ethereal sister Daenerys (the petite Emilia Clarke, a revelation in a stunning performance). They live in exile among the savage Dothraki, a race of brutal, nomadic horse riders, and Viserys hope that the marriage of Daenerys with their leader Khal Drogo will help him raise an army of Dothraki to invade the Seven Kingdoms, overthrow the king and put him in charge of the seven kingdoms.The series benefits from some great performances. Besides those I just mentioned, I have to add Peter Dinklage as the sardonic dwarf Tyrion Lannister, brother to the queen, and Jack Gleeson as the insufferable, cruel child heir to the throne, Joffrey. Not all performances in the series are remarkable, though: most of the Starks, especially Ned's sons, fail to make much of an impression.The series has a very good start, then somewhat loses steam in the middle episodes, but rises again in the last two chapters for a rousing finale. I quite enjoyed the series, but I cannot call it a masterpiece. One problem that the many characters and the various, convoluted plots make it confusing at times. Some plot threads, especially the one in the frontier, could have been excised completely and the series would not have suffered. The stunning photography and locations certainly helps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we see what happens when too many people demand that the one hour is filled with the three hours needed. This series has always had one major problem. TOO MANY SUB PLOTS. Distracting the viewer with small titillating aspects of so many lines of plots is maybe the way the books were made but fails terribly in a 40 odd minute TV show. The people who are glued to this like chewing gum to my old boot are being hypnotized not by the quality of the show but by their desperate desire for it to be great and the single biggest event of the year in their entertainment calendar. I am so sorry to tell you that you are being led by the nose down a very boring path and watching this stuff only makes me feel that the efforts are a waste. Sad really because if the scrip and direction were done by people who actually know how to construct a narrative this show could be a real winner. The special effects and the costumes and all that are great but they are empty vessels due to the madness of the producers dictating to the direction and scrip people and the fact that they have very little say in the final product. This is a money making machine and to hell with the story. The real sad thing is how many people are still loving this stuff. Makes me wonder if they are actually able to be critical or just like lemmings and democrats voting for idiots to run the country?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Season 5: Another Heart-Stopping Season</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Game of Thrones's Season 5 comes to an end. Again, HBO proves and demonstrate its power towards creating a very solid TV Series presented in ten episodes. A characteristic of really stands out is the well-done job of the technical aspects, such as the characters's makeup, costumes and the places chosen where the show would be filmed. This season surely is based in the books, but as continues to demonstrate, some stories of the TV show have differences from the books. One particular feature of this season is finally reaches every storyline of the books, except the ones which weren't presented in the series, and even showing some unpublished events. Since the TV Series reached the books, Bran's core is left aside to be showed in the next season. The main cores of this season is Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon Snow, Jaime, Cersei, Arya, Sansa and Stannis.The early episodes have a slow paced. There're a lot of conversation that allows a greater development of characters and the stories, which the show has proved already that it knows how to develop the depths of the characters. In the first seven episodes, violent scenes, fight scenes did happen, but surely the highlights of this season happen in the late three episodes.Sansa's core starts very promising showing the change of nature of Sansa, becoming a stronger woman, unfortunately something horrendous happens to her, breaking her up. The scene where this happens is probably one of the hardest scenes in the entirely series to watch. Arya's core is increasingly attractive and intriguing, due to her story with the faceless men. In Jon Snow's storyline occurs the biggest and coolest fight scene, showing that what everyone should worry about is the White Walkers.A most awaited meeting happen when Daenerys and Tyrion are put in the same room. A scene which has to be highlighted is the passage of Tyrion and Jorah through Valyria, it had such a mystic air. Making in us a desire of get to know more about the past of this world. The dragons's scenes are improving regarding the CGI used, resulting in scenes each time more nail-biting.Much of the Cersei's scenes in the early episodes are talking regarding the rule of the realm, but with the rise of a religion in the citadel, some fear is caused by it and spreads across King's Landing. At the end of the season, Cersei is put in a horrible situation making her do something extremely hard and this scene is in the top-3 scenes of the season. Jaime's core is the one which was really poorly developed. In it had a fight scene that was terrible, it looked so choreographed. Another disappointment of this core was the creation and development of the Sand Snakes, they were so badly constructed in the TV showStannis's core has some interesting scenes, some showing his love towards his daughter, and another showing what he's willing to do to reach and achieve his goal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some characters are not well casted, but the book(s) is/are adapted quite faithfully. An amazing TV series. Watch under any cost!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited but still quite skeptical when i found out that they're gonna adapt one of my favorite books. Book series that is, but Game Of Thrones is my favorite in the series so far. I'm an amateur screenwriter and one day i came to an idea of trying to adapt something since i've already written a couple of original screenplays. I wanted a high task and i wanted it to be a fantasy so i looked for the best fantasy on the internet and everyone said that this is it. And they were right. I read Lord Of The Rings, which is/are amazing, but this is something special and very different from anything i've ever read. All the characters are so well done, the storyline is so interesting with a whole bunch of unexpected twists, and so on... You don't even have a feeling that it's a fantasy while you're reading it. Anyway, it didn't take me long to read the book and understand that it can't be adapted. Into a movie, that is. So i gave up on adaptation, but i continued with reading the series and all i can say is i can't wait for the fifth book! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for the TV series, the book is more or less quite faithfully adapted. Of course, some parts are missing, some unimportant characters thrown out, most of the characters, especially young ones, a lot older than in the books and certain parts a bit changed, though they all still have the same ending, but that was to be expected. The book(s) is/are obviously a lot better, but the TV adaptation is still great. Brilliant. Amazing. Not as amazing as the book(s) but still....&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Certain actors, i must say, really don't fit their roles. Such as Jon Snow, Joffrey Lannister, Theon Greyjoy, Catelyn Stark and even Cersei i'd say, but what can you do. It shouldn't mind to those who didn't read the books. Characters that are well casted are, i think, Eddard Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Arya Stark, Brann Stark, Daenerys Targaryen, Khal Drogo, Tywin Lannister, Gregor Clegane,... There is much more of those who are not good for their roles but most of them are supporting characters so i wont mention them a lot, but the point is that casting should've been done a lot better. Joffrey, for instance, is supposed to be a very pretty kid with full lips an the actor looks like Dennis The Menace with thin lips and the most evil eyes i've ever seen. Really not good for his part even though his character is evil. Jon Snow is supposed to look way younger than the actor who plays him is, just like Sansa Stark and so on. But i guess i can go over those things since the series are really great and i'm just happy that the book(s) are being adapted in the first place.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Watch this series. They are great. Like The Godfather set in a fantasy medieval world. The Sopranos with swords and even better. My recommendation to everyone. And i just wanna say that i'm glad they didn't cut the nudity and brutality out of the series. That would really ruin everything since the books are pretty unmerciful toward it's characters and the story in general. 10 out of 10!!!!</fullReview>

It was horrible and I'll never get this time back. What's the matter with this generation? The hype surrounding this series scares me a lot. No sympathy at all, no memorable characters (because they all die right before they do or say anything memorable). The one and only thing I liked is the camera work. One of the saddest things is to see so many great and talented actors in this senseless series. I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed that this kind of series is so popular. So otherwise I would recommend to stay away from the series - now after watching the whole season - I 'd say : get the f outta here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood Splattered Soft Porn Set in the Middle Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote an Amazon review when I finally got around to watching GoT and ended up with crazed fans coming out of the woodwork to tell me how wrong I was to not like GoT. After watching more episodes because - as GoT fans insisted - I needed to see MORE to understand/like the show - I decided that the GoT is not for me - even if the beatings will continue 'till morale will improve.. Watching more didn't improve my opinion really - it only made me feel nauseated. I felt I was only stating the obvious in saying that there is a lot of pointless gratuitous sex and graphic violence on GoT. For some - that's what they like about the show. For me - it's a needless distraction to what could have been a compelling story.Here is my original review of GoT:As a lifelong geek, I've been hearing a lot about GoT for a while now and had high hopes of it filling the much-needed niche for satisfying story-telling that I came to know and love in such shows as Firefly and the Lord of the Rings trilogy - or at least something intelligent, interesting, creative and well thought out. Visually, Game of Thrones is gorgeous - at least in the initial snow speckled scenes, where you see a group of heavily bundled up guys in a very stark snow scape. Just one look at the costuming and the beautiful filming really sparks any geek to say, "Hey- this might be really good." Knowing that the guy who was Boromir in LoTR is playing a major role also gives hopes and expectations of something really great.The initial scenes where one of the riders stumbles upon a truly grisly scene of carnage is difficult to watch - but at least you get the sense that there is something going on, some kind of mystery - that needs to be solved and the question of just who the White Walkers are is intriguing. So despite the gore, I was initially very much taken in.And that's about where my interest stopped as the first episode devolved into pointless scenes of violence, sex, nudity, more sex - still more sex - to the point where it became a bit absurd and almost dull. So sad to ruin something that could have been epic with a lot of sex scenes that weren't even in the original books. The gore and grisly scenes of beheadings and splatter porn also painfully reminded me of the really horrible rendition of the Hobbit, where something that was written as a kid's story (talking about the Hobbit here) was made into a gory display of constant sword fights and beheadings. It kind of reduces all of human existence to one that is animalistic and somewhat mundane: animals are born, they hunt for and/or find food, they have sex, make other little animals, fight each other for territory (possibly) and die. Fine. But a fantasy that makes it seem like all of human existence boils down to this common denominator (and nothing more) is not only uninteresting and uninspired - it's dead depressing. It also seems such a waste of excellent casting, costuming, cinematographic excellence and a story that might capture my interest - if the makers of the series wasn't so insistent and determined to fill every scene with sex of every sort and violence. All the flying offal and swinging tits really distract from what might have been an interesting story.The first episode of GoT was the most graphic thing I've ever seen - including that time when some college housemates rented a porn movie and that other time when some other friends had a halloween horror movie marathon. At least the gore in those movies had a point and made sense in the progress of the story, whatever story that was and the sex scenes actually were important in the plot - or at least vaguely important for the plot. (It's saying something when the sex and gore in the average horror flick is more meaningful than the sex and gore in GoT.) All the sex and blood splattered scenes of GoT just seem to make the whole thing less believable. It's hard to really get lost in the story and really imagine being there - when every scene is a blood-soaked and sex-filled rampage to the point of being ridiculous. The sex seems less real - because there's so much of it. The gore seems less important - because there's too much of it. The actual story is completely overwhelmed by the heavy-handedness all the sex and violence.If a fellow geek friend were to ask me about Game of Thrones - I would comment that the opening credits were really nicely done - with a sort of steampunk, nanotechnology and clever clockwork building of the map, castles, houses and landscape with these interesting ladders connecting various areas of the map. The opening credits was awesome - far more inspired than the series itself. The music is well done. The casting is brilliant (and would have been amazing - or could have been, if such talent wasn't wasted and drowned out by all the other stuff.) Visually (when every scene isn't blood soaked and/or crammed from end to end with pointless sex and violence) - Game of Thrones is really beautiful - with its gorgeous period costuming and sets and great cinematography. The actual story - the one that I might have been more interested in learning more about, if it weren't for all the gore, guts and grunts - is something I'm sad that I won't get a chance to know without reading a plot synopsis somewhere else. But the actual series just comes off as a porn flick with lots and lots of violence that happens to be set in the middle ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Afraid To Show Feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please note, I haven't read the books.The series has well plotted out stories with political intrigue, warfare, and fantasy elements that spread far and wide through to many characters. Not typical. The ones you think are the "good guys" don't always win. I feel like it's a war story where many different factions are fighting for control of everything, set in the context of a fantasy show.There are almost too many characters and stories. Great if you read the books, and can read one right after another with no time-lag, but this show takes about a year before each next season airs. In the meantime, I forget whom some of the characters are, and what all the story- lines are. Sorry, but I don't spend the downtime watching reruns over and over again. I have a life, bad memory and short attention span. Perhaps I'm to blame, and yet I've seen many, many others say the same.The thing that really bugs me is that the characters don't show their emotions. Afraid to show feelings! It's not the actors/actresses being subtle either. Simply the way the characters are. Many tell sad bitter stories of things that have happened in their past, but do it in a cold distant manner. Tyrion does this. I like it. Suits him. But ALL the characters are like that! It gets tiring.There are no epic love stories. No grand sweeping declarations of love, or expressions of overwhelming grief. Romance is weak. So are the sex scenes. Tepid. If you're going to have sex scenes on a premium cable network, make em hot!There are no delicious villains. I thought Cersei might end up being a deliciously evil villain, but she ended up being just ho-hum. The acting: there is a mixture of stellar, to good acting, to some weak performances by some of the main actors.Final thoughts: Whom do I really care about? It's hard for me to watch and stick with a show if I don't care about anyone. I like Tyrion, Arya, and sort of like Jon Snow. But none, so-much-so, that I shout to myself: "I love this character." I am interested in seeing what happens with Daenerys Targaryen. There has been really good character development with her. I'd like to see how far she gets in her quest to take the throne. I can't say I love this character. Frankly, I find her a little weird, and unfortunately, I find the actress playing her to be one of the weaker performers, which doesn't help. I'm writing this as of the middle of season three. I'm seriously thinking of dropping this from my watch list. Yet I have a mild curiosity to see how things turn out. I admittedly would like the see the Lannisters lose the kingdom. Their dominance and "getting away" with everything is frustrating at times. Yep, would definitely like to see them fall. I think this show must be wonderful for people whom have read the books. I'm happy for them. Maybe someday I'll pick them up for a read, and my perception of the series will improve. 7/10</fullReview>

There is a way to convey the message without overly elaborating it like the show does.Everyone who has a brain and a history book knows that incest, rape, brothels and indecency was rampant back then no need to amplify it in every other scene.I find TV shows now a days exploit sexuality way too much and its a shame because this show has great potential. I would have given it a 9 or a 10 because the acting,scenery, story line is superbe...too bad</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDb and I was honestly so disgusted by this "adaptation" that I had to write this just to let out some steam. Apologize in advance if it's a bit 'ranty' and 'rambley'First let me say, obviously, that I am a fan of the books. I actually had never read them until recently, and with all the hype for years about the show I figured I'd finally see what all the fuss was about. But I had to read the source material first; like I said, love the books. Martin has built a kind of Tolkienesque world more at a human level with a dark and black/white/gray grittiness you normally get from something by Joe Abercrombie or Mark Lawrence. But hey, not talking about the book here, talking about the "show".Like I said, I was super excited to watch this show. I had heard it was very faithful to the books and that the acting was amazing and the effects over the top and it was the second-coming-of-the-lord- of- shows and yadda yadda, it's amazing, right? As I read certain scenes in the books: such as Danny going through the House of the Undying, or Lord Beric fighting Clegane with a flaming sword I couldn't help but to imagine the bad-assery in my head and couldn't wait to see it on screen. Yet after watching a few episodes I just had to say, WTF! Okay, the Wights and Others looked amazing and I was very excited from the get-go, (not necessarily the exact adaptation of the book but artistic licence is okay sometimes). Awesome way to start off the show! Aaaaand that was about the only great thing I found about this over-blown, terribly acted, big budgeted, softcore-porn POS. Words cannot describe how utterly disappointing and just plain gross this show is. The acting is good by a few characters, I'm a big Sean Bean fan and couldn't have imagined a better Eddard Stark and most of the characters look faithful enough and close to what I imagined so that's fine. (Jon Snow though -_- looks like he should be lead singing in One Direction, not a bad-ass Wight Slaying Black Brother that can ride for days with a seeping arrow wound. But I digress...) Anyways most look great until they open their mouths... Did I say terrible acting? Well I'll say it again, the acting mostly is on par with one of those monthly Syfy exclusives (Sharknado anyone?)And I know that adaptations rarely if ever stay %100 true to the source but man this is taking it to another level. Things they change just for the hell of it make me wonder if they even read the books. Arya being good at shooting a bow from the start for example, when the Arya from the book mentioned many times how she wished she could learn to shoot. What reason was there to change that?? Just a small example, but the show is riddled with the small slaps in the face like this so you get my point. Not only these small changes but huge story altering changes as well. I understand sometimes budgetary issues get in the way of certain scenes but for the love of God don't puss out and re-wright everything just for the seeming what-the-hell of it. Oh and I hear they're bringing Ned back to life in Season 6, nice job fellas! Haven't seen writing this good since my mother used to force me to watch Guiding Light as a child.I won't go into detail about every little thing that disappointed me about this show because I would be writing all night and no one wants to read a hundred page rant. I just think that this show gets waaaaayyy too much credit and acclaim.I'll finish by saying: If you like the books, avoid this one. Ever read Eragon? Ever watched that movie? Well that was Pulp Fiction and Lord of the Rings and The Godfather compared to this utter garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reading or watching?...Reading definitely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot understand why this series is so successful. I guess it's only because of the violence, sex and nudity displayed plainly within that draws people to watch it. The story of the whole concept is nothing they care about. First of all, the title is wrong. "A Game of Thrones" is only the name of the first of the seven books of the heptalogy of "A Song of Ice and Fire". Maybe it sounds a bit more attractive, yes, but it's not the title it should bear. The most annoying thing about it all is that the characters are much much OLDER than they actually should be, twice the age and also not captured well. E.g. Joffrey Baratheon has become one of the most hated characters, but if you read the books, you may know there ARE equally vile characters in the story, if not worse. He shouldn't be more than 13, but in the series it is a 23 year-old lad who portrays him. Daenerys should be 15, yet in the series she is a 30 year-old woman. And so can I go on and on. Sean Bean as Eddard Stark? Really? He would be my last choice and Arya was supposed to be skinny... Second, why so much nudity and sex? I do not claim that in the books there isn't mentioned how characters are having sex, but it gets lost among thousands of other more important and interesting and more described adventures, and it's purpose is just to make a background and show us the nature of some of the characters. The books are NOT about brothels, the word "brothel" is just mentioned. All I want to say - if you read the books, why should you spoil your imagination by watching this? Let yourself immerse in the great prose of George R. R. Martin and let the series for those who prefer watching this horribly made adaptation over reading and letting their imagination free. My only question is how could Martin consent to such an adaptation of his fantastic books?</fullReview>

GRRM is a brilliant writer and has created a world many people love. Weiss/benioff have taken his amazing source material and rewritten it very poorly. Changing story lines to point that make little sense. Changed characters personalities and arcs. Killed off characters who still play a huge role in the books. And most importantly taken GRRMs amazing dialogue and replaced it with poorly written garbage. I know books have to be changed for screen but a complete rewrite is ridiculous. Could've just wrote your own story and left westeros alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An event that extrapolates completely the television media.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the root the most extraordinary story written in the last half century, Game of Thrones can now be considered a single event in television history, and one of the most epic unique moments of popular culture. With a unique production and performances mostly superb, HBO has managed to create something that goes beyond all barriers of television media. Characters without Manichaeism in a world without heroes incontestable. A complex and fascinating universe filled by intricate political intrigue. A real lesson of geopolitics, military science and political science. Apart from all the credits due to the mind of George R. R. Martin, we can never forget the brilliant work of creators that, every year, in a space of six months, can produce ten episodes of such high production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review for the Game Of Thrones series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is a fantasy/drama series produced by HBO and was first released in 2011. It has quickly grown to the most watched television series. It's adapted from George R.R. Martin's series A Song Of Ice And Fire. There are 5 seasons to date and the sixth is set to be released April 2016. Seventeen years prior to when the series began, Lord Robert Baratheon and Lord Eddard Stark start a civil war to unseat the Targaryen Mad King. They succeed and Robert rules as king ever since, but the series opens when his rule is starting to be undermined by other factions. On the other side of the world, two Targaryen royals have grown into adults and are planning to return to their kingdom and take the iron throne. While betrayal and civil war are becoming very real, to the North, Jon Snow (Lord Eddard Stark's bastard son) has joined the night's watch and lives on The Wall, a seven hundred foot wall of ice that borders the north, defending the realm against wild men and white walkers (Literally SNOW ZOMBIES). The main themes for the series are, a struggle for power, violence, the corruption of money, and loyalty.First things first, Game Of Thrones is meant for an adult audience. There is a lot of swearing, a lot of sex, and most of all, a lot of violence scenes that either made me look away, or made me feel sick. However, these things are what make Game Of Thrones such an amazing and enticing show. First of all, Game Of Thrones is big on politics. You will constantly be rooting for certain characters, trying to predict what will happen, and you will feel so close to the action. Only to find out that next episode, your favorite character dies, the complete opposite of what you thought would happen, happens, and as you feel so close, you're ripped away due to a despicable antagonist who has no heart. Game Of Thrones make politics almost romantic. There is one rule in Game Of Thrones. DO NOT get attached to a character. This show is ripe with death. Game of Thrones is brutal. Frow literal jaw dropping moments, to gut wrenching scenes, the blood and gore is plenty. From majestic sword fights, to pulse racing execution scenes, you will always be on the edge of your seat. One thing that this show does, is it makes you uncomfortable. Not in a way that makes you want to stop watching, but in a way that makes you feel like you're in the same situation as the characters.An upside and a big downside to Game of Thrones is that it can be a frustrating show. There are some brave and fierce characters, however, other characters (Like Sansa and Aria Stark) seem to never do anything useful but get captured or end up screwing other characters over, Your favorite characters are sometimes left out of an episode, and characters choose to keep important information from each other that could end situations quickly. However, this happens in most TV series and just goes to show what great writing and acting is put into the show.Game Of Thrones has, and will be one of the most popular TV series for a long time, and for good reasons.The show is beautiful, complex and rewarding as well as most of all, entertaining. As we wait for more seasons to come out, if feels as though winter is coming. . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent Norse to English adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loving this new twist of old Norse stories adapted to the medievel era. Some characters are though much more boring than than the Norse characters, for example Cersei and Jamie. Sigmund and Sigi, the incestuous twins that have a child(Sinfjotli) that murders the king and his children. After this leaves his mother queen and sinfjotli eventually is poisoned. This is one of many examples on exactly who the characters in the series are based, not to mention that the entire story is Ragnarok. White walkers, dragons and a very well placed Loki in the form of petre baelish . If Baelish didn't exist stark never goes to kings landing,john Aryan lives, cersei and kids die along with daenarys and etc. One of the funnest aspects of the whole series is the way it hints as to what will happen next. For example the irony of tyrion telling oberyn you could at least wear a helmet or theon saying he will look like a eunuch. Although i enjoy the series the books are well worth the read as the series does edit much of what it considers filler out. I enjoy the banter of the characters in the books more than i do in the series and of course my favorite parts are almost never put in the show. While the last season strayed further away from the books I'm happy to see it go in that direction and leave more surprises for us fans. Unfortunately its Norse roots makes it a story I've read before with more profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best show ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The series is now on the 6th season. This is the first time the readers are at a loss at what will happen next as the book series ended at about the same point as the HBO 5th season left everyone. This is the first time that HBO is coming up with all of their material as original work with some help from George R.R. Martin, himself. So this is the really the first time we actually see the creators of the HBO show stand alone in creativity with nothing to really go off of... and they are doing an AMAZING job! I think fans were skeptical at the split. Many figured that the successful books were part of the reason the show was so good, but this season is easily proving all of that wrong. The twists and turns so far are exhilarating and seem to kind of follow the fans' inspired theories. (No spoilers!) The acting is still incredible and watching the series is like stepping into a whole other world. HBO did a great job in its casting and the scenery is always gorgeous. I am personally looking forward to everything having to do with Bran. But all of the characters and their own sets of drama are what keeps me watching religiously every Sunday at 8:00pm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard a lot of people say this was good. I put of watching it for months and wish i never. It is the best series i have ever watched ever i love it. It takes a while to remember all the names of people and to remember who they are working for. Do not watch it if you do not like blood and violence because there is a lot and don't watch if easily offended as there is a lot of sexual content in every episode nearly. I must say it has a excellent story line and keeps you wanting more and more every episode. Some characters you grow to love and some you really hate them and i mean hate But that comes from the superb acting. Game of thrones is fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all - if you're hesitant to whether or not you should see it, I'm telling you to watch it, but you gotta give it at least 3-4 episodes before you're in. There is a lot of different character ans stories going on so you have to give it a chance. I my self got stuck after the first episode, probably because I'm an actor myself and can tell when a story is good. (does that even make sense?)Anyway, this is one of my favorite shows ever. I've always liked this time period, and I got stuck after watching the first episode, and I've been ever since. It's rare to find shows that are as well made as films since they're under a lot of time and money pressure. This is for anyone who wants a lot of great visual effect, action, and cat-and-mouse game and brilliant storytelling. Words to describe this show: bloddy violence, intrigue, epic, evil, sward fight,I give it 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The storyline feels like something you need a Wikipedia page to follow. It's the stuff of fantasy geek heaven, i.e.a strongly gritty period drama with letter-perfect clothes, weapons and lingo, yet unencumbered by historical facts or the weight of real events. Of all the sword- flinging series which are on TV right now, Game of Thrones is by far the best ? cloaking a clever commentary on modern day political conniving with a gray Medieval-age story which feels like Rings' older, sexed-up brother. The main accomplishment of Game of Thrones is in that, while it should keep the hard-core fans satisfied, even viewers who don't care if Theon is a Greyjoy or a Tully can have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible, great show, but sometimes a little bit too bloody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That "Game of Thrones" is one of the best show which has ever been produced for TV, can't barely be denied, even if there are also many people who cannot really understand that opinion. It seems to be a matter of taste. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the incredible brutality which takes place regularly on screen, sometimes seems to be a little bit exaggerated. Of course it makes the show even more thrilling and fascinating. But I would say, you can also make a good TV-show without that amount of blood. There are enough others which proved that. I think the reason for the producers to use so much blood, is that they wanted to separate from other medieval fantasy shows. And they succeeded.But nonetheless, despite of the maybe appropriated critique, the show still is most likely one of the best ones I've ever seen. Of course, the show is definitely nothing for the faint-hearted people, but for all the others it is clearly worth to watch it, if you haven't done that so far.I hope there are not too many mistakes in my text. If there are, I'm sorry, but I'm no native speaker.</fullReview>

As its best, the every single season is completely unpredictable and meticulously detailed in its orchestration of pain and agony.

		<fullReview>The first time I watched this show I was stunned! It is just so good! I have watched all the episodes, and I still can't believe how detailed and complicated this show is! GoT doesn't dumb things down, or make them simpler so anyone can understand. You have to really get into the show, and most of all, expect the unexpected. In this show, nothing is obvious, nothing is as it seems. Main characters are killed, dreams are ruined, and most unusual alliances are made. Don't have a favorite character because - Surprise, surprise, he's dead in the next episode,and so is his wife, and mother, and unborn child, and even his pet! Yeah, I'm talking about Robb Stark. The show is also very detailed, has good special effects and CGI, and watching this show you'll get sucked right into a new world full of new places to explore, people to meet and kill, and cultures and languages to learn! Watch this show, and expect the unexpected, but be warned, you'll be suffering from heartbreak in a few episodes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful design, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps one of the best shows in TV, sponsored, obviously, by HBO. The movie-scale production is magnificent. From the smallest costume to the biggest set, it is entirely faithful to the books. The cast performances are, not only true to it's characters, but to the book design they have. I must say, however, that while season one was narrowly perfect, season two felt different. Perhaps it is because season one was, without considering minor details, completely faithful to the first book, while important plot elements where altered from the second book in the TV adaptation. The show creators have previously stated that they are not adapting "A Game of Thrones", "A Clash of Kings" and the other three books as each, but rather as the whole series "A Song Of Ice And Fire" which gives them freedom to move scenes and important elements. Yes, it gives them freedom to do so, but it does not give them freedom to change the story plot. They have also stated that character introduction is another reason for the changes. Perhaps this one I can live with, for in the second book there are at least thirty new characters, ten at least very important. Still, it's not impossible. Look at Boardwalk Empire! It has more characters than I can think about right now, and although Steve Buscemi's Nucky Thompson is the central character, almost every other character has it's own history. No matter what they say, in the second season, small changes like the introduction Meera and Jojen Reed where acceptable, but the changes made in the stories of Theon and especially Daenerys where just out of place. For Theon's story, there is one key character which is only mentioned, and not even by name. I seriously hope that this character is introduced in the next season because not only Theon's, but at least three other character's story is affected in the future by said character. Daenerys story changes really made me suffer to watch season two. Xaro Xhoan Daxos becoming King of Qarth? Daenerys'dragons kidnapped by Pyat Pree? And as in Theon's story, at the end of Daenerys story in the book there is at least one EXTREMELY IMPORTANT character who makes an appearance, yet in the adaptation, he was nowhere to be seen! This changes really made Daenerys story impossible to watch. No matter how good your adaptation is, or how many viewers you have, you just don't pull out important characters! Perhaps because I really loved the books is why I disliked so much this changes, but still, I hope they correct some of them in the next season, or, more precisely, I hope the creators stay truer to the books. Ignoring all of that, this is a must-see for Fantasy hard-core fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had originally gave it a 5 rating, but it does get much better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching this at the recommendation of a friend. I have to say at first, I did not see what all the fuss was about. In the opening scene I thought- this is going to be good, only to follow the majority of Season One being consistently disappointed, bored , and hoping for it to get better. I only kept watching because,asides from rave reviews, and a fabulous cast, I did enjoy the stunning scenery, and actually recognized some of the non-CGI'd landscapes from my childhood, as some scenes were shot where I grew up. All the scenery, however, is amazing- and I find myself totally drawn into this fictional land as a result. I will say though that it took me the most of season 1, to get a feel for the show, and while it was really slow for me at coming together, the first season ended with everything that I was hoping for. I never read the books that led to this screenplay, but if the screen adaptation is anything to go by, I would imagine that it would be like one of these books that you have difficulty getting into, but once you do you absolutely can't put it down. I'm just beginning season 2 , and am very glad I didn't give up on this show. Hat's off to the brilliant acting from the cast- even with the slowness of Season 1 , their amazing talent still shone through and were another reason I stuck with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most boring major show ever -- I gave up during season two -- nothing was happening, and the entire story is just like a bloodthirsty medieval royal family, France to be exact, where he got the idea, from series of historical French novels taking place in the 13th century.. The only thing making it "modern" or a fantasy is apparently a dragon, which never appeared while I watched.. then a friend said that big wall in the wilderness was to keep out zombies? unreal - how trivial, and unimaginative.. when you want vapid fans to flock to see it, add vampires or zombies or both.. Lowest common denominator stuff, just made with big money... I don't have a decade to spare to wait for this to unfold more violence and greed, that's been done so often that there's nothing illuminating or cathartic in it for me, but apparently it's new to people who are probably new to life itself, like those under 30..My hope is that before finishing the book series or the TV show, George Martin will suddenly die, that would be appropriate.. his SF writing is much better to me, like Sandkings.. check it out..I give it five on production values alone, and Peter Dinklage's acting, but he's better in The Station Agent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am fan since 2012. Right now in my early 20s, I remember here in London what was happening about this TV show. I had heard that it contained a lot of sex and violence. However, i gave it a shot to see if it was truly so good. After I watched the first episode, I was literally amazed by what had happened. But as the story progressed, and i was shocked for the first time with Ned Stark's death, I understood that it was serious business. The acting is superb even by young actors and actresses that are just in their teenage years. After the first season, I learnt that the series are based on book series. I picked them up, read them and they were absolutely sensational. But, we are here to review the show and not the books. So, the struggle for power and survival makes the show a joy to watch. Surely, some people may not like the violence for anything else that is included in the show, but is surely worth watching and should be considered as one of the best TV shows of all time.</fullReview>

No doubt why people like Game Of Thrones. The things that I like about the show is the way it's been showed to all of us the character representation as if they are real life, the power struggle and on a short note it teaches many things about life. Many dialogues are everyday's quotes. The show has near to perfect assembled cast. The things that I didn't like about the show is that amount of nudity they are showing which is unnecessary and irrelevant to the story. Secondly, the writers and makers include The author Itself George RR Martin, even though they are not following the book.

Indeed, the characters on "Game of Thrones" seem to have no aim except to fight for control of Westeros. It is as though their quest for prestige has become an excuse to spend eternity fighting.I should note that this show is not for children. It's one of the most violent shows that I've ever seen. Seriously, they leave little to the imagination. I've never read the books on which the series is based, but the series doesn't dumb anything down (understanding of course that it's fantasy).Having just binge-watched the first season, I recommend the show.

		<fullReview>I watched the first two seasons On Demand, then I decided to read all 5 books. I loved the books, but after season 4 I'm convinced that the show is better. The casting of each character is perfect, particularly for Oberyn Martell and Brienne. Peter Dinklage is terrific and Emilia Clarke is sex on wheels. There is a lot of turnover in the casting and I miss some of my favorite characters, but that's just the story. Seasons 1 and 2 were superb, season 3 dragged a tiny bit and season 4 was the best of the series so far. Largely because of Oberyn Martell. The show deviates from the book plot a little bit, and just about all of them actually improved the story - filled some holes with a sensible change. Grand slam home run, HBO. There are a ton of great HBO shows and this is the crown jewel. HBO series beat the crap out of 99% of the movies you're going to find in the theaters now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible show ... a little to fast paced though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire book series for years but never got around to reading it. When they announced the HBO show I was excited because I had a lot of friends who read the books.But when I actually started watching the show, I actually found it frustrating to watch. There were too many characters with too much backstory that seemed to go unexplained. I felt like the show was moving at a breakneck pace and wasn't catering to the non-book readers at all. By the end of the fourth episode, I gave up. It was too confusing. I couldn't keep track of it all and I felt like the show was moving too fast.Sometime later, a friend urged me to give it another chance. He lent me the blu-ray of season one and told me to watch the special features that went into the background of the show. After watching that, it clicked with me. I re-watched the first four episodes and loved them a lot more. After that I was hooked. I quickly got caught up with the series and found myself eagerly awaiting season 3.I started reading the books around that time and only just recently finished book 5. I have to say that the books are even better than the show! While the show is great for its fast paced plot, great acting and stunning visuals, the books take a little more time to flesh out the characters, go into the backstory, and spend a little more time with exposition.The main problem I have with the show is that it's too fast paced. You have to really pay close attention because if you miss one line of dialog, it's easy to get lost. This was why I gave up when I initially watched it. The show would benefit from the use of flashbacks and a longer season (13 episodes seems perfect). Or maybe just take a bit more time for character dialog to allow for more exposition. I know some people might complain that there's "too much talking" already, but I'm not one of those people who needs action all the time in my shows and movies.That being said, once you understand what's going on, the show is excellent and highly addictive. It's the best ongoing show on television right now. Definitely watch it, and if you get lost, take a break, watch some of the History of Westeros featurettes from the blu-ray (also on youtube) and try again. It's definitely worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(I will speak only for the first season, to prevent any spoilers)Game of Thrones from HBO is not your parent's "fantasy." It is dark, gritty and is utterly realistic. It is a fantasy story that could only be done, one place...HBO.The story it tells the sweeping. It has a cast of characters that literally goes into the thousands. Even the "main" characters are quite plentiful. It is an ensemble cast at its best. And what a cast they have. HBO has collected some of the very best actors to play in this wonderful new series. Eddard Stark: Sean Bean Cersei Lannister: Lena Headey Tyrion Lannister Peter Dinklage Peyter "LittleFingers" Baelish: Aiden GillenThe First season of game of Thrones on HBO closely follows the first book in the series by George RR Martin. The story may begin to spin away from the plot of the books,but reports have it that the first season stays fairly close to what was written. Martin has a habit of killing of major characters if the plot calls for their demise. This means that when you favorite character is in peril, that peril is dire. They may live...but they might not. You certainly have the right to fear the outcome when thing go a little pear shaped.If you are not reading and/or watching this series: you should be.Thank you for Reading! Have a nice day!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk of Punishment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the introductory episodes out of the way, and nearly all major narratives firmly established, this week we were treated to an especially raucous, brutally violent, and at times laugh-out-loud funny installment of a show that is already known for its violence and dark humor."Walk of Punishment," which could easily describe most of the events of books three and four in one succinct phrase, kicked things into high gear with our first big jaw-dropping moment, as well as not one, but two near rapes. It's overall a sprawling, but enjoyable episode which keeps the momentum going that was built in the previous two entries for the most part, aside from a few scenes in King's Landing that dragged mostly due to lack of real conflict at the moment.So looks like I was wrong last week in saying we had met all the characters, when there was still Edmure and The Blackfish to be seen. How could I forget Blackfish after his two-season absence? And what better way to introduce such a beloved character from the books. Pushing aside Edmure after he fails to light the floating funeral pyre three times, Brynden "Blackfish" Tully makes short work of the matter when he fires a flaming arrow directly into the boat as it drifts into the distance, without even a glance back to see if it hits; the Medieval version of walking away from an explosion. Obviously, this is a man you want on your side. As we see in the meeting between Robb and Blackfish, he is a much more respected figure than Edmure, Robb's uncle, despite his status as the black sheep of the fish-sigiled family (thus the nickname, in case it wasn't clear). Later, Catelyn and Blackfish discuss the recently deceased Hoster Tully, whom she cries over. It's harder to connect emotionally to the death of someone we've never seen on screen or interact with Cat before, but when it becomes obvious that she's grieving more for the situation that she's put her own children into by leaving them the way her father left her, it's a much more gripping and heartbreaking scene.Meanwhile, back in King's Landing, the small council has gathered to discuss affairs of state, beginning with a humorous chair shuffling scene, depicting more of Tyrion's satirical wit to the exasperation of the no-nonsense Tywin. And with the shuffling of the chairs so comes the shuffling of titles; Littlefinger is off to woo the widowed Lysa Arryn (Catelyn's not-quite-all-there sister) leaving Tyrion to take charge of the royal coffers. A bit of a demotion from Hand of the King, but at least he still has power, and after the emotionally crippling talk with his father in the first episode, it's a sugar-coated bitter pill. Tyrion also gives us the funniest scene so far this season when he decides to reward his faithful squire, Pod, for saving his life in the Battle of Blackwater Bay. Being that it's Tyrion, naturally Pod is rewarded with three working girls, which fills Game of Thrones' weekly nudity quota. However, when Pod returns from the brothel and lays the gold to pay the girls on his desk, Tyrion and Bronn are hilariously in stunned awe, and demand to know the details of Pod's first real and, by all imagination, miraculous conquest.In a bit of fun for readers of the books, we're treated to a boisterous rendition of 'The Bear and the Maiden Fair' by Jaime and Brienne's captors, while the odd couple are literally bound to each other. In yet another smart move by the show runners, the list of important names has been shaved in an attempt to be kind to viewer's brains, but readers may be a little miffed at the absence of Vargo Hoat and his Bloody Mummers, when their appearance is so memorable. At least now that they're in the same dangerous boat, Jaime seems to be opening up to the female knight in a small way, when he gives her genuine advice on what to do when the captors rape her. Uh? baby steps? To read the rest (IMDb form too short) visit: custodianfilmcritic.com/game-of-thrones-3-3-walk-of-punishment/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastically alive adaptation - rich, violent and good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gloriously big, classy, brave, sexy and violent production of George RR Martin's extraordinary "Game of Thrones" saga. The show benefits incalculably from the now-familiar HBO approach (lots of tits, lots of gore, great acting by heavyweights - lots of Brits, yay! - amazing scenery and set design, costumes, the lot), and it creates more vivid tableaux-vivants from Martin's wonderful source material than anyone, it seems, thought possible. Right down to the beautifully intricate steam punk opening credits, this is a whole show, thought through consistently and presumably costing an absolute fortune to make. The writer whose books have sold in the tens of millions deserves no less, but it was still surprising to see scenes take place on screen that matched so completely those that had occurred in my imagination when reading the books.The script is snappy and clever; characters scheme and fight, and face bigger, scarier threats than knights' swords. Almost every actor with a speaking part performs excellently. There were just one or two that seemed a trifle weak to me; for example, Lena Headey, beautiful in her huge blond tresses, corrupt as sin, but strangely lacking in commitment to her lines. I was initially disappointed by Emilia Clarke as Dany, and her story among the Dothraki - and by her Khal, clearly chosen for his man-mountain status and stripped of dialogue - may as well have been Chewbacca. But I warmed to Dany as the series went on, and her final appearances in Series 2 were truly powerful. Good on her. "The Imp" gets all the best lines, as indeed Peter Dinklage deserves - a great, once-in-a-lifetime part.Speaking as an anti-Lord-of-the-Rings person, I would say that the whole thing is great, great stuff. Please, go out and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of thrones is one of the best TV shows ever made.It is in the leauge of Breaking Bad which is also incredible. What makes it such a good show is the vastness of it. Its a huge setting, huge cast and huge plot with so many twists and turns. The acting is amazing and you start to relate to certain characters on a personal level. The graphic violence and explicit sex just add to the perfection of the show.Short review but please start to watch Game of Thrones because you will not be disappointed. Forget big brother and CSI, this is the real thing! 10/10. Also you may wish to read the books before hand but its not imperitive. The books are quite breath taking though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing but brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the fantasy genre, I knew this series would be right up my street, and I was in no way disappointed. The intertwining story arcs tell a compelling story, in which there are no definitive goodies or baddies, although British viewers might pick up on the annoying pattern whereby the more northern somebody's accent is, then the more likely they are to be noble (and will also be a bit confused at how people in the same family can have randomly acquired Manc, Scouse or Geordie accents?). Also, despite the fantastic sets, you do sometimes feel a bit short-changed with the visuals. Viewers groomed on the visual splendour of the likes of the lord of the Rings may feel a bit let down by the made-for-TV feel of supposedly epic scenes. Rather than fearsome armies, most of the troops and 'battle' scenes sometimes don't fool us into believing we are watching anything other than what they really are, namely a small group of extras on horses and holding cardboard shields in a field in Northern Ireland. And the sex? I love a bit of porn as much as the next man, but in GoT it does sometimes seem a little gratuitous. In one scene, where Bran is talking to the wild woman, a naked 'giant' appears from the bushes, before he is told to go and put some clothes on and runs off. What on earth did that have to do with the story other than the chance for us to see another penis? And it does get very confusing at points. The first episode introduces so many different characters that when it gets to the key scene at the end, I was so lost that I had no idea who the two people were in the tower, let alone that it was a queen having sex with her brother. The series does a great job of explaining everything, but even so, for those like myself who never read the book, it's hard to follow who the various hangers on in the court in the south and the seemingly eternal string of Stark siblings are. Names like Jaime, Theon and Tyron keep cropping up, but it all happens so fast that the less informed viewer ends up not having a clue who they are talking about. But these gripes aside, what a terrific series and I can't wait for the second. Unlike so many series, in this one it really is hard to see what's coming, helped by the fact that a number of central characters get killed. In GoT, you never feel the dramatic tension lost because you know there's no way so-and-so is going to be killed. I was dreading a similar fate would befall Daenerys ? one of the most delightful pieces of eye candy ever to appear on TV. And the underlying message for me at least is how so many real battles were fought not for the good of the people but to satisfy the whims of royalty. It is the growing threat from north of the wall that these people should really be worrying about, but instead they continue to shed blood in the name of their petty family feuds. A nice allegory for how the world today sees nations vying with each other rather than fighting for the things that really matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I don't say this show sucks, but it sucks hard comparing to the books.This show began with a great potential, until they started to be unloyal to the book series.I personally think that the relations, wars, etc. are well told in the books, however, they decided to change these in the TV series (which I don't know why), they started by not even mentioning really important parts, they also started creating new stories which are stupid comparing to the ones within the book. And the new story they created is really became dumb.I cannot believe how George Martin let them to ruin a masterpiece like this.All I ever wonder about this show is why did they decide to ruin this story by changing it this much (and changing it with untalented scenario writing), instead of writing/creating a new story,not related to GOT.My beliefs for this series are similar to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, which was ruined in a similar way. Those movies were not bad either, but Jackson changed the story too much, and it led me to think the same - why ruin this one and not create a new goddamn story not related to Hobbit?I simply cannot understand. If they stood loyal to the books in GOT (I admit it's impossible to stay loyal %100, but I'd expect at least not changing the story), it'd be a great, I mean really great show.But now, it has become only a "good show".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violence, gore, sex and swears. And an engaging plot, too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start out by saying I've never read the books. I've been told repeatedly that I should, but thus far I've never taken the opportunity.The very first episode of this show featured gore, death, violence, bad language, nudity, sex and incest. But, luckily, also had a strong plot and some very engaging characters. And throughout the four series that have been shown to date, nothing much has changed. It's still packed to the gunwales with all the same sort of action and each of the key characters' plots progress nicely and, to a varying degree, with some realism within the realm of the environment.I do have a few issues with the series, though. Firstly, the Lowest Common Denominator facets of sex, nudity, violence and swearing are a bit much at times. It's definitely uncomfortable viewing with your mum, I would expect! Secondly, some of the story lines seem to either drag along or peter out without any real crescendo. Granted, it's probably more realistic that some situations just play out with little consequence, but occasionally you'll follow a storyline that really engages you, just for it to tail off disappointingly without any real conclusion. Thirdly, some of the story lines that drag on are now becoming a bit difficult to untangle from the newer plot-lines. Apparently, this is a fault with the author and not the script writers, but it does make some episodes dull and others a bit hard to follow.But on the plus side, there's some really good characters who are hugely engaging. The Lannisters, as horrible as they are, are all strong and played well by their respective actors. With the exception of Tyrion, who is different because he's not horrible, just Machiavellian. I actually find myself rooting for him when he's in bother because he's such a brilliant part and played to perfection by Peter Dinklage. Screen Junkies say he's down to play every cool dwarf part until he dies or Warwick Davies kills him, and they're spot on with that. But even outside of this key family, the parts are very well played.And the most intriguing part is that, even with the backing of HBO and the clearly US levels of funding it has, it's actually a British programme! It makes me proud to see that our little nation can still produce such incredible shows, and yet sad that we need our American cousins to fork out for them because we're too busy churning out crappy reality shows.</fullReview>

I put him in the class of Jason Issacs of Braveheart and Alan Rickman as Sheriff of Notingham in the Kevin Costner Robin Hood movie. He does such despicable acts with the glee and enjoyment much like Alan Rickman. I would love to see him do many different roles, to display talents for all types of films.

The actors excel in every scene and the story keeps you glued to the TV. It is really the best series i have ever seen, it has action and the storyline is great. It's difficult to describe how good it is, the scenarios are deep and bring us to forget day to day life. It is way better than a Lord of the Rings version series, it's story is richer and more compelling, has less action, but it's story compensates. I compare it with Battlestar Galactica or Stargate Atlantis, that were well written and produced, but i think this one could be better. Pros: Actors, Storyline , well produced, action! I think the producers prove themselves as genius not in movies but only in series, as it is a lot more difficult to keep a great audience for a long time, and this one could be one of those!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The realism is scary with the attention to detail in the sets and locations. Its easy to see no money was spared in conveying a sense of the middle ages. Some will be turned off by the male and female frontal nudity, cussing and not so authentic, supposedly middle ages script. In fact, in some scenes it seems you might be over hearing a conversation on the London Tube or NYC Subway, and I'm only slightly exaggerating. Even with these drawbacks Game of Thrones is still a wonder to behold. I've just recently acquired, via loan, from my public library the Seasons 1 &amp; 2. For those of us of common lineage, unable to afford an HBO cable connection that is, its a smart way to play. Even if one has to wait for these DVD discs to see them, its well worth the wait.</fullReview>

It is obviously hard to provide as much in depth character and scene descriptions as the books do. However, the books are also about 1,000 pages each.If you have not seen the show, I would HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. Very easy to get hooked instantly. I saw the first 2 seasons before deciding to read the books. I have a job and go to school so you can understand why I was hesitant. It is definitely a time commitment. My girlfriend was not pleased, but I am halfway through the 3rd book after a month and would even say these surpass Tolkien's work (barely).All in all, no one I have talked to personally has disliked the show.

It's simply boring, and it's just not my kind of thing.

I always multi-task while watching because the plot is repetitive. There are also numerous two-dimensional characters where you just chuckle when they get decapitated or hump each other or whatever. A lot of the actors carry flat, wooden faces throughout their entire on screen existence (including the girl with the dragons). Having posted that, the dragons are indeed cool. So I guess I'm just another fantasy nerd like everyone else who watches this show.

It ups the bar in production values and provocativeness, but is essentially a trashy, meandering romance novel that HBO successfully passed off as a pop culture phenomenon.There is really no direction or character development to speak of. Peter Dinklage manages to inject some nuance into his performance, which appears as brilliant acting relative to all the other stone faces, of whom no director seems to make any hefty demands. Lots of great lines fall to the wayside while efforts are spent instead on costumes and sets. Evil characters are just evil, and making us truly understand them isn't remotely a priority.I don't hate it. I sometimes hate myself for rather enjoying it, in the way humanity's less endearing qualities force us to grow addicted to juicy gossip and reality shows. I wouldn't call this a "good" show though. On the upside, after watching an episode, everything I think and read takes on a posh British accent, which adds a touch of refinement to my American lifestyle.</fullReview>

I'm not sure what's worse, that they so gleefully depict and consume it in the show in the first place, or the rabid screams that this is "reality!" when anyone tries to question it (even though numerous articles by actual historians have shown this doesn't in any way reflect feudal society as it actually was for women or children... but facts be damned!).Either way, I'll go back to watching the Walking Dead and give this hate-fest a pass.</fullReview>

Instead, it focuses on pointless drama that has little to do with the main storyline. The dragons in the show are rarely seen due to budget issues, so viewers who watch the show for dragons will definitely be disappointed. A lot of the "exciting" scenes are in the finale episode where they would kill off characters just to shock the viewers... which is very gimmicky &amp; uncreative (They do it every season, kill off characters just for shock value).There's too many things going on due to having so many characters in the story. The show focuses on a couple of characters for a few minutes, then switches to other characters. This wouldn't be such a problem if these characters were actually important to the main storyline. But in this show, a lot of the characters aren't really important, and some of them get killed off in later episodes, so putting so much focus on their "story arc" becomes pointless.They need to just focus on the most important characters, and also stick with the main storyline instead of showing all these story arcs that just seem like fillers. A lot of the story arcs just seem very trivial and unimportant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew nothing about this series, neither literature nor this screen adaptation, nor even the author's work and name. This discovery was perfectly casual if it wasn't by my sceptical analysis of recent Conan's adaptation. We discussed John Millus' Conan, Robert E. Howard's and "Savage Sword of Conan", summoning the souls that should be transposed to the big screen. It was mentioned the plastic and orgasmic status Hollywood had presently acquired from the past few decades since its lack of profoundness, lack of critical approach, exuberance of ephemeral sensational effects and deeply poor acting had become its rooted motto of making money by exclusive brief debuts and marketing. The audience is attracted to a blockbuster movie like a donkey is to a carrot, exactly what I was expecting and confirmed later to be the new "Conan". Someone suggested This series in contrast to the cheesy updated blockbuster. This introduction reminds me that I found everything I was searching for not in the new "Conan" adaptation but here, in "Game of Thrones" - the art of narrative, the real acting and the incredible immersion in a fictionalized world where ancient archetypes and human spirit, plots, dilemmas, are all present. For my surprise I had my fingers fondling my beard, synonymous of intensely tasting what I was seeing while following the pilot episode, cursing slang with excellency attributions.Tolkien was always a reference since I remember, directly or unconsciously in my fictional world and I always felt that good adaptations of big tomes couldn't arise from spectacular blockbusters nor compressed movies - its juice would be simply wasted. Lord of the Rings was average but it wouldn't be that juicy if some few excellent actors and some very good special effects weren't present.But what can I say more? Shakespeare, Tolkien, literature, very wise application of special effects, excellent plot and acting, bold posture of using nudity naturally, bold posture of having a "dwarf" as main character (my favorite by the way) breaking bounds of politically correct, excellent costumes and characterization, what can I say more? I found everything here and like a kid I'm anxious to see the next episode (updated:season) already attached to the characters and this complex unpredictable and political world.Congratulations to George R. R. Martin the composer, to David Benioff and D.B. Weiss the marvelous interpreters and congratulations to the Bold HBO that allowed it to be materialized as also as to every mastered craftsman making it possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much was said about these series and there is a firm fan base who swallow whatever they feed them under the name of "Game of Thrones" so I bet this review would get some stiff resistance and dislike but the truth should be told. They call it a success! I don't know how to assess success for a TV show at the time of illegal torrent downloads. Yes, it was very successful in luring more illegal downloads than any other show in history and I assume it happened because of the high price of HBO as premium cable channels and its exclusive and somehow restricted broadcast through very limited channels. Forbidden fruit is always exiting even if its apple, a fruit which is anything but exiting in reality! Game of thrones is a nice show, it sure has very good production, character development is brilliant as there are no heroes and there are almost no pure villains. that's what I like about it. It's not black and white, its grey! but the screenplay lack the thrust. Episodes come and go and nothing really happens. It was like it from the very beginning, it never improved, just continued like a flat line. After watching couple of episodes, it downgraded to the level of well polished soap opera. I was on my laptop doing my work and it was on on TV. Each 2-3 hours i had to raise my head t see whats going on, I liked to know what happens at the end but the way to the end was so boring that I decided to make it tolerable with multi tasking.

		<fullReview>What is good: casting, production values, complexity and a fairly good balance or mix of action, drama, comedy and romance.Compared to the recent Arthur, Merlin and Pillars series, Game of Thrones is extremely well cast. There are no major blunders with actors picked to play lead characters. This is an accomplishment.I also like that it has the Fire&amp;Ice opening credits lending it a timeless TV vibe.And most of all about GAME, I really love watching the young Shakira actress who plays the queen/mother of the dragons. Her every body movement is consistently slow. There is a sexy slow motion grace with her hip-popping Shakira "Suerte" outfit sometimes worn, sometimes not worn... 100% slow-dreamy pleasure. Beyond good.But there are problems (going by TV / leaving books aside). We see no build-up or justification for Ned Stark to ever want to actually be a temporary regent. OK, yes, he might be willing to do it out of kindness, friendship or whatever, but nothing is ever shown to ever tell us that he was so blindingly dumb or blindingly power-hungry or blindingly anything to ever want to risk wasting his time to be a temporary regent, let alone push to do it, let alone risk life or limb to do it... let alone risking his defenseless children to do it."Our old dead King wanted me to be Regent for a while, but if you all are fine, I will return to Winterfell and stay busy minding the north for you. Any problems, write." This would be a win-win. This would be easiest. This would carry the least risk. Ned Stark had no motivation to do what was unpleasant, to do what was hard, to do what was risky, once his King friend was dead and gone.When in prison helpless and powerless, a childless neuter had to remind Ned that he has children in danger. The respected Ned Stark - forgetting he is a father. Forgetting he has children to protect. Not realistic. Another problem is the most evil players in GAME are invincible. Year after year, the great bad guys cannot be removed from "the game". Real fighting kills the great good guys, but never the great bad guys. Magic kills the great good guys, but never the great bad guys. Invincible bad guys ultimately make a story gloomy and pointless.Another problem is neutral parties, when given a choice between joining a brutal dishonest ruthless untrustworthy power-mad king, or joining a king with honor seeking justice rather than power -- the neutral parties will always join the dangerous untrustworthy king. This is reckless and unrealistic.Another problem is the greatest, most complex, most sweeping deception seen in the entire series was carried out by a loony old man with no right hand seen to conduct small things, let alone great secret things. No team running anything. The old man keeps his sons at a distance. He openly treats them with no respect. His sons show no like for him. His daughters are even more worthless.This weak old man could see his wife easily killed with no bother, all the while, he is surrounded by his adult children who hate him? The feeble old man is at the mercy of his close kin, so how could he not expect them to punish him for not caring to protect one of them? Not realistic. He dares eat a meal after what he did?Leaving aside the old man's unhappy nest, what about the army of the good King? Why is the army of the good King loyal enough to win mighty battles, yet not loyal enough to seek any revenge when the feeble old man somehow manages to kill the good King?GAME has too many 80YO men making babies and having hard interactions with young ladies. This is olden times long before the invention of serious ED drugs?And although the Shakira queen is a pleasure to look at, year after year she says some really dumb things. "If X, I will die. If X, I will kill you. After I am dead? I think." I don't care much for the magic and supernaturalism. GAME would be better without it. But even more distracting is the use of modern language. Lots of modern slang language is used in GAME, excused as being the common tongue. But as soon as the modern slang erupts, the illusion to olden times completely disappears. Much effort and costly production values have gone into the illusion of being in ancient times, it seems a shame to ruin it all every 13mins for no good reason. The illusion is more powerful, for example, when the young Stark girl speaks with Jaqur. It is weakest when the dwarf and/or the Hound start speaking slang.The final weakness is with general realism. GAME is far too modern with its social treatment of butch lesbians and dwarfs. It also lacks realism by having far too much happen at night. Visit a primitive location on earth today where electricity is rare, just as modern birth control is rare, and see how life begins at morning light. With no fridge or freezers, see how fresh food comes from the swarms of chickens walking everywhere all of the time. Rich people have many chickens running around. Poor people have not so many. But clearly, chickens and roosters rule the sounds of morning. Along with a sea of chickens, every young women has an infant, a 1+2+3YO and so on. A simple village is brimming with toddlers and infants. If chickens and babies are not seen everywhere, they are heard everywhere.Having many small animals &amp; toddlers make a production difficult, but these simple realistic sounds are not heard. GAME looks like an old place, but it doesn't sound like an old primitive place. GAME has many problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The following is just my opinion and should not be misconstrued as fact."When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die" Game of Thrones"Forget the promise of progress and understanding. For in the the grim dark future there is only war." Warhammer 40KIn my opinion GOT is a rehash of too many authors hard work. I acknowledge that nothing is new or original but I feel that for GOT he does not even attempt to be so. One of the biggest mistakes I made was to read Bulfinchs Mythology around the same time as GOT, at times I was certain I was reading the same story.If you enjoyed the character deaths in GOT I'd highly recommend reading(If you're able) Dan Abnetts Warhammer 40k novels. Character deaths have meaning while at the same time show the waste of war and how it can strike anyone randomly, they move the plot forward without being dwelt upon too much but are not just glossed over.To close this scattered collection of thoughts I'll give an example of one of the largest failings in GOT, the Red Wedding. While the lead up to the action is ham-fisted and unbelievable the event itself is fine. My gripe is that the "Rules of Hospitality" that had been important up to that point are thrown away to show Walders cunning. However!!! This oh so important traditional rule of not harming someone that takes "your meat and mead" bears no repercussions when broken. Anyway, just my opinion and I apologize for being all over this place with my thoughts. I suppose I should also mention I've watched all the current seasons and have read all of the books in the series up to this date.</fullReview>

Well to gain the market, nudity in start makes sense, but please, I would like to say this (to authors, if any is reading my review) that lessen the nudity. It will not affect the rating now..... I rated it 9, I would have rated 10 if it was clean. Or, please at least provide "Censored" version of all of it as early as possible, that might be helpful... The storyline given by George R. R. Martin is little bit different from what the writers of shows have made it to Whoever has liked this show, should must watch Breaking Bad, its on par with this show, or you can say it vice versa too...

Some people complain that their favorite characters are getting killed. But this is what makes them different from other shows. Its unpredictability is its usp.Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. This is what the plot in short is. We come to see betrayals, seduction, secrets, loyalty etc. There are a lot of people who complain about nudity, but there is not that much. But yes its show meant for the adults. Every season comes up with new twists and turns. I finished watching 4 seasons in just 2 weeks. and now looking forward to the 5th season. 10/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the show really captures its audience, not through CGI dragons and mystical lands and what not, but through the idea of power and what it can do. The show captures the evolving nature of characters facing hard choices that call for even harder decisions, for example the evolving of Daenerys's character throughout the whole show is by itself a good reason to keep watching the show, and this could really apply to everyone else. This is an important asset that we do not see that often with shows nowadays, most shows are focusing on attracting the audience rather than building a solid storyline to carry through the show. When I first watched GOT, I got hooked fast, because I was just bored watching the same ideas over and over again ( cops shows, medical crew shows, housewives shows, detective shows) Definitely one of my all time favorite shows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic (but lacking if book fan)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of thrones is an increasingly hard TV series to review. I started the show during the third season but have since invested a lot of time to the book series and have started to understand the amazing complexity that George RR Martin has weaved throughout his emotional masterpiece. Sadly, the TV show cant replicate this complexity of each character development and plot line but it can give the audience an enjoyable, funny, clever but somewhat lacking version of ASOIAF. If one watches the show without the books, one will enjoy the events even though they are tough to witness and recall the tragedies of recent emotional stories such as the Wire. But a book reader will be ultimately left with a shallow view of the multi dimensional stories that they have read throughout 5 books. The performances are excellent but the characters themselves pale next to the complex characteristics of each character in terms of psychology and what GRR Martin considers the apex of ASOIAF: The human heart in conflict with itself.</fullReview>

If you want action, fantasy, power games, sex, love and a lot, really a lot of fights and battles, you should watch Game of Thrones. Like, right now. I mean it.Game of Thrones is the first series I've ever seen in my life, and it obviously have a very special meaning for me; but that's not the only reason because I love GoT. I love Daenerys, and Tyrion, and Arya and a lot of characters; but I hate a lot too. I think it's just axesome how in a sooo large cast of characters the viewer know (and hate or love) every single one of them. I love the way all the story lines crosses in one point and separate in the other, and I love the fact that we, all the fans, have fear as hell that one of our fave characters die in the next episode.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is unquestionably the best series I've seen in ages. Great acting, great lines, amazing sets, constant twists, well developed characters, nudity and more nudity, sex of course, zombies (who doesn't like zombies) passion, terror, horror, suspense and more. If you rolled a bit of every Medieval ruler into a few characters with spice from Genghis Khan or Ivan the Terrible you'd have some idea of the breadth of the characters There are some very clever interchanges between the characters and genuine lessons in power and ruling. You could pick up excerpts of history from just about any period. The real challenge this series now faces, into its 6th season, is NOT to get carried away of over-the-top drama. Keep the mill of intrigue, revenge and compassion going without relying on the zombies to be center stage. The Walking Dead this is so been-there-done-that. Bring on a new challenge. Love the giants though. I'm also a sucker for read hair. Why does everyone south of the wall have to speak in a pseudo British accent? The exotica from Morocco is also a great contrast to the ice north of the wall. Keep 'em coming!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To date, the Game of Thrones series was the one that set me three days "followed" watching television... Watching the episode "Winter is Coming" (1 episode of 1 season), I was "in love" and just stopped until the episode "Mhysa" (last episode of season 3). Then I started following the 4th season of "Two Swords" to the "Children". It is also the first series I think it was done in a better way than the book itself. There are people who call the Game of Thrones 'Harry Potter for adults', but I do not agree with these people, because the two have no comparison possible, because they are both top of the tops. What impresses and stands out in the series is: the vast existing coordination, as it must be very difficult to write in so many places and with so many actors; landscapes and sites chosen are very nice to look at; visual effects (VFX) that have bestial quality and the clothes, but the clothes are what viewers less repair, but have small details that give the epic style to the acclaimed HBO series.</fullReview>

Extremely well done and I hope they are able to adapt the whole saga. Trouble is, whenever something good comes along it always seems to be the first thing to be cancelled!However, after reading the books I thought - I've read this story before - often word for word. I am not sure if I am remembering correctly but Robin Hobbs 'Assassin' series springs to mind. Anyway, whichever series it was all I recall of that other story is that it was tedious and repetitious - at least George Martin made it more interesting!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This decade might be the renaissance of TV shows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Game Of Thrones has 3 major points that are responsible for the show's success.1. Creating and exploring a whole new fantasy world George R.R. Martin dreamed and the showrunners created a complex and diverse universe. The medieval atmosphere serves as a perfect base and fantasy elements were integrated into the events masterfully. The politics of Westeros seems to be real and this huge world ensures inexhaustible resources, like: interrelated connections, family feuds, references to past events, different fractions, duels and battles, legends and beliefs, religious sects, mythical creatures and so on.2. There are no unequivocal charactersWe receive complex and multifaceted individuals from different social classes with different goals. Some of them have the power to achieve whatever they want, others can't even reach the simplest desires. Social inequality does exist and power relations change constantly. Characters fall from grace, others rise from the dirt and this insecurity leads to unpredictable events. We can't be really sure what's gonna happen next. Smaller events sometimes evolve into the central storyline, so some actions that seem insignificant may have an aftermath later.3. Outstanding verbal duels/ the weight of wordsMost of the scenes are basically conversations between characters in different places, but the incredibly talented actors and actresses are capable of maintaining (our) attention with well written dialogues. It makes time flow like a river. The show reflects genuinely on the consequences of verbal abuses. We witness fellowships and relationships vanish within seconds just by verbal communication. Many characters took an insult too far, and sometimes a few words proved to be the main reason for war. It's interesting to watch friends becoming arch enemies and enemies becoming allies.All in all, Game Of Thrones ensures qualitative entertainment for everyone and i'm pretty sure this series is a huge milestone in TV show history.</fullReview>

Well, I was totally fascinated with this combination of awesome directing, outstanding acting and of course, magnificent filming locations and plot. George R.R. Martin has written five great books that came to life in an even greater form. The only problem is the great number of explicit scenes. I believe that without them, Game of Thrones could be appropriate for younger audiences. I agree that some of those scenes are really important parts of the plot, ( like Jaimie and Cercei's illegal relationship ) but I think they can be reduced or be implied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-watch series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some may think that the fame of the Game Of Thrones series is just a matter of trend, but it most definitely is not.Adapted from George R R Martin's book series "A song of Ice and Fire", I believe the popularity of the Game of Thrones series comes from a brilliant adaptation. The characters are all played by great actors, and unlike so many other series today, the characters are not "one-dimensional" - they all have their own battles and their own problems, not to mention their own personalities. Steady character growth is also something too rarely seen and which has been successfully executed here, very notable on characters such as Khalessi played by Emilia Clarke or Jon Snow played by Kit Harrington. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were not miserable when it came to placing plot twists and character deaths in episodes, unlike other TV shows such as The Walking Dead where it seems that only the first and last episode of a season needs to be exciting while the rest are as average as they can be. Every episode of Game of Thrones reveals new and exciting information which makes every episode worth while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This show is a little over hyped, but is worth watching. I never read the books. Fantasy is for total geeks, Excalibur is a great film. I enjoyed the first season, I was surprised by the brave woman who act in this show. Beautiful woman throughout. Families fight over nothing other than keeping blood lines thick, always attacking with shallow threats, and lies, and of course battles for castles, building armies, killing families, et cetera. The stories do have a historical feel. The production and cinematography are outstanding. The amount of interactions (dialog) is soaking at times, but I read that it's following the books closely. Do not get attached to the characters, they swoon in and out of the storyline, and then get murdered. There really is not much fantasy involved. Mostly terrible sword fighting, throat slashing, blood squirting...OK 1 giant, 3 dragons, a crap load of stories about past kings and laws and fables, and that sorta crap. Over all its good. EXCEPT - the second to last episode of season 3, has some of the most violent bloody horrific scenes since Scarface. It really shows how savage humans can be. I was totally taken off guard more than three times... this show can twist you inside/out that's for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I began to see this series while I was reading the fourth book. Visual effects and filming are really nice, and the environment very well recreated, and chapters are real. They added some sex that does not appear in the books, an rearranged a little the story (In the book many things happen in parallel). I am not to complain about that, because I understand that books and TV are different animals What really disappointed me about this series is that storytelling is way too fast, and some main characters are hard to differentiate from each other (specially northeners). After watching the first chapter I could only think: People that that didn't read the book must have a huge mess on their minds about who is who and what the series is about. Simply it's impossible to realize about the real extent of the plot unless you read the books (That happens with many adaptations, but in this case I think you are missing most of it if you only watch the series). The first book simply has too much content for a 10 chapter season.Nice series, but it could have been way better if they didn't squeeze the story so much to fit a book per season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After two people I respect suggesting that I might like Game of Thrones, I decided to watch the pilot, since I have HBO on demand and was all caught up on my favorite series. I offer this feedback for the filmmakers of this series and others, and for future potential fans:I found it difficult to follow, but it was worthy of my patience, and I was genuinely intrigued by certain characters. I know some CGI artists who are crazy for the opening and understand their feelings--I find the opening does a disservice in that it fails to set the tone, it is confusing and has too many little details distracting from what you really need to know. If you want to compare openings that really capture the essence and set the tone - compare this one to Vikings (History Channel) and Homeland (Showtime Channel). After catching up recently, I am still pretty confused about where things are and what's what culturally, but it doesn't matter - one need not have it all figured out to appreciate the real stories, which are the relationships between the people, not the cities or clans. The names are hard to remember, and again, it doesn't matter. It's still interesting even though I can't remember many of the names.It fascinates me that the writer is still working out the future of this series - the books are not all written - so even the book fans do not know what is going to happen, ultimately. Is it a spoiler to say that above all, I cannot wait to see... oh, yes, that would be a spoiler... starts with a D. Note to HBO: WOW!!! AMAZING sets, costuming, overall production scale is absolutely stunning, the crew and producers should be extremely proud of what you have created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best TV series EVER.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the only thing i watch on TV, It's simply amazing.After hearing people talk about it for a while and having no idea what it was, I finally gave in and looked it up. It sounded interesting so I watched the first episode... and then the next 2 series over the next 4 days because I was so immersed In the storyline.Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) performed flawlessly In the first season and I actually felt sad when he died while being angry/frustrated at joffrey (Jack Gleeson).Then there's Jon Snow (Kit Harington) He's probably taken the spot as my favourite actor because he is just that good! and I am eagerly awaiting to see what he does in season 3.Since watching I have told 2 friends about Game of Thrones and both have thanked me, So if you have a interest in Fantasy films/TV shows you should certainly watch this, you wont regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another mile stone in TV entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land ...Filmatic medieval-like TV series, with high production a values and quality acting. Despite some seemingly inconsistencies with the language in the script the characters are finely portrayed. The lead cast are an array of familiar faces from both TV and film, a mix that has become synonymous with TV series recently, Game of Thrones includes Sean Bean and Lena Headey to name a few. Notable is actor Peter Dinklage who wonderfully portrays Tyrion Lannister. The characters are shades of grey, the story is vast and bravely take it's time to unfold probably thanks to George R.R. Martin's novel source material. The locations, costumes and set are fantastic and capture both the richness and squallier of the fictional period creating an atmosphere you can taste and feel.The bloody and gritty first episode successfully set the tone for the series. Game of Thrones is certainly a milestone in TV entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ideal show vs can-improve-show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The show is good, so much better than many shows on TV, but there's room for improvement.What this show was meant to be, is ---&gt; 1. a Sopranos type drama ---&gt; 2. with many great characters, ---&gt; 3. plenty of amazing twists, evil and tragedy ---&gt; 4. and many Lord-of-the-Rings-mixed-with-Horror type battles.The books set up nice and then deliver. A TV show unfortunately can't deliver all. Some things are cut due to budget. Some things are added for titillation (although there's plenty of sex in the original story already).So what you get is ---&gt; 1. a Sopranos type drama ---&gt; 2. with many good characters (whose introduction can become a drag, because this is not a book)---&gt; 3. plenty of amazing twists (latter half of the series), evil and tragedy---&gt; 4. and BOOBIES---&gt; 5. And some fight scenes and implied battles.Still good, stick with it. The story is great and makes up for the lacking Lord-of-the-Rings type battles.My biggest pet peeve? Pacing.The acting is really good (Sean Bean! The kids! Awesome!), but the pacing sometimes feels unbalanced.And I don't mean the snail's pace of the first episodes. That is needed, unfortunately. I mean there's an awkward pacing between the scenes. This series has yet to grow comfortable with itself, find a balance between it's ideal version and the TV/constrained version.I'm rooting for season two anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I am having trouble understanding how people can write all the negative stuff about this show, generally the negative reviews are after only one episode.This show is simply amazing.I think the casting was incredible. Peter Dinklage was the ONLY person who could have played Tyrion, and man, it was better than I could have ever hoped. Sean Bean is one of my favorite actors, and he does not disappoint in this. I was somewhat surprised at the portrayal of Visaerys being so, wimpy, but then again I haven't read the books in years.I'm not going to try and persuade people to like this series. All I am saying is to give it a try, and watch a few episodes. If you just watch the first episode, you won't understand much at all. Watch a few episodes, and then you can have a good idea of what is going on (Although there are so many twists and turns in the plot, you'll never know what is going to happen.) Also, yes there is violence and nudity. I will say that the first episode has more of the latter than the subsequent episodes, so don't just throw the series out for that reason alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the first slower paced episodes this amazing series takes of. You've gotten to know the different characters and are about to set off on an amazing journey.The beautiful landscapes and wonderful sets alone are reason enough to watch. But it is the story it self that is the key. True to the books it was based on, with twists and turns at every corner make it a must see.The scripting and the actors make this story come to life and keep us glued to the television! I've always loved reading fantasy novels, but seeing a book come to live like the game of thrones makes me want more. It looks, feels and almost smells like how i've imagined it while reading.I can only say ... thank you and make more</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most overrated show out there,after season 2 the writing of this show is so bad.The showrunners hate characters like Stannis,and because of their hate and misunderstanding of the character they butcher his whole story-line,they love characters like Tyrion,Jon and Daenerys and they always make them look like heroes,when this show started no one everything was unpredictable while now and especially in season 6 everyone predicted everything just from the very first trailer.The writers choose only to kiss a** and do only what the fans want.From a good show that everything that happened mattered now Daenerys,Tyrion,Jon and Arya have plot armors and do whatever they want without any consequence.I know i sound like a hater but as a book reader comparing the quality of the writing between the books and the show,i see that the show is just awful,I don't want an exact copy of the books,because the show is an adaptation but I can't stand this stupid fan-fiction,even GRRM himself called the show a fan-fiction(3 out of 10 only for the high budget,great visuals and good actors that this show used to have e.x Charles Dance,Stephen Dillane etc.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much graphic full male nudity and only partial female nudity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an excellent programme spoilt by spin and media attention. The recent episode with the graphic shot of the penis and scrotum reinforced the inequality of nudity in the production where all females hide behind merkins so there is no full female nudity. I would prefer no genital nudity as a production of this quality does not need it. The parents guide is currently incorrect and really needs to be corrected to:-Partial female nudity only , all genitalia being either covered or CGI altered. Full male nudity including close up graphic views of genitalia The current guide implies a lot of female nudity but only as much as you would see on a beach</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Season 5: the sad demise of GoT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll declare my hand. Up until Season 5 Game of Thrones was comfortably the best thing I've ever seen on television. It had all the best ingredients. I would have reviewed all 4 seasons at, or very close to, 10.Season 5 by contrast is a bitter disappointment and a marked deterioration in the brand. It's not just that it has become desperately slow moving, nor that so much of the first half is dialogue driven. It's also that the plot lines have become stultifying. Great characters have become bogged down in, frankly, very boring stories: examples being Arya, Tyrion, Daenerys and the dragons (who never seem to do anything). Even the wonderful Sansa has been sent to a backwater and, ironically, denuded Ramsey Bolton of much of his original interest. The two of them are stuck at Winterfell, which would never happen (Sansa's far too regal too have gone to the Boltons as GRR Martin knew full well). The intrigue which surrounded King's Landing has vanished in the face of really rather dull religious fanatics. So, for example, we've lost most of the wonderful Lannister-Tyrell friction. It's partly because we've lost the evil people with power such as Tywin, but it's not just that. The series has become that most awful of adjectives: bland.A lot of this series comes across as shot hastily with poor scriptwriting and shoestring budgets. It's a bitter disappointment but a sign that perhaps Game of Thrones has had its day. I hope not because we're set for a grand finale, but the producers really need to get their act together and bring this back to form, and fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game of Gossip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is nothing but a glorified Gossip Girl set in medieval times. Don't get me wrong, I am hooked in the series but for all the wrong reasons. The Universe built here is mesmerizing and I am more interested in the mythology than the damn fighting for the stupid and uncomfortable Iron throne. The books are even worse having to swing your machete at the overgrown drool of words upon words that one has to dissect carefully to get what the author means. I prefer the series over the books, they are cutting through some of Martins' bulls*#% and keeping the storytelling more streamlined. I certainly can't stand "fanboys" because they become zombies blindly following something without questioning a single thing. In their eyes their idols are perfect and that is simply not true. We are all humans and not one single person is perfect. Certainly not Mr. Martin who in an interview said that he doesn't owe anybody anything. Well, I guess you managed to get your millions all on your own sir. I'm sure it had nothing to do with your blinded fanboys.The series, just like books, take too much time to make things happen. It is all word of mouth instead of actions. You know everything that goes on through somebody's monologue. Whatever happened to show me rather than tell me gets lost in this series on an unusually large scale. I have to give series like Defiance, and Falling Skies credit for at least trying to show me those hard to present scenes. Game of Thrones is simply put a colossal tease. Shows white walkers and dragons and magic like sprinkles of salt on a stew causing them to stir excitement on the viewer then...nothing. No huge battles, no dragons are involved in the battles in which they have to be involved, no walkers are were they are supposed to be, all invasions and huge conflicts are solved in mere moments, that again, are told rather than shown. Yeah, the Blackwater battle was not as impressive as you fanboys want to claim it was. All these things happen on a larger scale on the books, here they've become nothing but a bunch of gossip. The producers are not even trying to invest and make the effort to show us this grand Universe. Everything gets reduced to simple words spewing out of the main characters to let us in on the entire plot. Even the lamest soap opera makes an effort to show some of what's happening in their world.Verdict: I love the mythology involving this series but I am not a blinded fool to think that this series is the greatest thing on television because it is not. You love it, that is fine. You hate it, that is fine. I understand both sides of the argument and both assume the complete extreme. I am humbly telling you that is worth a look to see if it falls under your taste or not. Me, I just critically follow the series to get the conclusion to a story whose mythology has me hooked, but it does not change my opinion that is nothing more than a glorified Gossip Girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I await season 3, this show has been posted as the 'top user rated TV series of 2012' while I thoroughly enjoy most episodes I have found one thing in particular lacking... meaningful battle scenes.. we have seen armies sweep across the fabled land of Westeros while rarely seeing them draw a sword in anger, this show is in effect a 'medieval' soap opera with occasional glimpses of the real action, my main issue with this is that the program demands more action and on a much grander scale and in reality it pretends to have these set pieces in abundance which is a little bit of hype on the part of the producers. Anyone who wants to see epic battle sequences will be bitterly disappointed. I can only hope that in this coming season we will actually see more of these 'wars' played out on the battlefield rather than focusing completely on the aftermath of battles or the reactions of various noblemen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth the wait.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best things about certain books is that, for me, they lead to pleasant, but not vapid escapism, and the Song of Ice and Fire always fitted that bill for me. As a historian, the grittiness bypasses all those silly notions of a romantic, bucolic Mediaeval period.Television adaptations, such as this one, must take certain liberties, but here they have been, for the most part, subtle enough to not be jarring or irritating. The only one of note so far that concerned me was the "outing" of Renly and Loras Tyrell so blatantly. The subtlety of the book was much better and allowed a better introduction for characters who are important later on, namely Brienne and Margery Tyrell. That said, I wont worry too much about it.The characters are well drawn, with decent personalities that reflect the shades of grey in real life. Even the most venal characters have some redeeming features which are not brought in apologetically. Their character is allowed to stand without such self-conscious presentation. Obviously certain parts of the books could not be easily filmed, or legally filmed, but the main atmosphere is still there.To my mind it is preferable to Lord of the Rings, to which all fantasy seems to be compared. I enjoyed LOTR, book more than films, I just prefer this to either though I do wish the books would come faster! For myself, I would recommend exploring this excellent series. Have some care as to the depicted violence, both against humans and animals. It certainly did not bother me, but I know some people might be disturbed by some of the imagery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First five seasons the curve goes down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What in the beginning has been a promising TV-show, with a rich story behind rich visuals became a feast of killing, perversions, ever so thinner story and predictable outcome. The producers obviously try to squeeze the last drop of milk from an exhausted cow. After killing so many characters, new emerge but without any reason or cause except transforming GOT into another Lost. Instead of answers, we got more questions. Instead of coherent storyline, we got thousands of branches with no leaves and no ending in sight. I've watched all episodes at once, one after another, and it was still gets harder to follow. I could not imagine how it would be week after week. Nothing to remember, nothing to link with anything. This is not a fantasy story any more, but randomly picturing someone's dirty mind/dreams in a form of a TV-show. However, the acting and direction (in such circumstances) is superb, although the characters are pretty one-dimensional (either good or bad) with no depth. If you endured so far, keep watching and hoping for better story development. If you did not watch any of GOT so far, don't bother. Read the books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should have been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying this is hands down one of the best TV shows on the air today. Unfortunately part of me can't help but wonder if it's the lack of other quality TV options most of the time that lead me to feel that way.There is a lot to love here: quality acting, nicely done sets, great attention to detail in props and scenery. Judged on it's own merits there is a lot to enjoy and take in. As a spectacle of it's own this is among the best TV has to offer, with only a handful of movies (with larger budgets) that can top it for its genre.The problem is; this has source material. Being based on a book series that is simply far and away the best of it's kind printed in the last decade. Having read the books this is where the problems with the show begin to bleed through: the plot simply is not as good as it pretends to be.You have A-list material from the books which could have been lifted page for page; but instead the show writers have chosen to not only truncate the dialogue but also write in their own mediocre scenes.Don't get me wrong, I fully understand cutting some things simply because the books are so much longer. But what I can't agree with is cutting material and than replacing it: that means you did have time for things you skipped...The stuff being added is B-grade at best.That's the shows biggest sin; dumping good scenes and adding in fluff. The laundry list of other changes (characters that were cut; merged and otherwise changed) is also a bit unsettling. The entire "game of thrones" has essentially been dumbed down for TV. What should be a chess game of monarchs is watered down to a couple of idiots playing checkers. Some of the blood lines for example instead of having multiple heirs only have 1 and the threats and plots surrounding them have been simplified or nearly cut entirely. And in its place? Extra sex scenes from minor characters.The show is at it's best when it stays true to the books, the dialogue and plot twists shine and keep you engaged. Than it wanders off into la-la land where the writers think they know better than the source material and all I can do is shake my head and wonder just how truly epic and amazing this could have been.So; is the show good? Yea. Just not as good as it should have been. They were handed the keys to one of the most well developed fantasy worlds ever written, and I just wish they would stop hiding under the bed sheets and stick to the source material.In summary all I can tell you is this: Read the books. Unless you lack imagination and reading comprehension it will be one of the best reads of your life.Watch the show afterwards and take it for what it's worth: a 9 that should have been a 10.</fullReview>

I beg you to watch it and watch Lost to you wont regret it! This show has it all, it's a lot of nudity in it but just enough to get you into the time where this story is played out.

		<fullReview>I know it's silly to call a TV series "perfect", but I find it hard to see what could have been made significantly better. Sure, Lena Headey sometimes makes a bit too much of her crooked smile, and Harry Lloyd may be a bit too slimy. But these are marginal notes, a hundred times over compensated by the work of Sean Bean, Peter Dinklage and others. But the acting, of course, is only a part of it - you can find excellent acting in lots of British shows. What makes this one so special is how everything is welded together, from the basic Medieval fantasy story, to Machiavelli and the power play of modern politics. The scenery is gorgeous, the costume is so good you can smell the leather (and you seriously wonder if the characters ever take a bath). Well, yes - I do have one major complaint. I would have preferred to watch the whole series in one go. The cliffhangers drives me crazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that i am probably in the minority here, but i do not hold game of thrones in such a high esteem as the rest of the viewers. I have not read the books so my opinion only has to do with the show as a TV product. I find the acting, the soundtrack and the atmosphere of the series amazing. But in the end, i never find myself eager to watch the next episode for some reason. I love fantasy series and i devour series with action, battles and politics. I loved Spartacus and i didn't mind the nude and sex scenes. In game of thrones though i find many scenes too disturbing. I also find that i do not care for many characters so much as i should. The first season was for me the best. Every character was given enough time, for us to learn about him and his story...But in season 2 and 3 we only see every character for a few minutes and sometimes not in every episode. I know that this is the way it is supposed to be but it keeps me from getting invested in them. Everything involves so slowly for me that in the end when i have to choose an episode from any series to watch, game of throne is almost always my final choice despite being a superior production to most shows out there right now...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly, I already finished the books, so my expectations were bigger. The books are great and anyone who wants to feel the real thrill of the series should read those. Overall the series are OK, but "haste" is the overwhelming feeling, like everything was done in a hurry, some of the actors seem to be paid for words per minute, rather than performance.The plots, intrigues, betrayals are described in an excellent manner in the books, but the series keep a rather thin line of those, concentrating more on sex, violence and non-important eye-catching aspects. They missed many important things from books in my opinion, things that would have lead to a better understanding of main plot and of some characters. On top of these, HBO Romania managed to make 31 translation errors in 2 episodes, 10 of them being severe. "Calapono" instead of "Khal Pono" for example. Too many for any television that has any respect for it's viewers. The one that translated never touched the books.10 episodes per book are too few to capture the magic described by Martin. I strongly recommend the books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching four episodes, I have to say that I really love the series so far. I have not read the books, and I haven't been a fantasy- fan at all really before I watched the series. It is amazing! The third episode was maybe a bit slow, but other than that, I really feel the tension and the characters really growing on me. I disagree with most bad reviews that say it is boring, to slow, to fast and that the actors are misplaced.I really like all of the good characters, and do not like the evil ones, but that is because they are evil characters and not because they are misplaced or bad actors. Ned Stark is very tasteful, also his sons - as a woman, I really like them. The atmosphere is realistic and I'm looking foreward to winter when the story probably turns even darker. I don't feel violated as a woman watching this - I love that they don't sensor the reality like most American series would have. It is harsh and true, and I really feel it in my bones. I think it would only get better and better. No series is for everyone! That is just something to accept. But for most people this series clearly is fantastic, hence the rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor storytelling, slow and boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by pointing out what i like about this show; Good cinematography and acting. The rest is standard directing, mediocre soundtrack and a poor script.I've been in a situation many times, where a dialogue was going on and they spoke of other characters but i didn't seem to know who where they speaking of. I spent the entire first season trying to memorize the names of many of the characters (including some of the main ones). The second season actually made me memorize some of their names. Excluding the main characters the other characters are briefly introduced, nothing outlines them to make you remember which character is who. Do the script writers expect me to read the books before watching this?Worth mentioning that 90% of the show is dialogue, which is OK if it actually leads to something and it's a drama, instead of a fantasy series. Dialogue is mostly irrelevant and boring. It leads nowhere most of the time and does not contribute to the storyline. And in the rare moments it actually does, nothing happens next. You are hang with the promise of everything happening the next season. And to your disappointment, it doesn't. More dialogue and nothing happening. More promises...The story moves slowly. As if they had to stretch the whole thing to make every dollar of the budget count. Daenerys Targaryen could possibly be my favorite character, but she spends, up until now, 4 seasons to build an army and reach the iron throne (which i doubt it will only be in the 5th season, with some luck). That's how slow and boring this is.Whenever an episode finishes, i feel no urge to see the next one. There is nothing that lefts me hanging. I just feel like if they pulled the plug on this one it wouldn't make a difference to me.Mediocre show with dragons and special effects. People digest this crap because they are hungry for a fantasy series with a big budget. A well made Lord of The Rings style series. That's what viewers crave for. And this is the only reason people watch this and feel good about it. This show has no direct competition or it would be dead in the first season.Oh, and some advice. If you do actually watch this; you can take a leak, prepare your popcorn, grab a beer and call your friends to come over, all during the intro.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, you're better off watching the show and seeing for yourself than reading this review. However, if you still want to, you can go on. I really don't care if the show's storyline deviates from the books. What keeps me hooked to the show is the superb pace and detail that is associated with each of the parallel story lines. Each storyline is handled delicately and a viewer will seldom feel a bias towards a particular one. Every character exhibits true human character and is not just a vessel for reciting the script. For me, every character scores top marks in every department. Also, you can't forget the setting and the scenery. Their selection immensely affect the atmosphere of a scene giving it way more definition. The least that I can say about this show is that it is an intense work of art. To conclude, this show is just about perfect and I bet it will be the one to beat for quite some time down the line in its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, this is the show anyone wants to see. When i watched the first three episodes of Game of Thrones, i got disoriented easily because of the extremely wide scope of the stories. But as we watch more and more, this thing becomes the reason why we all carried on watching the show.Many folks out there said that this show isn't particularly similar to the books, and they said that the show is deviated from the books, but this is really why we should watch it. If the show goes on exactly the same as the books, then the book readers have no reasons to waste their time on watching the show.Of course, our gratitude should go to the mastermind, George R.R. Martin, and the producers, Dave Benioff and Dan Weiss. They've made this show very interesting from episode to episode, and keep us watchers to be curious on whats gonna happen next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had watch hundred of shows in my life. But, GoT is the greatest show I ever watched in my life. I had so much attachment with each character. The GoT would be the legacy and trademark of HBO. They keep true to the epically written book, and they depict the characters in an excellent way. With a few exceptions I would say they have made what will be an epic show here, and I would really hope that they continue for all the books. The main problem is, that if you don't know the books you are quite lost with the characters and what happened to all of them. But I hope we will get deeper into the minds and backgrounds of those people! The cast for that is really well done and I hope for they can pass on the feelings I got when I read the book!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best TV Show that's still on!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such a good TV Show, nearly as good as Breaking Bad. But it needs to tune down on the unnecessary sex and nudity! Sean Bean is such a good actor and I hate the fact that they killed him off but that's the thing with Game of Thrones, it's unpredictable so you never know what's going to happen. I love the fact that at the end of every episode something big happens and it keeps you guessing for the next episode and Breaking Bad did that but I think Game of Thrones does it better! Peter Dinklage is an awesome actor especially in this Show, series 4 is starting soon and I sure as hell hope they don't kill him because it would then get irritating, and killing off all the characters would get repetitive, the acting is very good, however for some actors, it's not the best. But if they kill of Peter Dinklage, I will stop watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review is based on the seasons 1 to 4.This review contains spoilers !I used to heard about game of thrones success but never had time to watch It so one day I decided to go ahead and watch the 1st season.First of all let's talk about the 1st season, It was really boring, a story line about a kid that falls from a building....I was like wow what a story line...(ironic).I gave this show a last chance and I thought there would be some kind of big change or a boost in the story line with the season 2 so I started to watch the first episodes and unfortunately I was still disappointed with this show. The story line is mediocre, no change with the 1st season I wondered myself how the hell can be this TV show so popular, there's no suspense at all, the story is very slow to start, I hoped to see wars but nothing about It except in the 2nd or 3rd season when Stannis Baratheon attempted to assault the king's landing (only good moment of the show).In brief this show deals with the political and government world but from the ancient age including treasons, wedding conspiracies and killings..I watch this show only when I have time to waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we talk of greatness, this show would be a perfect definition for such word. The execution of all the artists with their respective character based from the novel by Sir George RR Martin is just undeniably scientific. The interpretation and processing thoughts or the writers of this show are just intelligent. This is a show about human life drawn into the world of fantasy. Politics at its finest. This is a mind-blowing piece of art, really. It contains shocking revelation and twists which you cannot anticipate, for real. I am seriously attached with this magnificent TV series. And if you haven't watch this show yet, better do it now before you die. For we all know that "valar morghulis".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With many shows and movies about post-apocalyptic futuristic societies, George Martin's Game of Thrones is a refreshing change. It is a stunning mix of fantasy, drama, and medieval warfare. The book series turned TV show is truly audience engaging with its great cast, attention to fine details, and suspenseful storyline. The cast of a show either makes or breaks it, in Game of Thrones the cast definitely makes the show. Before the end of the first episode, the audience can't help getting attached to certain characters and hating others. One character that the audience can't help but hate is Prince Joffrey, who attacks a helpless boy who is pretend sword fighting. After Joffrey gets hurt he has his father, the King, order to have the boy killed. A character that viewers can't help but love is Arya, the daughter of the King's best friend. Arya doesn't follow the social norms set for girls, she wants to learn how to fight, be rough, and ride horses like her brothers. When caught pretend sword fighting with her friend she fights back against the Prince not caring about his status. Jack Gleeson and Maisie Williams bring these characters to life. Without the amazing actors and cast there wouldn't be a huge following of the show, which includes over seven million people who watch the show just on TV not including those who watch online. The details are an important part of any book, movie or show. This show is no different because there are so many small details that could easily be forgotten. One would think that the style of clothing, type of armor, or even silverware used to eat wouldn't make a different in watching the show, but it truly does. The clothing distinguishes the poor from the rich, and those who live in warm climates in the south from those in the north in the cold. The armor displays that someone is a knight, or a war soldier. The silverware exhibits financial status. Each noble family in the kingdom has their own personal symbol, and when they travel or go to war, flags with the symbol are carried with them. These details didn't come without extreme cost .When watching it is easy to understand why it costs over five million dollars to film each episode. It probably would have been easier to film in front of a green screen, but that would have taken away from the authenticity of the story. The show is filmed in authentic locations all around Europe from Iceland, Spain, Croatia, Ireland, to Malta. When reading a book or watching a movie, it is usually easy to predict the ending. It often times ends when the boy gets the girl and they live happily ever after. This does not happen in Game of Thrones. All sixty minutes of each episode is action packed. It is nearly impossible to predict a certain character's fate because of the action packed scenes and suspense, even if they seem like a main character. When watching the audience can't help but sit on the edge of their seat not knowing what's going to happen. When past events are tied to recent event, it creates a "ah ha" moment that helps viewers understand a certain character's actions in the past. What makes Game of Thrones great is that it is truly unique, with the use of mystical animals. However, a comparable show is Vikings, in both shows the goal is to become King by overcoming numerous obstacles. If you're looking for a show that is action packed, and full of suspense then Game of Thrones is the show for you. Full of great actors with whom the audience can't help but form an emotional attachment to. The attention to fine details creates a sense of authenticity of how the people in the kingdom live. A major point to consider when watching is that no one is ever safe. It never turns out the way the audience anticipates, the future can never be predicted. It will leaving you with a cliffhanger ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complicated, not enough dragon action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is well made and has excellent acting. However there are a ridiculous amount of characters, each with their own mission and agendas. You might be able to get the gist by reading accompanying wikis and utilising the rewind button but you really have to pay attention. This is not an easy watch. I stuck with it for a good two seasons and concentrated really hard.I often enjoy fantasy films but not big on historical themes unless there is an excellent storyline or humour in there. This may have affected my opinion of this series. They talk a lot throughout the film. There is action but it can get confusing figuring out why people are hacking each other to pieces again. I just wish there was less strategising and more dragons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not enough male nudity and gay sex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.....Contains Some Spoilers.......Game of Thrones is such an amazing show packed full of extreme violence, gore, drama, sex, which I love. But I have only have one criticism.... No male nudity!! Every time I watch the show, all I see are women's privates and breasts. Helooooo, Penis!!!! Where is the male nudity? I think the only problem with the she show is that there needs to be more naked men, more penises, more hot male chests and buttocks to make the show more fair to men. The show contains too much female frontal nudity but not enough male nudity. I want to see some!!! Also, game of thrones contains all types of sex: anal, lesbian, incest, rape and prostitution but there is no gay sex. I wanna see more men and men in bed. There was a scene in "kissed by fire" where Loras and Olyvar had sex. That scene was so hot. Olyvar's body was so hot and he had an amazing bum. Also in series 4, Olyvar was naked in bed with prince Oberyn. We got to see his sexy hot ass, sexy chest and his penis as he left the room. Those were the only two main gay scenes in game of thrones and that is ridiculous. To conclude, I think there is too much female nudity and not enough male and I want to see more gay sex scene as I believe these two factors will make the show much fairer and better to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great show! There is so much to talk about. The acting is stellar, the sets, locations, costumes, etc, are just awesome. Warning- do not watch if you are 12 and under or not a fan of violence, sex or anything pertaining to that. This show is packed full of violence- and i mean extremely. for example (SPOILER)- there is a pregnant woman stabbed in the uterus, and is very disturbing to watch; also there is a man who gets his nipple cut off (not that gory but very unnerving). There is also a lot of blood- whether through stabbings or slitting of throats or whatever. There is also a lot, and i mean a lot, of boobs and sex. There are many prostitutes who show boobs and women who aren't prostitutes who show their boobs. The sex also is very graphic. In the first season, there is a group of people, a few of the main characters are with, who have sex just out of the blue. You can also see a little bit of penises here and there but nothing full on. It is still a great show and has lots of plot twists and many likable and unlikable characters- and is all around a great show. It is base off the book series, which are just as good, by George R R Martin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLEASE NOTE THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS OF OTHER SHOWS SUCH AS BREAKING BAD, NOT GAME OF THRONES THOUGH, OTHER SHOWS ARE IN HERE BECAUSE ITS A COMPARISIN. I watched the first episode and I think it's not so good, I mean whats up with all the nudity unneeded and all?it is good I admit, but its not better than breaking bad, especially for being thought out, I didn't read the books and watched it, it starts out foreignly, I shouldn't have to read the books in order to know whats going on. Like Walking Dead, I know whats happening from the start. Here are reasons why Breaking Bad is much better than this... 1. Based on creativity, its not based on a book 2. Reaity, its the only show where it shows the characters choose their fate. 3. Backstory, it has flashbacks that are enough of a back story, not an entire episode's time like LOST. 4. Danger, they switch enemies ever so often, each time getting more and more powerful and dangerous, yet while Walt struggles to keep his spot in the king lineup and focuses to get there himself, with every takeout/move he makes getting more dangerous and powerful himself. the only movies good with one enemy through the series are Harry Potter, The Walking Dead (which has more than one zombie), The Mummy (remake, first two), and Batman (The joker's returning) 5. It really happens, things like this, can happen, unlike medieval time that... 6. It has a point, You feel things, pain, regrets (and there not coming from buying the seasons) but you feel what the character feels, it makes you feel like your right there with them in the fight. Like 3D but its not... 7. Acting, Bryan Cranston was amazing even in Malcom, no one could be that good, Aaron Paul is a perfect junkie, Matt Jones plays Badger perfectly. Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte, there all perfect, enough said there... 8. They end the show before it gets out of hand, its gonna end in sixteen episodes, sixteen heart-racing downfall episodes that lead to mist, with one question... What happened to Walt? What is going to happen to him? I bet if this show would have eighteen books thud make twenty-two seasons, put two books in one season, simple as that, before they get out of hand, more realistic. Now The Walking Dead, I also think is better but I thought Breaking Bad would make a good example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the Hodor is George R.R. Martin When You Need Him?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Game of Thrones's first 4 seasons were great on my end. However, season 5 slowly but surely started to disappoint me tremendously. It became mediocre shock value because the father that inspired this show was absent in writing it. Hopefully wishing D&amp;D would get their act together was not helpful. Not even season 6 could make me lift a buttery popcorn finger. Therefore, I am going to read the books instead. Also, I want to belittle the show for the lack of accents making much sense in some of the cast members' mouths. It sounds as if Game of Thrones's fictional characters never conformed to accents at all. For example, Ireland has that usual rolling of the Rs and quick speaking. Think of Northern and Southern Ireland having English, borderline American, German, Scottish, French, etc. accents crammed into it with an equal amount of people with them. That is Game of Thrones for you. So, that is an error in it, I believe. Yes, Peter Dinklage is a more-than- good actor on my end. Still, he fails to successfully mimic that accent he professionally has to create. People seem to delve into Tyrion's characteristics in the televised show whilst I disappointingly see he never will become Tyrion in the books. So, I feel half-good and half- bad when Peter's portraying him. Sansa (Sophie Turner) is a one-liner bad joke that can not be any where near Queen Elizabeth I of England's intelligence, grace, or attitude. Totally not getting how some people would think that what so ever. I am definitely not talking poorly of the actress, only the actress's character she does. Arya's (Maisie Williams) character development has weakened and strengthened in season 6, which equally disappointed and satisfied me a bit. Please do not get me started on Daenerys (Emilia Clarke)... Emilia is fabulous in creativity and being interesting, though. Okay, now to my personally more important matter to show here. Ramsay (Iwan Rheon). Iwan Rheon is not being taken seriously enough, in my opinion, regardless of his ability to know how to be extremely cruel and interesting though he claims to be nice in real life. Ramsay in the televised show is a watered down version of the Ramsay in the books. Which, that in itself, baffles and disappoints me highly. He pulled too many Joffreys, and then he ultimately became the boring borderline Joffrey I cared less for during and after season 5. Total yawner right there. By the way, Joffrey's actor accomplished making me dislike his fictional character automatically. The only characters there were decent in the show were Olenna, Varys, Littlefinger, Margaery, Cersei, Gilly, and Sam to me. The books had better ones for my preference. Also, kudos to Sam for stealing that sword to rebel against his father's brashness. That father and that son are probably polar opposites utterly. Contrariwise, Ned (Sean Bean) had the most healthy relationship with his children versus other families. His death didn't affect me emotionally. But, his passion for justice did. Of course, Littlefinger perhaps thought he would die sooner or later. Then when opportunity arose, Catlyn could potentially be his. Littlefinger got GoT'd, so Peytr and Catlyn wouldn't be K-I- S-S-I-N-G or doing much of any thing /intimate/. If any character gets GoT'd, nothing happy happens to them. But, Game of Thrones GoT'd me too much with disappointment. I crave traumatic experiences that are artistic. Only George R.R. Martin has perfected that skill on paper these days for me. Sure, there may be other writers out there. But, oh well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but hugely overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was recommended Game of Thrones by many friends quoting it to be 'the best series ever' and 'better than breaking bad'. I hoped they were right and marathoned the first 2 seasons, I always found myself waiting for something to happen but it never came, only at the very end of the second series did I find myself being remotely interested in the proceedings. Now after just finishing season 3 I have changed my outlook slightly, Season 3 is infinitely better than 1 &amp; 2, this isn't to say it is now brilliant it's just not as awful as before. Season 3 still has it's flaws in the seemingly endless trials of Bran and Sam. Four characters make the third season passable, Daenerys Targaryen's story of her and her dragons is brilliant, The hound and Arya's story line is good, but the best character in season 3 is Ramsay Snow played by Iwan Rheon his psychotic and creepy personality is genius. I find myself only becoming interested when any of these combinations of characters are on screen, all others with exception of Tyrion bore me.I believe that GoT is a good series but is way overrated by many people, too hyped up and above all else a bit boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hands off the Royal Set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching, 'The Game of Thongs ? ah ? Thrones', after we managed to get a hold of a case full of DVDs covering previous boobs?shows. At first, I felt the only reason for producing this program was to display young Medieval Boobs, so I just had to watch the first episode all the way to the end. After watching the first show, my inclination was that there was no plot, yet digging deeper between the cleavages, I discovered a very intriguing boob?plot. I discovered there were only a few sets of important boobs, the rest were only clever viewer distractions, I will call these - diversionary boobs. Oh, and I will admit, I was taken in by this ploy. Let's face it, there were big boobs, little boobs and even middle-of-the-road boobs?it was like being lost in a vast forest of boobs - how was I to know which were important and which were not? One day my head was spinning trying to figure things out and then it hit me. I noticed that there was a set of royal boobs soaking in milk. This was that eureka moment for me. It was apparent that these two stars were attached to some queen or some sub-queen or something. In any case, I knew these boobs were important. I recognized these as the controlling boobs. One would say they might be nestled in the protective confines of the royal bra. Envy and jealousy forced several sub-boobs into squabbling battles and dangerous alliances - some of which are successful and some are not. All these actions have the endgame goal of wrestling the royal boobs from their protective cups and placing one set of sub-boobs into ultimate control. I kid - truthfully?this is a well directed show and it is very entertaining. The acting is superb with a story that is so intense and spellbinding?the viewer will soon becomes entrenched with all the characters. I will admit, I did not like the show at first?I was such a boob. I am hooked and am now a fan. So ? folks ? keep up the excellent work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buy the book and watch the show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never written an IMDb review before. I find myself needing to because I am pretty enamored by the start of this series and I know there are many other nerds like me who will love it, just waiting to know if the show is worthy of a watch...IT IS!!! First off, I just got done re-reading the series in anticipation of the release of the newest book which is due out this summer. So, for the last couple weeks I have done little more than read these four huge books. When someone asks me who my favorite author is I tell them George RR Martin, because of this series. The books bring an entire world to life, if you haven't' read them, I recommend highly that you do. That being said, this adaptation seems to be very well done, so far (I have only watched the first episode, though). First, I want to note that I HATE watching a bad version of a good book! Likewise, I hate watching a copy that tries to be a doppelganger of the book (thinking of the Twilight movies here). What I look for is someone to bring the characters to life, and show me more. Whether more something is additional to the story that I read, or only a better depth depends on the movies' production crew, I suppose. For me, thus far, I have enjoyed HBO's interpretation of the faces of the characters and I have seen the storyline followed pretty well, without it being so exact that it just reminded me why reading the story is usually the better option. Bottom line: a good start for a great story! If you, like me, find yourself wanting to see more subscribe to HBO and let them know that you want them to continue with this storyline. THANK YOU HBO for doing such a great job creating visual version of my well loved story (and many thanks to Mr. Martin for writing it, and finally publishing the continuation). Buy the book and watch the show!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched GoT from the start, and sometimes I have been absolutely captivated. Had a wobble at Craster's Keep, but decided to give the show another chance.There's always been that sense of sexploitation in GoT. Apologists say that this is just how the world of Westeros is; a very violent, very misogynistic place. People in general are treated badly. But here's the thing, in GoT world, men may be slaughtered horribly, children may be threatened and slaughtered horribly. But only one gender gets threatened, raped, humiliated and slaughtered on a regular basis. And that's a bit peculiar when you think about it.Male rape happens in the most horrible of horrible worlds, as does child rape. But it never appears in Westeros because, quite rightly, most viewers would thoroughly object. So if it's not OK to depict male rape or child rape in a fantasy world, why is it OK to depict female rape in the same situation? Because the audience is used to it? Because the audience accepts it? Because certain parts of the audience may even like it? Sexual abuse as screen filler seems particularly cynical when it has no background in the source material, but covers a very real issue in later GoT; with the charismatic and clever villains gone, the story is slowing a lot. No amount of sexual violence is going totake the place of pace.Bring on the dragons and the white walkers because if we can't have good writing, we might as well have great effects - and if we can't afford to get the audience used to high fantasy blow-outs, what's the answer? More women screaming and sobbing? Don't bother on my account. Whatever I'm watching, it won't be more of this.</fullReview>

Terrible cast except 2-3 actors, slow development of the plots which are ultra diluted and have very late resolutions, not to mention the dose of pornography and incest which could have been suggested not shown in excess. The explicit contentdiminish the fantasy effect of the stories. Winter is coming for 4 seasons, I was hoping Sean Bean will be alive when winter was coming. By the look of it all the main characters will die before winter. We get it the evil characters live longer than the good ones, but they tend to stop in their character development becoming predictable. Like bad acting was not enough there are hundreds of unnecessary monologues and tiny intrigues to ''feast'' your ears. Apparently 6 millions per episode can't change that and for some it's money well spent. Here is a suggestion: Put the money into more Dragon's scenes and more North of the wall scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filth - do not trick yourself into thinking otherwise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know my opinion is not popular, but let's be honest: GoT is nothing but filthy, violent porn trash. I am not telling you not to watch, if you are voyeuristic and like naked women getting raped/molested/etc. or - even worse - getting power-lusty and suddenly enjoying sex with their barbaric Dothraki husband just to get more might... go on watching it, but do not trick yourself and others into believing that this is art/high literature/merely fantasy genre etc. - it is the disgusting, repulsive fantasies of an old, fat, horny guy, dreaming of naked women and violent/coarse knights - little boy fantasies mixed with hormone shifts, it is a creation by the worst of mankind, about the worst of mankind (the only character you can possibly truly respect is Brienne and she is presented like a man because the makers seem to think it is unfeminine to fight and not to be just a sexy playboy bunny enjoying to be f'ed by a barbaric horse rider, playing Queen and running around naked all the time) and obviously for the worst of mankind - pure filth which poisons everybody who watches it and the proof is that fans actually believe they are watching art - ridiculous, the worst on television. Watch it, but be aware and honest that you are watching filth/trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>extraordinary show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a series lover, and want to see exciting series which is filled with a lot of drama, romance, ego, conspiracy and what not, this show is seriously meant for you guys. The show is based on the lives of the people who are fighting for the throne-and, one who will sit on the throne will be the ruler of The Seven Kingdoms. This show is a historical fiction with supernatural happenings like the white walkers (the dead walking ice man) who are ready to kill, and even the dragons. The show is filled with a lot of good dialogues and the casting actors have played their role very well. This show i.e. Game of Thrones is a must watch show and will leave a lasting mark on your memory. Hence, I strongly recommend all the viewer to at least give it a try and sink in its beauty. You won't regret!!!!</fullReview>

It's like HBO kept preciously all the feelings, sensations we were expecting this season ... and found a way to amplify them and send them back to me in one hour ... As already written by another reviewer, this episode is the one that marked me the most since the beginning of GOT ... I certainly agree that not everyone felt like me, but i really did feel the adrenaline in my veins ...HBO made us drive a roller coaster this season, and i have reached the top of it a few minutes ago ....One can say many things about GOT. This kind of show isn't the type of shows i usually appreciate, but i can't deny GOT is the one and only show that's "playing" with my body and my soul of such a way.</fullReview>

I actually enjoy watching the game of throne since I just watched all the season in 3 days, I felt that this was a great series so I imagine that the book would be epic. I am this type of person who does not care about criticizing other show if I do not like it, so I am looking forward toward your response especially from all this big fan of the book too.

Where are the kids from Deepwood Moat that help the young Stark boys escape? I have read the series 4 times now and never remember the dragons getting stolen. How do these changes help the story for TV??? It is fun to watch the story made into a mini-series, but I think I'm done watching. They should call it something different, if they are gonna change it so much from the books. I'm really disappointed. They could have done better and, at this point, I don't understand the walk away from the original storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great Great series. What makes this series so great is that you never know what will happen. In some series/movies you know XXX is the good guy and they will never die. They will always win. It takes out the suspense. Instead of wondering if your guy will win, you just watch to see HOW they will when. In the GOW everything goes. No one is safe or secure. It is one of the first series where no one ( except those who have read the books) knows what will happen. For example, we have Ed Stark at the beginning. He is the guy featured on the posters. He is the King's hand. At the end of the 1st season, he dies. Now there will be those who are disappointed, but for me I thought it was a perfect ending. Jeffery, the king's son, didn't know he was a bastard and what Stark said was treason. It shocked the audience and made me extremely happy. I have read the wiki for the next book and let me say... STAY TUNED!! There is nothing but surprises and twist ahead!! I am loving this series and sad I have to wait for Season 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I would like to say that I have not read the book so how much it stays true to the books is not something I have considered. With that being out of the way I am a huge fan of fantasy stories, mostly high fantasy but also low fantasy.Game of Thrones although considered high fantasy feels a lot like low fantasy in the sense that it is not so much about fantasy creatures such as dragons and orcs, although those do exist, but rather much more about political intrigues of various powerful families and in that sense reminded me more about medieval times and how the monarchies fought each other.However Game of Thrones is set in an imaginary world and definitely has supernatural elements so in effect it could be the perfect mix of fantasy and realistic story. And although the series is quite good I feel it falls short in two key areas.One is that it often feels anti-climactic. Many of the important key plots are often concluded in a very short time, after a very long and slow buildup, which for me has left me quite unsatisfied. I can't go into details as that would be a spoiler but let's just say that there are things that you have waited for the entire season, just to finish quickly and with a whimper rather than a bang.The second key area where it fails are the battles. Most of the them situations are resolved very quickly and in many times not even shown at all. Rather it is built up slowly, sometimes over several episodes, and once it actually happens you don't see anything! Rather it is just explained, after the fact, what the outcome was. I think, after watching three seasons, I saw one battle which was satisfying to watch and even that comes nowhere near the epic battles of movies like Lord of the Rings or even Spartacus (the series).And for a fantasy story, be it high or low, it is inexcusable to have such poor battle depiction and the main reason why I scored it a 7 rather than a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think GoT has run out of steam :( oh well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Started out very well. 1st season was gripping, witty, entertaining. Season 2 and 3 were also quite good. I was very keen on watching every episode as soon as possible.But from season 3 to season 5 negatives of the show have increased as positives became tiresome or non existent.Many boring episodes consisting of pointlessly long torture scenes mixed with action scenes and repetitiveness.The show has become convoluted and tries to fit in too much. Subplots don't work well. Character development suffers in place of shock scenes. I don't particularly care for any of the characters anymore. Which is all disappointing.Season 5 I did not enjoy much past the first few episodes (they were good though).If I wanted cliffhangers and a budgeted formula, I'd watch the CW or some superhero crap; it isn't far off right now. I feel like HBO and the producers have settled on their success and aren't going to be putting in the quality they had originally. Sucks for the people jumping on board now and putting in their best.The show was right up there with Breaking Bad, maybe not as good. But definitely a winner worthy of 7.5+ stars, but now? I guess I'll watch it? A resounding "meh" for the show in its current state.</fullReview>

More sex scenes too, like Spartacus. Also more blood and fighting. More nudity would also add more spark to the show.Stark Senior is a great actor for his part, there should be more opportunities to make him appear like a main character, particularly special in my opinion.Making the show more scenic and putting emphasis on improving the quality of music would also make the show nicer, Loving the show.

		<fullReview>This show is probably one of my favorite shows of all time. I even started reading the books and guess what! The show is almost completely identical. I don't know what people are talking about when they say it is leaving out a lot of stuff. Yes, there is stuff being left out but stuff that is not really necessary to put in the show. Also, a lot of people are saying this show has way too much sex and I don't know what they are talking about. You want to see a show with a lot of sex? Watch Spartacus. That is a show with a lot of sex and it is way more graphic.The story is amazing. It puts you on edge and always makes you wonder what is going to happen. The characters are really well written and the actors they chose for them are perfect.I just think a lot of people are uncomfortable with sex and violence. If that is the case, this show isn't for you. If you don't mind seeing some sex scenes, a few disturbing scenes(one?), fantasy, amazing character designs, and amazing cinematography then this show is perfect for you. I love it and I think it is amazingly written.I am just going to say again, THIS SHOW IS NO WHERE NEAR PORNOGRAPHY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good show. I like that the show kept close with the books. But I think "The Song of Ice and Fire" deserved more. If HBO built a small part of Rome for the similar show, they could have invested more here. Maybe they were hit by the crisis or they simply failed to foresee the great potential of the story. I understand they can't afford the LOTR visual effects or John Woo for fighting scenes, but all that close filming angles and the lack of panorama create a feeling that we're watching a theater play on a stage. Almost all the scenes (e.g.: the Wall, the Hand Tournament, the Cloud Castle) could have offered much more greatness with just a few extra money (or maybe imagination). I'm afraid to think how the epic battles scenes will look (if any). I'm sure GoT brings enough audience to HBO (the book fans community is large enough) to make them invest more in the following series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers I find this show entertaining enough to watch, but I don't understand the hype. probably because a lot of fans of the books like it and think it's true to the authors words. But, I never heard about it, so I started watching fresh and to be honest, it took me about 3 episodes to get into it. I had the feeling I was watching a mediocre acting crew of a mediocre story from a soap opera in the middle ages. I think it's fairly well made, the settings are nice a lot of the times, but that doesn't make it an outstanding series. Sean Bean is good in his role, but he's born for these kind of parts. But the rest, well, sorry to say, it's just mediocre acting and a very thin storyline, even not always edited very well. a 7 for the way it is visually brought and the fact that it did entertain me enough to sit the 10 episodes trough, but for the rest I think it's overrated.</fullReview>

Only after much recommendation by my friends i went for this one. The casting, Direction, Acting, Screenplay and action scenes are just top level. The best thing is that you can't just leave it after watching one episode, it will surely hook you up. My personal favourite is TYRION LANNISTER , he is the next best thing to SHERLOCK played by BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH . Jon Snow is awesome as is Daenerys Targerean.

		<shortDescription>Not even close to braveheart - i don't like GOT that much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before everybody watched GOT, my brother told me that i woudnt like it because it is too slow. At some point a girl told me that i had to watch it. I did like it but i did agree with my brother. It is too damn slow. Season 1 starts off pretty cool, but during that season u never really see the "things" u see in the first few minutes of season 1After season 1 i was hoping for the big battle coming in season 2, The big build towards the big fight. When season 2 ended i started to dislike this series. Just because nothing happened in season 2. Really, ppl Always go crazy when i say that. The fight in season 2 was nothing, because it was a failed attempt, so it didn't chance much in the story (and they didn't even show anything cool during that fight). Only the end of season 2 is kinda cool and makes u want to watch season 3. Season 3... Well im still disappointed. I hoped for so much more! At least it was much better than season 2. Having "the red wedding" as biggest happening in season 3, is kinda lame. Yes some main characters die but it was kinda predictable and not close compared to the biggest event in a series like "Dexter" or "super natural". In my opinion: - GOT is way too slow (maybe this is because in real life nothing happens really fast, i don't know but its not fun to watch). I think seeing kalesi during 2 scenses in 1 episode for only 1 minute where she doesn't really do anything, isn't that interesting. - GOT is too predictable. So far i could predict a lot. Yes of course i didn't know about the thing with "jaime lannister" or with "eddard stark" but most of it is just too simple. - GOT has no (fun) action. There are no big battles, like in LOTR. There are not even cool small fights. I think that is a much in this type of series/movie.I told my story to a friend who is a big fan, he is reading all the books etc... I told him that he should pick a random episode from season 2 or 3 and that he should write down everything that happened in that episode. He did and he said that it was quite a list. So when i saw what he wrote down, i started to laugh, stuff like: "joffrey got send to his room". Maybe thats the first that he isn't really the boss, but in every episode before that one, was it leading towards that same thing. Also tyrion lannister kinda did it multiple times. It isn't a big event, maybe its important for the story but that doesn't make it that big of a deal, specially when its done before and predictable. Ppl tell me that i just don't get it and that the politics are really important. GOT isn't hard to understand (thats not something negative). Braveheart has so much more of everything. Even though i don't like it that much, i still think GOT is a must see. Just because everybody is watching it and because its still fun to watch. Its just not that great as everybody thinks it is (opinion, i guess)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2nd season was disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Season one of Game of Thrones was easily the best fantasy TV series I have ever watched. The acting, the visuals, the costumes were all extraordinary, and while there were departures from George R.R. Martin's source material, even these departures seem to me to have served the larger sweep and purposes of the epic. I give it a 10.But what happened in season two? Everything was great except the story falls apart again and again. (Spoilers!) The most blatant plotting error is arguably the burning of Winterfell. Who burned it, and why? The Iron men were on their way out the door to accept peace terms. We're given no hint that Roose Bolton's bastard son is anything other than a loyal Northman. I was totally confused (and a bit shocked) until I read the book.Other head-scratchers: How does Stannis Baratheon make it from the walls of the Red Keep back to Dragonstone? What made Sansa decide not to leave with Sandor Clegane? She seems in the series quite ready to go.The plot changes aren't all bad. For instance I found the transformation of Danaerys' stay in Qarth compelling and well-fitted to the larger story. But compared to season one, the writing in two is inferior and made the show hard to watch at times. Please, HBO, allow this series enough screen time to breath...and have a talk with your writers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why these additional SCENES?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I must say I was pleasantly surprised the first few episodes of this series as to how well it represented the book. I thought the casting was outstanding, the acting impressive and the scenes beautifully executed. One of those few novel-to-screen adaptations that represented exactly what the author portrayed. However, the most recent episode I've watched(epi 5 the wolf and the lion) disappointed and shocked me! Firstly-the homosexual relationship between Renly and Loras was not only an addition not mentioned in the book but didn't seem to add anything to the plot. If anything, I am concerned it will complicate the storyline and betrays their characters! Renly is self conscious and whiney-not reflective of his robust and outgoing personality in the book, and in the book Loras was a hit with the ladies so I don't see what the purpose of adding that was. Don't misinterpret this as homophobia of any sort, I simply feel it was untrue to the book. And the second scene that bothered me was between Cersei and Robert. There was never such an intimate and friendly encounter between them represented ANYWHERe in the book as the scene where she practically counseled him on his decision to attack Dany. This scene in the show portrayed them, while not as in love, as friendly and almost a mutual respect that completely contradicts with their relationship. The Robert in the book would never have listened to her and she couldn't have stood to have spoken to him without the acrid and sarcastic demeanor she always appears to exhibit towards him. Up to the point I've been so impressed but frankly this episode outrages me! Mr Martin signed off on this??? I hope this episode is an exception and it will resume its close reliance on the actual story as he wrote it so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great acting, great photography, setting and story! The creativity and imagination is a joy to watch. I give this 2 stars due to the raunchy nature of the script, and its strong misogynistic elements that are in just about every episode. It seems to render this story much more a film of our age, rather than a timeless classic that it could be. Incidentally, if this is a mirror of our times, then we are headed for some dark days indeed. Some say Frankenstein was pushing the boundaries back in the day, and the violent 70's screamer horror films was another genre that pushed the boundaries. Screamer horror films evolved, and those old screamers are a rare sight these days. The same will happen to this series. We will move on, and evolve. I'm glad I didn't invest my money in the production.It makes me also quite sad to think the level of lack of respect shown in this series is required to gain public attention, which I don't believe is true. I think it cheapens the series, and is definitely unnecessary. My toes cringe every time a scene that is clearly sadistic and unnecessary comes on.A great story, told well and photographed beautifully, is all that is needed. This series has lost 2 viewers from my household after watching just Series 2 for these reasons. We doubt much will improve, and fear it will only get worse. After reading some reviews, it seems to be the case. We'll be moving onto far more worthy programs such as True Detective and Penny Dreadful - great story telling, great acting, photography and scenes that remain in line with the story itself. The Hobbit film trilogy will remain my firm favourite in terms of fantasy epics - a film that holds its integrity without relying on naked bodies and sadistic shock tactics to sell it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is an intricate and interesting story that thrives off of shock, titillation, and disgust. It brings out the worst of human emotions within the characters and is a poor influence on the minds of its watchers (people who mostly just want an epic fantasy). The attention that this series has gained is an unfortunate reflection on our society. While I can understand the allure of such an expansive world with many amazing qualities of a good fantasy, I cannot personally support a series that makes light of nudity, women, rape, and violence. My rating is for the quality of the story as well as the cinematography. I hope that people everywhere will recognize the effects that this series has on their thoughts and emotions as they become immersed in this filth. I also hope that parents will recognize the importance of avoiding bringing these sorts of influences into the home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Las episode of season 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering episode 9 I was expecting much more from the season finale unfortunately there's only two words that can describe this last episode BIG DISAPPOINTMENT ... if you add to that, that we have to wait one year for the next episode / season it becomes more than that, it becomes TOTAL FAILURE with the added bonus of ruining the whole thing. So besides being total crap the actual story didn't develop much as you would expect from a season finale episode but on the contrary it left a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT feeling. The show is one of the best currently there's no denying in that and it had up's and down's like all have and so far it was good and entertaining, too bad about this last episode it was like the creators run out of ideas / lack of inspiration / professionalism. I can understand to leave some things unresolved that creates the desire to see next season in viewers but to add new stuff and let them also (totally) unexplained is amateur work, it should have been an "explosive" season finale considering the previous episode which was very good and raised my expectations for the finale a lot. I wont probably remember next year to watch the next season because of the bitterness I felt with this season finale. Shame ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From storyline to production an amazing product (Season 1)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge movies fan and when it comes to TV shows till recently I didn't follow any specific show, the first season of Game of Thrones was the ticket for me back to the TV arena.I will start by saying that I literally advised to most of my friends and family to view the show. were it the production, screen writing or casting I can't give a credit to only one it's the whole that made the show what it was. immediately after viewing the show I have read the entire book series and was amazed to realize that there were barely slight differences between the first book to the first season - a thing that is known to be very difficult to find.The show's storyline is thrilling and keep you on your toes from episode to episode, for anyone that loves medieval theme or/and political struggle with a bit of fantasy in it this is the perfect show.This is till the second season. People say the higher the expectation the harder the blow is, but in my opinion it wasn't the expectations that made the second season a failure (in comparison to the first one)rather a misread of the audience. I regret to say that in my opinion the team behind the show decided to sacrifice storyline to advance minor affairs between the characters. tweaking the story and the way it effects the characters - and even worse killing or even removing characters in from the books.I don't know how will they be able to fix it but while the first season is on the rating of 10 for me the second is barely reaching the 6.would recommend seeing the first season alone and read the rest - hoping for the third season to get better again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sooooo slow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of the hoopla over this show I have downloaded and watched the first two series.Boy, is it slow... like watching a ship move out of its mooring, it's slow! Blackadder is much better than this and it also has Lord Flashheart.The best character is the dwarf with his horrendous accent that makes Dick Van Dyke's Cockney waanker in Mary Poppins sound word-perfect! I can't believe that not one of the almost entirely British cast didn't have the balls or dignity to sidle up to the director and mention this awful, catastrophic and annoying accent. Was he doing it on purpose as some kind of joke?Anyway, that aside, these hour-long episodes could easily have been edited down to 20 minutes or so, without anyone losing a moment of plot significance. Nothing much happens except people chat about the past and make plans for wars.Lots of men hugging when they haven't seen each other for a long time or they are going off to battle, etc... something else I'm pretty sure never happened in the olden days. Overall, even after you list every other fault this mess has, the biggest one still remains the most significant... it's just dull. There is just so much boring dialog to wade through before anything happens.I can't complete any more of this torture. I'll wait for the movie version.</fullReview>

But still a very good show. There are actors in this that were in Lord of the rings. This show is awesome. See it. It is a great show. I need more lines and I am running out of things to say. This a great show. Peter Dinklage is a great actor. Lena Heady is a great actress. David Benioff is not greateast writer but he is OK. I give this show 5 out 10. See this show it is very scary.

		<shortDescription>Simply great for the most part but can be tiring and confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually I would give it 7.5 out of 10 if I could. It - to me was a bit like Sons of Anarchy in that it took a while to get in to and work out what is really happening. There are times when verbose confusing conversation dullens the sensual-ness of the awe inspiring scenery and sexy beyond words boys and girls. To clarify a point I have read in past reviews that this is set in a medieval time. No nothing can be further from the truth. Medieval times were a set period in human history from the 5th to the 15th century. I don't recall ever when they specify the time or date in GoT, this is not human history it is fantasy that is 'Reminiscent' of that time. The suggestion that there is too much Gratuitous sex is also to my mind incorrect. There is indeed a lot of Nudity and some sex but it isn't soft porn by any stretch of the imagination. The reason GoT sucks you in is that we develop personal likes and dislikes toward certain characters much like football teams and when a much loved character is murdered it seems almost unbelievable so of course your emotional side requires you to seek reprisal for the fallen by watching further until next thing you know the whole series is over. If it wasn't for the dull conversations about what King owns what land and did what to whom I would easily have given this 9.9 out of 10 but unfortunately that is not so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rousing entertainment for our baser natures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am enjoying this series immensely, but at the same time I feel a little guilty about that, as it is very, very shrewdly and deliberately calculated to be a kind of "carnival of depravity" appealing to all our baser instincts.It's probably a combination of the work of both George Martin and the TV writers, but virtually EVERY situation and almost every character is calculatedly twisted to come up with the most unsavory or grotesque slant possible.Just off the top of my head and in no particular order: (SPOILERS HERE) A cunning, duplicitous courtier is also an accomplished and cruel pimp; a seemingly noble order of watchmen is made up mainly of rejects and rapists; an elderly holy man is dragged out of bed with a prostitute and revealed to be a deceitful liar; a mad queen breast-feeds her too-old-for-it and obviously mentally disturbed child while giving audiences; almost all plot exposition is delivered while characters have vigorous sex with prostitutes; A beautiful Queen and a handsome Knight are revealed to be incestuous twins and unspeakably evil monsters who cripple an adventurous little boy; an exiled Prince is a loathsome selfish jerk who wants to pimp his sister out to a savage barbarian warlord; that warlord kills an enemy by ripping his tongue out of his throat and pours molten gold over the jerk-Prince's head; an exiled knight is a slave-trader; a prodigal son comes home to his abusive family and unwittingly sexually fondles his sister; a brutal warrior had his face hideously burnt in childhood by his even more brutal brother; when the brutal brother loses a joust, he hacks off his horse's head; a favorite knight of the ladies is revealed to be the gay lover of a king; a clever, disenfranchised younger son of a ruler is also a whore-monger, an alcoholic AND a dwarf for good measure; a beloved ruler is executed abruptly; a young king turns out to be a Caligula-style psychopath; a gentle retarded man is shown hopping around nude with a giant dangling sex organ; a ruler of a wilderness castle rapes and impregnates his daughters, granddaughters AND great granddaughters and leaves his male offspring in the snow for monsters to take; every other throne room seen looks more like a dungeon than a place used for running a kingdom... It's SO over-the-top grotesque it's almost laughable. I could go on and on with these types of examples, too. There are dozens of little shocking moments like these in every episode. About the only gross medieval cliché they don't pile on is The Black Death.The show is fancy, expensively made exploitation for a mass audience that outdoes in shock value even the kind that in the more refined and restrained past was presented only in cheap lurid grindhouse and drive-in flicks. It's exploitation, but it not so much exploiting any particular person or group, as it is exploiting our natural human appetites for the bizarre, the disturbing, the tragic and the twisted. It's the same set of primal impulses that made the Roman arena such a blockbuster. It's the same instincts that make us slow down and rubberneck for blood and bodies when we pass a traffic accident.People look at this kind of ultra-violent, depraved stuff and assume it is very historically accurate and realistic to "the way it was" in our own medieval times, but to tell the truth, it's greatly exaggerated. It's taken in the same way that people claimed the "mud and rags" graphic approach to the Italian spaghetti westerns of the 60s was realistic, even though that genre was just as far fetched in its own opposing way as the ultra-clean cut westerns of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers. It would be like people in the far future thinking that Rambo movies and porno flicks were accurate representations of life in the late 20th and early 21st century, because "civilization wasn't as advanced back then".Game Of Thrones is pretty much the famous gory "Black Knight scene" from Monty Python &amp; The Holy Grail, only running for dozens of hours, &amp; played not for laughs, but in dead seriousness. It tries SO hard to constantly outdo its own horrors and titillation and exuberantly and gleefully wallows in negative images and emotions.Don't get me wrong, I am really entranced by the show. Being human, I am not immune to vicariously enjoying strife, sex, violence and grotesqueness, but I can't help feel a little sad that the envelope has been pushed yet further and to nervously wonder what even greater vileness will come to our screens in the future.This is very low, crude and base entertainment, cynically made by jaded imaginations to cash in on our inner savages. It's not at all uplifting, enlightening or inspiring. But it certainly is entertaining. If you like this sort of thing, then this is the sort of thing you will LOVE.I would definitely not allow anyone younger than 18 to watch this. I don't feel this way about too many mass market movies or TV shows, but I definitely think this series could be harmful to a child or young teen's psyche.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing some key scenes..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, English is not my main language, so.. forgive my mistakes.I read the first book about 6 months ago and i absolutely love it. Drama, war, amazing characters (and a lot), deep and original story. When I first hear about the Adaptation, I was very Happy, because HBO has a great history of making Epic Series (Band of Brothers, The Pacific and many others) and this one can't be different.After watch the first episode, I was concerned because they rushed too much and I know that people who don't read the book would be lost, like my girlfriend did.. but, they really choose well the actors and the atmosphere was perfect (medieval, but with a nice touch of fantasy).If the history don't get you attention and you don't try very hard to understand, the first 3 or 4 episodes may be very "boring", because is very hard to understand what is the 7 kingdoms and how big they are..After watch all the 10 episodes, I was pleased, but some key battle scenes have been changed and bother me: I) the fight of the Tywin Lannister against the small army that Robb Stark send to distract him.. where they adapt the scene in a way that Tyrion Lannister don't made nothing.. just "sleep" thru the whole battle.II) and the Riverrun Battle, who the series don't show and it is the biggest and complex fight of the First Book (Game of Thrones), where Robb annihilate Jaime Lannister army and capture him..Anyway.. most of the scenes was a really great adaptation, except the "random porn scenes", with don't seems like medieval nudity.. just regular light porn. I give a 7, because the book is way better.</fullReview>

To much dead people and probably only Lanister's will be live people in the end of series. Only good characters in series are dead Edard and Rob Stark. I think that the names of castles in Westeros are simple Kings landing ex. and obviously the Westeros is middle age England i guess Winterfall is Northumbria for ex. And the VIKINGS are so much better the GOT. P.s. Sorry for my English, it's not my first language. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Good But Sensationalized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I must say that I have never seen a television show on the scale of game of thrones. The sets effects and costumes are amazing and really bring the world described in the books to life. Everyone, especially the child actors, are extremely well cast and all give convincing performances. The story is compelling and does make you want to see more however, for me, there are a few things that let this series down. Do not get me wrong, I love many American series and films, however, no one, not even the Americans themselves, can say they are known for being subtle (or particularly realistic). The sex in this series is gratuitousness and feels like its just been thrown in because they think the audience will get bored if there isn't something going on every second. This really detracts from the realism of not only the events but also the relationships between the characters. I know that a certain amount of sex and violence comes with the genre and I didn't think the violence was too bad however, I find it hard to sympathize with characters where the majority of their personality centres around sexuality (e.g.constantly using prostitutes or raping women every five seconds). To be fair, however, the non-sexual relationships, such as between ayra and her father feel genuine and real. In short, I think game of thrones is a very good series and one I will definitely watch the second series of however, I feel the sensationalism detracts from the reality of the characters and their relationships.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George R. R. Martin books are a well written but often tedious read. He has created a rich lore world that feels like a medieval Europe but with a hint of fantasy with a large cast of characters. And this is often the problem to many characters with to many parts to play. But the HBO adaptation filters out a lot of the tedium and condenses it into a very gripping show. It almost feels like the Sopranos set in Middlearth.The only problem that I can see with the show is the knowledge of what I know is coming from the books. And I know who dies and what happens and I think the non-book reading fans of the show will be very unhappy with some of the major characters just being killed off on almost a whim by Martin's trying to shock style of writing. And come the second season they will feel that there aren't really any likable characters to care about any more. So we may see lower viewing figures when popular characters are killed off.And will HBO really carry out the show to the end is another big problem. We are four books into the adventure with the fifth coming this summer and no resolve on any of the plot points, Martin is making this a 7 book epic, so will HBO run this for 7 season? That is why I give it a 8 because of what the future could bring for the shows production. But so far a very enjoyable show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's why the HBO series is so true to the book:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the book's author, George R.R. Martin, was very much involved (as series writer &amp; co- executive producer) in the HBO series' creation (which is likely why it's taken so long for him to release the next book in A Song of Ice and Fire). And second, the serial format is ideal for maintaining fidelity to the spirit of Martin's wonderful story. A major challenge faced by the creators of the Lord of the Rings (LotR) films was the amount of material they had to cull from Toliken's epic tale in order to fit into three relatively short films. The serial format provided by HBO eliminates this problem. In fact, nothing would please me more than to see a PROPER adaptation of LotR filmed in this way. Another pleasing aspect of this series is the obvious devotion to quality. By hiring a world class production designer (Gemma Jackson) and a slate of top-notch English actors, the creators of Game of Thrones have been able to re-create Martin's world in a beautiful and convincing way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I continue let me just say - I DO ENJOY GAME OF THRONES ! HOWEVER, having absolutely loved series 1 I find the second series a little disappointing. My mistake was to read the second novel BEFORE the series started to air and I find that I am missing some of the characters who I think add to the plot. Where are Meera and Jojen for example? Haven't read the third book yet but I can only assume that they may have a pivotal part to play in Brans life! A lot of the characters stories seem to have been changed (Jon Snow, particularly(his screen time doesn't seem to be any shorter but Almost completely altered - where is the incident with Ghost for example?))presumably to fit in to the series schedule but it does detract a little for me.Also - WHERE IS THE ACTION? - battles are totally glossed over. One moment you see Grey Wind lunging at a soldier next moment thousands of bodies lie dead on the battlefield. Individual conflicts are over in a flash (Brienne's escape from Renly's tent for example).Don't get me wrong I love all the intrigue but I do feel its lacking some excitement. Dispense with the nudity and titillation and stick in some good old scraps. Wars aren't (just) won in the bedroom.Despite all this I will continue to watch but it leaves me in a bit of a quandary - do I read the third book when the series has finished (as was my intention) or do I not spoil the 3rd series? Oh decisions, decisions !!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a good show,The characters, story, and plot are just bad. The environment is boring, and dull. This world is nihilism, and its completely unrealistic.The characters aren't gray, they are just dark. No balance in real life between good and evil in ones self.The "good guys" are stupid and brain dead. Its like watching retarded villains (who aren't that smart, and threatening) outsmart, and fly around in circles the brain dead heroes. Death became nothing but a cliché in the show.They have use porn to keep your attention, and fancy visuals.Talk about desperate. The books don't freaking matter,you read the books or not. This show is an adaptation.Season one is slowly paced, and the characters lack any life to them.Example of being unrealistic is Ned Stark.This guy loses credibility.He made three mistakes. Trusting Littlefinger,telling the Queen about her incestuous affair, and lacking any tactics. This guy should be able to spot trouble or problem situations. He doesn't spot them. He simply ignores it. Joffrey would had been assassinated.No one in real life will tolerate him.Royalty can be assassinated, if they stray away. Many revolution happened, and royalty had been killed.The politics in Game of thrones is real retarded. You have to be cunning in order to survive in this world. Villains like Naraku from Inyusha would have zero effort manipulating them. the characters aren't smart.The theme in game of thrones says the more you love the weaker you are. Love makes people strong, and it gives us strength to defile expectations.Even naruto anime series tackles you are nothing without love. I only read two books, and dropped Song of Fire and Ice at the 12 chapter in the third book. I watched season 1-4 for free online(I'm too smart to waste money). The red wedding,and viper vs the mountain did not surprise me. Bad guys in this universe win about 80%. Arya in real life would had been raped,tortured, and then killed. The author chooses who to kill, and gives other characters his divine protection. Martin killing the Red viper is bad writing, and the spear is laced with a poison similar to a neurotoxin.The mountain should have died as well in the arena with Martell. Apparently Martin makes sh@t up as it moves alone.Not thinking for the future of the story.Marin does everything for shock value.The previous score was 5/10 (its average). I was being to kind to the fans. Now the core is 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tasteless, Boring Mess!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NO MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!This review is solely based on the pilot episode. Or should I say the first 35 minutes of it. I know what you all are going to say. I need to let the show get going before I can make a formal review. To that, I say, "Get some expectations, you stupid moron!". I mean, are you kidding? Why should I have to wait? The opening moments of the show should draw you in, and get you invested. Not just be a 35 second shot of a rising gate, and then shifting to a shot of a group of stupid looking barbarians with accents so thick, I can hardly understand them. Then we get a couple of jump scares so pathetic, they won't even scare a 2-year-old, which only serves to show a brief glimpse of a member of a cannibalistic tribe(?). That whole scene was 8 minutes long, and I'm already almost asleep. With IMDb's stupid guidelines, that probably counts as a spoiler, even thought it's way too boring to be one, so I checked the box anyway because I don't want to be put on their blacklist, like I have many times in the past.We then get introduced to some random kingdom with Kit Harington living in it (OH NO!!!), and that's where the plot completely stops. Everything from this point onwards is just boring, uninteresting talking between a bunch of D-List actors sporting accents that only people living in the UK will understand. All the little interest that I had was instantly flushed away, and I was forced to spend the remaining time in the episode desperately trying to figure out the plot, and what was going on.Sadly the excess of talking is only the largest problem in this disaster of a show. Things such as lack of motives, and unlikeable characters only magnify this show's ineptness. As much as I'd like to talk about these things, I don't have all day to do this review, and I have much better things to do in my life than to vent about this stupid show. The visual effects and high production values are the only things saving this show from getting a 1.1/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a show I had heard a lot about, I assumed it was one with a cult following, in fact it has become more and more popular as time and seasons go by, so I decided to get into it as well. Basically the show is based on a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, it is set in the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos in the Seven Kingdoms (the North, the Iron Islands, the Vale, the Westerlands, the Stormlands, the Reach, and Dorne). There are three narratives that go on throughout the show, the first being a civil war among several noble houses for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, the second being attempts to exile the descendants of the ruling dynasty to reclaim the throne, and the third being the rising threat of the inpending winter and fierce creatures and fierce people from the North. Within in the series are several plots and story lines, and a broad ensemble cast of characters, said to be the largest in television history, and winning a Guinness World Record for this. Starring Golden Globe and Emmy winning and four-time nominated Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, twice Emmy nominated Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister, twice Emmy nominated Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen, Kit Harington as Jon Snow, Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark, Iain Glen as Jorah Mormont, Maisie Williams as Arya Stark, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister, John Bradley as Samwell Tarly, Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy, Aidan Gillen as Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish, Jerome Flynn as Bronn, Conleth Hill as Lord Varys, Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister, Rory McCann as Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane, Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, Julian Glover as Grand Maester Pycelle, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon, Michelle Fairley as Catelyn Stark, Isaac Hempstead Wright as Bran Stark, Ian McElhinney as Barristan Selmy, Stephen Dillane as Stannis Baratheon, Ben Crompton as Eddison Tollett, Nathalie Emmanuel as Missandei, Mark Stanley as Grenn, Daniel Portman as Podrick Payne, Liam Cunningham as Davos Seaworth, Richard Madden as Robb Stark, Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrell, Kristian Nairn as Hodor, Sibel Kekilli as Shae, Carice van Houten as Melisandre, Finn Jones as Loras Tyrell, Hannah Murray as Gilly, Rose Leslie as Ygritte, Kristofer Hivju as Tormund Giantsbane, Michael McElhatton as Roose Bolton, Joe Dempsie as Gendry, Jacob Anderson as Grey Worm, Ian Beattie as Meryn Trant, Owen Teale as Alliser Thorne, Vicious's Iwan Rheon as Ramsay Snow, Dominic Carter as Janos Slynt, Donald Sumpter as Maester Luwin, Natalia Tena as Osha, Esmé Bianco as Ros, Brenock O'Connor as Olly, Ron Donachie as Rodrik Cassel, Josef Altin as Pypar, Amrita Acharia as Irri, Eugene Simon as Lancel Lannister, Michiel Huisman as Daario Naharis, James Cosmo as Jeor Mormont, Tom Wlaschiha as Jaqen H'ghar, Dean-Charles Chapman as Tommen Baratheon, Luke Barnes as Rast, Art Parkinson as Rickon Stark, Sean Bean as Eddard 'Ned' Stark, three-time Emmy nominated Dame Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell, Oona Chaplin as Talisa Maegyr, Peter Vaughan as Maester Aemon, Anton Lesser as Qyburn, Roxanne McKee as Doreah, Ben Hawkey as Hot Pie, Brian Fortune as Othell Yarwyck, Tara Fitzgerald as Selyse Baratheon, Love Actually's Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Jojen Reed, Kerry Ingram as Shireen Baratheon, Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo, Indira Varma as Ellaria Sand, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Mace Tyrell, Ellie Kendrick as Meera Reed, Gethin Anthony as Renly Baratheon, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Noah Taylor as Locke, Steven Cole as Kovarro, Callum Wharry as Tommen Baratheon, Aimee Richardson as Myrcella Baratheon, Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon, Francis Magee as Yoren, Scorpion's Elyes Gabel as Rakharo, Mackenzie Crook as Orell, Paul Kaye as Thoros of Myr, Blunder's Tony Way as Dontos Hollard, Josephine Gillan as Marei, Jonathan Pryce as High Sparrow, Ciarán Hinds as Mance Rayder, Robert Pugh as Craster, The Grey's Nonso Anozie as Xaro Xhoan Daxos, Clive Russell as Brynden 'Blackfish' Tully, Casino Royale's Tobias Menzies as Edmure Tully, Jessica Henwick as Nymeria Sand, Harry Potter's Ralph Ineson as Dagmer Cleftjaw, Nell Tiger Free as Myrcella Baratheon, Harry Potter's David Bradley as Walder Frey, Mark Gatiss as Tycho Nestoris, Star Wars' Oliver Ford Davies as Maester Cressen, The Crystal Maze's Edward Tudor-Pole as Protester, Ian McShane and Max von Sydow as Three-Eyed Raven. To be completely honest, I cannot keep up with absolutely every storyline going on, because there are so many characters, in fact I have probably only memorised less than ten of the character names. The biggest reason I keep watching is because of the exciting fight and chase scenes when they happen, the great special effects to bring dragons, ghosts, zombie and all other mythical creatures to life, the over-the-top bloody violence and deaths, and the frequent nudity and sexual activity. This does not mean I do not like the show overall, I am always interested to see what will happen next with the faces of the characters I recognise, so it is certainly a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Television Series ? Drama (twice), it won the Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Art Direction for a Single-Camera Series (also nominated), Outstanding Costumes for a Series (also nominated twice), Outstanding Makeup for a Single-Camera Series (Non-Prosthetic) (twice, also nominated), Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series (also nominated three times), Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One-Hour) (also nominated twice), Outstanding Special Visual Effects (twice, also nominated twice), and it was nominated for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series (four times), Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (four times), Outstanding Drama Series (twice), Outstanding Hairstyling for a Single-Camera Series (three times), Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie or a Special (four times), Outstanding Single- Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series (three times) and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (three times).

		<fullReview>I would like to know why this review was deleted? I was not shocked when I learned that they are going to shoot Game of Thrones in Dubrovnik. But for Dubrovnik to be the King*s Landing a.k.a London, that was unfair. For London of course! Dubrovnik is such a backwater and a province! It is very beautiful, and interesting for film shooting since they repaired it, since it was largely destroyed by the Serbs and Montengrins in 1991. But it is a small town with a provincial feel. What in the Earth did I do there for 10 years???!!!??? Well at least kids grew up, but I will never forgive what they did to my children especially Theodore in Ivana Gunduli&#x107;a school. Why were they aggressive towards them? Because they were American born? Sva?ta!!! Dubrovnikians sometimes felt like the Orks. Very aggressive and nationalistic. Albeit Dubrovnik is beautiful like a gem! The whole Dubrovnik-Neretva county is like a gem. I hope the scouting people of the Game of Thrones will find Popovi&#x107;i beach and do couple of shots there. I even tried to be an extra in the series by they did not pick me. They did pick my neighbour and he was given 50euros for three days of shooting.As far as the series goes, I had a feeling that I watched something similar in like Lord of the Rings films. It is unavoidable that someone was going to spread those films into series. It is fun to watch, for we will have some more seasons. But I think I outgrew it, it is for the kids. All the actors are so good but Emilia Clarke and Peter Dinklage carry the whole series. Special effects are great, the naval siege of the King*s Landing is fantastic and Dubrovnik walls became useful for the first time in its history, Dubrovnik was never sieged, except in its very early history, the walls you see today never were used to defend Dubrovnik, it was deemed to unimportant by both the Turks and the Venice.I think that 9,4 grade is too high to mark the series, given on IMDb.com page. I gave it 7 out of 10. And please do not come to Dubrovnik to check out the locations. From your bodies we can not walk freely on Dubrovnik streets.Above lines were written after watching three seasons. I wanted to add a little bit more after season four.I have to say it was more interesting to watch season four, it became more serious and everything jumped for a notch, acting, plot, visual and special effects. I especially enjoy acting by Emilia Clarke. Man she really portrays deep savagery of her character, I have a need to do her in a local WC on Lokrum island, if you get my drift...I will raise my grade from 7 out of 10 to 8 out of 10. Just as I said, everything became better in season four. I have to say I am looking forward watching season five and beyond, I am interested which parts of Dubrovnik did they use for sets, although I do not like Dubrovnikians, I love Dubrovnik*s geography. It really is one of the rare gems of beauty in the world...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This review may contain spoilers ***This can be a great series, it truly can. And I hope it will be. It is Imported for me to state,just like everyone else does that it stays very true to the books. This is both a blessing and a curse. As anyone can see almost all reviews here are done by fans of the books. I myself have read the books, but I am no fan. As for me, I hope the series will not completely copy the books total lack of plot. The White Walkers ? seen in the start of the pilot ? Will they have a role to play? Or will they like in the books first be heard from again in 200 episodes time. If the series stays true to the books we will get just what they where ? "Days of our lives" set in the Middle Ages. Containing lots of hate, betrayal, Penthouse forum Letters, betrayal, intrigue, betrayal and betrayal. With any shadow of a plot finely gets brutally murdered and has a wolfs head sown on its shoulders instead of its own head? Did I mention betrayal?But the series starts well enough, awesome location shots and lots of great actors. That some of the characters are a little flat is not the fault of the actors. It is to early to tell if the style holds out or if they decide to put in a plot. It would create an uproar from the fans of the books ? But it would also make for a much better show. As one reviewer puts it, "The series revolves around Eddard Stark and his family. He has a wife and five children, three sons and two daughters. Eddard Stark is ruler of the North and close friend of King Robert who needs his help in ruling the Seven Kingdoms."*** major spoiler don't read on *** Hard to say how they would handel the early death of both characters. Time will tell?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't see why this is so popular and gets such a high score on IMDb! At rare instances it is fairly enjoyable but most of the time it moves forward in such a slow pace that you will ask yourself over and over again; why are people so crazy about this show? Disturbs me that it has a rating close to Breaking Bad, which has rightfully earned a high score (I give it 10/10). I wonder if it is the teenagers enjoying the quite frequent display of tits and ass?It's a high budget production which shows and most of the actors do a decent job even though I find Peter Dinklage to weak an actor to have such a high profile on the show.Game of thrones is a sleeping pill and the occasional exciting moments are not worth it.Now that I have started watching it I can't stop, sleeping pill or not, I still want to know how it ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted, well written, and well produced - but too extreme.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen all episodes so far, and I've finally made up my mind about this show.It's been a bit back and forth for me - and there have been times when I've greatly enjoyed it, which is why I can't be too harsh.I've read about half of the first book, just because I wanted to see how different it was - and it seems to me the show is quite loyal to the book in the important ways.Now, I can see the appeal of this show - but I must say I disagree with the universal praise. It's obviously supposed to be a plausible reflection of medieval Europe with some fantasy trappings - but I don't see how it succeeds.My primary issue is extremity. Every character seems to be an extreme of one sort or another. I'm not saying they don't have nuances or that they're not "grey" - because they are, and that's fine. But their acts and their profile are basically extreme. This goes for ALL the primary characters - and almost all of the secondary characters.We have the most altruistic honorable people and we have the most excessively cruel sociopaths. They may have nuance and grey areas - but they're delivered through extremities.It's like the writer or the producers want to make an impression every few minutes. Every time we establish a warrior as the greatest of all time - and we get some excessive act described or demonstrated, another warrior comes along that's just that little bit more extreme. Constantly. How many "best" and "most fierce" warriors do we have again? Bronn, Nedd, Kingslayer, Rob, Robert, Bear, Hound - and on and on and on. They're all superheroes, basically. They all have a well told tale of some superhuman act in the past that hammers into the head of the audience just how bad ass they really are. It's cool the first time - but not the 20th time. It loses its effect and you get diminishing returns.This goes for all the profile types, including the power-hungry lords and ladies and the schemers. Each more extreme than the last. It goes for the "evil" people as well.Every time we have a person behave in the most cruel way imaginable - we have another enter the scene and demonstrate why the last satanic individual was almost kind in comparison. Lest the viewer/reader forgets how very harsh this world is.It's layer upon layer of extremities. It's as if the world has no subtlety and the characters are incapable of not trying their hardest to get noticed at every turn.To me, that's desperation. It's the desire to bring shock and awe over the desire to write or show real people with real issues. Sure, the conditions are brutal - and people would naturally have to do a lot of questionable or brave things to survive - but not with every beat of their heart.If you want the greatest impact, what you do is that you pace your big scenes. You hold back and you build tension. You don't have to torture people visibly every other episode. One time is enough - and you don't have to make every character an extreme. Some people have a harmony about them - and they can make a strong impression over time.All those "cool" scenes of torture, violence, sex and so on would be so much more profound if they didn't happen constantly.I understand the temptation of a writer who's trying to match a true great like Tolkien. Tolkien was very different - and his was a very romantic and mythological approach. But he understood subtlety and he didn't bring too much attention to his characters at every turn. No, he built tension slowly - and the effect was that much more powerful.That's something Martin could learn from. Yes, yes - the world is harsh and people suffer all the time. But even in the harshest of worlds, we will have the mundane and we will have average people failing or succeeding without going above or below average.Subtlety did exist in medieval Europe - I'm almost sure of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Games of Thrones,Well it is a series that has excellent:1. Photography 2. Soundtrack 3. Astonishing women and men as actors 4. Great costumes and many more things But... Does someone agree that the story hasn't gone nowhere after 11 episodes? It is very slow and in each episode there hardly happens something and we are getting to any certain point. I hope this will change very soon because if not it will be a big fluke. The same thing happened with the second series of Boardwalk empire and i presume HBO is trying to make a lot of money with long stretched series abandoning there usual quality and amazing productions.Because the story lines are weak i only give it a 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly a confession - I hated this TV series so much that I only made it to the end of episode 6 before I gave up - I figured if I couldn't be won over in six hours it was probably never going to happen. Given this fact the reader should be aware that some amazing transformation may have taken place later which make this series far better than I am giving it credit for - though everyone I've spoken to who likes the series thought it was great from the start so I'm guessing the quality (or lack of it) is pretty consistent throughout. My objections? Firstly the writing is terrible - characters speak in this strange and special 'fantasy genre' dialogue which is stiff and comic (when it's not supposed to be) - the series looks cheap and nasty too - sets are often clearly studio bound with weak design, poor lighting and a strangely dated feel - it looks like a 1970/80s BBC Shakespeare production a lot of the time. The series also takes itself far too seriously - the whole thing has a portentous quality and apparently fails utterly to recognise its own silliness. I have absolutely nothing against the fantasy genre - the LOTR books and films are great - but this is a weak addition and I'd recommend avoiding it.</fullReview>

When their conversation concludes and the King heads for the exit the Hand takes another awkward slug of the wine he had previously declined. Granted it's picayune but it struck a false note within the context of the action. That said I must admit that the thing is hard to stop watching not exactly like having one potato chip more like rubber necking at the scene of an accident.

		<shortDescription>Embarrassingly terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the exception of the first episode (due to terrible CGI blue- eyed monsters), I found the first series of this show quite gripping, with tense drama and witty dialogue. The problem now is that it's more and more (and more) of the same, so what once seemed fresh and interesting seems hackneyed and boring. Personally, the CGI always brings me out of the story, and the whole dragon-based/supernatural side of things, along with such scenes as the woodenly-acted Red Woman queefing a ghost out of her foofoo, just make me roll my eyes. If you like ridiculous CGI fantasy, clearly this will appeal. Now, at season 6, we have hardly any of the wit and surprise of the earlier seasons, instead being left with lots of swearing, delivered by actors who don't seem like they can really be bothered any more. The scenes (now manifold) in faux-foreign tongues are embarrassing (perhaps this is a bit too subjective coming from me, as I am a linguist); in fact the whole thing is quite embarrassingly bad now.I also had a realisation whilst watching S06E01, that this is basically Star Trek (NOT a good thing).Actors now spend a lot of time stating literally what is happening or has just happened ("I did what I thought was right, and I got murdered for it, and now I'm back"..."He stabbed him in the back"...).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This series is clear evidence that a top production does not necessarily mean a good product. It is too notorious, but under all that thrown money has almost nothing. Except of course loads of nudity and perversion for the younger generation. Without nudity this series would be a fiasco because the main plot is a combination of Santa Barbara and The Hobbit, and Dynasty, with an emphasis on Dynasty (in the Middle Ages). HBO with this series pushes the boundaries and approaching pornography, but it is obvious that sexual perversion, blood and violence is for today's generations everything in life. Too bad, if producers used a bit more RR's book and reduce these annoying dialogs, we would get a lot more dynamic, better product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Game of two halves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm very much in two minds about Game of Thrones. While I do not get the amount of hate we see here, I cannot share the enthusiasm that so many people seem to feel. Up until season 3 when certain undesirable strains started to appear (see below) I found it watchable, although no masterpiece. By mid season 3 I did find it going downhill for the reasons below. Things I like about GOT: 1. Complex interwoven story-lines. George R.R. Martin has cleverly assembled a number of stories designed to appeal to everyone. There's a little girl in disguise on a quest, a little cripple boy on a quest, a bastard son on a quest, a masculine woman on a quest, along with various royal pretenders seeking the throne. Then there's the dwarf (of course!), the eunuch, the sadist pimp...the only thing missing is the effeminate male. 2. No concession made to the viewer. From the very start the viewer is thrown headlong into the story and expected to pick up on names, locations and family allegiances. Certain ideas are mentioned in passing and then come to fruition episodes later without any recap given. This series demands careful viewing. 3. Unpredictability. Key characters are killed suddenly and unexpectedly without fanfare. 4. Good scenery. 5. The imp. Peter Dinklage is the star of GOT. Things I don't like about GOT 1.Gratuitous nudity. These are the now notorious "sexposition" scenes where lengthy amounts of dialogue are delivered to shots of naked women. In the first series a certain amount of male nudity is also shown but this disappears in later series. 2.Gratuitous swearing. Sometimes, such as when a group of men are gathered together, the copious use of the c-word and other strong oaths seems appropriate, but in mixed company it does not ring true. 3. Gratuitous violence. No so much a problem in the first 2 series but in scenes 3 a deeply unpleasant strain of "torture porn" begins to develop. 4. Darkly lit. While this certainly makes GOT very moody, it is sometimes hard to see what is meant to be happening in the numerous night time scenes.5.Increasingly predictable. After the surprising developments up the the middle of series 2, it has become a soap opera, with loads of sex and violence but little real danger (at least for the main characters).6. Silly plot developments. This was the decisive factor in me turning against the series. Some guy with a "magic penis", the warrior woman (who had been previously and admirably plausibly shown as being manly) turning into a sexy lady and worst of all, someone with the ability to bring back the dead, a development that makes me worry that some of the interesting things in previous series may be undone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I literally just finished reading the book and loved every word! I cannot express how disappointed I am by the series. The acting is perfunctory, some of the locations are not at all correct and I really don;t understand why they had to play around with the dialogues so much!! You have an amazing book there which gives you everything you need and instead it has become a tapestry of scenes which don;t flow and do not convey any of the history or the background. Some characters like Varys and Petyr Baelish really lack that venomous, conniving (is that spelled correctly??) edge to them..same goes for Cercei. I find Khal Drogo very disappointing..I would have expected a far larger and more robust man..and where are the bells??? intricate part of him and totally lacking..as well as the grassy plains and the whole 'important moments in a man's life should be done under the stars'. It's a shame.I would have thought a series rather than a movie would be the ideal carrier for such an amazing book but even though I have tried to watch it several times and come back to it several times, I am always disappointed.</fullReview>

Im guessing that was a hint at what was to come, Game of Feminism. Female characters massacre male characters, untrained women beat battle harden men, men are tricked by women easily and predictably, anti war messages became pro war messages.In short, HBO ruined a great series with its fanatical left wing messsages. Women scream at men more regularly than they just talk to them, men are stereotyped as a bunch of rapists, Brieanne kills so many male characters and then goes around bragging about it, The Sand Snakes in Dorne, kill house Martell, "in revenge for house Martell", Dany walks around making insolent faces at people that want to kill her then mass murdering male characters, HBO tries to humanize evil Cersei Lannister, Sansa walks around telling people what to do and complaining, Arya with no muscles and no height, is training to be a killer by another killer girl with no muscles, the bad guys are all literally men- the white walkers, Ramsey, the slavers, the Tyrell Grandmother is somehow the leader of the Tyrells.It is puke level propaganda that could NEVER shine a light on the books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones does for medieval fantasy what Deadwood did for westerns. And like Deadwood Game of Thrones amps up the viciousness but this time to a ridiculous degree. The acting is terrific. The set design (cgi or not), costumes, directing, editing and sound are all top notch. The dialogue can be cutting and clever but also arch and melodramatic. The desperate and menacing and oh so important conversations frankly started to blur together in my head. Just when your attention might wander breasts or a new extreme in atrocities is served to remind you how cool and hardcore this world is. After a while I started to wonder how anyone is still alive in this world. Where does all this fodder come from? But for sure thousands of lives will be readily available for extinguishing next time the audience might be getting bored or needs to be reminded how nasty somebody is.</fullReview>

After a certain point (more so in the books than the show) the plot becomes drawn out, there become too many characters, and the story stops progressing. However it is still a great series. The hype surrounding it is a little too large, as only the third book and the episodes which cover it truly live up to the hype, but it is still great. I do wish that people would stop saying that it is of the quality of series like the stories of Middle-Earth, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who, Supernatural, Sherlock, Mass Effect, etc. Is it great? Yes. Hyped a little more than it should be? Definitely. There are more than a little incredibly boring scenes, especially after book three, and there are too many plot- lines and characters you just do not care about. That said, it is great, and a fantastic television show and a great book series. There are better shows, particularly those made by Vince Gilligan, but that is not to say that Game of Thrones is not good, if a little overrated.</fullReview>

They know how to hype you for the next episode with there tactics, and once you you will see the following episode you will be quite disappointed as you will only see them talking and again no action. I have found this quite boring. If there would be more action, great fights as we all would love to see, especially the dragon ones then this would get 10/10. If you don't like violence and like to see people talk then this is definitely for you and you will love this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While season 1 was awesome, breath taking, the quality decreased with the next 2 seasons. I don't know why they stick with 10 episodes format, there is too much information, events and characters in the books to be properly summaries in 10 episodes. (and I must say this, don't read the book before seeing this TV show, will ruin it for you, well except the first season of course.). Many shows hit the inspirational bump on their road and have a hard time to invent new content. GoT don't have that problem, there is content in the books to keep it running for years, why intentionally make it shorter ? or remove content ? Devon had 4 sons, the bastard that torture Greyjoy has a full story behind, new characters just pop out with no background and is harder to follow the action even for me, the wife of the king over the wall is missing, as well as her sister, no romantic relation between Snow and the red girl while in the book was the supreme condition of his oath breaking as a knight of the night watch, the connection between boys and their wolves is barely mentioned, never shown when they take control of their pets, Ser Dontos is the one approaching Sansa to help her escape and many more, while adding stuff that was never there, Rose the "entertaining lady", dragon kidnapping. I understand that they want to make some things a little different than the book, but at least make it better. ( Rose is great addition BTW) :) . The quality of this show tends to diminish lately, they failed to bring up the effects of the war over the provinces, the famine, the horrors, the dead, the robbers, the famine again, Aria and her companions are really chubby =/, hard to achieve that feeding on roots .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles Dance said in an interview with some gentle sarcasm that he would not read the books because they are too heavy to hold. That tells it all: great artists and filmmakers are doing their best to make an HBO quality show from a pulp fiction fantasy.The story doesn't really go anywhere, characters can be killed anytime, new characters can be introduced as well, and the fantasy world is very far from believable. The budget can never be high enough to produce more than a couple of outstanding action scenes in one season so the writers (David Benioff has seen better days: 25th Hour, Troy) have to fill the gaps with long, never-ending and quite uninteresting conversations.But, fortunately, the greatest stage actors also need the pay, so we can watch an amazing cast: Sean Bean, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Fairley, Carice Van Houten, the above mentioned Charles Dance and so on. Their presence worth watching the show.Aside from that this is one of the weakest series of HBO, not even close to the quality of The Wire, Boardwalk Empire or Six Feet Under. The show could have told us something about human nature, power, politics, love, religion, faith and chaos, but instead of these we get a lot of nudity, pointless violence, and some Hollywood clichés.You can say, it's just entertainment, so be it, but it still doesn't deserve more than 6 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't disagree more with all the glowing reviews of this series. as a fan of the literary series, i wasn't optimistic about a conversion to film. the story is just too deep. there are too many characters with nuanced attributes. i never believed it could translate to film. i was right.have you ever read a "cliff notes" version of a classic novel? sure, it helped you get an "A" on your 8th grade book report, but it didn't help you appreciate the source material. that's what this series is, the Cliff Notes version of the war for Westeros.Bottom line: there is no way to distill 800 pages of excellent story-telling, character development and world-lore into twelve hours of film and do it any sort of justice. this is exactly what HBO is attempting to do with Game of Thrones. Fail. The series is an empty husk attempting to replicate the brilliance of the novels. It just doesn't translate.What are we left with? An apparent money grab by G.R.R. Martin and the starched shirts at HBO (who are trying to pimp mediocrity in the form of Boardwalk Empire to fill the abscess left by The Sopranos).Weak effort. You should have just left it alone, George. Concentrate on finishing the series. Please don't pull a Robert Jordan-act on us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this show I was very excited to see how magnificent it was...WRONG!!! I am a HUGE Breaking Bad fan, and I was DEEPLY disappointed when I saw that Game of Thrones had the same rating as Breaking Bad. Why in Gods name would Game of Thrones have the same rating as Breaking Bad!!! Game of thrones has NO action, let me guess... throwing a kid off a castle is action... THERE IS NO ACTION IN THAT AT ALL. Let me continue... Oh my GOD!!! The acting!! Hahaha that must be a joke. Breaking Bad actors have EIGHT more EMMYS FOR BETTER ACTING THAN GAME OF THRONES DOES. Last time I checked EIGHT is GREATER THAN ZERO. Anna Gun the wife of Walter white has the EXACT same Emmys as Peter dinklage... GAME OF THRONES BEST AND FAVORITE ACTOR. Better Acting... Ya right!!! Better storyline... HAHAHAHA! A chemistry teacher with terminal lung cancer makes methanphetamine in order to provide for his family is a WAY better storyline than 7 noble kingdoms use pornography in order to intrigue the viewers into watching the show. And DRAGONS... What the heck is wrong with the fans!!!.. Are you what 3 years old!!! Might as well put some tinker bell in that show too to make more people want to watch the show more!!!... "Game of thrones is sooooo much better than Breaking Bad" Ya right!!!. Breaking Bad Was Nominated TWICE for being the best BEST DRAMA SERIES... TWICE!!! Breaking bads main actor Bryan Cranston has FIVE Emmys, Aaron Paul has THREE Emmys and Anna Gunn has 1 Emmy and all you have on GAME OF THRONES is Peter dinklage with only ONE I mean only ONE EMMY. Game of thrones will NEVER be as superior as Breaking Bad. GAME OF THRONES=INFERIOR</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I forced myself to watch all the episodes of Game of Thrones and just couldn't get into it. It doesn't seem to know exactly what it is or where it is going. I think it's trying to be another "Lost" or "24" - aiming to continue forever.The storyline is strangely "untogether" and it is not sure if it is a mythical tale or monster movie. The producers have gone to great lengths to find bizarre characters to populate the screen and surprise us - but they don't "gell"" together.I still cannot work out why they are all talking with northern English accents (I keep waiting for "ee by gum it's coud up 'ere innit" to be thrown into the conversation).Obviously unsure of their own product, large dollops of sex have been thrown into the pot to make it sell. The final 'thing' is uneven and unsatisfying. Perhaps "Game of Thrones part 274" will be better.....</fullReview>

Everything was as &#x130; have imagined while reading the books! &#x130; watched the full season in one night and lived with its magical music in my ears for a while! Yet, stop with this happiness before you move to season 2 And prepare yourself to extra, stupid scenes that does not exist in book; many events missed or falsely changed; shallow characters that say stupid Hollywood typical words! The events are so cut that they do not make a whole anymore, they do not add up! No magic, no loyalty to the book and no respect to the many fans! My advise: unchange whatever you have changed in season 2 and give us back the best fantastic series and best adaptation i have seen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't read the book, nor did I ever heard of it. Second; I watched the first 6 episodes so far Most reviews are mainly positive, but many of those are written by the book readers. If one feels that you have to read the book to enjoy the series this review is not for you.This series is a drag. I think thats the best way to describe it. Its a never ending introduction of people whom may become important later or whom may not, you don't know for sure. Its about intrigue, backstabbing, leadership, honor, good, evil all that.. but it doesn't deliver. Some things happen, and if it does the show will definitely let you know "something" happened. Even if its not that special it will become the main part of the story for to long.Six episodes is almost 6 hours, nothing 'epic'/'grand' happened. All six hours is talk and no show. You might see a sword fight or two (not much more), but no battles or some breath holding scenes. Even those who love this series cannot deny this. There are no real scenes in it, which will 'take you away', in lack of better words.So far, to me, this is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. You keep switching from story line to story line, and although they are put together nicely it just gets boring after an hour or 4. Once again I'd like to state that nothing really happens.Conclusion!?Each episode has some brutal fighting with someone beheaded or loosing their eye before dying. It looks like an awful clone of MK fatalities. Then out of the blue there's sex and swearing. I mean, What the Freak?!!! What makes you people rank this 9.5 of 10? IT IS LOUSY AND PATHETIC... I'm sorry, this series just sucks...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the books (the first three I have read twice, the fourth once). I love the books. So in theory I am pre-disposed to either like the series or hate it because it is not sufficiently like the books. It would be damn near impossible for me to judge the series as if I had not read the books. I have only seen the first two episodes of the series.All that said, I love the series. The casting is phenomenal. The acting better than some of the best mini-series. Tyrion is spot on (a phenomenal acting job and a phenomenal character). Jon Snow is spot on. Arya Stark, Cersei Lannister, Jaime Lannister etc, etc. The series clearly gives the feel for the book and is true in its characterizations. No series will have every plot detail of a book nor will it have every character exactly as every individual sees him/her, it can't, but this series is very true to the book, true to Martin's writing and true to the character of each player. I can't wait for the next episode. I want to own the series on DVD (Blu ray). I want to go back and read the books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First thing, I am a HUGE fan of George R.R. Martin books, specially the Songs of Ice and Fire novels.I was so happy when I heard that this novels will be filmed and released as a show. Enormous plus was the fact that it will be filmed in HBO production, which is in my opinion, the absolute leader in the field of filming shows and series.Last week I saw first 14 minutes of the show on official HBO website, and.... shivers went up and down my spine of shear excitement!Finally the day to see the first episode was here. And here were the expectations, so much of them. And that probably is the thing that almost ruined everything for me... First 14 minutes that I saw earlier were so tense, realistic and even scary! Everything was as I imagined while reading the book! Characters were on a highest level, setting was awesome, the winter was coming! I was thrilled! And expectations increased accordingly... After that moment something happened and my overall experience with the episode went down the hill. I found some of the acting a bit weird, music didn't fit all of the time and sometimes annoyed me. Interiors were too artificial and, again, didn't fit my expectations. Everything happened too fast, which is logical since the information in the book are massive and it would be hard to fit them all into the series, but I could notice that, and that is more than enough to give me the reason to think is it possible that one of largest and most beautiful fantasy books ever are too complicated and complex to film a series about them.After the first episode I can only say: Peter Dinkleage and Sean Bean are awesome as usual! The episode followed the book in best possible manner (even though too fast), characters and locations are just as you could imagine them while reading the book. The plot is is intriguing and will pin down to the chair everyone that haven't read the book. Of course, there is plenty of sex, violence and blood for everyone that expect that from HBO.Even though I think that there are flaws, The Game of Thrones episode 1 deserves enough of viewers attention to watch it once again before the second episode, just to give it a shot and I think it will repay you for that in later episodes.All in all even though my first experience isn't the best one, I think this one is a winner which will be a must for every fan of the book, and one of best series in some time in eyes of most of the viewers that didn't read the book. Another HBO's success! Enjoy the winter!</fullReview>

If Ned is a Lord of a House, then he has experience spotting deception. If Ned is this stupid, then PIS if House Bolton did not destroy House Star early on. The plot goes nowhere, an example will be the first 2 seasons.The first season was slow, and the second season was a snore.The dialogue sometimes are boring. The reason is because the script is badly written.Characters (some) are dull with no life to them.Lots of the characters are 1 to 2 dimensional.Many of the characters aren't explored. The show has to throw sex to get you interested, and care for this cra@p.The show wastes time on nudity, and has a long opening.The show itself does not deliver anything.It gives an illusions that it accomplished something.You have to wait for the battles for a long time, while .If interesting things happen, its only for shock value. Most of the characters,and things that happen in this show. It does not benefit the story. Its definitely not a Dark fantasy.This show is a Medieval torture porn.The show is predictable that the good guys lose. Its the opposite of Lord of The Rings where the good guys win.There is no balance between good vs evil like the show claims itself to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bad Guys Always Win</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This show is probably the most disappointing thing watched in a long time. At first, I didn't mind the concept of the good guys not prevailing. However, as the show goes on. It becomes more of a parody of itself, and in some cases ? unrealistic. There is no sense of balance between the protagonists and the antagonists. The antagonists always seem to prevail despite the overwhelming odds against them. Its funny when people state that this is 'realistic' and I should watch a bugs bunny cartoon If I criticize its cynical nature. If you think about it, if the antagonists and the protagonists would have swap places. People will find this show cliché and predictable.Lets stop pretending that this show is morally grey. If this show was morally grey the Lannisters wouldn't act so obviously evil. While the Starks wouldn't act so righteous and just. Making the Starks uphold honor unlike their nefarious counterparts is a trick. The writers want you to get emotionally involved and like these characters. They do this so they can shock you by killing them off. The Lannisters will always win no matter what. The very fact that most of the relevant members of the family is still alive and most of the Starks members are dead should tell you something. Even when they're against a noble house that is just as powerful as they are. They managed to kill off the prince of that house in the most anticlimactic way. The prince isn't even all that honorable to be honest. You see ? in Game of Thrones even the anti-heroes don't win. Evil prevails and gets rewarded and you can't be even slightly good like prince.The arrogant fans of this show/books is also aggravating. Always saying this show is a realistic fantasy, and should read Harry Potter if I want a good vs evil showdown. Well guess what.. This IS A GOOD VS EVIL showdown, and rather then being realistic, its just nihilistic. You see, real life isn't as dark as this show. Even during the middle ages most the public lived a somewhat peaceful life. Yes people were a lot more brutal and cruel compared to modern standards, but they still had a trace of morality. The people in this show have no morals, and the ones that do are killed off. Of course there is people like Jon Snow and that Targerean queen. The problem with them is that Jon Snow is always a underling to corrupt officials. And the Targerean queen is too far away to make a difference. There is also the stark kids but they're not a threat to the iron throne. The writers obviously want the good guys to remain powerless and non-threatening so it can give you the illusion of being 'dark' and 'edgy'. Sorry, I didn't fall for your magic trick. I find this show extremely juvenile and predictable.</fullReview>

There are no heroic quests or epic battles. None. It all hinges, instead, on gossiping about who-had-sex-with-who and who-back-stabbed-who for the throne. There is no real substance to it. I did not really feel any connection to the characters. I did not feel like I was in a fantasy at all. I felt more like I was in a world of boring gossip. If this were to be any other genre, it would be much less popular. People probably only like this because it has a medieval setting. However, when you take away all of the castles, armor, wild boars, and swords, you are just stuck with a bunch of gossips.</fullReview>

The show does do right, though, with how it rests solely on HBO - hopefully it stays that way. This way, people who have regular cable will never have to sit through such a boring and overrated show. The only thing that people have right is that the camera-work on this show is actually decent, but Breaking Bad topped this thing in every episode, and sometimes an episode would go by in BrBa without a single great camera angle.

There are so many different story lines, that you never really get bored with any of them. I've been on the edge of my seat, jaw dropped, in shock all at the same time. I've had many characters that I've despised and hoped they would kill off as well as characters that I've loved and were killed right away. Point is this story line has an extremely hard twist that I don't expect anyone could ever guess "what happens next".

No.It used to be a well written, well crafted show but now it has turned into something sadistic and completely unimaginative. I give it a 3 only because of the well done Special Effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a flattering reflection of the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***I'm reading the first book and I'm about 200 pages in, so all of this plot is still very fresh in my mind for what I just saw on Episode 1. I don't understand why this show has such high reviews...perhaps the obscene amounts of gore and nudity? I only watched Episode 1 of Season 1 and that is all I will watch, for reasons I will make known below. Before that, I would like to state that this series may reflect the book, but it taints the reputation of the book and the reflection is not accurate in the least bit.Characters: First of all, the ages of all the children are older than in the books...which I'm assuming will make nudity of the girls...more acceptable to the audience??? Jon Snow is not at ALL what I pictured him to be...I mean it gives a physical description of him in the book...so there's no excuse for that. However, most other characters do look a lot like I would have imagined (esp. Arya and Ned), just not Jon.When the show began it completely butchered the scene of the Night Watch men who encountered the Others. The wildlings on the ground were not butchered and the man who deserted after the encounter only survived because he climbed up a tree. I know that seems like a small deviation, but for a series that claims to be so close to the book, the opening scene was screwed up. The execution of the deserter was handled well, but what about Bran's big question? Following the execution, the dire wolves scene was mishandled as well. The actor playing Jon did not look as though he was caught off guard by finding the runt. Speaking of that, all of the plot was rushed much too much. The actors failed at capturing the nuances, pauses, and facial expressions that these characters make. I was frustrated throughout the whole episode because it seemed to rush to the nudity, which is FAR LESS IMPORTANT than, say, the scene where Ned and Robert were underground paying respects to the dead. That scene deserved more than it was given. They didn't bring Robert and Ned's relationship to life, instead they make Robert look like a man-whore and they made him look soft (as in fat is whole life). The king should be hardened, but with a softness that only Ned can bring out in him...Mark Addy is NOT Robert Baratheon. No, no, no. I'm so mad at myself for watching this because now all of the faces of the characters will be associated with the actors...Boo!The sex scene with the Imp and all of the whores was completely fabricated...I mean that was just completely unnecessary. So many people are stating that this series handles sex maturely, but it takes something sacred and makes it absolutely disgusting. The book did not handle sex this way at all! Also, Daenerys is supposed to be a 13 year old virgin and the show had the actress who played her take part in two obscenely long nude scenes. I'm sorry (not really), but that actress does not act very innocent or afraid and I don't think she can because she is too willing to pull her drawers down. The sex scene between her and Drogo was not handled well either because it made Drogo seem way more barbaric than he actually is in the book (according to that specific scene in the book). They didn't have time to throw in the fact that he tenderly asked her for permission? I mean, really? That scene in the book ended in mutual agreement...(well as much as possible considering the circumstances). Now, the sex scene of Cersai and her brother was pretty much dead on for the book...I will admit that much. Pros: The costumes, props, and scenery are somewhat nice. That's it. You can't build up a show on nice backdrops and cool clothing though. Overall impression:-The necessary scenes were rushed. -Important details were completely neglected. -Some characters are all wrong and the ages of the children are fudged. -Sex has devolved into a barbaric act of overpowering women. -Most of the nudity is unnecessary and is OVERWHELMINGLY uneven (all full-on naked women) -Props and scenery are nice. -Whorehouse scene completely fabricated.PLEASE READ THE BOOK. You'll understand why so many of the people who read the book are angry. Now I'm off to read the book some more, but I think I've made it quite obvious that this show has dragged down my overall "A Game of Thrones" experience. I don't even know if I'll finish it now, but I definitely won't be back to watch this ridiculous adaptation of it.Last words: The actress playing Daenerys is so beyond wrong. I actually feel bad for the made-up character in the book!BLEH! &gt;:(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Torturing Women is The New Normal. Sewer Material Served on Silver Platters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No other shows on TV celebrates female-torturing more enthusiastically than Game of Thrones. The GOT creators have elevated the spectacle of graphic female-torturing to a whole new politically correct level. Not only it is okay to watch snuff porn in the comfort of your living room, it is now totally cool to yell down (and censor) anyone who dare say GOT glorifies misogyny.I don't mind some sex and nudity on TV, but perverse sadist crap that dehumanize the one already-over-dehumanized sex belongs in the sewer of internet porn. Officially, GOT's contribution to artistic progress is making un-PC perversity the new PC-ness.Congratulations GOT for elevating stinking sewer material to high heaven.Obviously, GOT creators and fanatics reckon it's totally cool that women and little girls are repeatedly (in highly graphic details) psychologically tortured, insulted for their sex, publicly humiliated like slaves, stripped and displayed and auctioned off like meat on sticks, raped like sun-human, hunted down and slaughtered like animals, and their naked female flesh bloodily pierced with sharp weapons of all sorts. It doesn't matter who (male or female) is doing the torturing, females in this show are either tortured virgins, tortured whores, tortured and torturing bitches, or tortured dead meat. Keyword is tortured. Women must be tortured for the pleasures of GOT directors whose ambition is to play high budget porn director. And not just any porn mind you, but specifically maximum pain-inducing, maximum dehumanizing-effect kind of porn.Of course they didn't stop at torturing women. Men are tortured too. The ratio? About 9 women for every 1 man. Women simply deserve more torture apparently. Why? To reflect the world as is? Or to reflect the overflowing sewer that is GOT creator's brilliant genius mind content?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is an otherworldly drama set in about the middle ages. This world has a civilized feudal Southern territory and a frozen wasteland to the North. North and south are separated by a enormous insurmountable wall of ice built and guarded by the territories south of the wall. The north is inhabited by wild-lings and "white walkers" The South is made up of seven kingdoms with one supreme ruler who sits on the iron throne. Power is inherited via bloodlines. Game of thrones is the drama intrigue and conquest and general skulduggery that surrounds who will sit on the iron throne.While other things brew north of the wall...I must admit that my first impressions of the the first 3 episodes was that it was little more than a tiresome medieval soap opera. I am a chronic insomniac so one night had run out of things to watch, By the end of Season 1 I was an addicted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just as well might tag each of the lovers of this show, with a few exceptions, as White males. "Hi, I'm a White male, and GoT is the best thing ever since ever."I give the story 10 of 10, the acting 10 of 10. What ruins this show is the editing. How many times must I pause and explain to other watchers what is happening? Additionally, how long do you have to make them wait to buy in to caring about one character or another? But not to worry, if you are about the tune out, boobs. Watch because boobs. I get the context and need for the nudity and sex and rape...but it must support the story. If it doesn't it is just porn. And there is nothing wrong with porn, but I am not necessarily sitting down to watch GoT to get off. I am watching for a good story. Too much of this sexual content essentially spoils the story for me. But, I am not a White male. If I was, I might welcome the sexual interludes even though they do not enhance the story. It would be the same to me as including random fight scenes with no explanation, dialogue with no meaning, or characters constantly introduced and then never seen again. Where's the substance? Oh, right, its hidden behind that boob.Sorry--just misses the mark. Too bad. I'd rather read it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story of "A Song of Ice and Fire" is not Being Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Includes Spoilers - Do not read this if you love the books and have not started watching the show yet! ***First, if you have not started with reading the books, then I suggest waiting until the show is finished. Then again, maybe I will be too nit picky with my review, and you can simply enjoy watching and reading...Summary: A great production and a great show when based only on its own merits, but is a disgrace to the story of "A Song of Ice and Fire" and does a great disservice to the fans of the books it is to be based upon. The shows do not come close to being true to or measuring up to the quality of character development, world building and the just plain excellent storytelling enjoyed when reading the books. Season three did an especially bad job sticking to the story told in the first half of "A Storm of Swords" as it just goes off, messes a lot up, and tells it in a way that I suppose would be required when only ~10 hours of time is made available.Details: Since each season and every episode of this show have Martin's blessing, I am assuming that he is okay with "Game of Thrones" being loosely based -- in an extreme manner -- on his epic masterpiece of fantasy literature.I could tolerate the first two seasons as they were not too incredibly far off from the the first two books (still, very far off). But the third season takes things way too far regarding the show's deviation from the books.I watched the premier of the third season until I saw how badly the storyline of every primary protagonist of the books was going to be abused by the very excessive of creative license taken by the writers (and maybe Martin himself as well) of the show. What really struck me was that for some reason Selmy was on his own when he came to save Daenerys and that a simple yet important character such as Strong Belwas was absent. I decided at that point to stop watching. And the season ended and I was determined not to care, not even when the "Red Wedding" became national news during a slow news cycle.However, as time crept on I came to terms with the fact that the show and the books are not the same and that the overall quality of the show cannot be compared to the far superior and actual story of the books. "Game of Thrones" is not "A Song of Ice and Fire" and I now view the show as telling one story and the books telling another.After thinking on it, and being somewhat persuaded to do so by others, I decided to just watch the third season since I had mostly enjoyed the first two. The quality of production and (for the most part) dialog and acting are superior to just about anything else TV - I rank the show on its own merits being on the same level as The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire as far HBO shows and most any other shows on TV go. But, still, despite the fact that I have come to understand the show as being a very condensed and exceptionally loose adaptation of the books it is to be based on, and despite the fact that I do enjoy watching the show, I can only say I really half like it because of how much I loved reading and re-reading the books and how often I have to ask "Where is that character?", "Why did they leave that key event out?", or "Why would they change that when it would be just as easy to stay true to what was in the book?". Add to that the alternate story for Asha that starts up in the season finale of season three really irks me. Not to mention the bones I have to pick regarding Bran's story...If only HBO could dedicate more than 10 episodes at ~50-55 minutes each for a season, maybe the story of "Game of Thrones" would be much more in line with the actual story of "A Song of Ice and Fire" and would be a much better show because of it. However, that is not the case. It will be interesting to see what they do with the second half of "A Storm of Swords" and exactly how great the show itself can be while still messing with my book-reading mind.Yes, I enjoy the show, but my love of the books necessitates dropping my vote to a 5/10 and it's getting a 5 and not less because this is in part a show that is being overseen by Martin himself and I have come to appreciate how he has agreed with and influenced in whatever way he can the story being told in "Game of Thrones" and how it is being told.Now, can we book fans please get "The Winds of Winter" sooner rather than way too much later???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First season review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of my nephew I started to watch the first season. This series is sometimes great and awesome, but most of the time boring. I am not an fan of movies that happened far in the past, except Gladiator.There are a lot of thrones in this movie and a lot of people (actors and actresses) or characters who are well performed. For instance I like this Peter Dinklage, good actor, would have been a great add for the Willow cast back in the days or be good next to Hugh Laurie in the remake of twins 1988. But the children of the kings are spoiled brats and start to come out my throat by now.Sean Bean was a good add to the series, but somehow he had to die. That was a surprise, like the series is full of it. But what it seems to lack is what direction we are going to. There is no direction for the viewer. Everyone who you think that matters die and the ones you want to day stay alive. Maybe that is also the strength of the series, because I am going to watch the second season for sure. I wonder how the second season evolves with dragons in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard nothing but praise about this show from friends, and I have nothing against fantasy, so I gave it a shot.If you have read the books, this show might be the best thing since sliced bread, but for a casual viewer it's a let down. As I understand it, the plans are to do one book per season. But judging from season 1, there simply isn't enough material in one book for almost 10 hours of television. Let's compare it to the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, where the total running time for all three movies - in the extended editions, mind you - is roughly 12 hours. I think "Game of Thrones" would benefit greatly from merging two books into, say, a 12 episode season. 6 hours per book is still abundant to tell the story.One common problem with make believe kingdoms and countries (not only with the fantasy genre) is the geography. I remember the first time I read "Lord of the Rings" in an edition which had no map, and it made no goddamned sense where all the places were in relation to one another, which led to a frustrating read. But "Game of Thrones" solves this problem beautifully in the opening credits.The opening scene set in a wintery landscape on the other side of the wall, or whatever it's called, is very good and it sets up a nice feel of mystery. But sadly, it's all downhill from there. The multitude of characters are for the most part one-dimensional and unengaging. The plot sprawls thin and lacks direction, making me lose interest quite quickly.</fullReview>

But since the very first episode, I found it kind of an exhausted model. It is a mix of a Lord of the rings (setting from the middle ages, different people living together in an invented world, strange languages, some witchcraft) and Spartacus (half naked warriors, a lot of sex, hookers and boobs). It's just more of the same. Who knows, perhaps that's what people like. I just can't afford to waste 1h of my day on this. I'll rather watch a good movie</fullReview>

But the TV version does not reflects the book, and the worst: They change the original plot with some bad ideas, like the scene where Catelyn went to the tower, and finds a single blonde hair!!!! Maybe this happens because each season only have 10 episodes, there's a lot of information that is not reflected in the show, and a lot of scenes that if you only watch the series without read the books, you will never know why or what the heck is happening...

		<shortDescription>fantasy porn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HBO puts a lot of sex in its dramas, even the ones that compete for awards. Most of their shows have a kind of rhythmic cycle-- 20 minutes of drama, 30 seconds of porn. Game of Thrones goes a lot farther than once every 20 minutes. If I didn't know it was based on a book, and so many reviewers weren't raving about how faithful it was to the book, I'd swear it was just an excuse to create a very expensively produced dungeons and dragons themed porn series. Instead of the sex spicing up the plot, the plot seems designed to create lots of opportunities to have a lot of sex. There's sex between fraternal twins, gay sex, extramarital sex, brutal sex, orgy sex, prostitute sex, little people sex, rape sex, and some other varieties I've probably forgotten about already. None of this is necessarily a bad thing, but it does make the show seem less serious, or at least harder to take it seriously. This also makes it a kind of anti-Narnia or anti-Lord of the Rings, as romantic, sentimental moral idealism doesn't figure much in this world and there are no religious themes to speak of. These often duplicitous characters are simply trying to make their way in a hostile, cynical, and steamy world where dragons and zombies are just part of the landscape.On the plus side, production values are extravagant and lush and most of the cast is first rate. This is the first mostly Belfast-based show I've ever seen and vividly bright green is everywhere. Some of the costumes, particularly the fancier armor suits, are incredibly beautiful and are no doubt up for some emmy nominations. Maisie Williams, a 14-year-old actress playing a character that's probably a few years younger, is remarkable. Don't worry, she's too young to make it into the porn scenes. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, a Danish actor without a trace of an accent, also stands out as one of the many evil-yet-charming-and-good-looking villains. Aiden Gillen, previously the uppity city councilman on The Wire, is both from Ireland and in this.So, will you like it? Not if too much sex annoys you. On the other hand, if you've always wanted to sexually liberate the knights, maidens, dragons, and dwarfs to make whoopie on screen, this is absolutely the show that will do it for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good show, but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried to read the books before this was ever a series, but the books moved so slowly, I lost interest. That happens to be the case with this series at some points. But I guess that happens in many series I've watched.I think the show is good overall, but I just have one huge complaint: The way that sex has consistently been portrayed in this series thus far. Every time there is a sex scene or a supposed "sensual" scene, I am almost always repulsed. Sex is always portrayed in a very negative light in this show. The men are the biggest douche-bags and then women get disrespected and treated as sexual objects. They are prostitutes and whores, or it's molesting your sister, or raping your forced-to-be-married-to-you wife.At least in Spartacus, hot men were shown and there was equality on the nudity field. That doesn't happen in this series. And at least in Spartacus some of the sex was actually respectable and some was about love. I have yet to see that in this show.I just hope it changes, because sex isn't suppose to be a thing of disrespectful douche-bags and dehumanization of women as it is consistently done in this show. It's repulsive in its current form.After reading other reviews, I have found that I am not alone in my opinion. Lots of people, from Europe especially, agree that Americans just don't know how to behave about sex. This show accurately portrays the authors and producers screwed up attitudes about sex. Plus, I also agree that sex is way overdone in this show.</fullReview>

Amount of violence is on par with Spartacus: Blood And Sand. Nudity is corruptive and mostly unjustified. Power is the name of the game. Sean Bean is probably the best actor in the series. Yet, this is far off his performance in LOR. The only thing I could connect with were beautiful landscapes of Malta where some scenes were shot.

		<fullReview>I have watched all the episodes of GOT as of April 18, 2014, so admittedly the new season has only just begun (the disgusting wedding of Joffrey and Margery just aired). The latest episode finally made me realize how utterly despicable this show is. Not because of the violence, not because of the sex. I have seen wonderful shows that have too much violence and sex. What is missing from GOT is any semblance of humanity. I can count on one hand the number of decent characters still living (Danerys and her General, Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, John Snow, and the two small Stark boys whose names escape me.) Yes, there are a few more decent folks here and there, but they get very little air time and have no influence on the story. The rest are either corrupt, despicable or just plain EVIL. It is simply bad storytelling to only show evil and corruption, without a counter-balance of decency, love or normal human feeling. No one really loves anyone in GOT, or if they did, you can be sure somebody died horribly because of it. Watching GOT feels like you swam in the sewer for an hour, and you're actually relieved when the hour is up. Unfortunately, you can't get some of the hideous images out of your mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In most cases I find IMDb ratings fairly real, but this is absolutely not the case!Where should I start? Well, I don't know if the people who gave this show 10 stars have ever watched any REALLY great series so I'm hoping that this is the first show they've ever watched and they don't know what 10 stars should represent. I feel really sad when I see those 10 stars, sad for the people I mean. Don't even want to think about medical (psychic) issues they must've got, even though they are pretty obvious... Just to be clear, I don't mind them giving it 10 stars but that misleads other people who come here to check out what's good for watching.About the show, the idea behind the story sounds great when you hear it - seven noble families BATTLE for the crown. Yes, BATTLE!!! Well, if I'm not mistaken, there has been 30 episodes so far and maybe 4 or 5 out of 30 includes the mentioned BATTLES. But, that's just the beginning, those couple of episodes mostly consist of people going to battle and people coming from battle. Basically, you watch and wait through 8-9 episodes (out of 10) to see the battle (finally) and it lasts 2-3 minutes. See the problem? If not, make an appointment at your doctor... And for those saying that the scams and other b.s. is worth the rating, Mexican telenovelas are being filmed for decades (if scams are what you're into) so check out their ratings...I won't go into spoiling the story, I'll just explain my rating:10 - boring as hell - total lack of battles (which all is about) - useless hours of character descriptions - it's following the book so 10 stars = 6Anyway, if you're into watching lots of TV series like me, it's watchable like The walking dead (oh the boredom since season 2), Dexter (rule no.1 never get caught - caught every season), and similar. You know, great ideas - bad production. But it's OK cause time does pass by while watching it.And remember, this is a watcher review - not a blinded book fan so it should be of help, at least I hope so.P.S. I think that the Spartacus crew would have made this to be one of the best series ever, but sadly it's HBO working on it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself as a man who doesn't watch TV series, i never did.On the other hand,i enjoy watching movies. Some friends of mine told me about game of thrones.They compared this series with lord of the rings and when they did that...that was the final hit.I started watching the 1st season, i watched it all,every episode.Someone could say that i was inspired or even more that i was amazed. No i wasn't, it was just the needing to know.I wanted to see what was going to happen.Maybe this is the goal of the producers, maybe they don't care if you like it, they just want you to watch,to watch it all.If that is, they achieved it. But let me tell you this, this has nothing to do with lord of the rings. You are not going to see lord of the rings in a TV series version.I am not saying if this is good or bad, this depends on each one's preferences.All i am saying is that this is something completely different. Here you can enjoy corruption,anti-heroism,back-stabs,murders,ultra- violence,naked "sausages" and bouncing "melons",if you know what i mean and most of all death.As for fantasy,battles,true heroes and...fantasy, this is not the right place to be.Of course i don't believe that fantasy and battles is all that lord of the rings gives.On the opposite,lord of the rings, mostly as a book but as a film too,transfers very deep meanings. I want to add,as an answer to some reviews, that true heroes and true villains are not childish or superficial.The existence of the good and the evil symbolizes the human and his internal fight and dilemma.Talking about lord of the rings,i think that its heroes are much more realistic than the ones in the game of thrones.Every important character in lord of the rings confronts his/her bad and dark self,for example frodo and boromir did.But the target is to transfer the meaning of hope and love that's why finally comes the redemption of the characters.I didn't see this in game of thrones and i didn't like it. Concluding,you could find some interesting things in game of thrones,one of them is the plot which will easily keep your eyes on the screen.Have a good day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are now too many plans of action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the 1-st season, it was great and it had everything. Season 2 was a bit of disappointment and in season 3 it keeps going like season 2.The general feeling is there are too many plans of action, and actually if you summarize en episode not much happens. An episode has one hour, and you have in season 3 maybe 10-12 plans of action, this means 5 minutes per plan - well not much happens as there is no physical time and everything goes forward very slow and it is kind of boring.And there are still new characters which appear in the movie. It is sad as this is ruining the movie. It is a good idea to have a complex movie with plans which intersects at certain point and have a connection, BUT you should keep it more simple, as from an action point of view I don't feel the dynamic of the movie, everything became static. I kind of lost the desire to see the movie. I thought is only my problem but I spoke with friends who are watching but they said the last 2 seasons are pretty boring, but they couldn't really say why.I gave a 9 as a mark for first season, but I can't go higher than 7 for the next two seasons. I only look now because I got used with the characters.I also feel a central character is missing from the movie. In the first season I felt Ned Stark was closer to something like this. but maybe this is the idea, not to have one.Anyway, I hope my review will reach the right eyes and maybe they fix season 4(maybe kill some characters). There shouldn't be more the 6-7 plans in a movie, at least 10 minutes per action should be shown in one episode.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the 1st episode from season 1 and I have to say I'm disappointed. After the 1st episode I already know this show doesn't have anything to offer for me. So I won't be wasting my time.I love fantasy genre in general. I have my standards and habits. I was almost shocked when I saw how this series is riding with nudity. Breasts visible all the time, naked women being toys for the guys. This was awful. I don't mind watching brutal scenes every now and then but I just can't see any reason why there has to be so much nudity.Good fantasy story rides on with it's good script and not with nudity. This series is more Bold And The Beautiful series with soft porn scenes.TL;DR Waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing Muck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This show and I assume the book(if the show is anyway accurate) paint a very depressing and twisted look into the human mind. The minute any character shows any decency, honor, loyalty or trust. They are shown to be weak and foolish then killed off. Not only are cruelty, deceit and selfishness needed to gain power and wealth, these characteristics are also needed to find justice for those who have been wronged. This means that any character that wants justice or to perform good deeds has to betray the principles they stand for to achieve these goals. I see no originality in this show only gratuitous violence and endless betrayal and backstabbing. Any 2 people who marry for love rather than power and wealth end up dead, so it is a fantasy world where happiness in unattainable as the wealthy and powerful are miserable fighting to hold what they have and acquire more and anyone not concerned with these things gets trampled on and used. It seems the the author of Game of Thrones may be quite right though since the books and show are so popular humans really do enjoy violence and treachery. Production values are good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch the series because my boyfriend is a fan. I've tried to like it, but it's hard you know?I don't mind violence and sex, but I think this is the only thing Game of Thrones has to offer. For me it's just terrible, the characters are the worst human beings portrayed on TV. They don't know loyalty, friendship or respect. All I see is gossip and betrayal, with tons of sex and naked girls just because.Even after watching the first episode of the third season I still don't know what the plot is. There were so many screen time for silly fights between lovers I tought I was watching Gossip Girl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Game that never ends / gets to the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those new to this thing, the only reason Game of thrones the book series got so much undeserved attention is because it went in the opposite direction of the fantasy genre's rules. Instead of a classic good vs evil take it went for the everybody's in the Grey area. The problems started right there, cos for most people fantasy is the genre where you want classic good vs evil battles and you can sometimes show the honourable side of a villain, doesn't mean they get as equally good moral compasses as the heroes. Thats what the drama genre is for. The second thing thats wrong with the books is that they simply have no sense of direction, like when the first harry potter book was being written by J.K Rowling, she knew how the story was going to pan out. She knew it would be a seven book series and had a bird's eye view of the future works. Game of thrones simply is an improv sketch, where George Martin made the story up as it went along. Some of the stories just makes no sense , its like watching the life of an ordinary guy, nothing happening, story not leading to anything , any event. Even though HBO has thrown in some big budget sets, VFX and good actors, this ultimate sense of futility will definitely start getting to you from season two/three. Remember all the fun times we had hating mindless gore/sadistic movies and calling everyone that watched them sick. Well hurray, this show just managed to convert everyone to the other side. Now you can just cut the head of lead and noble characters, and call it unimaginable plot twist. Killing the hero is not a plot twist, ending of Sixth sense was a plot twist. Any idiot can create a sense of shock by suddenly killing of the most important characters in the show. I don't know if any of you have seen The Hot Tub Time Machine, but in it there's a scene where John Cusack's character asks the kid why he's wasting his time in a game(second life) just being in prison taking push ups. I mean this is the place where you get to do the impossible stuff, so why not go kill some orcs or terrorists and be a hero? Game of thrones is ruining the fantasy genre like that. This is an escapist genre, where you don't have to be reminded of the grim, boring nature of our lives, a genre where heroes are born, epic battles are conducted, where there is always light at the end of darkness, hope that makes you want to live. In short, If you like your TV shows to make no sense, no purpose, and you re happy to just watch fictional characters living out their lives, talking matters of no importance to each other, cutting heads, raping, molesting, where the hero always dies, you ll find it sufferable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a certain audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. I do not care for fantasy. 2. I despise HBO. Having gotten those two caveats out of the way, I was recently subjected to the first five episodes of this HBO series. I found it talky, flatly directed and under-budgeted, which is nothing new with TV series or miniseries. At the same time, I was surprised by the quality of some of the acting, especially Lena Headley, Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, and the cinematography, which brought this alternate universe world to life. I also understand the script adheres fairly closely to the book, probably because the author was responsible for translating it to the screen. From what I saw of it, I would warn prospective viewers not to expect another LORD OF THE RINGS. It reminded me more of DUNE. As with so many HBO shows, there's some gratuitous sex and nudity, including truly repulsive scenes where a 10 year old boy suckles at his mother's teat and an effeminate man performs fellatio. There's also some gore and violence, although not enough for this gore-and-violence fan. I understand some of the worst cruelty in the book has been eliminated. Thank god for small favors. This show is for adult fantasy fans and those who like to be titillated, like the individual who made me sit through the first five episodes. At times, it verges on the pornographic.</fullReview>

His prose (or lack thereof) is horrendous and the funniest thing about the show is that it comes off just as dry and bland as it does in the books. For avid fantasy readers it is insufferable to read and watch the blatant and sometimes subtle literary theft-cover-up-change-a-tad often dished out on the pages. If we were to punish for the crime of literary theft, then he'd be serving a Life Sentence! The show receives at least a star for a so-so cast of actors that try to pull off the impossible and make the story actually interesting and worthy of a bag of popcorn, but in the end the show is not something you'll be binge watching anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I confess I did not read the books, and did not even give Game Of Thrones a try until just today when I watched the pilot. The name simply didn't appeal, but after catching positive buzz about it, I wondered if it could possibly be something like my beloved Spartacus series which sadly ended last season.I could not have been more wrong. The one thing they do have in common is production value. That's sadly where it ends.Where Spartacus had deliciously gripping plots weaving phenomenally-written characters together into intimate dramas, GOT throws out an endless cast of colorless, simplistic characters hoping something will stick. Worse, the plot is as old and moldy as the characters, (Kings wanting their MTV, yadda yadda yadda). And while Spartacus had more than its share of over-the-top violence and depravity, it all served a purpose and the writers still managed to expose the humanity of each character through it all. In GOT the sex, depravity and greed is gratuitous, shallow and as pointless as the rest of the show, leaving me with a sense that I just watched the unimaginative fantasy of a 9yr old boy with anger issues.The first five minutes had me thinking maybe this was going to be a good show... but it quickly derailed into boredom and by the halfway point in the pilot I was wondering if I should waste my time watching the second half. I did, but it only confirmed my opinion.Spartacus always left me feeling exhilarated because of the outstanding writing and characters. In fact the characters and plots were so well written the show could stand on its own with most of the sex and violence edited out, as could happen if it is ever syndicated for network TV. Game Of Thrones, on the other hand, feels like a flat, old, board game. No standout character. No standout plot line. Nothing to pull me in and make me want to see more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have given up on this piece of garbage, it is so boring, being nothing but an unending parade of characters, all with mops of hair all over the place, fur, leather, steel, breastplates, swords, spears, blood and ambition. Every show is nothing but turgid scene after turgid scene, strung together in no discernibly meaningful sequence, of these buffoons endlessly engaging in inane verbal sparring matches, torture and murder, or sex. Even the sex scenes stink, nothing but flat chested babes obligatorily baring their embarrassing AAA cup breasts. It doesn't even qualify as porn. The plot, if there is one, moves at a glacial pace, strewn with confusion at all turns. The editing cuts from one verbal sparring match to the next, with nary a thought to continuity of place, character or plot. It is boring, repetitive and leads nowhere. There are simply too many characters, locations, schemes, supernatural events and words to form a coherent presentation. If you took all the episodes of the whole season, cut them at every scene and then scrambled them all together you could then splice them back together at random and you'd have a new season of episodes with no detectable difference. My wife is addicted to this crud so I have to endure it as she endures my Netflix choices of history and documentaries. I read while she rots her brain with this horrible waste of electricity, running the TV and DVD player.</fullReview>

I'm impressed with some characters that I follow, but there are a bunch of characters I could care less about. Not cause the actors are bad or the characters aren't interesting, but because following seven families and the members of the families is soap opera like..

		<fullReview>I didn't read the books so what I see in the episode this week is completely new to me. The movie is outstanding, the plot it very complex, you get a lot of action/drama scenes. Sometimes it gives you the felling that you're watching a football match where you don't have a favorite team, but as the game goes you get this occurred felling and you get yourself backing a team as if they where your favorites from the beginning. It definitely makes you want more. I was going like this episode after episode until I've reached this 9 cursed number were Lord Eddard Stark dies. How is it that the main character, the iconic figure of this series, the one that absorbed like a sponge the hole action around him dies? You see him on the trailers, on the advertisements, on the press posters, you see him everywhere. Every morning I see his face on a big poster in the bus station. He made the film alive! Why would you kill the man that puts people in front of the TV? I understand that this is from the book and he was suppose to die. OK, I agree with this but the book foreshore did not point out Ned as the movie does. I understand that not all movies should have a happy ending and that normally it should made the acting more trilling and the audience more attracted when some important character dies but the hole team blew it when they put Ned on a pedestal and then hacked him down like a lamb.</fullReview>

Something was missing that I could not put my finger on. Maybe too much CGI? I'd prefer real sets in this story I think, where possible. I'm getting a little tired of the same type modern computer graphics look in all these different series on the various networks. The other problem was the speed they attempted to introduce the characters. Seems like I couldn't quite get an endearment for any of them yet. I guess they were just trying to get people hooked from the beginning and introduce the whole map area and various families. I'm not sure that worked well in practice. I'll watch the whole thing with the hope that it works out well, but I am not real overly impressed with the beginning. Not bad, just not excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take every fantasy cliché' you've ever seen or read, repeat those in a dull soap opera format that plods from subplot to subplot, and you have "Game of Thrones." Why are way too many of the character in shows today written as female characters regardless of the actual sex of the character? giving lots of dialogue a "prissy," "catty" tone that rings hollow like a soap opera? Where are the male characters speaking and acting like men do? I simply can't imagine feudal warlords having prissy repartee like modern HS students, yet "Game of Thrones" is full of it. Fantasy themes are supposed to be at least as much action as character or dialogue driven. This show is 95% talk and 5% action. GOT is dirt cheap to make and formulaic.Season One wasn't all that bad, but the second season of this show is one of the worst examples of "hook the audience, then bleed them out slowly and rip them off" I've ever seen, straight off a midway. It may be the worst season of a television program I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot.Avoid this if you are over 14 or under 14 and reasonably intelligent.</fullReview>

It's good for teenagers though. If you're true fan of the books - stay out of it! If you haven't read the books yet - do it now and learn the difference.

		<fullReview>First of all, ill say that I didn't read the book, nor did I ever heard of it. Second; I watched the first 6 episodes so far (thats 6 hours).Most reviews are mainly positive, but many of those are written by the book readers. If one feels that you have to read the book to enjoy the series this review is not for you.This series is a drag. I think thats the best way to describe it. Its a never ending introduction of people whom may become important later or whom may not, you don't know for sure. Its about intrigue, backstabbing, leadership, honor, good, evil all that.. but it doesn't deliver. Some things happen, and if it does the show will definitely let you know "something" happened. Even if its not that special it will become the main part of the story for to long. Six episodes is almost 6 hours, nothing 'epic'/'grand' happened. All six hours is talk and no show. You might see a sword fight or two (not much more), but no battles or some breath holding scenes. Even those who love this series cannot deny this. There are no real scenes in it, which will 'take you away', in lack of better words. So far, to me, this is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. You keep switching from story line to story line, and although they are put together nicely it just gets boring after an hour or 4. Once again I'd like to state that nothing really happens. There is one thing this series does. It somehow keeps you interested. I think I know why. its because the story lines that are plotted out continually give you the feeling something grand is going to happen. I had that feeling since episode 1, but it never delivered. They set-up this epic wars and battles that are bound to happen, but they don't. I imagine something will happen soon enough, but its too late imo.I am not watching dragon ball (or am I?). I don't want to watch 6 to 8 hours for one action episode. That makes it a SOAP. I am all for 'complicated'/ extended story lines, but not this. Its to much. To much characters you need to know, to much different protagonists, to much parallel story lines. Acting wise, I am not to impressed (also not disappointed). Its hard, because there are to many lead-roles. The big roles are filled by competent actors. In this aspect they do transcend a soap, but there are many roles that are filled with lesser ones. (for me; Jaime Lannister and Jon Snow don't hit it)I am not shy to sex-scenes. I am from The low lands and we like to make sex the main basis of all our movies, but come on. The abundant nakedness almost makes me think someone is compensating... for lack of action that is. Sex scenes are fine, but imo to much emphasis is placed on some in this series and that makes it a bit weird now and then.To conclude; I actually don't think my comparison with dragonball, for the ones familiar, is that bad. One battle could last a season. In this case a season is comparable to the preface of a DBZ episode. It only remains interesting because they constantly talk about grand wars and actually ride to war since episode one, but the 2 out of (the?!?) three sword fights are fought with wooden swords (not kidding) and my patience is starting to evaporate soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, it's a high production value, high level of acting and casting but it doesn't change the fact that it's all about people having sex while TALKING about something interesting happening elsewhere, off camera, in the past or in the future. If you want to know what Season 1 is about you can watch the first three scenes and the last scene of season one, and you wouldn't really miss anything. It's Sex and the City in a fantasy world... Really... Truly... But u get to watch ppl wearing swords and having sex with your girlfriend! Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit is soooooooooo boooooooooooooooorrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiing!! If you have watched more then one movie or read one book in your life there really aren't any surprises or new things to this. It's an HBO show, just placed in a fantasy setting this time (lame imo)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So you get friends coming to you to say "you gotta watch GOT, it's amazing!" and not being a TV watcher you ignore them. So you see the series on offer on DVD and you mention it to the wife and low and behold you get it as a present. So you watch it and hope that it is going to be something special. And low and behold you ring up your mates after watching a number of episodes and say "WFT is this shyte?" And then you remember these same "mates" were lollygagging about "Dexter" (which is possibly the worst mistake I have ever made when buying DVD's recommended by "mates". But back to GOT. It is not just that it is going nowhere but, like, Dexter, is it quickly running out of ideas. So far, some kid was murdered by a brother and sister but he doesn't die and wakes up not remember anything. Or does he? Or who cares? And then there is the nudity and sex. Right, it is HBO, and there is nothing wrong with a bit of nudity and sex, but Jaysus, we have watched a few episodes now and the sex business is just there for no reason. No "plot" advancement. No explanation of character. Nothing. Just sex. Alright there is an incest scene but interestingly not graphic and this is the whole premise of the story. As I said we are about 6 or 7 episodes into this shyte, but the story is thin and as of yet we have not had the obligatory lesbian scene (HBO trademark, come to that every Network trademark). Something to look forward to I suppose as there is feck all else. The 2/10 rating is for the character of the midget brother and Sean Bean. This rises it slightly above awful. And for those who will say watch the whole series and then comment I say do I have to? Really, do I have to?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is much intelligence evident in the writing for this series. The story is solid. But it's presented as something akin to The Lord Of The Rings, full of magic and wonder. It is not only boring and slow, this series, but it's relentlessly grim - like the daily news. I'd rather have the daily news. When I read it, I am looking for the info and expect it to be bad. When I'm looking for entertainment, while betrayal, destruction and good guys and gals loosing may be part of the story, I am not looking for only grim, which is what you get here. As for the supernatural and fantastic, it's next to non existent.You have the odd shot of a cool looking kingdom and that's it. When it looks cool from a distance, once we get closer and behind the gates, there's the same old blah.This isn't entertainment in any positive sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite bad actually</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So everyone is complaining about the series being to slow paced. I don't deny that, but the books are as well so there's not too much that can be done there. One thing that annoys me though is that this series get most of their good reviews because people like to watch the sex scenes, they barely even care about the plot. There's plenty of places where you can watch naked girls, I could name some for you if you want...Another thing is that the plot has become to boring. During season 1 it was good and seemed to build up to something even better but then what happened? I know that the writers are just following the books but you can't let the audience get all excited for something big to come and then just drop it in the way that they did. The last thing is that I think they are plagiarizing The Lord of the Ring way too much, sure George Martin has said that it has been one of his inspirations writing the books but really it's quite embarrassing to watch. To the people that has watch GoT but not watched LotR I recommend you do it and later on see what you think of the series.This series has almost become unwatchable for me nowadays and I'm not enjoying it when I watch it, I feel like the only reason why I watch it is to be done with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Art thrives on limitations, or it can also thrive on big budgets. But I have never seen art push so far to these two extremes that it becomes an overdone and overbearing nightmare that never gets to the point. It's a chess game that never ends. I thought Law and Order was dull.I truly believe that this book series would work better as Films, because cuts would be needed, and believe me, I would cut out a lot of scenes in the HBO series. Hell, I'd cut characters out altogether, Rob and Arya Stark, and the other Stark kid who has noodles for legs, and others. You can retire these characters with no warning right now and I would not have caught on. Until they do something important, I won't care. Sorry, Mother of Dragons.This show takes itself too seriously that there gray characters and gray persona's matches there gray on gray suits and landscapes, even when you see red and gold, its lies. It's hard to care about The Kings Slayer when the biggest things he has done in the series is bang his sister, pushed a kid out a high window and had his stranger hand chopped off. Even though there are a few scenes with him after that which seems to have a potential to launch into something interesting, if not good. Whether they use this to its advantage or not, remains to be seen, most likely not.The only character that stands out in anyway is The Dwarf character. He is not a good character, but he is the only hint of a character we have.There are too many characters in this story, even for TV show standards.THERE ARE 32 MAINE CHARACTERS ALONE!!! (One or two of them being killed off, even so...)No wonder the show has weak focus. There is simply not enough screen time for any of the them, which makes you forget about most of them as soon as they leave. And I love how they just keep adding new characters, because that is exactly what the ultimate solution is, right? Reminds me of No Country for Old Men.This show needs to learn to leave well enough alone, when to not drag and when to move on, learn to be comfortable with edit, and being serious and gray does not make this show epic or deep, let alone smart, it is just underwhelming. The Walking Dead isn't this serious.I'll still watch GOT like a sports fan who still sticks with their bad team, but I'm hoping as the show goes on, it will undo all the issues I have had and finally make a story that is worth a damn. Put you pieces where they need to be and stop stalling.I just saw season three episode nine, and congrats, my friend, you have actually made me care about people in a scene, but in the most basic and cheap way possible. Its never comfortable for ANYONE to watch ANYONE get an abortion in that fashion, but if screwing someone or getting killed is your only wow moment these characters ever get, then stop writing and find a different hobby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to watch this because others were watching it and I tried to be open minded and see what all the fuss was about. Seriously how did such a silly novel came to screen! This shouldn't have been done by HBO. It' just nerd fantasy fiction. What a derivative story! They just throw in all sorts of shocking and titillating nonsense to make a story but it's all so silly. There is just so much gross stuff: the incest, the beheading and other dismemberments, the token homosexuals, the gratuitously violent sword fighting and last but not least the "Golden Crown". I'm reminded of what many prominent authors and critics got together to say about Harry Potter: The sight of grown people reading the books is distressing. The same can be said of Game of Thrones. Except Game is full of so many unpleasant characters. The cast tries hard but they are wasted. They are almost all irritating and to kill of Sean Bean leaving only Lena Headey as a cast member of stature! Can't bear to think of Season 2 relying on the remaining cast. I think the worst part was watching Emilia Clarke talk that strange language for minutes on end.Were there any good points? Just the effort put in production set design and makeup. Jason Momoa does look like a human monster here. The vaguely British Irish medieval castles and settings are well done. Its just a shame so much effort went into such drivel.</fullReview>

There's not much that I can add to the criticisms that have been leveled at this pretentious, humorless and vacuous twaddle, especially as I only just managed to get to the end of the first episode. But from what I've read, nothing much changes, and I've certainly got far better, if lower rated, shows and films to spend my time watching. I'm sure that if I was about 13 years old again I'd love it, but it's a total mystery to me why it has so many 'adult' fans.

		<fullReview>The only thing I see good here is how costumes and makeup were done, and that too leaves something to be desired.I approached the show thinking I'm going to be its biggest fan most likely. I'm like that, and it looked promising. I have not read the books, and after watching this I don't think they will be worth it.I have seen all the seasons and barely managed to remember who is who, and how is he related to everybody else. Characters are poorly done, you can't be sure if an action would be in someone's character or not. Cause they are all so bland. Characters you might grow to somewhat like get killed, and I didn't mourn them either. You barely feel the loss of anyone.The show feels like they are literally using the book script as a series script, which makes it drag unbelievably. Not all the details from the book should be included in movies, because not everything and everybody is of equal importance to the story.I didn't want to judge the show before seeing all seasons...but watching them was really draining and boring...and it really bugs me how you are set up to start liking Dany, everything is going in that direction...it feels like writer made too many characters to develop them, then started killing them off, saying it was on purpose to make his world seem cruel.There is too much emphasis on sex for no reason. When it serves to make the plot going or to add depth to characters like Cercei, I can understand why it has been shown. But I can't grasp two girls pretending to have sex, while Littlefinger talks about his first love in the same room, addressing them. That is twisted...This thing is just really badly done, but books might be interesting...cause in books, details matter...and in shows, they hinder the overall feeling...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Full disclosure: I have not read any of the books, and this is the first time I am experiencing this narrative.Based on the high praise here on IMDb, and a personal recommendation from a friend, I have given GoT a try. I must say that I am not overly impressed. At the end of each episode, I feel slightly disappointed, as if this show has the potential to be great, but always seems to fall short somehow. My impression after watching five episodes: GoT is basically a manufactured (and predictable) cliffhanger narrative based in a fantasy realm, full of unnecessary sex and violence, that seems tacked on because that is what is 'fashionable' at the moment.Now I know what you are thinking. You think that I am some sort of prude or puritan or something. That could not be further from the case. I have no problem with sex or violence, no matter how explicit, if it furthers the narrative. That just does not seem to be the case here.It is not a bad show by any means. But it is also not a 9.5 show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The real trouble with this show -- Game of Thrones -- is that if you compare it to a show like Boss -- which is about loyalty just as much as Game of Thrones, but Boss is arguably current day and therefore has an astonishing measure of "real" application to our current political environment and current core political issues -- is that it is a fantasy. Admirers of the TV/Cable show Game of Thrones are so admiring of the show -- per having read many positive reviews -- precisely because it depicts the fantasy/fantastical story presented in the fantasy book so well. But the book is a fantasy. With so many admirers of the fantasy, a thinking/questioning person begins to wonder why all this "reach" and marvel into what even the author of the fantasy contends is fantasy that quite literally has little to do with our current times -- other than the predictable traces of "human nature?" I watched the first two episodes of the series and thought okay...it's okay as a story told...but there is really very little to be learned about mankind that we cannot discern from one day's daily newspaper from a large international city -- or a single issue of The Economist; who's in trouble now...and why? I suspect the rigorous and dedicated followers of this show need to be shown a "world" that is a distraction, not a distillation, of the more concrete world in which we, the living, live...to be shown a world without the current manifestations of political ambivalence and upheaval, the forces of political expansion and contraction, and most of all, political jeopardy and the individual's political polarization. But this is why I give Game of Thrones a 2-star rating; it is no real help to any of us now...it's simply a distraction. More soberly, why aren't we all wondering why we have been invited to watch the spectacle of slow economic meltdowns of the so-called PIIGS of Europe, all predominantly Catholic nations, without learning of any public, notable financial assistance from the Vatican? Let's define loyalty, really,...and for real. In addition, the CGI is strangely amateurish and the soft-core seemingly purely "eye-candy"; plaudits for so unsubtly targeting the 15-35 male audience to boost the ratings -- just can't get more vulgar than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones is another one of those series that follows the trend of exploiting violence and sex to draw in an audience. Sex and violence would not, in themselves, be a problem, had they any context or relevance to the story of the development of the characters. Unfortunately, this is not the case here. The series follows the story of a number of 'noble families' with fights for power and political intrigue occurring against a backdrop of a fabulous and fantastic world. The premise has potential, however the result is poor. The story is predictable and has been covered from a number of angles. The characters are one-dimensional, either good or bad, no in-between. The only exception to this being Tyrion Lannister, who makes quite an interesting character. There is a constant display of gratuitous violence that is displayed as if normal for the time. Seeing that this is fantasy, there is no historical accuracy to maintain, the violence and sexuality displayed are merely a choice of the writers and not historical depictions of a time and place that does not exist in the first place. Also worrying is the normalisation of the mistreatment of women. Not only there are numerous prostitutes to pleasure the men in many occasions (and not useful for anything else), women are often referred to as 'whores'. It begs belief that this sort of misogynistic behaviour, which is offered as that of 'noble men' and therefore normalised, does not raise eyebrows or even disgust but instead praise and a number of Golden Globe nominations. The acting is far from fantastic and what is it with those English accents coming up randomly? There are instances where the series shows potential and the characters display interesting and unexpected behaviour. Unfortunately this is not as often as it could be to support such as basic story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This show started with promise, as I'm a huge Sean Bean and medieval fan...but with an absolutely nauseating amount of gratuitous and unnecessary sex and gore, my opinion turned sour very quickly. I don't consider myself high brow, but the sex and violence in this show for the most part is geared towards a simple-minded audience...which I'm not a grunting ape so I necessitate more than that. Oh and lest I forget, I could overlook a bunch of the raunchy scenes if not for the unbelievably irritating character of Joffrey. That little puke completely ruins this show as I get so annoyed every time he's on screen that I grit my teeth and can't even watch. By the 7th episode, I was done and sent back my unopened second season to Amazon.Furthermore, Ned, his illegitimate son, and sword fighting daughter are the only likable characters. However, they get mucked over at every single turn with no repercussions...which I choose to voyeur into escapism in order to get away from injustice, not watch more of it.I'm amazed at the high praise this trash gets, but I suppose it's a social commentary on what the current populous thinks is entertainment.Sorry I wasted my time.</fullReview>

Hobb had to wait due to the immediacy of my addiction. I was somewhat let down in the first episode. Now I can say nothing more than: so far, it is merely watchable. The books sucked me in and held me due to the amount of detail and immersion in the storyline. The characters came to life, leaving you wanting more and more. This series lacks the character development needed to achieve the same effect. I hold hope that once the cast are at war and the starks and cohorts are on the move, things will pick up, but I grow more and more skeptical. The imp is spot on, though.

		<fullReview>OK If you are reading this i am guessing you are one of those super fans who can't get enough of Game Of Thrones &amp; like wallowing in your appreciation of this despicable sorry excuse for TV Fantasy drama. As you can tell i am not one of you. Game of Thrones has so many good reviews &amp; such glowing praise as to make me wonder if the whole world has fallen asleep or alternatively hooked up to some matrix-like hive mind channelling this drivel through a tube placed carefully up your backside, can so many people be so wrong? well the answer is Yes obviously. To Critique this show in a sour way is tantamount to treason i am sure but i am British &amp; trust me it is OK to voice your opinion in a negative way despite the whole world wanting to spit venomous bile in your eyes. I have like most of you, watched every episode of it &amp; although you will rant that i have a choice not to watch it or to plainly just go away, i, like a lot of people these days like watching TV shows &amp; be they bad or good it is always good to watch the things that everyone is talking about (and talking about, and talking about) so i carry on in the vain hope that one day i'll switch this show on &amp; something will actually happen but instead i get B grade British actors talking about 'The Wall' or saying things like 'Something awful is coming' or 'Let's shag!' &amp; on &amp; on, talking, more talking &amp; waiting &amp; waiting, always waiting for something to happen, has anyone noticed that nothing has happened in this show for the last 2 seasons? oh but there was a big battle! yes there was except we missed most of it as we were watching the women hiding below talking some more. Oh but there was 'The Wedding' yes there was, 5 minutes of action tabbed on the end of one of those lengthy talky episodes (you know the ones) 'wow so radical, killing off some of the main characters in such a ghastly manner, no one has done that before' Give me strength!! Game of thrones is like a really bad carrot, like the ones you always throw away to get a better one in the grocers, and the viewers are like ageing donkeys continually following it around until you are so accustomed to doing it that you just carry on regardless, yes i am one of them, i've been suckered as well!, i admit it but by always tossing out the promise of dragons i persevered anyway &amp; now i am at a point that i am writing a review about it, not because i like the bloody thing more because i am sick of these endless reviews praising it's 'Boldness', it's 'Genius', it's 'Lord of the Rings-ish-ness.' My god people, what version of Lord of the Rings have you seen? the one i watched was majestic, action packed, sad, uplifting, funny &amp; the real definition of Genius. Not this pile of puss spewing troll bile that passes itself off as fantasy, if anything its more like playboy channel soft core porn than epic fantasy, obviously one of the main reasons its so popular. Of course you will tell your girlfriend/boyfriend your watching it for the breathtaking dramatics or epic storytelling (because of course it has both of those..cough..choke!!) So you will go on watching it telling your friends how amazing it is, how shocked you were by it etc etc but deep down you all know the truth, that this is just a low level generic hybrid of The Red Shoe Diaries, Dr Quinn Medicine Woman &amp; the recent crap Conan movie. In years to come this will be joked about, like in one of those TV Shows that reminisce about the 80's or 90's with a headline like 'How 10 million people COULD be wrong' &amp; you'll sit there &amp; laugh to yourself in a sad 'i wasted my youth' type way, you will finally realise after years of trailing after the carrot that nothing is going to happen in this show, you'll be left with one last talky exposition scene (whilst a battle rages on somewhere else, presumably somewhere they can't take the cameras) everybody will sit round the throne &amp; toast with fine wine &amp; grapes, there will be singing &amp; dancing &amp; orgies (of course) and maybe if we are lucky, one of the dragons might take a dump? Seriously if people don't start waking up soon i worry about the world, i mean Reeves &amp; Fishburne are way too famous now to give a toss so save yourselves. There are much better shows out there to obsess over, much better fantasy books to read, much much better fantasy films to watch &amp; certainly way better porn! but of course if watching evil characters twirl their moustaches &amp; cackling behind peoples backs whilst masturbating over incestuous kin doing the Humpty Dumpty is your kind of thing, there is at least one scene like this every couple of episodes so knock yourself out. oh and of course you will get the promise of dragons just at the moment your thinking about switching off &amp; watching re-runs of Breaking Bad instead... awful TV, watch Lord of the Rings again, that might wake you up my Matrix loving friends. Game of Thrones, enjoy your stay of execution but one day your head is going to be lopped off just like the only good actor in your show... By the way if you are thinking i am a Troll, i'm not, Trolls are fictional beasts that usually turn up in decent fantasy shows along with Goblins &amp; Dragons, all of which do not feature prominently in Game of Thrones!</fullReview>

It is horrendous and it completely escapes me how people manage to enjoy this garbage. There is actually a scene in one of the episodes when someone gets grumpy after failing a jousting tournament, pulls out a sword and cuts a horses head off. Like, actually off of it's body. There is another scene in the same episode in the same situation (a jousting tournament) where someone gets a joust stuck in their throat and they start vomiting blood. I hope this series gets stopped soon, it is absolutely disgusting and gut-wrenching. My peers and siblings seem to enjoy it because of the occasional sex scene. It is so stupid that they would put pornographic scenes in this television show. I have no idea why such great actors would join this trash. Probably the worst show I have ever experienced and would rather watch My Little Pony than this stupid worthless trash which I hope gets removed before it damages anyone else.

		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying, I hated this series. My two daughters love it, but I don't want them to watch it any longer. The only thing I remember from first season were tits. You can't create a series with only boobs in it. The story was very thin and it was confusing. There were too many characters in the movie. I didn't see any epic battles whatsoever. I expected Nightwalkers and Dragons all over the place. Instead, I, and I stress, see boobs. Only boobs. It was depressing, because my wife was jealous. She was so jealous that she went to have plastic surgery. It was a total nightmare in my opinion. The blond girl, she was like 14. They dwarf was annoyingly short for my taste. And they all acted like they were from the medieval times. I simply can say, I hated this series. But people seem to love it. And I don't blame for being short minded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary violence, nudity and slow plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched up to ep5 The nudity and violence in this series is unnecessary. 9.5/10 sex scenes depict soulless sex or "f...king whores" as they would call it as opposed to sex between people who care for each other. IMO it glorifies having sex with as many women as possible as women are disposable and plenty for a price. Continuously referring to women as "whores" and the amount of times a brothel house crops up is unnecessary as well. I feel like this show is catering for heartless and violent men or glorifying those who are and depicting them as men of honor.There are a few scenes where someone's head has been chopped off with blood spurting/rolling around which is tasteless and serves no purpose. The Lord of the Rings' battle scenes don't even portray this level of violence gore.The plot is slow to develop and the only exciting things that happen are in the last few minutes of the show where they place a cliff hanger of some sort. Watching a whole ep for those few minutes isn't worth it at all. More events unfold in Jersey Shore's 40m than 3hrs of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nudity and Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to watch this. I really did. And I really wanted to like this.There is just so much nudity that I am not continuing.This show seems to have lots of neat and interesting points to it. But I have seen ENOUGH of women's naked body parts. And I simply cannot stomach any more.Many people obviously don't mind this. But I absolutely hate that what looks like such an interesting show has been cheapened so badly. Some people may call it "gritty" and "realistic." I find it trashy. You can still imply things are happening without shoving it in your face.I am extremely irked because I simply love fantasy, and the mythical creatures, political situations, and intricate world makes me want to watch this badly.But I don't know if I can get through my disgust. I almost turned it off after seeing yet another de-robing of a woman (the second time with this particular woman) with her pointed parts in plain view, while a man proceeded to take advantage of her while she was crying. I mean, this show can stand on its own without all this stuff and still be successful. What is the point of throwing in this trash? Is titillation to draw in perverted viewer counts worth ruining what could otherwise be a very respectable timeless work? I believe that whoever decided to include this was directly, and absolutely, lowering the value of this work.Anyway, I'm sure many will disagree with me, but I was extremely disappointed.Additionally, yes there was a fair amount of gore. A lovely intestine hanging out of a freshly sliced man, maggots on a de-gutted deer with a closeup of its head and bloated tongue, be-headings with pretty views of the red neck meat. Ugh. It was not as bothersome as my prior complaint, but I don't have too much of a problem with gore. Also it wasn't as frequent.With so many positive ratings, I feel that my viewpoint should be put out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the 1st season. Very very boring. I think I have wasted 10 hours of my life, for nothing, by watching this series. The first episode was a bit promising, but later on nothing. So i saw the rest of the 1st season hoping for some improvement, which never "came". The script and the plot is nothing special and very very slow. Casting is also poor except, Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage. The production gave me the impression of a low budget film. Too much blood, without any war scenes. Too many sex scenes probably too boost up the ratings. Compared to the Pilars of the Earth (8 mini TV series), The game of Thrones is at least 3 "steps" lower. I really do not understand the IMDb high score of 9.4, No way ! There is no point for me to wait for season 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After four episodes, I have to say that I am disappointed. It's not that too much is happening - I love my entertainment to be packed with storytelling - it's more that every single thing that happens, and the way everything is done, is utterly cliché, and seems cobbled together from dozens of other works. The impetus of the story is shock value and soap opera, sex scenes that convey obviously conservative values (as per what we're supposed to be shocked about), characters who act idiotically, and stupid-looking hair-colors. This does not say "timeless quality" to me.There is some entertainment value here, but not enough to make it really interesting. The show has two assets: Peter Dinklage and Maisie Williams. Well, and Sean Bean. And, I guess, the guy who plays the bastard, although he, too, is terribly cliché. Oooh, the wronged bastard who is really a super-nice guy and worthy heir... sheesh. Anyway, I felt like I recognized Maisie Williams from somewhere, but it dawned on me that she just resembles James McAvoy quite enormously... Funny.Anyway, I don't expect this show to keep my (very critical, I admit) interest for much longer, as it will probably never rise from its swamp of soapiness and into truly epic territory. I will say, though, that I'm impressed and amused with the way HBO always makes use of almost exclusively British acting talent when they want to make sure the cast and the voice acting are of a properly excellent caliber. Cheaper and better in one fell swoop, no doubt. So, I guess the U.S. still needs the ol' country now and again when quality is at the stake...6 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After two episodes I still couldn't get into the series, there is no emotional buildup or character development. The rest of the series I fast-forwarded through, dwelling about 5 to 7 minutes on each episode. I stopped in episode 6.Here's what you get: -One-dimensional stereotyped characters "we don't care" for -infinite boring dialogs -bleak film sets devoid of modern visuals and CGI -animal killings: Nytheria (wolf) and the beheading of a horse early on. This wouldn't bother me if the wolf hadn't been the one likable character on the show -tons of bleak looking medieval stuff-a storyline excruciatingly following the book series -nudity could aid the series, in GoT it is misplaced and women are debased (e.g. A knight just beheaded someone and proclaims to his newfound lad whether he would like to lay with a woman now, as he usually does after gorefests - RIGHT in front of the queen). That's the general attitude towards females of the whole series "Spartacus" is female emancipation compared to this show -dated. The series might as well have been made three decades ago. There is nothing revolutionary. It is purely fan driven.-Devoid of fantasy (Normally I would like that, except in GoT this means more endless hard to follow dialogue on the backdrop of beak-looking sets).The best proof that this show is only watched by fanboys and girls can be seen directly in the IMDb ratings. 98% rate the show a 10/10. Fantasy at its best.</fullReview>

I agree, there is too much sex and naked women, but hey, are we already so desensitized as human beings, that those disgusting scenes are not a problem? My stomach is still confused. I had to cover my eyes at every 2 scenes. If children grow with this kind of evening movies it is just wrong. Also, the characters were developed superficially, in a poor manner. They were childishly divided between extremely good and extremely evil. If the movie is very accurate and realistic, why these non-realistic people?

		<shortDescription>First episode too rushed, but getting better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start I should mention that I'm a die hard fan of the books, and consequently had ever-so-high expectations of this series, so of course I was bound to be at least partially disappointed. However, I think they've done a fair job in putting the book to the screen, as much as I can judge from the opening episode. The art direction is commendable, and it was amazing to see the book come to life in that sense (particularly the Wall!). Great care has been taken with costuming, locations, and props. I have absolutely no complaints in this sense. Also, the plot has been followed so far in its critical points (for us fans)... compacted and adjusted when necessary in quite effective ways. The casting is mixed, but in general does a fair job of representing the book's characters. The actor who plays Bran could not have been better chosen. Tyrion, Arya, Sansa, Eddard, and others are very good as well. But still others are not as strong, such as Jamie and Cercei Lannister (they needed to be much bolder and ruthless figures in order for later character development to really pan out). Some characters seem to have been changed a bit... such as Illyrio, who in the book is a much more flamboyant and pretentious character. But in general I think the actors will do. All which bodes well for the series' future. However...My greatest criticism is that they rushed through too many things in the first episode, at the cost of sacrificing suspense and interest in the characters. There really was no need for this. The books are perfectly written to be made into a series (at least books 1-3), and the ambition to introduce all the characters in one go really sacrificed the book's careful character development (one that almost seemed pre-planned to be adapted for television... every two chapters would make an hour of television with a perfect hook point almost without exception). You don't get a chance to FEEL any of the characters. When Bran falls at the end of the episode, you really should have felt a terrible sense of loss. Not just curiosity about seeing the next episode. You should despise Jamie and Cercei Lannister from the start (very important if the series is to take you into the the second and third books). I think it would have paid off a lot more to get you to care deeply about one or two of the characters. There was no need to introduce Pentos just yet, for example. There was no need to make you understand the entire world situation in one go. It greatly sacrificed the suspense. Rushing through thing like that only made everything seem wooden and soulless. I think even my assessment of many of the actors is based on them not having the "room" to really develop their characters yet.I hope it was just the fear of not hooking the audience that led them to this rush, and that future episodes will allow the emotional suspense needed for this to really be a successful series. It does worry me that these are the same people behind Rome (I think it would have been better for the series if say, the producers of Deadwood developed it). Rome suffered from some of the same "soap opera-ish" type development. In some ways it reflects Martin's writing very well (the crassness, the sex, etc.), but so far it's really missing the subtlety of his characters (the greatest feature of the books by far, along with the political complexity). This IS just the first episode, though. First episodes are tough. So I have my fingers crossed. They have gotten a lot of things right, and George R.R. Martin's books were begging to be made into a series... it will be a real shame if the result is mediocre.SECOND EPISODE UPDATE: MUCH better. The pace has slowed a bit, the emotional impact is greater. I think Coaster-Waldau (Jamie) has more promise than I at first believed. Peter Dinklage I thought was perfect for Tyrion and in the second episode he confirms it fully. I still don't think Lena Headey is right for the part of Cercei... not in any way due to her acting, but her style in general. She is too earthy and much too likable. Cercei I thought should be cold, uppity, distant, too elegant. All in all the cast will do just fine if the pace isn't hurried. I now DO look forward to seeing the rest of the episodes. *Phew*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly boring so far (3 episodes in)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of HBO and the fantasy genre, I thought this show would be a sure-thing, alas I was wrong. Despite the universal acclaim the show is getting, I find it rather dull, boring and inconsistent. There are moments of brilliance that are too-often followed by nonsensical or badly written scenes. The Imp is a great character, by far the most interesting of the bunch, so much so that he makes the rest of the characters seem like dull archetypes. The show is also very sexist and gratuitous, and I'm no prude or overt feminist, I'm also a man. The plot line with the princess being more-or-less raped over and over again who then learns how to have sex more efficiently to please the man in question, now it seems she is in love with this man and happy about having his child.... yeah I don't think that's a very convincing or morally sound character arc. Between that, and scenes that occur for no natural reason other than plot advancement, I don't think its a great show. The production values are astounding, as you would expect from HBO, and the acting is great for the most part, so I' say it's slightly above average despite my complaints. I seem to be in a minority in not thinking this show is a masterpiece so I would have to recommend it for others to try for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly Made and Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This show is very bad, hard to even sit through the first episode.1) I am a bit surprised that if you organize the reviews here to show the bad reviews first, that universally the only complaint is the excessive sex. The sex IS excessive... but that's hardly what makes this show terrible. But while I'm on the topic let me second the previous assertions, there is too much sex, its way too graphic, and its portrayed in a way that is derogatory to women.2) Now that we've got the sex complaints out of the way, the show itself. The sets and props are just terrible. Glaring issues such as Lord Eddard's "leather" vest is stitched too perfectly, in pristine condition and clearly has never been worn before. When Jon Snow saddles a horse, he carries a large and perfectly manufactured saddle. The barbarian chief is supposed to be a tough, rough barbarian, and yet his body is too soft skinned with a tan that is obviously earned in a tanning bed, and why do you specifically mention his hair is supposed to be braided, and then never braid it but only bother to give him 3 or 4 ponytail holders? Oh and of course Danaerys who is supposed to have white hair just looks terrible with her dye job. Maybe someone who was a platinum blonde could have pulled it off better? Because getting a brunette to play her and just dying her hair is painfully obvious. These issues and issues like them distract from the believability of the show, and these things don't even require fancy special effects!3) The actors are dry and and give weak performances. Its hard to say whether its the fault of the actors or the director... But in the end you just never end up getting invested in the characters as anything just cheap 2dimensional stereotypes. You want to think that *maybe* they just didn't have enough time to develop each character, when they have so many characters to cover... but then you wonder why you have them waste so much of each episode staring blankly at the screen as if that creates emphasis or is dramatic or something.. it doesn't.4) The final point I have to make is in regards to the fact (I assume) that the reason this series is so popular is because of fans of the books. I read the books, and while the general plot, and most of the scenes are taken from the books, there are enough variations to bug you. I guess Lord Eddard is OK, he's a great actor, and Lady Cat is pretty well cast for her character, Bran and Arya and Sansa are good too, appearance-wise... but Jon Snow just doesn't strike me as the tough and clever guy he should be, and Robb doesn't seem nearly regal enough. King Robert was too soft looking for someone who still fights in tournaments and leads hunts, and his beard is not nearly burly enough. Jorah Mormont isn't old enough. Oh and the dwarf, Tyrion is supposed to be deformed, with dark hair streaked with blonde, mismatched eyes, and a protruding forehead and nose; but they just got a blonde little person to play him and left it at that. I could go on and on, but basically if you read the books then none of these characters in the show are going to sit well with the characters you read about. They also change small parts of certain scenes, which seems minor, but completely changes the nature of certain characters. For example, when Danaerys gets married to Khal Drogo, they almost play the scene exactly like the book... but then they basically just have him force himself on her and move on, where in the book he is patient waiting for her to accept his advances. This totally changes the nature of their relationship in my opinion, where in the books he earns her trust and respect, but in the show he's basically just bought a woman sex-toy and that's that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can the source material turn into... This...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"HBO has done it again" seems to be the consensus on this new HBO show, an adaptation of George R.R. Martin's best-selling book series, A Song of Ice &amp; Fire. But I've noticed a pattern. It seems to be coming from the type of people that ate the last season of Lost out of the writers's hands, or found "The Walking Dead" to be the most riveting 6 hours of television they've ever seen. I've seen 8 of the 10 episodes of this season so far, and I can safely say that it's a disaster. Many people say that the show is faithful to the book but they seem to be only concerned with simple plot points. Character A kills Character B, Twist #1 leaves viewers wanting to find out what happens next, etc. But where are the details? 10 episodes, 10 hours. Each episode covers 10% of the book, i.e. 7 chapters per episode. And yet the writers find a way to only scratch the surface. I'm almost convinced that they speed read through the book to get it written in time for filming.If you want a solid, well written season of television, look elsewhere. If you want a jumbled mess of amateurish editing, directing, and pacing, look no further, you found your best option. The show's main problem lies in the pacing. It is absolutely dreadful. Prepare yourself for abrupt cuts to credits, clunky transitioning, misdirections due to bad writing, the list goes on. Each episode is just one event after another. There is no common theme to tie anything together. The pilot races through the chapters to get to the first twist in the book and use it as a cliffhanger. The difference lies in the impact. The characters involved were only given a few minutes of screen time total. There are episodes where months pass and the writers lazily let the audience know by having people say "It's been a month since..." The two main locations featured are 30 days apart, yet characters come and go as if they were neighboring towns. There are several scenes that last 5-7 minutes long, and almost all of those scenes are lifeless conversations between two characters. The show would benefit greatly if everyone just stopped talking for 30 seconds. There's no time to breathe. Who really cares about history lessons that date back to 500 years? The writers spend time talking about decayed skeletons just because the book did. They don't realize what should be included and excluded. There are quite a few scenes of children being taught or reminded of their history lessons by their elders. But it doesn't stop there. The genius writers have more tricks up their sleeves, including a minimum of one scene per episode involving sex and exposition. Sexposition. Nice to see that the writer's respect their audience. One 5 minute scene involves gratuitous soft-core porn while a character reveals his intentions and babbles on about history and names, but the moans of two women pleasuring each other drown him out. Another problem is that the writers dedicate a lot of screen time characterizing secondary characters. In the book, they weren't main characters for a reason. To develop other characters. Sure, they're important characters, and they do game-changing things that affect everyone, but they're a backdrop. They move the story along, and most seem one-dimensional. It's not until later in the other books that they take center stage and show their intentions, their motivations, their reasoning, etc. In the scene that I described above, the character speaking over the moans is a scheming bastard in the book. But you never know what he's up to or why. Yet in the show, he has more screen time than most of the main cast. Some of the characters only get mentioned a few times in the books yet here they're featured prominently, revealing things that don't get revealed until much later in the series.The show does a terrible job at portraying the world the books build. The lack of scope is jarring. Seeing battles with 20 soldiers instead of 20,000 isn't exactly "epic" as the kids like to say. As an example, there's an army of 100,000 across the sea that the king is concerned about. But in every scene involving them marching, at the head of the group are old men and fat women. It's inexcusable. The extras (in any scene) are so bad that it's distracting. The lack of direction in this show is unbelievable. Most of the action scenes are very poorly executed and feel like they came from a low budget TV sci-fi movie. They feel almost as lifeless and rehearsed as the rest of the show, so it brings nothing new or exciting. The weather is always sunny, there are almost no night scenes, no dynamic camera movement, and way too many re-used sets. The world is even more lifeless than the characters. The cities don't feel like cities but rather like sets. One particular fight scene is clearly a sound stage, with no shadows or natural lighting. The sound editing is horrendous, so don't watch with headphones. The music is mediocre, and it doesn't surprise me, seeing as how the composer was hired 6 weeks before the pilot aired.All in all, the show is just downright bad with little good. For those who haven't read the books, you might as well give the show a chance. It'll be easier to excuse some of the flaws if you don't have source material to compare it to. If you aren't looking for the next "Mad Men" or "The Wire", then maybe you'll enjoy the show. If you have read the books, well prepare to see them get butchered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I gave this show chance given its rave reviews and very high rating on IMDb. I have to say I love the graphic style and cinematography, watching it all on Blu-ray Disc on a 106" projected screen in a dedicated home cinema. It is a feast for the eye and ear!But content?? After mere minutes - before the title sequence of the first episode - I am lost in glowing blue eyes and supernatural crap.I am sure this show must get its high rating from the amount of exposed lady skin and focus on sex from role-playing acne-be-fest teenage clowns that would normally run around in the (same as in the show?) woods dressed like Kings, Queens and Darth Vaders, and whose only claim to skin must be that they were close to the set when this aired.It holds absolutely no value to me. I am not interested in seeing sisters and brothers going at it with each other. Or midget sex. If you are an adventure loving clown, be my guest. If you value half a bit of decency combined with just a tiny part realism, stay away.The only cool piece was when they actually included Prince Charming from Skrek in the form of Jamie Lannister, played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. Fit man for the comic role.Piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well. i took my time to register just so i can write my first review.I always read viewer's reviews and many times i come to agree. Sadly this is not the story here, for the majority of the people who watched the pilot episode have so many good things to say about the series that i happen not to.First i would like to say that YES, it sticks to the original Plot and many significant events and dialogues are kept intact. Graphics are good, the whole scenery is good, clothing and such.But.. it lucks the atmosphere and some of the dialogue is thrown to us like something that has to be said just because it has to for the sake of the plot and character's depth. (like the part where Viserys talks to his sister for what it will take so long as he as his army). Also come to say about the Atmosphere.. They found a forest,painted it white and there's your Haunted forest. Not dark, frightening and clostophobic as it is described on the book. Atmosphere lost there... Also the crypts where all the uncestors lie dead.. they found a dungeon and that's it.. the part where it ends and Bran gets thrown out of the window was made in 10 minutes, on one go..just so they can call it a wrap. The words again ''the things i do for love'' are said with no character depth, no real emotion. He just said it without mining anything.. Thinsg like that make this series as Shallow as it gets and far from the book's atmosphere.Though it seems to follow closely to the text all the other things that ,to me, matter as equal are paid no real attention thus making this not quite enjoyable.. lets all hope it will all get fixed as it goes. Thank you for your time reading this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is True Blood medieval style. If you're a fan of that title, you may relax the critical elements of your brain to overcome what is a very average show. If you don't think much of True Blood, you'll be unimpressed with this show's mediocrity and non-stop attempts to overcome it with frequent, gratuitous nudity and violence. Additionally, you'll be bewildered by Game of Thrones getting a 9.5 out of 10 rating on IMDb, as of writing. Wow, how the hell.With few exceptions, the acting is often poor. The script, however much it accurately portrays the written work, is easy to tune out from. The allure of an implied, mysterious fantasy story is replaced by family politics and repetitive boring bickering. The setting can regularly appear well constructed and suitable. Production values overall are quite nice as is seemingly standard with current HBO works. But, ultimately it's a very mediocre TV show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad pacing, spotty writing and acting - but still watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh from finishing the first book in the series, I was anxious to catch the first two episodes of this series. It's absurd to expect a film to ever deliver the kind of rich experience a good book does but I still found myself let-down by some of the decisions made by this production.The film does look good, the actors look their parts. I cannot fault the picture for the way it makes do with a limited budget. Yet I found myself rolling my eyes at the clearly Caucasian actor who, besmeared with tanner and eye makeup, is made to be Khal Drogo. It reminds me of John Wayne westerns where the "Indians" were simply random white actors who were covered in shoe polish.Which brings me to my next complaint - there is just too much Daenerys in these opening episodes. She is a very important character but the way in which she has nearly equal screen time to the Starks ruins her character arch and I wonder what will be left for her to do at the end of this first season.The worst offense of these two episodes is, as many others have pointed out, the terrible scene where Bran is thrown to his doom. This scene is accompanied by light-hearted music and the way the scene is portrayed smacks of a daytime soap opera; the Lannisters even look the part here.I understand that HBO enjoys pushing the sexual envelope and I am no enemy of seeing a beautiful naked woman, but it just seems that the sex and nudity are exploitative in this film. The book had a lot of it, but it used it less frequently so that it would have more effect.Overrall the films do not seem like they're in expert hands. The acting can sometimes be splendid and other times I am shocked that a scene was spared the editor's mouseclick...there is just very little consistency. Each scene soars or falls flat in alternating order and after a while this just becomes a little tiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9.5/10? Orly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched the first 3 episodes of this show, including a somewhat unpromising first, it is arguable that I should allow the plot to unravel further before passing judgement.To begin with the most positive aspect of Game of Thrones, there is a lot of beauty on display. It would appear that a great deal of thought and endeavour was put into the scenery and setting.However, I struggle to understand how this show has managed to garner so much in the way of positive reviews and ratings when it appears to fall down on so many levels. The casting for this show, with the exception of Sean Bean, is disturbingly poor. The uninspiring characters are played by a host of rustic looking actors with limited appeal. The show is further handicapped by the slothful plot progression.To surmise, the hype generated by this series is unjustified. The average rating on IMDb for this show (at the time of writing) stands at 9.5/10 - is "Game of Thrones" really in the same bracket as "The Wire" or "The Sopranos"? Or even "Rome"? This series lacks so much that all truly great shows possess - namely, intuitive casting and clever or memorable dialogue. Thus far "Game of Thrones" has proved to be a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do i start first of all this show is HOR-RIBLE like a car wreck where a family of four gets mangled and killed horrible. I'm not trying to be mean i'm just going based off my observations.I will break this down as simple as possible.Acting : Not good,if i were to rate the acting on a IQ scale i'd put it at 50.Which translates to being mentally retarded, the writing is some what to blame but.If these actors had any really good talent that was above average.They could make the show much better even with sh*&amp;^% dialogue.Why any self respecting actor would chose to be on this show,is a sign that there is no good actors here at all.At least any with good judgement or integrity.Any actor with real talent would only be undermining themselves by doing this garbage.Plot: Dungeons and dragons with lots of violence and lots of sex.Just think of eating something thats way overcooked and.You're pretty much getting the same thing here.Luckily this show has a built in audience or else it would of sank along time ago.The main ingrediant for this show has become just to shock and confuse people.To keep them interested which is usually a sign that the creators are struggling to keep this show afloat.Even going as far as throwing in the sex sounds when peter dinklage is getting his knob slobbed.It's like they had prepubescent boys in the editing room;working the sound effects.Writing:I doubt there is any writers ,if i had to guess i would say they are just pulling dialogue right from the book verbatim.Overall the show is held together by gum and paper clips ,theres only so many times graphic violence and sex will work .There was a scene where one of the male characters is giving a monologue with two female actresses.Performing sex acts on each other while trying to sound serious i felt embarrassed for the actor and actresses that had to put up with that.This show has absolutely NO substance what so ever the best advice i can give is this .If you want to know what this show is really like don't go to someone who is a fanboy of it .They will just sensationalize it for you.Which will just winde up misleading you to wasting your time watching this junk.This show trysway to hard and doesn't deserve any of credit for its efforts. I wish IMDb allowed for negative numbered ratings so i could give this a proper rating.EPIC FAIL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never read the books, let's get that out there right away.OK, so I heard about this "Sopranos in middle ages" series that was suppose to be THE next thing on television. I gave it a try, actually three tries.I felt constantly confused during the pilot. I mean, we have this epic opening with a Matt Damon look-a-like and some monster-race owning up the place. Truly balls to the wall stuff and I got hooked thinking "this is gonna ROCK". From there it was downhill into a confusing mess of side-plots, mass character introduction and the laying of foundations for a series made for an audience already familiar to the story arc.Don't get me wrong, it's good to introduce characters and creating some side-plots, but this was worse than Lost S03 within the first two episodes. In a book, this is forgivable given how the reader has time to digest all what's going on. It's even sometimes demanded in order to keep the reader interested. On TV/movies it is quite different. I felt lost and distracted and the show never pulled me in. I didn't care about the characters or their plans.So what do we get? Well there is A lot of nudity. I mean, it's HBO so it is kind of expected, but it's so misused to the point where it's shallow and cheap. Nudity is suppose to serve a purpose in a serious show, here it just feels like a medieval soft porn production at times.To compare this to Sopranos is just laughable, I guess they were aiming for the tits and the "grown up" dialog and violence. In other words, it's more of an "HBO production in middle ages" than anything, oh wait that's exactly what it is.I'm not gonna go into any details, but I do have to address the view of women in the show/books. If I am to understand it correctly, the books have nothing to do with Europe or European society, only in some (very cliché) reference aspects. What I can't bring myself to understand is why you would portray women as the "serfs of men". We are not depicting history here, why include these elements that only suits 15 year old boys down on their luck with women? If it is that way in the books, well then why insist on having it in the show? Filled with boring old clichés for an audience that got bored with Sci-Fi. Well now they can get bored with fantasy instead. I will continue watching though, the level of production value is high and not all of it is horrible, just most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mind a show with a little violence and some sex, I actually like "Shameless" but I don't know, Games of Throne is a different type of violent show, and it is absolutely too much for me to handle... The rapes, incest, and weird sex scenes, killing animals for no reasons, blood everywhere and sex scenes absolutely not necessary... no thank you! It is really degrading for women, they are used like puppets you just put naked in front of the screen, maybe if you're a 15 years old teenager it's exciting but otherwise, I just don't see the point. I think it could have been an amazing show, the beginning was good, I wanted to see more but then I was just disappointed.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I doubt even the author of the books knows. He's still slated to finish the final two books of this saga in the near(?) future. There's no doubt they have a huge budget with all the great talent that's on the show, but sadly, they lack the proper writing to match. The plot is spread too thin, the dialog is uninspired and at times hard to watch. If the dramatic speeches sound familiar to you, it's probably because you've heard it before. My biggest problem is the lack of character development. They're all so full of irrationality and contradictions, it makes their motives contrived and their actions hard to justify. It's all so childish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This show was hyped so much that I couldn't wait to see it. The production values seemed high and the actors are of great lineage. So what went wrong? Well I blame myself really. I got older and now when I watch a programme I'm more interested in plot and character development than lingering shots of women entering a bath. Now don't get me wrong here, if that shot was required for the development of the show, put it in by all means. But most of these scenes were totally gratuitous. Plus there seemed to be a gender bias at work, there were no shots of male frontal nudity.In conclusion I think that this show was made for males aged 18-35. Fine no problem there. I just don't think that I fit that profile any longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly written, poorly directed, poorly produced. Completely disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy the books and am looking forward to the rest of them. I also love well done films and to some degree good television. I was looking forward to this series very much.I cannot truly see this as a new work - and having read the books, I will inevitably have to compare them... Therefore, I can only praise or lament at the effectiveness of the adaptation. From this perspective, I don't think it works.The production values are pretty weak for being made nearly a decade after LOTR was handled so well. I don't just mean the CG - which is pretty poor - I mean everything else as well. The music is mostly bland knock-off's of Zimmer, Horner, or sometimes Gabriel's Last Temptation soundtrack. You've heard it before. Even the extras are weak. I shouldn't notice this. That's a bad sign something is wrong.However it's the casting, writing and the direction which have failed. I think the show was horribly miss-cast with the exceptions of a very few characters. In a large, complicated story like this, it is necessary to get the right cast or make the adapted characters stand on their own so well that the comparisons to the original source are of limited merit.The direction and writing fail to manage this. Most of the acting is wooden, and the directing didn't get the best work out of this cast for most of the time. I like Sean Bean - and even though his Ned isn't the stone-faced man expressly depicted in the books, he manages to make it work - but needless to say, while his actions will sire many key story elements - he isn't the most important character in this story by a very long shot.Indeed, of the key players in this cast, Arya is one of the few that I feel can carry her dramatic weight. Casting the kids would be the hardest part of this whole thing. But the adults are the most misplaced. They lack any charisma - and when it comes down to it, people who do reprehensible things need charisma to keep you interested in them. They aren't helped by the direction.There is a serious inability to portray any convincing viciousness and malice. Many of the characters are "playing at it" and you never get the feeling they really mean it. In a series with very very few absolutely good or evil characters - where many of them must fight and kill to survive "the game" - this portrayal manages to rob characters who should be dangerous of any teeth. Even the dire-wolves seem friendly.This seriously weakens all the characters. There is not enough tension. Scenes aren't built, and each scene lacks the necessary foundation to build further tension. Tension drives good stories, and good films. If you don't believe it, then you can hardly care about it. There was so much to work with, and so many difficulties that where there - I understand the difficulty in adapting a work like this. Sometimes you have to cut out characters, transpose necessary actions onto other characters, shift lines and add some clarifying dialog in the name of economic storytelling. I understand why you must do this to play to the strengths of this particular form of expression.A perfect, simple example of this is the transposition of an early scene where a deserter from the night's watch is executed. Rather than an old, experienced and hardened man of the watch who is so scared of The Others that he flees south... They've re-written it to be an a young man who looks like he'd run from anything. There is no dramatically compelling reason for this change. It is a small example of NOT understanding what matters.The next scene with the dire-wolf pups, which can easily serve to illustrate the multiple intricacies of the various character's relationships is devoid of almost all dramatic effect. Bran's relationship with Jon Snow. Theon's careless cruelty. Jon's (and all bastards' blatant ostracism) Jon's relationship with Ned. The scene is there, and it takes 4-5 minutes of screen time, but they do so very little with it... just horrid story economy.Even the choice to take the black (a big deal for a major character) is stripped of any dramatic value and just plonked in there. Such ham-fisted direction. It made me sick.Good adaptations manage to retain the essential elements and craft a unique work which can in fact surpass the original material in some capacity.This series has failed to do so.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hope this gets better, and I am mindful that a) this comment is based on the first episode, b) I am in a minority, and c) it can only get better.Firstly the opening sequence was riveting right up until the explanations and disposition. Secondly most of the acting was fine, although the film hardly spent enough time on creating understandable characters and rather too much time spinning from location to location. And thirdly in my main beefs about this opening episode, the closing sequence was telegraphed.The translation of a story into screenplay is an art, especially so in the making of a TV series, where it is important to explore characters in such a way as to make you have feelings for them. This opening episode did none of that for me. I really didn't care. I was bored by dialogues which, like the opening sequence, promised so much but couldn't deliver. I really didn't care for anyone after this forty minutes or so.I do hope it gets better and I will watch episode two just to make sure I didn't see it on a off night (it would have been two off nights because I watched it twice just in case I'd missed something) but actually this is a case where the trailers are better than the real thing. Here's hoping for a better part two.</fullReview>

From the first few seconds of the first episode were that young boy have his face painted with black pen not mud (make up artist fault for sure) or the awful acting to the non attention to details. I really don't get it. Even the story is sooooooo predictable that it make me roll my eyes to see another American rubbish medieval series. This for me is a notch better than Zena warrior princess and that's mean not good. Please do not compare This to LOTR or you're dam too stupid to see the difference. I'm sure the books are fantastic to read but i hated the non attention to details in this series (people and places to clean, wolfs are husky dogs, clothes are to new and out of history context, etc....) but thanks for Sean Bean charisma and acting skills to make this series a bit more interesting then a pair of tits here and there. Anyway Not enough for me to watch the all series. Overall... great to watch as a teenager perhaps or if you don't care of the above. peace</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As if there weren't enough characters after the first 3 episodes, they add more. I know the series is just staying loyal to book. But the writers just crammed too many events in this episode. It's difficult to follow for anyone who hasn't read the book. What's more, a lot of those events are only back stories which are not shown, only talked about by characters? "Show; don't tell" is a basic principle of good writing. Moreover, in a 50 or so minute espidode, how necessary is 2 minutes of two men talking/reminiscing about a battle where they fought side by side? There are several scenes like this in this episode. The editing is bad, as well. The scene where Daenerys kicks Viserys' ass (or they have an argument just outside the horse lords' domain) is immediately followed by Viserys in bed with a pleasure giver. I found a lot of flaws in this episode that I can't even remember all of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the books and was very much looking forward to this show. Counting the days almost!Unfortunately, like some other reviewers here, I was sorely disappointed. There are a few reasons for this. The opening scene in the woods looked very good, but the rest of the show looked to me a lot less beautiful. Sometimes it even looked like people were standing in front of a screen with scenery.Next, the level of acting. Some actors were very good, others were dreadful. Just reciting lines with absolutely no feeling or emotion. But maybe that is not entirely their fault. It could be because they tried to put way too much into 1 episode. Why not start with introducing one house? Get to know the characters, give the viewers some feeling about who they are. This all felt very rushed, and especially if you haven't read the books, I can imagine you have no idea who is who. Even after reading the books, I felt absolutely no connection to the characters.Finally, the nudity.. I don't mind nudity if it is presented right and where you expect it. For example, in the series Rome, I never had this problem. But here it just felt sometimes like: "just put some naked women on the screen (or sex scenes) because that is what people like to see". Well, it didn't work for me.Hopefully the next episode will be a lot better. I have to give this show another chance, because I LOVE the books. Let's all hope the next one isn't as rushed as the pilot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the pilot episode was over-hyped.I'm a huge fan of the books. I have been waiting for this show to debut for months, Sean Bean being one of my favorite actors.I thought the locations were beautiful and the locations drop-dead gorgeous. I didn't expect Lord of the the Rings. The books do contain a moderate amount of sex, a large amount of violence and are written in contemporary English, swear words and all. The fact that the books are like this is part of the appeal. The characters are real, flawed and speak just the way we do, but the focus is always on the relationships between characters and factions. Not just on sex or violence. Fantasy fiction for the modern adult reader.This is not what I watched last night.....In one hour-long program there were at least two rapes, twenty women naked from the top up (several completely naked), one blatant sex scene and several partially obscured scenes. I sat on the couch next to my husband with my face burning (which has never happened to me). He said the show was pornographic and confusing. He never read the books.The books are not for children, and on HBO I expected sex, violence and swearing. But the level they took it to, detracted from the plot of the story. Several of my friends that I asked to watch this texted me stating how confused they are over the shifting scenes, and large amount of cast members that were barely introduced. Other shows that I have watched and loved on HBO did not have this large amount of sex. Even Sex and the City. I will watch one more episode but if it was anything like last night's then I give up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Game of Thrones clearly has good production values, good acting and beautiful women. But the story (or the script) is a potent sleep inducer. After watching this show for 30 minutes I could not care less who was who, what are their plans, and etc. These tales of intrigue and high drama mixed with stereotypical notions of bravery, deception, honor, treason, loyalty, royal lineage etc. are so passé that one wonders why people keep on making films and writing books about them. Not to mention that reading and hearing about kings and queens and all this nonsense has become a chore. How many films and book have been written based on this quasi-medieval quasi-mythical ideals?That is why lately there are always some naked skin, exposed breasts, rough-sex scenes (e.g. Spartacus) on these productions. The directors need to get the attention of the viewer, right? Otherwise, people would simply turn to other things which are a little bit less dull, confusing and uninteresting.Can't those guys create more interesting alternative realities? Does it always have to be about power, murder and sex? All in all, this type of tale is nothing more than a medieval version of Dallas....Yep, you've seen one, you've seen them all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought for once there would have been a medieval series that my kids could watch, but to no avail, this one is on the banned list for my household. Why does it seem every series "needs" sex? And not just normal, hidden sex, but graphic, and nothing any person under the age of 18 should ever see. For this reason, and for the reason they add so much extra the books don't have, so you think they can leave the graphic nudity of ONLY WOMEN out. Yes, I said it, this is another series targeting only showing women's nudity. Granted it's not the plot, but there is too much for a normal couple, or family to enjoy. I know of series' that can leave out the graphic nudity, but still get amazing reviews. I am a family mom, nothing containing nudity or drugs enters my house without me knowing. This will turn into another Camelot, plot and story line say one thing, but it's the graphic sexual nature that will end up getting the show taken off air. Edit: For anyone who didn't like this series there are a few IMDb users who take it upon themselves to harass anyone who didn't like it. They try to Make you mad by assuming personal details that are completely false. And these people call themselves adults, they are nothing more than children trying to get a boner. I stand by my word that this is a HORRIBLE series. This is MY opinion, that should concern No one else. If anyone else gets these harassing/threatening messages, simply ignore these kids. All they want is the satisfaction of making you mad, I have 3 kids; these immature toddlers are NOTHING compared to any mom raising kids. We have patience that will last a lifetime.</fullReview>

Also this is not an heroic fantasy story. There is no fantasy at all... except at the end of the last minute of the last episode. Before it's just like middle-age. Medieval stuff (sorry Dardaryen steel looks like ordinary steel) and barbarians ways (with a touch of dismemberment). Of course you have free nudity but completely pointless.To sum up it's a very mediocre entertainment you have to avoid at all cost not to lost 10 precious hours of your life !

		<shortDescription>Cheapened with Porn and F-words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love fantasy stories, but recently the only stuff to come out of Hollywood is full of porno and swearing. Really find that it cheapens the movie. Sad thing is that those scenes and the language are not even needed to make it a great story. This is my main point, these things are not needed, so why put them in? I mean what value do those scenes add? The F-word also feels like a modern word which should be left out of medieval stories. Perfect example of a great fantasy story is Lord of the Rings. Had none of that and it is one of the greatest movie's ever. It is a shame it looked like the story has so much potential was really into it until enough got enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vast disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I forced myself to finish watching the pilot, and regret to say there's no way I'm gonna watch another minute of this show. Okay, I admit the gore and sex scenes did induce a sudden increase of hormone in my bloodstream, but if I wanted that kind of experience, I'd go watch Saw or a porno.The pace of the entire episode is way too fast. Feels like they rushed thru a quarter of the first book in an hour. The storyline remains mostly loyal to the original novel, however the unnecessary altering of some details is just baffling. (With the exception of the prologue?it's nearly unrecognizable.) The Others, a key element of the story, is not mentioned even once. King Robert Baratheon's hearty greeting to Eddard Stark is reduced to a simple "You got fat." That sure helps to depict their closer-than-brother relationship. Tyrion Lannister loves drinking and whoring, I don't doubt, but he's not "always drunk". That's Robert. Tyrion certainly wouldn't openly go to a brothel while his presence is required at the king's side, unless he's taken leave of his wits. And Jaime's quadrupling the number of prostitutes in bed with Tyrion is just...?The cast is not as strong as they would have you believe, either. Cersei is too soft. Lady Stark speaks like a septa. Viserys should be cruel and arrogant, not effeminate. And why won't the characters call each other's names when they talk? Speaking of which, they can't even get the pronunciation of "Arya" right. Roy Dotrice worked out everything perfectly for the audiobook in 2003! All they had to do was follow.I'm giving 1 star for the excellent photography and scenes, 1 more for the props and costumes, and a 3rd for the title sequence. To be honest, it's the only part that got me truly excited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not impressed at all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most of you i was eager to see this new show released by HBO,the pilot started very good at least the first scene in the woods is very well made,but slowly it started too fall.After seeing all the episodes till today (last was 5th The wolf and the lion),my opinion is this :Plot-nothing extraordinary or something we never seen before Characters-well played a few including Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage rest it's average Costumes-very disappointing except from a few soldier armours Locations-the first scene was amazing almost all the scenes that where filmed outside have amazing views -but the ones they build most of them look fake and out of place -the sets are very poor they look like the average fantasy shows nothing new. Story-first i will mention that i read the books,and till last episode the show follows the book with just a few lets say not really important parts left over.And now most important part and the reason i decided to make a review on the site:it all have to do with the last episode "The wolf and the lion" because in this episode i saw the most disgusting scene i saw in a long time. I understand people like to see nudity and sex but in the 21 century when we have internet and u know that u cant see anything on web,i don't understand why the people who made this show use it excessively here where it's really not necessary because we don't watch it for that trust me.Yes in the book there are scene that lead the reader to imagine what happened between characters but it was NEVER described in detail like in the show.And in this last episode the scene when Sir Loras is shaving Lord Renly around his nipples and under his arm (and the thing that followed...) was disgusting and it never happened in the book - yes in the book u where lead to suspect a different relationship besides friendship between this too but it was never painted like this at all.So overall an average show with a lot of bad taste nudity,some very very bad fighting and sword fighting ,even that follows the book closely the show left me with a bad taste and i probably i will pass the rest of the season.Thank You</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great actors in a really boring story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to the new HBO series "Game of Thrones". I have been disappointed by Camelot and have missed the boldness of Spartacus. I am a huge fantasy and period piece fan and had high hopes for this fantasy, since I was told it had great characters and great scope. I am also a fan of Sean Bean for his LOTR's portrayal of Boromir and other movies. I've tried to get into this series but I just can't. I don't understand how any of these people have survived; they just go around killing each other. No one is smart except the dwarf and Dean's youngest daughter but alas the dwarf has become just another repetitive idiot and the little girl is a minor character that you hardly ever see. It's just not an interesting story. I bought the book which I might read. Maybe the written story will be better. This is a real disappointment for a fan of history piece and fantasy. There is not fantasy in it just endless people looking ugly and sad.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hmmm totally over-hyped...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>all these 9 and 10 reviews after 1 episodes...time for some counter-opinions...honestly, i think the series does not deliver anything new which hasn't been done in similar series such as tudors or rome or whatever...its really pretty over-hyped and all the good reviews are probably from fan boys...the storyline is pretty standard 0815 and the plot very predictable...its simply your average throne-intrigue-setting...the one thing that really annoyed me seriously was all the nudity and the fu****...sorry guys but i don't understand you Americans, usually you're extremely conservative about such stuff, but with all these medieval/fantasy/historical settings your completely overdo it with the sex stuff - and this series just completely blows it out of proportions...there is sex ALL THE TIME - seriously this series is more about sex then most porn i have watched...and that just gets boring really fast...please more action, more decapitating and less smushing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hype has been over done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The PR for the series has been that it is good enough to be considered a "Lord Of The Rings" quality/genre project for TV. Not quite. It plays an awful lot like an old 1950's Universal Studios medieval potboiler. The sort of thing you would expect to see Tony Curtis or Alan Ladd in. It certainly isn't up to the normal HBO standard when compared with a production like "Rome". Maybe, as the series progresses, a stronger storyline might start to appear. The production values are handsome enough for TV, but overall the atmosphere is very dull. By and large, the cast seems to be not overly interested in the material. They could be waiting to see some improvement before they bother trying.</fullReview>
