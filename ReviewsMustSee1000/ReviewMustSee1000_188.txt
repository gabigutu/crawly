		<shortDescription>Life is a right, not an obligation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go to the cinema to be entertained, amused, so as to fill up your time, do not go out of your way to watch this film.If you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths of human-kind, the feelings of real people, to explore the characteriology of personalities, if you go to the cinema to absorb magnificent photography, be sure to put this film very high on your list, preferably in first place. The experience is profoundly rewarding, causing the intelligent viewer to make diverse reflexions over the meaning of life itself. With 'Mar Adentro' Alejandro Amenábar has surpassed the best he has done to date, and even redeemed certain deviations in his earlier films which smacked a little of being aimed at Hollywood. This is not the case with this visual poem put to music: Hollywood could never get anywhere near the effect of this tinglingly inspired human - and humane - story.In no way should one interpret 'Mar Adentro' as an apologia for euthanasia; this story, based on the real life of the Galician fisherman Ramón Sampedro, is a cry from the bottom of the heart for life and love, a reaching out for human compassion, for understanding emotions. Sampedro was an articulate and intelligent man who after a diving accident off the rocks of the Galician coast as a young man was condemned to live the next 27 years in bed. 'Condenado a vivir' (2001) (TV) was the first version of this man's life on which I have already commented. However, Amenábar has succeeded remarkably at portraying this man, with his permanent enigmatic smile and witty sense of humour, in an equally articulate and intelligent way.And Javier Bardem rose to the occasion, met the challenge head-on, complete with a Galician accent, producing an electrifying, compelling, enthralling performance, such that the actor and the fisherman become fused into being the same person on screen. Here, indeed, is an occasion to doff your cap, and softly mutter 'chapeau'. Bardem is driven on in his task by a magnificent cast, especially Belén Rueda, Lola Due?as, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (Los Lunes al Sol) (qv) and Clara Segura, Galician and Catalan accents taking prominent part. Amenábar produces wonderful dialogues as these six rotate among themselves one-on-one, or in groups, with excellent chemistry, thus demonstrating that this young Chilean-born Spanish director is an artist who knows what he is at and how to get his results; his global concept of the film includes his own music, interspersed with pieces by Beethoven and Puccini on Sampedro's record-player.Whilst viewing 'Mar Adentro', I found myself a couple of times comparing him and this film with Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece 'The Hours' (qv). I refer to the way in which the dialogues work with tenseness and passion and that careful sense of timing in each scene.Javier Aguirresarobe's photography is superb as usual. As I have mentioned elsewhere on IMDb, he does not simply film the events and scenes - he captures even the feelings and the atmosphere of the moment, deftly catches that look in the eyes, light and shadows, such that his work behind the camera is at once another player in the story. A superb artist.'Mar Adentro' is another landmark in the history of Spanish cinematography, among the best five or six works of art produced here in the last 25 years. This film places itself alongside such cinematographic art as 'El Sur' (qv), 'Los Santos Inocentes' (qv), 'El Abuelo' (qv), 'La Lengua de las Mariposas' (qv), 'Las Ratas' (qv), 'A Los Que Aman' (qv), and I think I must add 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' (qv).Superbly orchestrated story of a real man, and those who loved him around his bedside: not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The core moral question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many more eloquent reviews than this have described the quite spectacular acting, casting and styling of this film. It appears that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived imbalance in the film's handling of the core moral question (euthanasia).This film is, bar the final scenes, meticulous in stressing Ramon's belief that he's not making some grand point but merely that, for him, a life devoid of dignity is a life not worth living. We, as viewers, see an enormous amount of dignity in his life - we see family and friends and culture and, but for its physical limitations, a life fully lived. Central to the tragedy of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks that Ramon's life is not worth living - and that is him.To watch this film and say that the only counter argument comes from the visit of a bumbling priest is a nonsense. The priest's visit is pure farce, a direct assault on the simplicity of the Spanish Catholic Church's response to the issue of euthanasia. However, the sister's parting words to the priest momentarily expose the powerful 'pro-life' sentiments quietly underpinning the entire film. We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and the beauty of a life lived with love. As the film progresses, we may gradually be encouraged to understand Ramon's reasoning but we are never reconciled to his decision. I do not remember a film which moved me and provoked me as much as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Biopic That Asks Disturbing Questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director and co-writer Alejandro Amenabar didn't make things easy for viewers of his taut, a bit overlong but very disturbing story, accurately based on a Spanish man's struggle to obtain assisted suicide. "Mar Adentro" ("The Sea Inside") is gripping and its impact far exceeds the time spent in the theater.With the award-winning Canadian movie, "The Barbarian Invasions," folks got to see a family along with a coterie of devoted friends address the wish of a beloved albeit irascible man to end his life. In that movie, the center of attention suffered from progressive, incurable cancer and his descent into a terminal stage was fast. Emotional as the scenes were, death was inevitable - the question was how gentle could it be made through solicited intervention.Ramon Sampedro (brilliantly played by Javier Bardem) is a different story. For well over two decades he's been a quadriplegic because of a diving accident. (Very sharp viewers may detect a terrible irony as to why he ended in that condition because of his improvident dive.) Once a world traveler and lover of beautiful women, he now lies trapped in an immobile body, his every need attended to by a truly devoted family who willingly surrender much of their privacy and time to sustain their beloved relation.Rosa (Lola Duenas), a single mom of two small boys, enters the Sampedro household out of what might have been mere curiosity to learn about the paralyzed man's plight but she becomes both an emotionally supportive centerpiece for Ramon as well as an amusing but occasionally aggravating presence. A nice performance by Duenas.The problem, of course, is that Sampedro isn't sick in the normal sense. He may well live for decades more with proper care. So his softly but persistently voiced desire to end his life with "dignity" creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives who, not surprisingly, react from different ethical and religious perspectives.Ramon is the poster quad of a group dedicated to changing Spain's laws concerning assisted suicide. "Death with Dignity" is their watchword. Gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist who enlists the aid of pro bono publico counsel, Julia (Belen Rueda). Julia has her own health issues which carry an indefinite but catastrophic prognosis. Happily married to a devoted spouse, she bonds emotionally with her client.What follows is an acutely sensitive interplay of values and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and wife, their technophile teenage son, not the intellectual Ramon is, and his aged dad who can't stop grieving over his son's cataclysmic descent into absolute helplessness.The moral and legal issues are played out through excellent acting and short vignettes including a courtroom scene in which formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that might take into account Ramon's feelings and views. It may be Spain but the issues are alive in most countries, including the U.S.Especially amusing is a shouted, first floor to bedroom, debate between Ramon with a drop-in, lecturing Jesuit priest, also a quadriplegic but one whose hidebound dogma casually masks the absence of a soul.Special kudos to Mabel Rivera, Ramon's sister-in-law-Manuela, for a wrenchingly authentic portrayal of a strong woman who holds the family together. And the same compliment fulsomely extends to Belen Rueda, Julia, who segues from objective advocate to close friend to a woman hurtling towards a dark fate.The director imposes no value judgments allowing each character full range to express his or her feelings effectively and, at times, movingly. Like "Dead Man Walking," this movie can support any view about its deadly subject.No one can stop a person from committing suicide if he/she is determined but the universal tragedy of the world's Ramons is that without assistance, life in a body in which only the heart beats and only the head can move is a sentence no court could pronounce on the most depraved of criminals.The cinematography is well-matched to the story and the beautiful Galician scenes are an intended contrast to the limited views the once globe-trotting Ramon experiences from his special bed.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Learning to Cry with a Smile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of one man's struggle to control his destiny. The great Javier Bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as Ramon. His eyes and head movements leave little doubt what is going on in his mind. The dream and fantasy sequences are not overused so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants. Rather than force us to answer the euthanasia question, the real question posed is , What is Love? At every turn we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. The script is tight and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in one room. The supporting cast is wonderful and we truly feel their pain and how each family member deals with Ramon's decision. This is a gem and deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb cast, great score, excellent movie...not perfect though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Mar Adentro (Out at Sea would be the better translation) last Sunday. The movie is powerful and moving, as was the true story of Ramón Sampedro, a quadriplegic from a coastal village in Galicia (Northwest Spain). Sampedro lived for 27 years lying in a bed, unable to move but his neck and face, needing help and attention with everyday needs, and fighting a battle to obtain legal permission for somebody to assist him in his suicide. A sensitive and articulate man, Sampedro wrote (with his mouth), gave television interviews, and captivated the Spanish public with his good humour, his wit, his intelligence, and his dramatic and well-reasoned determination to be able to control his life and death. The legal battle was -predictably- lost, but Sampedro died anyway. It is no small feat that this real-life story remains as poignant on screen as it was in reality. Amenábar has intelligently stayed close to the real characters and their surroundings. Beautiful landscapes, an outstanding score (most of it by Amenábar himself, played and arranged by Carlos Nú?ez). The cast is prodigious overall. Bardem's performance as Sampedro is superb, even in points such as the slight Galician accent, convincing and never overdone. Few actors have so dominated a movie despite the limitations inherent in playing a quadriplegic. Mabel Rivera outshines the rest of the supporting cast as Sampedro's unselfish, undemanding, loving sister-in-law. Belén Rueda gives a competent performance as Julia, one of Sampedro's pro bono lawyers who suffers from a degenerative disease herself and is considering euthanasia. But her character is a weak presence in the movie, and only makes sense towards the end, when her disease has deprived her of the ability to choose. Most troublesome is the unconvincing love story between Julia and Sampedro; this may have been an attempt -in my view failed and superfluous- to underline how seductive a character Sampedro was; Bardem should have been trusted on that without this superficial prop. The multiplicity of characters combined with the slow-pace, majestic rhythm of the movie, punctuated by flights over breathtaking landscapes and the repetition of the scene of Sampedro's accident, are at odds with how many layers of complexity Amenábar can show in the time of a movie. And this may be the source of one of its few weaknesses: we are left with a slightly manichean view of things. For example, the only two characters not supportive of Sampedro's decision to die are slightly -or grossly- caricatured; one of them -a quadriplegic priest- provides one of the intensely comic moments of the film. This, in turn, is one of the many merits of the movie: faithful to Sampedro's personality, there is humour, there is wit, there are moments to laugh (Sampedro asks Julia for a cigarette; she reminds him that he does not smoke; he replies: I know, but what if it kills me?"). This is not a depressing movie, but a movie about the irreductible freedom of the human being, about dignity, about love, about self-sacrifice. And about our bonds to our fellow humans, how we create them, how we nourish them, how we abuse them, and how we must realize, painful as it may be, that we have no rights over other people's lives. Films like Mar Adentro remind you what movie-making is (or should be) about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story about a man's 28 year struggle for a death that would liberate him from his already dead body becomes a masterpiece to be remembered,thanks to a team of artists in a state of grace. Directed, written,edited and scored by Alejandro Amenabar, it touches you from the very first images, and doesn't leave your eyes and your heart to rest until the last credits, thanks to Alejandro and a group of wonderful actors and actresses at their best. Bardem is an acting animal:One of those few comedians that can make a masterpiece from almost any character, the supporting actresses are great in their roles and the story is told with such a sensibility that one laughs and cries in the same minute, as we used to do with the great old masterpieces. The year's best film in all senses. 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This small, quiet, harmonious movie grows into a masterpiece on human dignity. It is intelligently structured, filled with meaningful little details and important side-plots. It tells a story of one man with great humanity without positioning itself politically, but fostering life as a precious right (not an obligation) and underlining individual's right to choose. It enjoys the richness of different landscapes (mental and physical) and languages (important detail). Outstanding acting by each of the actors, especially unbelievable Javier Bardem. His screen-presence has such a force that you forget that this is fiction. The movie has a wonderful rhythm, it is beautifully shot and outstandingly directed. It takes real talent to make a movie on such a difficult theme with understanding, humour and heart. Six stars out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The right to die with dignity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenabar, the young and talented Spanish director, clearly shows us he is a serious film maker. Anyone doubting it, should have a look at his latest film "The Sea Inside". This is a movie that has been rewarded with numerous accolades, not only in Spain, but throughout the world, wherever this wonderful movie has been shown.If you have not seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop here.Ramon Sampedro is a man confined to bed. Being quadriplegic, he depends on the kindness of strangers for everything. Since his accident, Ramon only thinks in one thing alone: how to end his life! This is the moral issue at the center of the story, based on the real Ramon Sampedro's life.Mr. Amenabar tells the story from Ramon's point of view. There is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part. After all, he relies on facts that were well known in his country as this case became a "cause celebre" in favor of euthanasia, a theme that no one in that country wanted to deal with in Spain.With its background of being a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Spain has evolved into one of the most democratic societies in Europe, a distinction that is more notable because of its long years dominated by a dictator. Yet, in spite of the advances in that society, the idea of taking one's own life, is something not clearly understood by the majority of its citizens, who still considered this subject as something that could not be done in their country.Ramon Sampedro was a man that loved life. He lived an intense life as a young man when he enlisted as a sailor to discover the world. Having no money, this was the only way for him to see other lands, experience other cultures. Ramon's love affair with the sea, is something that people in Galicia learn to love from their childhood. Imagine how that same friendly sea is the one that takes away Ramon's life, as he knew it! In a second, Ramon goes from a vibrant young man into a vegetable!Ramon's family is shattered by the experience. Suddenly they must leave everything aside to take care of him at home. His brother and sister-in-law, are stoic people that deal with the situation as a matter of fact. Their lives become something of an afterthought, because Ramon's life comes first. They tend to the sick man without protesting, or blaming Ramon for the sacrifices they must make to keep him alive.That is why, in their minds, the Sampedros can't comprehend Ramon's wishes to end it all. Haven't they given up having a normal life to take care of him? This moral issue weighs heavily on these uncomplicated and simple people because in their minds, they are doing what came naturally.The second subject of the movie is the legal issue of the euthanasia and the well meaning people that suddenly enter Ramon's life in their desire to help him put an end to his suffering. There's Julia, the lawyer who is herself handicapped and suffers from a rare malady. There is Rosa, the fish cannery worker who becomes infatuated with Ramon. Javier Bardem, makes a brilliant Ramon Sampedro. His transformation is total. We don't doubt from one moment he is no one else but the paralyzed man on that bed. Mr. Bardem can only use his face in order to convey all the emotions trapped inside Ramon. Mr. Bardem makes this man real. This is perhaps Javier Bardem's best role of his career. He surpasses his own award winning performance as Reynaldo Arenas, the late Cuban poet he portrayed in "Before Night Falls". In the supporting roles, Belen Rueda, makes an impressive appearance as Julia, the woman fighting her own physical problems. Lola Duenas is also effective as Rosa, the kindred soul that loves Ramon deeply. Celso Bugallo, as Ramon's brother shows a man at a crossroads of his own life. Mabel Rivera makes a compassionate Manuela, the sister-in-law that never asks anything of life, but tends to Ramon without questioning why she has to do it, at all.Mr. Amenabar also has composed the haunting music score for the film. He is a man that never cease to surprise. One wonders what his next project will be, but one wishes him success in whatever he might decide to do in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amenabar's mastery at the service of a True Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the privilege to watch Mar Adentro last Friday, and I am still shocked by its beauty, the powerful work of every single actor and actress and Amenabar's unbelievable ability to narrate the story of Ramón Sampedro, who was well known in Spain for asking for a legal euthanasia, lost the court cause, and eventually died in front of a camera drinking a glass with poison, freezing all our hearts with his determination not to go on living forever immobilized because of an accident. Before watching the movie I was already mesmerized by the strong symbology in its title, which I would translate as "Into the Sea" and not as some suggest "Out to sea", and which is taken from an original poem written by the man this story is about. Then I watched the movie. Oh my friends. This is Cinema with a capital C. The narration flows to take you to the heart of every single character: Sampedro, reincarnated in a Bardem that you forget from the very beginning, is in the center as a man full of sense of humour and full of hope, and his hope is to die, because for him, the life he is living is not worthy to be lived. The rest of the characters but one dance around him and respect his decision because they see him as a human independent being (forgetting he depends on the others for everything), even though they do love him so much. And this is what the movie is about: love. You can feel it, you can breathe it in the skin of every character. You witness the growing of the feeling within three women who meet him in the movie: Gené, the member of the association that defend his right to die with dignity, his friend, her story in the movie is the hope for us the lucky ones that can live a normal life in this world; Rosa, the woman who meets a good man in the middle of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used her and despised her; Julia, the woman who shares a tragic destiny with Ramón, and eventually acts in a way we cannot but only understand.However, before meeting these women Ramón knew what was love like, because you cannot meet him without loving him, and he is deeply loved by his abnegated family: Four characters unique in their humbleness and bravery, each with their own thoughts about his decision, each thought respectable in its own way, because the terrible thing about this story is that nobody is to blame for what happened. That, sadly, life sometimes is that terrible. From this familiar quartet I specially liked Mabel Rivera's work as Ramón's sister in law, Manuela: a terrific performance.I would like to draw attention to three episodes that are for me the best climax points I have seen in a long time, and if you haven't seen the movie don't read this, pass over this paragraph and read again from the next one starting "Mar adentro", let the movie show its secrets to you. The episodes I loved were: 3. The best love scene I have seen in a movie, when I really felt love invading the screen, is when Ramón dreams awake that he is flying to meet Julia in the beach and they kiss each other. 2. Gené speaking by phone with Ramón, the day before he is going to do it, and he tells her it is better they say goodbye at that very moment, not to put her in trouble with the authorities. And then she knows it is the last time they are going to talk, and she has fought for his right to die... but she does not want to lose him, because she loves him as a true friend, and even though she is respecting his decision at all cost. 1. The best. A young Ramón in the beach, looking at his girlfriend under the sun, jumping to the water from the rocks to a sea that is retreating. We see the crash, we hear his voice recalling what happened and claiming he should have died that very moment. The face of Bardem, face downward, shown to us from the bottom. And the hand of a friend who pulls him from the forehead and brings him back to a life that will be a hell for him in the next 30 years. There are many others, like the impressive ending, in spite of the fact that in Spain we know too well what Ramon did.Mar adentro did not deceive me, Amenabar never does, but this time he has to thank the actors that took part in the project, and who maybe took it personally, because this is not just a movie, it is an elegy to a man who died alone when he was asking to die "legally", which meant for him, as Bardem pointed out, dying with the people he loved and who loved him around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensitive Drama About a Polemic Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Spain, the former sailor Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has been quadriplegic for twenty-eight years and is fighting in court for his right of practicing euthanasia through an association that defends the freedom of choice and leaded by his friend Géne (Clara Segura). Ramón is introduced to the lawyer that is defending his cause, Julia (Belén Rueda), who has a degenerative fatal disease; and meets Rosa (Lola Due?as), a lonely worker that has been abused by men. Their relationship changes the behavior and viewpoint of life of Rosa and Julia.The Chilean Alejandro Amenábar is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary directors. His filmography released in Brazil is composed by excellent and original movies: "Abre Los Ojos", "Tesis", "The Others" and "Mar Adentro". Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain in the present days. Their association produced this sensitive drama about a very polemic theme, the right of committing euthanasia. This drama is never corny or depressive, since the screenplay uses humor as a relieve valve in the most dramatic situations. The performances of the cast are perfect, with characters having and defending different positions regarding this unpleasant theme. The dialogs and lines are very solid and intelligent. I noted in IMDb plot outline that this movie is based on the real-life story of Ramón Sampedro. Unfortunately, neither the movie nor the DVD gives this important information. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Mar Adentro" ("Sea Inside")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The true story of a Spanish paraplegic, Ramón Sampedro, who fought for decades for the right to be euthenized. This film, along with the Best Picture winner of the same year, Million Dollar Baby, caused a stir that year with their depictions of disabled persons desiring death. Both advocates for the disabled and (unfortunately for the disability advocates) conservative pro-life groups protested both films, and their Oscar nominations. The nominations also came during the entire Terry Schiavo debacle, just to put it all in some historical perspective. The protests, especially from the disability groups, against Million Dollar Baby make some sense ? the film clearly depicted, without wavering, the life of a paraplegic as worthless. The film's central character, Maggie Fitzgerald, becomes a paraplegic, doesn't seem to get any counseling whatsoever, no help whatsoever, and immediately wants to die. The film is, honestly, pretty dumb and uncomplex. The Sea Inside, based on the true story, is certainly a lot more thoughtful on the subject. It most likely got railroaded into the same category as Million Dollar Baby without its protesters having even seen it, an incredibly common phenomenon. The film does give time to many different sides of the argument. And it immediately declares that the wish to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone. It is guilty of a couple of crimes, though, and I'd still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it. First and foremost, there's the protagonist's meeting with a paraplegic bishop. I don't look kindly on the way he's depicted. His orally operated wheelchair is depicted as absurd, and there's almost a comic sequence where his effeminate, boy-toy servants are dragging him, in his chair, up the stairs. He can't even reach the room in which Ramón is located, and one of the boy-toys is forced to carry the conversation between them. I had to think, gee, maybe if Ramón lived in a slightly more wheelchair-accessible household, he wouldn't spend his entire life in bed, and might find life more fulfilling (who knows how closely the film depicts the reality). Director Amenábar (The Others) also includes some laughable scenes that try to make this film about suicide more life-affirming, like a cross-cut sequence where Ramón looks thoughtful and his lawyer's baby is born. But besides a few ugly moments, the film is very good. It hurts that someone may want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others. However, in the end, our lives do belong to us. Shouldn't we have the right to choose? The film's strongest asset is its supporting characters, and the actors who play them. It depicts how Ramón's fight and decisions affect those around him with a beautiful precision. The family members in particular are great, and Ramón's final departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking, and had me in tears. My favorite performance in the film comes from Lola Due?as, whom I also felt gave the best, or at least certainly most undervalued, performance in Almodóvar's Volver last year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE SEA INSIDE a film by Alejandro Amenabar.Almodovar has always single handed the flag for Spanish cinema for years now, out of nowhere came Amenabar reinventing genres and injecting some new blood to the otherwise malfunctioning Spanish industry, now in a big gamble he switches from psychological terror to social drama, well the big ones would be, are audiences ready to embrace the swing and more important can he hold the flag? This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor that in his twenties was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident at the sea and his fight with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has the traces of an afternoon made for TV melodrama and the only way this is going to work is through words and honest performances and they both come in spades. Mateo Gil and Amenabar co-write in a way where the audience is not meant to be lead blind to a death end but they are encouraged to make up their own minds in the process and that is a brilliant stroke, this is not a movie pro death but a movie in favour of the ultimate illusions of our time LIBERTY. There is a few laughs spare a long the way, like when the church comes home in a wheel chair to deconstruct Sampedro beliefs but is mostly a valley of tears through out, punches coming from all fronts even when you think you are safe his father that to that point didn't make any sense comes up with the most moving line of the entire movie. It is a heartbreaking experience specially when Sampedro seems more full of life than most the people wandering the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life even those who are helping him to die? but when you strip a man of his dreams? The film is almost exclusively built on close ups bringing a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with Sampedro. That's for the actors a huge challenge that must construct their whole performances with their eyes and the eyes don't lie. Bardem was not granted his second Oscar nomination, probably in favour of Eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could have shadowed Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD where the acting looked effortless and I reckon Bardem has reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blur. I was never fond of his early work but since Almodovar's LIVE FLESH he is on a roll, LOS LUNES AL SOL, THE DANCER UPSTAIRS and the Oscar nominated BEFORE THE NIGHT FALLS made him an international star and although he and Banderas come from the same Almodovar background is fascinating to see how different paths they took and how Bardem has now become a real reference for Spanish cinema in the whole world. A golden globe, 14 Goyas, jury prize at Venice and probably an Oscar with permission from THE CHORUS BOYS, Amenabar directs, co-write, edits and puts music to a high caliber drama, he has pull it off? what about some Science Fiction now? Whose life is it anyway?****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too heavy handed and maudlin for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The supporting cast was brilliant and begged for more of the story. The performances of the son and brother grounded the film firmly to the soil of that farm and family. The unsentimentalized, caring Manuela was another outstanding performance. And finally the effervescent Gene stole every scene she was in. The brilliant supporting cast raised the movie up to greatness.Would that the film consisted of these performances and that the paraplegic was offstage like the madwoman in the attic, because the film became flat and plodding when Ramon and his lawyer, Julia, were on screen. The soundtrack was calculated to be heart wrenching in an extremely heavy handed way, manipulating the viewer's emotions in ways that didn't fit with the content of the scene itself.***** Spoiler to follow **** Finally the film sank entirely in the final scene when we go with Gene to visit Julia. The filmmaker shows us the profoundly disabled woman she has now become It is almost as if this is her comeuppance for her failure of nerve? principal? in letting down our hero and not going through with their agreed upon plan. I found that scene to be gratuitous. We know that Julia had a degenerative disease. We know that she changed her mind (but not the reason, a disarmingly light touch in a didactic story) when we see her on the beach with her husband and see that the book has been shipped to Ramon. Here the directing was ham-fisted about the ramifications of not choosing euthanasia with the added touch of seeing the achingly beautiful Julia laid low.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had planned to ignore "The Sea Inside" after initially viewing it, assuming it would be another one of these small films that would creep out of the theaters unnoticed and forgotten. To my dismay, it was recently nominated by the Academy for Best Foreign Film over deserving films like "House of Flying Daggers," bleakly ensuring "Sea" a run of at least another two months. So I feel it my duty to break the bad news for the critics who wept for this film: "The Sea Inside" is a terrible, and terribly simple movie. This does not take away from the excellent performance by Javier Bardem, who in the film plays a quadriplegic named Ramon condemned to a life in bed. As Bardem spends most of the movie under sheets, the role is exceedingly more difficult than the casual film-goer may be led to believe. In short, it's a masterful job of communicating charisma and pathos through facial tics alone. In the hands ? or more aptly face ? of a less capable actor, this role could be not just profoundly boring, but terribly frustrating. Bardem, the great actor he is, commits a fine face to the screen. Of course, in all fairness, since he IS lying on his back for a good portion of the film, it's not the most difficult role ever created. I got a small kick out of seeing him move his head around with that brush, just for the fact that there was finally some movement in his dreary dun bedroom.With that out of the way, now we can criticize this sappy proselytism. The basic plot line is simple and straightforward and you can read it from the many other reviews on this site. What is not commented on is the dreadfully mawkish manner in which director Alejandro Amenabar chooses to tell his story. Every character gets his and her cameo to shed a tear (with an 's' in some cases), and Amenabar insipidly captures this sentimentality in gross close-up after close-up. Let's face it, folks: Amenabar is no D.W. Griffith, and these grieving mugs aren't in the same league as Lillian Gish. Hell, I'd even settle for Julianne Moore's Gretta Garbo imitation here. But ? as the director prods us on ? can't we see the sorrow and grief that not supporting euthanasia is causing? Yes, and that's all we see. Amenabar relies on this type of manipulation for two hours to push his agenda. Let me put it simply: any hack can plunge the knife in our hearts and twist. In my mind, "The Sea Inside" mines territory covered by "Stepmom," by "Beaches," by "Terms of Endearment." This is not intended as a complement.Amenabar might think he's making waves, but he's really just treading water and going nowhere in his sea of tears as he preaches his sermon. Rather than present an argument for euthanasia, Amenabar settles for cheap good vs. evil storytelling. The chief flaw in this type of presentation about an actual social problem, not only in Spain but also in most of the world, is that there is absolutely no conflict of views. Believers in euthanasia are obviously understanding and sympathetic in the film; detractors of it are pious religious types with no brains of their own, intent on oppressing one's life for selfish and ignorant beliefs. Excuse me if this isn't simplifying the subject, all as the film clumsily sidesteps any moral or social dilemmas this topic has clearly had an effect on in society. Ham-handed attempts at equalizing discussion, such as a mildly amusing "debate" between Ramon and another crippled priest, are not as even as they may seem. I include debate in scare quotes because there really isn't even a reasonable battle of argument; the film clearly sides with RIGHT Ramon and his irreplaceable wit over the less articulate, stubborn, and clearly WRONG priest. By showing scenes like this, Amenabar doesn't want to challenge his own views, and instead piles on more hypocrisy and ad hominem by attacking Ramon's family rather than the issue of euthanasia itself. These instances are just a couple in many (the courtroom scene, the sympathetic lawyer, the didactic conclusion) that show how gutless single-mindedness can ruin a potentially good premise.Those looking to be converted need not see "Sea." Like Michael Moore and "Fahrenheit 9/11," like Mel Gibson and "The Passion of the Christ," Amenabar, here a proud liberal, is only interested in addressing like-minded fans who agree with him. He sticks to his understanding of a sole idea slavishly and ostentatiously. T.S. Eliot, you may recall, said of Henry James that the writer had "too fine a mind to be violated by a single idea." This film, on the other hand, seems entirely to be the violation of a single idea: the unquestionable and unchallenged correctness ? and political correctness ? of the verity of euthanasia. I guess it's what we thought all along anyway, right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reviewing the film, not the ideological issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I expected would happen, too many reviews of this film (from professionals and amateurs alike) have focused as much if not more on the film's ideology. That's because The Sea Inside (aka Mar adentro) is a film about euthanasia. Specifically, it's a true story about an infamous Galician named Ramón Sampedro, who fought for many years for the right to assisted suicide, who was denied that right by the Spanish constitutional court, and who--well, I don't want to ruin the ending of the film for you.The real life Sampedro catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in Spain. Now with producer/director/writer/composer/editor Alejandro Amenábar's (Abre Los Ojos, 1997, and The Others, 2001) "biopic", The Sea Inside, another rhetorical aid has been provided in the international debate on this hot button issue.But as I keep saying (to deaf ears?), your opinion, pro or con, on the film's ideology shouldn't affect your rating of the film. You're not supposed to be rating the philosophical or political messages that Amenábar wants to make. You're supposed to be rating the film, as a film. Maybe that's a bit too idealistic, as none of us can likely completely divorce our evaluations from our ideological biases, but idealistic or not, that's the goal.So forget about the philosophical and political issues for a moment. As a film, Amenábar has turned in one of his most elegant and mature works to date. He does not focus on societal debates. He does not focus on Sampedro's legal/political struggles. He focuses on Sampedro as a man, living out his days confined to a bed in his brother's home.Sampedro, played here in an amazing performance by Javier Bardem, was a quadriplegic. As the film begins, he has been a quadriplegic for 26 years. That condition was brought about, as Amenábar shows us through marvelously shot flashbacks, by a diving accident--Sampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman, miscalculated the water, dove in, snapped his neck, and almost drowned. As a quadriplegic he eventually began writing poetry, some of which was published in a book entitled Cartas Desde El Infierno ("Letters from Hell"); in real life Sampedro's book became a best seller in Spain. Perhaps taking Sampedro's artistic work as a cue, Amenábar has created an elegantly poetic film.Most of The Sea Inside is set inside Sampedro's bedroom. The focus in these scenes is Bardem's complex and sublime performance. As a quadriplegic, Bardem is limited to moving his head and talking. He has mastered subtle changes of expression and inflection to convey a deep character with a multifaceted, intellectual approach to life. Bardem and Amenábar have Sampedro often waxing philosophical in understated speech, but there's always a combination of a wicked sense of humor, passion for the aesthetic--including music and women, and a sadness and even occasionally bitterness not far below the surface. Different underlying emotions occasionally break through like waves on the skin of the ocean.The people Sampedro interacts with most frequently facilitate this in complex ways. These others include his sister-in-law, Manuela (Mabel Rivera), who has been his chief caretaker since Sampedro's accident; his brother, José (Celso Bugallo), who is one of the vocal objectors to Sampedro's wish to die, and with whom there is an underlying unresolved issue (it seems like maybe José was the one to save Sampedro from drowning?); his nephew, Javier (Tamar Novas), who is perhaps the most understanding towards him; a right-to-die advocate, Gené (Clara Segura); a pro bono lawyer, Julia (Belén Rueda), whom he wanted because she had a degenerative disease, CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), and would thus by more empathic, and who he falls in love with; and Rosa (Lola Due?as), a local woman who works at a cannery and moonlights as a DJ, who heard about him from the media, who wants to convince him to desire to live, and who falls in love with him.The bulk of the film consists of these characters interacting with Sampedro in his room. There are also a few other ancillary characters, including Sampedro's father, who remains oddly distant, and a notorious and media-conscious priest, Padre Francisco (José María Pou), who does his best to change Sampedro's mind via philosophy/theology (in a scene often mistakenly characterized as "comic"--it has an attendant comic element, but the scene is primarily very serious).That most of the film takes place in Sampedro's room ingeniously gives the couple significant changes in setting greater impact. Sampedro's room has a nice, big window, which he says he is satisfied with as an observation point on the world. Maybe even more importantly, he regularly imagines the window as a launching pad through which he flies across the hillsides to the ocean, which he always loved, and which has been the most influential force in his life--it provided his living when he was younger and took his mobility away. Amenábar gives us a fantastical sequence of Sampedro imagining one of his flights to the sea. It is beautifully shot, with low angles (presumably from a helicopter) of the hills rushing by, until we follow a stream to the wide-open ocean, which in this film represents freedom, the infinite, and natural forces.The other significant change of setting arrives with Sampedro finally taking to a wheelchair (he otherwise refused them, saying they "mocked his immobility") to make an appearance in court to help plead his case. Amenábar gives us a poignant, melancholy travelogue, shot subjectively, of Sampedro viewing life and the world in action from the car window.Whether you agree with legalizing euthanasia or not, it's difficult to deny that this is a well-acted, well-scripted and well-constructed film. You may not believe that it's a ten (and that's even more unlikely if you disagree with legalizing euthanasia), but it's still worth watching as a fine example of artistic, sophisticated film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Multi-awarded-winner based on real-case notorious in Spain of a paraplegic who wants to die , including a wronged message , pro-euthanasia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The factual story of Spaniard Ramon Sampedro (a near-unrecognisable Javier Bardem whose unflashy expertise acting does justice to him and his cause) , who fought to wish to die , a thirty-year campaign in favor of euthanasia and his own right to pass away . Meanwhile , Ramon tries to stimulate his fertile but frustrated imagination . Ramon is tired of being a burden to his family , friends and an object of pity to others . He's even more tired of the Spanish government when his advocate in law Marc (Francesc Garrido) defends his case and Court refuses to allow him an assisted suicide means he can't attain the dignity in death he feels he's denied in life . Film explores Ramón's relationships with his family , sister-in-law (Mabel Rivera) , oldest brother (Celso Bugallo) , grandfather (Joan Dalmau) , and two women: Julia (Belen Rueda) , a lawyer who supports his cause and helps him his published memories , and Rosa (Lola Due?as) , a local woman who wants to convince him that life is worth living and mostly attempts to persuade him to carry on . This is a feeling drama plenty of sensibility , emotion, dramatic moments , hugely engaging interpretations and sense of style . Direction , cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe, soundtrack also by Amenábar all are assured and respectful . It is a superior uplifting Weepie with some manipulative limitations that entail the story . This is the second Spanish movie about Ramon Sampedro's life, the first one was Condenado a Vivir (2001) by Robert Bodegas . It deals with a titanic fight carried out by the Galician ex-sailor against government , Justice and Catholic Church represented by another quadriplegic , a priest perfectly played by Jose Maria Pou . Very good acting by Javier Bardem as terribly restrictive quadriplegic confined to his bed with just books and the sight of the Galician hills outside his window . For international spectators the main attraction will surely be the immensely charming , very expressive acting of a magnificent Javier Bardem . Special mention to Belen Rueda as an adoring lawyer ; however , when Belén Rueda was phoned to be informed about she had just been chosen to play a role in an Amenábar film she hung up , as she thought they were kidding her ; from now on , she obtained a lot of important roles such as ¨The orphanage¨, ¨The Julia's eyes¨ , ¨The body¨, ¨Septimo¨, ¨No Tengas Miedo¨, among others . This was the most awarded Spanish movie at the Goya Awards, winning 14 of the 15 awards for which it was nominated . Selected by the Spanish Cinematographic Academy to represent Spain in the Best Foreign Language Film Category of the 2004 Oscars. The motion picture was compellingly written -along with Mateo Gil- and directed by Alejandro Amenábar . Alejandro's slickness ensures entertainment , amusement and many engaging moments . Since his perhaps best-known early short-film "Himenóptero" in 1992, in which he directed , produced, acted and wrote the script and the music, Amenábar progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with "Thesis", Amenabar was 23 when he directed this his feature debut , a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene . And ¨Abre Los Ojos¨ that was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky (2001), starring Tom Cruise who in ¨The others¨ was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . ¨Los Otros¨ (2001) was released a few months prior to Vanilla Sky (2001), the American remake of 'Alejandro Amenabár''s Abre Los Ojos (1997). Ironically, it starred Nicole Kidman's then estranged husband Tom Cruise . "Los Otros" confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world and is Amenábar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the all-time worldwide box office history . In all his films Alejandro also writes the script and the music, as well as composing the music for other films , most notably "Butterflies tongue" (1999). He subsequently directed this ¨Mar Adentro¨ with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and finally the epic/historical ¨Agora¨ with Rachel Weisz . Rating : Better than average . Essential and indispensable watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable. Greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six years ago I watched this film. It is still fresh in my mind, as if I had watched it last night. Movies don't get more impressive. It is so far the best drama I have seen (out of more than 5000 movies, one a day ) I watched over the last 10 years. Nec plus ultra, and it supports my opinion that Spain produces the best cinematography of all countries lately. The story -inspired from reality-is scripted to emotional perfection. Dialogues are exacting, gripping, powerful. There is not a dull moment, as the tension is so strong that even the beautiful landscapes, the flashbacks of Ramon (J. Bardem) the music filled intervals, never detract from the harrowing story.It is not sad, it is not happy, it is not right not wrong, not legal not illegal. For whichever view one may take on the issue, there is a contrarian view of equal power beautifully suggested in the story. Indifference is what you will not feel. The Jesuit priest scene is only one instance of critique of the simplistic opinions and hypocrisy in the bourgeois society.Amenabar has put together this masterpiece with a superb script and crystalline photography, precise cast and evocative music (some by himself). Justly awarded for this movie, he has carved a solid name for himself in cinema.Javier Bardem gives probably the best performance of his career (though I really hope he is able of even more in the future). European Film Awards granted him aptly the Best Actor prize that year. For a movie about the very lack of mobility, with most scenes in a room with a bed and little more, for a character that moves eyes and eyebrows, Bardem is a wonder in the acting guild. Another noted performance of Bardem would be his deliciously versatile act in "Before Night Falls" The supporting actors deliver strong scenes, especially Belen Rueda (Julia). Some review this film as being a debate on an issue. It is, but also far more than that. It is the essence of humanity, makes you think, makes you cry. And -as tested on myself- after many years and thousands of films I have watched after it, it remains the most powerful. This movie unleashes the force of life. I cannot think of a more memorable experience in cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the real-life story of Ramón Sampedro, a Spanish ship mechanic left quadriplegic after a diving accident. 'Mar adentro' is his story, it's based on the hopes he had, and on how he said good-bye to life.Alejandro Amenábar, the director of the film, makes a Gem. It's one of the most moving and enlightening experiences you'd watch. Late Ramón Sampedro was a man beyond his words, his weakness and his strength. He was a man to remember, which he has since his death. His final stages unfold with terrific direction, and some dramatic cinematography.And of course the performances: Javier Bardem is top-notch as Late Ramón Sampedro. He has proved his caliber, once again. Belén Rueda is absolutely flawless. Lola Due?as also delivers a bravura performance. But it's Mabel Rivera, who steals the show, with an excellent performance.On the whole, ' Mar adentro' is an experience you just can't afford to miss. Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An astounding performance in a deeply moving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On first viewing I really liked this film. I loved the acting and the style but I felt a certain emotional distance keeping me from labeling it great. But on second viewing, I found myself far more deeply moved, while still being intellectually challenged by the moral, emotional and ethical complexity of the story of a brilliant quadriplegic man with much to give the world wanting to die. Bardem gives a truly heartbreaking, world class performance, and is closely matched by those around him. Director Amenabar also wrote the score for his own film and it is terrific and original. Throughout, there were some stylish touches that gave me a visceral shiver. A few simplistic scenes, and slower moments keep me from calling it a perfect film, but it's not far off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling and interesting film that never strays too far into the political nor the documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose it's quite an achievement to be able to present to an audience a true tail about a frail man; a tail in which the protagonist will spend the majority of the film on his back, in a bed and totally unable to move. And yet the achievement is in the film's effectiveness as a dramatic piece; as a recollection of a true story and I guess as an argument as to why people should have the right to die if they so wish to. But the film isn't a political statement and perhaps thankfully it shies away from too many scenes of debate although it does include one for the sake of argument anyway. More-so, this is one of those foreign language films that presents its lead character as a cripple whom can do nothing but talk to the people around him and yet is able to come across as engaging and compelling anyway.So rather than be an out and out argument, the film is more a sweet yet timely dramatic piece about another person wanting something or in search of something; the only difference is that by attaining this 'goal', it would mean the termination of a someone's life and it would be achieved by not physically going anywhere. Javier Bardem plays real life Galician Ramón Sampedro, an individual who at a much earlier age dived into a clearing of water that was too shallow for such activity. This rendered him bedridden for the rest of his life and his wish to die is the focus of Chilean director Alejandro Amenábar's film. We've seen so many films in our lives in which characters have certain 'goals' or targets one must meet before the film is over to provide a satisfactory experience for the audience, but the change of pace in The Sea Inside is gentle; it does not involve young, energetic, attractive heroes going off to do battle in far off places but a real person after something that means so much to them.Even if you do have a strong policy, either pro or anti-euthanasia, you may find yourself hoping Ramón gets what he wants at the end of it all anyway. The film sets its tone very early on with Ramón giving a speech on why he wants to die to watching family members, immediately introducing the situation and subject to the watching audience who may not know what the film is about. Interestingly, some of the family members are 'anti' what he wishes which might place any audience member that feels strongly about the subject in their respective shoes. But the purpose of this set up is to tell the audience 'No, this isn't one man after something who incidentally has the whole of his family backing him to the end'. Quite easily, the film could've gone down a route in which it is the Sampedro family vs. everybody else but some are anti-Ramón's idea; some are too young to acknowledge what's really going on and others are seemingly too distraught to even have an opinion other than they just want Ramón to stick around a bit longer, they love him after all.The Sea Inside is a following of a story revolving around a victim of sorts. Ramón is a quadriplegic and it is his perspective we see things from. This is something that may disjoint viewers or have the film come across as quite odd given we are being presented with a film from the point of view of a victim rather than an instigator or a lead character in a film that is always inducing the cause in the cause and effect drive. But this is no criticism and it's a credit to the director for delivering such an approach in the effective manner in which it is. The film asks questions; it offers a scenario to its audience. If you were in Ramón's position: what would you do, or think about or dream of or talk about? Consequently, dreams about lawyer Juila (Rueda) are not so much shot for the audience's pleasure as much as they are an ever so slight window into one man's escapist fantasies from his predicament.The study of Julia intensifies somewhat later on when a she begins to share certain similarities with Ramón and that is when she begins to have strokes that are a result of a disease of her own. This trait seems timely in the progression of their relationship and adds a further ingredient of connection on top of an already engaging friendship. This is because Julia feels the physical pain and restriction, not in a sense that she isn't able to get up and walk, but I think she realises the value of life given how emotionally bad she felt beforehand. While the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of euthanasia, it feels like more of a down to Earth drama about a man in a situation in which he is prepared to fight for what he wants but must do so verbally. It's refreshing to see films like The Sea Inside as it not only references history and gives us an insight into that but as a stand alone film, delivers on an emotional and engaging level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting and inspiring in spite of such an apparently downbeat subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't move. At least nothing below the neck moves. You can't turn around. You can't eat or drink unaided, or do, choose, or effectively decide, very much for that matter.Once you had a full life, travelling the world as a ship hand, living and loving to the full. Inside, your spirit still soars, racing along the beach, catching the spray of the waves, smelling the hair of a woman in your arms. But now your spirit has been disenfranchised, stranded behind the veil of your dreams. You have become a distant observer of your own life, powerless to get involved, a ghost at the wheel.This is the evocative story based on the real life Ramon Sanpedro who became a quadriplegic after a diving accident, and it is the film's brilliant interiorisation of his world, making the audience feel and see things as if they were the highly articulate Ramon, that gives it the gut-wrenching force to scale the heights of emotional grandeur - rather than wallowing in the grim mire of a sentimental 'message' movie.Early on, the audience is tantalisingly entrusted with the attraction that this unusual man convincingly conveys. Manuela, his sister in law, is devoted to him. Rosa, a struggling local DJ and factory worker, is enamoured of him. But it is Julia, a beautiful lawyer representing him that most understands and empathises with him, partly as she has a dark secret of her own. The right to die campaign worker, Gene, is inexhaustibly supportive, and one of the most well balanced characters morally. But with who, if any, will romantic flights of fancy become physical? And who, if any, will help him achieve his wish to say goodbye to the world if and when the courts fail him in his quest? The Sea Inside is a quiet revelation that packs emotional honesty, a memorable script (using excerpts from Sanpedro's poetry) and superb acting from Javier Bardem. It tackles a difficult subject more thoroughly and engagingly than has ever been done before and kept me wide awake with eyes glued to the screen even after an exhausting day. Its weakest point is that those of a different viewpoint are handled without the gravitas afforded Sanpedro's own wish to end his life. The visiting priest is an object of ridicule and humour and, while this provides some excellent light relief, it smacks of an absence of intellectual rigour in an otherwise very thorough examination of the issues. But this is only a small criticism in what is otherwise a monumental and highly recommendable film.Chris Docker</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much LIFE in a movie about death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ramon Sampedro has been a quadriplegic for nearly three decades as a result of an accident in his mid-twenties. Restricted to movements from only neck and up, he is under the tireless care of his family of four, a loving widower father, a stubbonly religious and honest brother, a sister-in-law who treats him like her own son and a sensible though not particularly intellectual nephew. This film is about Ramon's sober, calm, but fiercely determined effort to seek consent from the Spanish courts for euthanasia.This is not an emotional decision. His life after the accident has not been devoid of bliss. He is blessed with a loving and caring family that makes his handicap less difficult to endure. He is talented and his talent is gratified in his ability to write beautiful poetry, and he has learned to "cry with a smile". After 26 years, inertia alone might sustain his carrying on. But he says he no longer wants to live without dignity. I think the real reason for him to want to die, particularly at this point, may be that he no longer wants to be a burden to his family. His father, while still healthy, is old. His brother and sister-in-law are both older than he. His nephew will finish school soon and deserves to focus on his future and career.Here comes the biggest irony. We see so much zeal, energy, vitality and LIFE in Ramon's quest to seek death. Through his good friend and death-right activist Gene and her husband, he engages a lawyer to fight the legal battle, culminating in his yielding his resistance to wheelchairs, so as to be able to appear in court to demonstrate that his is a fully rational and responsible man, capable of making a well-reasoned decisions. Interesting to note that during this time, Gene is pregnant and the scene of childbirth punctuates Ramon's effort to gain death.Julia, the lawyer undertaking his case, is a gentle, perceptive woman, happily married but suffering herself from a disease that progressively destroys her, first putting her in a wheelchair and eventually damaging her brain. What we see in most of the film though is the development of a wonderful love story between Ramon and Julia, from their working on the case, their gradually understanding, appreciating and empathizing with each other, and Julia's helping Ramon to get his poetry published.Another woman that comes into Ramon's life is Rosa, a divorced factory worker with two children. Rosa has read about Raman and wants to persuade him to continue to embrace life. Not at Ramon's intellectual plane but shrewd in her own way, Rosa soon falls in love with him. At the end she become the one who helps Ramon to gain his wish after the court turns down his request.The most remarkable thing about this film is that it is so full on life. Part of this is in the vivid energy with which Ramon pursues his purpose, so vibrant that you sometimes forget that this purpose is death. Part of this is in another line of activity ? first the discovery, then the publishing of Ramon's poetry. But mostly, it is in Ramon himself. If there is self-pity, you see very little of it. He is articulate in his arguments and firm in his conviction. He can be irritable, but he can also be humorous and gentle. He is intelligent and charming, so much so that both Julia and Rosa, from very different backgrounds, fall in love with him almost instantly. And all these are portrayed by Javier Bardem, acting from only his neck up. Surely, language should not be a barrier to his winning the Best Actor Oscar this year.This film is rich in every aspect, deeply moving at times, hilarious funny at others. The cast is wonderful. In addition to the two women who fall in love with Ramon, played by Belen Rueda (Julia) and Lola Duenas (Rosa), special mention must be made of Mabel Rivera, whose simple and enduring goodness as Manuela the sister-in-law will surely break the hardest heart.For an artistically splendorous scene, everyone will remember Ramon's flight out of the window, over the vales, to yonder lovely shore, under the rousing music of probably the most popular tenors' show-off aria Nessun Dorma.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenabar's The Sea Inside delivers the story of Ramon Sampedro, a man beseeching the Spanish justices to tolerate euthanasia on his behalf. The film seemingly sympathizes with its main character's wishes as the majority of the characters are willing to assist Sampedro in his plight. The only consistently protestant character is Sampedro's brother yet his objective sets him apart as an antagonistic force to battle rather than to reason with. Throughout the course of the film one's predictions as to the outcome fluctuate, as it is hard to determine whether Sampedro will go through with his death wish or admit that life is not as terrible as it might seem. As the film progresses one finds it increasingly difficult to watch, given the main character's unrelenting pessimism despite the plethora of loving individuals that surround and admire him.As Sampedro's story unfolds the things he reveals about his life make it more difficult to sympathize with him. For example when asked about love Sampedro admits that he had a girlfriend at the time he was paralyzed; she remained with him through his hospitalization and asked that they be married. Sampedro refused her, claiming that he was incapable of loving in his condition. When encouraged to view love as more than mere physicality Sampedro states that he cannot. The main character speaks critically of everyone around him, at times causing his family and friend pain due to his evident bitterness. Aside from his voluntarily grizzly persona, Sampedro's character is notably intelligent, inventive and imaginative. He is able to dream, but only of death. He is able to write, but only of the hell that holds him captive. He is able to remember, yet chooses to reminisce only of his accident.The film is difficult to endure, especially as it nears its close. Sampedro denounces the love of those who refuse to assist him in his suicide. He lashes out against his family and friends until at last one young woman, desperate to receive love from someone, agrees to help him with his plight. She procures a poison, rents an apartment and sets Sampedro up with a camera. Sampedro speaks to the justices, through the camera, telling them that he will have his way whether it is legal or not. He then sips the poison and dies on film. Before the film ends, however, it revisits a close friend of Sampedro who decided against euthanasia despite living with a degenerative disease. She is seen sitting in a wheel chair near the beach, is evidently blind, and has lost her memory. Even after this moment it is difficult to determine if the film is supporting or criticizing euthanasia. One could argue that the woman's quality of life had been degrading by the disease and yet her determination and her husband's dedication are both admirable. It is difficult to ignore the fact that Sampedro's mind was never at risk of deteriorating and so his death allows him to avoid being emotionally burdened by an event that changed his life almost thirty years ago. While the viewer's external context establishes a bias toward the issue even prior to watching the film, Sampedro's nastiness and lack of will do little to encourage support or understanding on his behalf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring tale of a living death; Bardem is superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SEA INSIDE (2004) **** Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Joan Dalmau, Alberto Jimenez, Tamar Novas, Francesc Garrido, Jose Maria Pou, Alberto Amarilla, Nicolas Fernandez Luna.(Dir: Alejandro Amenabar)An inspiring tale of a living death; Bardem is superbThe true life account of Spanish quadriplegic Ramon Sampedro and his petition to fulfill his desire for euthanasia by the right to die may not be considered a likely source of inspiration but this film is just that.Sampedro (played superbly by Bardem) was a virile, energetic young man when he lost the function to his limbs after a tragic diving accident (recounted horrifically in flashback with a visceral jolt to the senses) and for nearly thirty years lay paralyzed in bed while his loving family cared to his every need. Although his abilities to move were nil his mind was very much active and proved skillful as an inventor, poet, author and artist that kept his mind busy until he could no longer bear the thought of living longer in his stunted condition.Enter beautiful yet also afflicted with a crippling disease attorney Julia (the ethereal Rueda who matches Bardem beautifully as if they were indeed soul mates) is hired to see through Sampedro's final wish to end his life and in turn becomes an aide de camp when he begins to open up to her like to no one ever before. Not too long has time passed and Julia begins to investigate her charge's past discovering many letters hidden away by his family. When Julia confronts Ramon with this he at first is reluctant to discuss any thing with her but eventually he agrees with her that this may help his case and the project becomes a book in the making ? a memoir/biography by way of free-style poetry and prose. The film is a heartbreaking tale of the human spirit and how love eventually triumphs over heart ache in many forms including for Ramon the unlikely love he shares with a complete stranger named Rosa (Duenas) a single mother who sees him on TV one day inspiring her to bicycle to his remote farmhouse in Spain to get to know him and possibly change his mind about ending his life.Filmmaker Amenabar, who co-wrote with Mateo Gil the fascinating screenplay, allows some fantasy into the mix when Ramon envisions himself magically leaving his bed and flying across the bucolic landscapes to the eventual sea where he suffered so many years ago the cruel twist of fate that has imprisoned him for three decades. The film is not a complete downer with a sly wit and occasionally humorous tone throughout that doesn't dilute the impact of the story's final act. Kudos also to the remarkable make-up job by James and Jo Allen do a tremendous job in aging the vibrant Bardem to an aging man to full effect that should get them an Acadamy Award nod. Bardem and Rueda deserve Oscar nominations as two people with so much in common and despite Rueda's Julia being married to a loving, doting husband, that a pair of people so made for one another it is down right impossible they were never together to begin with. That's just one of the cruelties that rings true but it is not by definition of the film as its whole; it is a must-see and one of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-Facts (I): "Mar Adentro" relates the well-known (at least in Spain) story of Ramón Sampedro, a Galician quadriplegic who killed himself (helped by some friends) after 28 years prostrated by his condition. Judges had denied several times his petitions of active euthanasia.-Facts (II): "Mar adentro" becomes THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR in Spain. Everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people... Everyone likes it, even the critics' opinions are unanimous. The film wins a lot of prizes (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goya...) and annoys catholic community and life-lovers quadriplegics. A star is born.-Facts (III): The intensity and the quality of the actors in "Mar Adentro" are just amazing, and this makes mi wonder how come we have to watch the same bad young actors in the most of Spanish latest movies. I don't know if Javier Bardem is a great actor or a great imitator (there's quite a difference between one thing or the other); anyway, his job is just impressive, as well as Lola Due?as', Belén Rueda's, or the job of all the guest starrings. This is (the actors selection) the strong point in Amenábar's movie.-Facts (IV): Alejandro Amenábar learned his lesson there at the Cinema School, there's no doubt about it: he's got a privileged brain. He takes good control of each and every one of the technical aspects, he knows what the audiences want, he knows how to touch the right chord, even if that turns him into such a demagogue (just like Spielberg is -one of Amenábar's idols-).-Facts (and V): If you criticize a movie such as "Mar Adentro" it will seem like you have any kind of trouble with the moral issue the story tells about. There's a trap in this kind of pictures: you have to differentiate between the movie itself and the moral concepts. If you don't like "Schindler's List" that does not mean that you agree with Hitler's philosophy (or do you?). So, for me, it is a good film and an extraordinary story (since it is a real story that makes it much more extraordinary). Grandiloquent, self-kind, and everything but neutral (no matter what Amenábar or Bardem have said about it: those characters that are not in favor of euthanasia come to no good at all!!). 50 % Hard / 50% way too sentimental.-Epilogue: "Mar Adentro" wouldn't be by no mean in my ranking of the best 50's Spanish movies of all time. Nobody has special merits in the story but Ramon Sampedro himself. He IS the movie. Now, Alejandro Amenábar is gonna become the more international Spanish director ever, maybe he'll go to live to Hollywood; but some of us would like to watch him filming a simple story, without bit final twists, without living dead nor dying alive... "The Others" is still his best movie.*My rate: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, thought-provoking movie about life, death and the right to die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Powerful, thought-provoking movie about life, death and the right to die. The true story of Ramon Sampedro, a Spanish quadriplegic for 29 years who fought for the right to kill himself. Explores his and motivations and rationality for wanting to commit suicide, plus life, loves and psyche. Told from Sampedro's perspective, so not entirely a balanced debate. However, there are some characters in the movie who represent the "don't do it" argument, though their arguments aren't as forcefully told or as coherent as the lead character's.Very emotional at times, and the last few scenes are incredibly powerful.Superb performance by Javier Bardem in the lead role. Supporting cast don't put a foot wrong either.Won the best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2005. Interesting to note that in 2005 the Best Picture Oscar (plus a few other Oscars) went to the brilliant "Million Dollar Baby", which explored similar themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Powerful Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As The Sea Inside indicates, the right to die with dignity is a very controversial issue not only in Spain, where the setting of this film is, but all over the world including countries like the United States. With that in mind, this film packed an emotional wallop as we learn the story about this man who wanted to die, despite being in relatively good health. This is a well-acted melodrama that is very hard to watch and even the strongest person may have a tear or two in his eye.Alejandro Amenabar's film is about a quadriplegic named Ramon Sampredo who fought for 28 years for the right to die after suffering a horrific injury in a diving accident. Ramon must face an uphill battle as he deals with the protests from the court of Spain as well as his family members.Javier Bardem delivers one of his best performances here as Ramon. Despite all what he is going through, he remains a cheery guy who smiles often. But once we hear the pain he is in and how he has enough of being in bed and unable to live life anymore, we can see this pain resonates. Javier Bardem does an excellent job on capturing the emotion and the reality of the suffering these kind of people face. Meanwhile, the two women who he becomes attached to did a great job. Belen Rueda as Julia and Lola Duenas as Rosa.Overall, The Sea Inside is a tough film to watch because of the subject matter but nonetheless, it is still a very good film that is very well made. Not only is the acting tremendous, but things that stand out are the makeup and the screenplay. This film has a very strong script and the makeup does a good job in transforming Javier Bardem into the man who wanted to die. Such a powerful film. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional diving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sea Inside is a fantastic Spanish film starring Javier Bardem as a quadriplegic who wants to end his life with dignity. I know that a lot of people will condemn this film for supporting euthanasia and giving a one-sided debate, but this isn't a film about a euthanasia debate. It's not something a religious studies teacher will put on for their GCSE class. The Sea Inside is simply about Ramon and the brilliantly written characters which surround him. I firstly have to praise the outstanding performances in this film. Javier Bardem is extraordinary as Ramon and manages to pull off a string of different emotions without using any part of his body (aside from his head of course). It's a magnificent performance and far from his psychopathic Sugar in No Country For Old Men. Belen Rueda (a somewhat underrated actress) is also breath-taking in her role as a lawyer befriending Ramon and suffering from a life threatening disease herself.The Sea Inside manages to captivate its viewers for its entire two hour running time, which is no mean feat for a film largely set in a man's bedroom. Alejandro Amenábar's directing is often extraordinary and always captivating. There's a magnificently heart-breaking moment where Ramon imagines getting out of bed and flies out of the window to the operatic tune of Nessun Dorma. The fluid camera work is quite extraordinary and dream-like. It perfectly captures Ramon's desire to be free, and makes us all appreciate the use of our able bodies.Alejandro Amenábar's screen writing screens are also quite brilliant. Whilst the film does have plenty of emotionally draining moments, there are also plenty of uplifting ones too to make you smile. He makes Ramon a sympathetic and extremely likable character, as well as the good-natured people who surround him. I especially enjoyed the romantic sub-plot which is sure to pull at anyone's heart strings. The Sea Inside largely works so well because of its magnificent characters and powerful dialogue.The film is all the more painful to watch because we know how it's going to end. The suicide scene is pretty intense to watch with the camera stationary, allowing us to see Ramon die almost like in real time. And whilst the film may not be as relentlessly painful to watch as say, Amour, it still has plenty of powerful moments and many did actually pull on my tear ducts, which is a very rare thing for me. The only films to actually make me cry are Amour and Dancer in the Dark, but The Sea Inside did make me tearful. This is a fantastic film about humanity and the right to freedom. It's a film I'd highly recommend to everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Javier Bardem's best performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Javier Bardem ever since No Country For Old Men came out back in 2007. His presence on screen was something extraordinary and i could tell the guy knew how to act. Sea Inside is definitely a film were his talent shines. The character he plays as is a paraplegic. After an unfortunate accident, he's left paralyzed from the neck down. After so many years he decides that he's had enough and wants to attempt suicide. As he tries to find the right person to help him, we get to meet so many great characters played by many great actors/actresses. From his family to his friends, you get this emotional bond between everyone and it really makes for a real powerhouse. You will believe Bardem is paralyzed, it's so effective. He makes it seem so realistic from beginning to end. This film has a very deep and dark meaning that anyone could feel for. It'll make you cry, it'll make you laugh and it will leave you in silence. If your a fan of Javier Bardem, or your a fan of a good and solid piece of art, do your self a favor and see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I really say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a masterpiece. Although it may deal with a rather tabooed topic by most people (euthanasia) it really is worth watching. The real reason I wanted to watch this is that I wanted to broaden my horizon of Foreign films away from Scandanavian cinema (which some of those are hidden gems too) so I decided to look up countries of which I have seen a film of theirs before (in this case Spain) and found this.The plot is that a quadriplegic by the name of Ramon Sampredo has fought for almost 30 years to die. This basically is the last few months of his life. It may not seem like much but the execution is brilliant.The dialogue of this movie is really intelligent. I was impressed with the writing of this movie. So one expectation I'll say to have is strong dialogue, because in that sense it will be fulfilled.I will recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a well made drama movie, regardless of how you feel about euthanasia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That's right, run -- since you can"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie beautifully captures the regrets a man can feel from having spent one moment too distractedly by the sea. The man must confront the fact that he, a man who knew the sea well, had joined with nature to create his paralysis. Had he not dived, had the ocean not receded when it did, he might be standing today. But then there would have been no film. And this is a good one. It's reminiscent of "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly." But the protagonist here, played exquisitely by Javier Bardem, manages to make quadriplegia sexy -- for the romantics in the audience -- while raising important questions about the right to die. Bardem's character conjures an important truth in the film: Death will catch up with each of us sooner or later. So what's the big deal if one man makes it come sooner, rather than later?The protagonist in this film seems tortured by the fact that everything he wants in life is right in front of his face. Yet he can't reach out and take it. Death will provide some desperately wanted mobility. Throughout the film one wavers between the main character's point of view, forged through excruciating suffering, and the view of some other characters who, perhaps selfishly, wish for him to stay with life and partake of what pleasures he can.I work in a field in which questions like these arise. This film has provided a lot to consider, if society will dare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deals with large, powerful issues through an intensely personal lens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Euthanasia is a challenging moral issue on which there are any number of stances, but "The Sea Inside" manages to make its audience put all that aside and just pay attention to the true personal story of Ramon Sampedro.Sampedro is hard to crack. Javier Bardem had the enormous challenge of becoming a man who was so utterly convinced and so at peace with the idea of ending his own life. You can't simply chock that up to Sampedro being mentally disturbed or psychologically wounded, even if the film suggests he was more wounded than he allowed himself to admit. Bottom line is that in spite of being a quadriplegic, he had all his wits about him; he just felt death was the best way to move forward.That's not easy to understand as a viewer. The notion that nothing, absolutely nothing, would give Ramon cause to live, is tough to swallow. In the film we're treated to a number of meaningful relationships in Ramon's life. He bonds with his nephew, Javi (Tamar Novas), becomes smitten with his new attorney, Julia (Belen Rueda), and forges a new friendship with Rosa (Lola Duenas), a woman moved by his story and convinced she can help him see cause to live again. Yet his belief in his right to "die with dignity" is so totally resolute.Spanish writer and director Alejandro Amenabar and co-writer Mateo Gil give us a full range of perspectives on Ramon and his situation and keeps the movie intensely personal. We don't see many court room scenes; this is no Hollywood biopic in which the main character crusades for what he believes in and receives some swelling emotional climax for his efforts. In fact, the film leaves us on quite the opposite note with a haunting final scene as Ramon decides to take his own life when the courts will not grant him the permission to do so legally.As so many great European filmmakers tend to do, Amenabar also gives us a poetic side to Ramon's story, which in this case is especially fitting because Ramon is an excellent writer and poet. Between the title and the film's opening, it's not shy about this notion of the sea inside, which is Ramon's mental escape from his physical reality, though to complicate matters, the sea is also directly tied to how Ramon ended up a quadriplegic. We connect most to Ramon through the dream scenes, through his fantasy. Despite the limited degree of empathy we can possible have for him, we still identify so clearly with his longing and desire, and Amenabar gives this to us with such a soft, deft touch.We also see Ramon as his friends and loved ones see him. The film explores the psychology at work when someone you are so close to, someone you have helped and cared for for years and years, wishes they were dead. The degree of public attention on that wish makes it all the more challenging for these characters, many of who we like, many of whom we don't. We get to see them ? just as we see Ramon ? in 360 degrees.As a Western viewer, there's a definite itch to see a bit more of the technical side, to explore Ramon's story in the large context that is the euthanasia debate, but Amenabar does such a incredible job convincing us that there's no need for it. This is an issue that has a clear face, that can and maybe should be judged on a personal level. In this particular instance, there's no public debate without a personal decision. If Ramon did not want this for himself, then no one would be having this conversation.Consequently, each viewer will grapple with the issues in this movie on an intensely personal level. Personally, I went back and forth as the film did, so purely wanting Ramon to win his own personal right to decide, yet wanting so desperately for him to find cause to live. In bringing this conundrum to this personal level, Amenabar effectively captures the large-scale complexity of this issue."The Sea Inside" is a great film for the way it accesses these ideas, not so much in the power of its drama, but regardless it leaves a lasting impression.~Steven CThanks for reading!

His lawyer, Julia, suffers from an incurable medical condition supports his choice and fights the legal system with him.Another woman, Rosa, loves him and tries to change Ramon's mind regarding suicide. Bardem is as good as any actor I have ever seen and this performance ranks with his Oscar winning role in No Country for Old Men. Ramon's brother Jose and his family make his survival possible, so he feels like he is a burden on them. The court case drags on and on, until he has reached fifty four years of age and a decision is finally reached. There are no easy answers to this moral dilemma, and The Sea Inside doesn't preach to the audience from one side or the other. Love, life, and death are tackled in a deep and insightful way with the great Javier Bardem leading the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific movie that presents the moral question of Euthanasia from two radically different perspectives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ramon(Javier Bardem) expresses his desire to die amidst the mental turmoil he is facing as a result of becoming a quadriplegic due to a tragic accident. His family is in complete denial of his mental condition as they have provided love and care that can make him feel secure. This denial and deep sadness is palpable when a famous personality (who is also a quadriplegic) arrogantly proclaims that Ramon wants to kill himself as a result of the negligence from his family. Then there is Julia, a lawyer who takes a curious interest in his case and supports his cause. And there is Rosa, who wants to show him how beautiful life is.Each of these women reveals secrets that directly impact how they feel about Ramon's decision. To us, the viewers this creates a moral dilemma as both of them appeal to our principles thereby forcing us to think deeply about why Ramon feels this way. The director does a fantastic job of bringing to the table a variety of situations that share a glimpse of Ramon's world. In spite of the influences that people have around him, Ramon very calmly never flinches from his decision, almost always giving an impression of eerie obviousness that we cannot perceive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No clichés here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The notion of carrying out one's life for the sake of carrying out one's life is the main concept that is criticized in Alejandro Amenabar's film. Dark conversations about death take place in a sky-lit room with a verdant and serene view, while moments of raw human optimism occur in darkness, with only a hint of a rusty sunset. Visually, this film shows what it needs to when it needs to in order to induce empathy, but not pity from the viewer (i.e. the final death scene). Expression of human dignity is the foundation of this movie, and Amenabar goes to many lengths to show its intrinsic value. The scenes of Ramon flying to the sea while Luciano Pavarotti's "Nessun Dorma" guides him is a good example of how the movie doesn't rely heavily on a linear plot to get its point across. Instead, it highlights human aspirations and dignity to not settle for less. It doesn't fall victim or feel the need to over-complicate its plot with twists or turns, but simply presents instances of bliss within the tragedy of death, allowing the viewer to interpret them to their liking. It is important to note that this film is not the cliché call to action to stop taking things (i.e. mobility) for granted, but an exploration of how one can smile in the dark, or cry in the midst of a pristine shoreline. The choice to do either is there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out to sea ... where dreams come true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar's Academy Award-winning film, Mar Adentro, looks at the life and death of Spaniard, quadriplegic, and assisted suicide campaigner, Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem).Based on the true story of Sampedro's attempt to win a right to die decision, the film does not spend much time on the deep and often dark concept of euthanasia. Instead Amenábar illustrates Sampedro's close relationships with family and friends. In particular the film follows the bed-ridden Sampedro as he develops an intimate and beautiful friendship with his lawyer, Julia (Belén Rueda), who also suffers from a debilitating disease. Even though Julia is married to someone else, the two share a deep understanding of personal struggle. During their many bedside talks, Julia gives film viewers a glimpse into Sampedro's life before paralysis as she draws his story from him. Eventually, the viewer learns that Sampedro broke his neck while diving into a shallow part of the sea. He would have wanted to drown but a friend came to his rescue.Amenábar's elegant portrayal of Sampedro's relationship with his own feelings is worth mentioning. Lying in bed, holding a pen attached to a stick in his mouth, Sampedro laboriously recorded his thoughts about life and his right to die. In the film Julia discovers them and encourages, and ultimately helps him to compile them into a book. One of the film's more intimate moments takes place when Sampedro read parts of an essay to Julia. "To worship you and penetrate you, eternally, my seductive lover, the beloved sea, " he said and then admitted to fantasizing about a relationship with her. After Julia kissed him for real, a blank stare appeared on his face as if he is stuck somewhere between his dreams and reality."Out to sea," he said in his goodbye letter to Julia. "Out to sea and in the weightlessness of the deep where dreams come true, two souls unite to fulfill a single wish." Mar Adentro left me contemplating that void as I watched Sampedro lose his case in court but take his own life anyway and plunge again, into the deep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Based on the profoundly moving true story that captured the world's attention, 'The Sea Inside' is about Spaniard Ramón Sampedro (played by 'Oscar' nominee Javier Bardem), who fought a 30-year campaign to win the right to end his life with dignity. 'The Sea Inside' also explores Ramón's relationships with two women, and his ability to inspire them through his gift of love. A truly joyous experience, 'The Sea Inside' celebrates the nature of freedom and love, and the mystery and beauty of life," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.While overtly respecting Mr. Sampedro's individual decision to end his life, this film is an argument against euthanasia. His life after the crippling accident is, indeed, "A truly joyous experience." The true worth of Sampedro's life would be lost, if he had drowned. That he lived, albeit in a paraplegic state, enriches (even saves) others' lives - consider, for example, the platonic "affair" he has with "Julia" (Belén Rueda). Their love is as deep and meaningful as one that would include acts of sexual gratification; emotionally, they violate her marriage.Sampedro enriches the lives of strangers, like "Rosa" (Lola Due?as), with life-affirming friendship. And, he is a life-altering member of his family, especially to "Javi" (Tamar Novas), who so memorably runs after the van taking his uncle to, finally, rest in peace. It's difficult to imagine how these characters' lives would be better, had Sampedro died in the water (as he wished); and, his decision to leave them is saddening (if not selfish). Director Alejandro Amenábar and his crew make "The Sea Inside" a beautiful experience.; Mr. Bardem and the cast are marvelous.******** Mar adentro (9/3/04) Alejandro Amenabar ~ Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Tamar Novas</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The winner of the 2004 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film could have easily been a strong nominee for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay had it been in English, such was the quality of the work.Alejandro Amenabar's directorial prowess works at full capacity to produce a Motion Picture about a subject as taboo as human euthanasia, with enough wit and intelligence to captivate audiences of any type. There is no hint of melodrama or pretentiousness (qualities that are common in films of this nature) and audiences will not feel insulted.Amenabar produces valid arguments for and against self-assisted suicide, but never draws any distinct conclusion, instead opting to let the viewer follow his/her heart.The cast, led by a superb Javier Bardem (who outshines most male lead performances for that year with an emotionally riveting and realistic portrayal) is quite good, comprised mainly of actors/actresses previously unknown to American audiences.MAR ADENTRO contains great direction, excellent acting, intelligent writing, and breathtaking cinematography showcasing the beauty of the Spanish countryside. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 188. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie - Much more than a debate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little apprehensive about spending my time watching a movie about euthanasia and the debate surrounding it. I finally watched it, and I am glad I did. For a movie about euthanasia, this movie is so full of life that you begin to wonder why the central character is so bent on taking his own. Despite Ramon's claims, it does seem that he is doing it to make his point about freedom and dignity of life, than because of his own state of unhappiness. The movie has a great script, strong acting and spectacular photography. Music is great too. I will recommend it to anyone who would like to watch thoughtful cinema. Some characters could have been handled better - I would have loved to get more insight into the characters of Julia and Rosa. Overall a great movie which never gets sombre, even as it deals with infirmities and matters of suicide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may very well be the best of Amenábar's work to date. I've seen all he's completed thus far, as of and including Tesis. I've yet to truly dislike or find myself unable to see genuine value in what I've watched that he's helmed. They are all movies of questions, not answers, as he, himself, puts it. And they all deal with life and death, often among other philosophical subjects. This perhaps in a different way than the others. At its center is the following for us all to ponder: Is living a right, or an obligation? No lectures, no dictating, nothing is claimed as fact, but rather stated, and it is up to the individual to decide where they stand. The deliberate, eased pacing, with some use of sudden, startling shifts in intensity that he has employed before is evident here, and it's a perfect fit. This is very well-directed and effective. It can be strong, but never tasteless. In his make-up, Bardem is almost unrecognizable, going by what I've gotten of a look at him outside of it, which, admittedly, is not much. The editing and cinematography are masterful. Not a single moment is off. The acting, as well as I can judge it, not yet speaking the language, is spot-on, throughout. Javier, especially, seems to lose himself entirely in the role, and comes off as believable. The characters are well-written and credible. There is a little humor, and it is good(do note that among it is relatively dark jokes). As with the previous releases by the man I mentioned at the beginning of this review, this is not a mainstream, easy-to-take-in flick. If you are seeking entertainment(I'm not passing judgment, I don't only go for this kind of piece), you will probably do better to go elsewhere. The DVD holds three deleted scenes that are well worth the time(and they're also subbed, so that helps), and a behind-the-scenes featurette that I will write about on its specific page here on the site. I recommend this warmly and eagerly to any fan of true film, of drama and of the people involved in making this, Alejandro in particular. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Emotionally-charged masterpiece from Spain deals with the true story of Ramon Sampedro (brilliantly portrayed by all-world talent Javier Bardem), a quadriplegic who fought for 30 years in favor of euthanasia and the right to choose death over life. Belen Rueda is unforgettable as his attorney with her own severe health issues and Lola Duenas shines thoroughly as a working-class single mother who finds the joy of life and love through Bardem's complicated character. Co-writer/director Alejandro Amenabar's film is full of difficult questions and dilemmas aplenty. Every angle and seemingly every viewpoint is examined to various extents in this amazing production. An overwhelmingly excellent cinematic accomplishment in every way. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love is understanding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Javier Bardem is Ramon Sampedro, a quadriplegic who after 28 years of "hell," is desperately seeking the aid of friends, strangers and the court to help end his life. A group called Dying with Dignity enters and begins the tasking job of starting a petition for Ramon, which once passed, would inevitably give Ramon an assisted death. But all is not so simple, and his journey towards ultimate liberation seems to be far out of reach. His voice and story reach far and wide, and through mutual pain and loss, Ramon befriends a trio of women who all in their own ways, love him unconditionally. Who loves him deepest is left to be seen."The Sea Inside" is an important and well made film about one's desire for death amidst so much love. Some don't understand his feelings, while others do; and then there are those who only wish for Ramon to be happy and burden free. Though the film's central notions are secularized around Ramon's viewpoint of "dying with dignity," Alejandro Amenabar does a great job of instilling the viewer with each of these thoughts and then letting you decide for yourself. The actors all did a great job, especially Bardem and Lola Duenas as Rosa. There were very vivid daydream sequences that I must admit felt and looked the same way it does when you fly in a dream. The film isn't perfect however, and there were a couple lines(strong ones at that) that should have been placed separately in the film; a scene with a chasing boy didn't work as well as it should have, mainly because it was bound to happen.All in all, "The Sea Inside" was an honest and daring depiction of a man's quest for death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful, Achingly Beautiful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sea Inside" is a refreshingly subtle polemic, if there can be such a thing. It has a clear agenda -- arguing in favor of humans' right to die with dignity -- and it makes only the most minor attempt to address all sides of the right to die controversy, but it never preaches or gets bogged down in treacly sentimentality. It's as clear headed and articulate as its protagonist, Ramon Sampedro, a quadriplegic who fought, and ultimately lost, to have his right to end his own life recognized by the Spanish government.Javier Bardem plays Sampedro in a simply beautiful performance, all the more astounding given the fact that for most of the movie Bardem must act from the neck up only. His Ramon is a man full of great reserves of love and compassion for his family members and friends, but he's also single minded in purpose; he wants to die, and he doesn't want anyone, no matter how well meaning, to stand in his way of that objective. Therefore, we almost always support Ramon in his goal, but don't always approve of his methods, or the way he treats others around him, particularly the young woman who ultimately assists him in his suicide, who's on the rebound from a failed marriage and attaches herself rather desperately to Ramon, and whom the movie suggests Ramon would take emotional advantage of if it would help him achieve his goal. But the movie's point is that Ramon is being forced to play by rules created by a bunch of people who know nothing about what it's like to be in his situation, so he can be forgiven if he breaks those rules.There's much to enjoy in "The Sea Inside" even if you are strongly opposed to assisted suicide. It really is a poignant, beautiful movie, and it resonates with compassion. I remember the small controversy that surrounded this movie and "Million Dollar Baby," another film about assisted suicide that came out in the same year, and audiences' calls to boycott these films because they espoused a point of view the audiences were against. I can understand why someone would not agree with the argument in "The Sea Inside," but I can't imagine how they could have a blanket objection to watching the film, when it's so full of warmth and examples of decent human kindness.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sea within the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen "Whose life is it anyway?" (1981) and now "Mar adentro" (2004). I loved both films while they unspooled their entertaining sexist jokes in the morbid background of a male quadriplegic requesting euthanasia. Evaluated for their witty content, the American film wins outright over the other. Evaluated for philosophical content, the Spanish film is an outright winner in contrast to the Hollywood product. The American film entertained for the duration of the film; the Spanish film entertains you by requiring you to reflect on the various segments of the film, long after the film ends.People who know Spanish aver that the correct translation of the title would be "Into the sea". If you have seen the film, the deep philosophical, theological and social undercurrents of the screenplay make the less accurate title "The sea within," more appropriate.What were the aspects of the film that made me reflect on it? The unflinching support of a small family to care for a cripple for 27 years is unusual in Western society. This is powerfully understated throughout the film. The viewer is witness to mute actions of love from the family for the quadriplegic but only on a few occasions is the subject discussed.This brings up the strengths of the awesome screenplay (Amenabar and Mateo Gil) that reverts time and time again to the hills visible from the quadriplegic's bed while the memories of the quadriplegic are those of the sea. The sea is within the mind of the quadriplegic?and quite appropriately the first shot is of the sea, which is soon replaced by the hills.Suicide is theologically a no-no for many. A repentant Judas is not forgiven by the Church because he commits suicide, while all other repenting sinners the world over are supposed to be absolved if they repent. The film, set in Catholic Spain, takes a bold step in including the loud debate between two quadriplegics?one a priest who wants to live and another, a lay man, who does not?separated literally and figuratively by a floor.The power of media is underlined: the role of TV programs and publishing of books. Yet the real outcome is nurtured through love between individuals through direct contact. The end of the film would not be the same in the absence of love. The bonding between the sick and the crippled (physically with Julia and psychologically with Rosa) are contrasted with bonding of the physically whole near family?Manuela and Gene.This is my second Amenabar film?the first was "The others." While "Mar adentro" deals with a thought provoking subject, the brilliance of the young director is underlined in "The others"--a fabulous ghost story, elegantly told. Amenabar and Andrei Zvygintsev ("The Return") are the most promising and talented young filmmakers (both Europeans) today. Amenabar has proved that he can direct great movies, elicit great performances from his actors (Javier Bardem, here. and Nicole Kidman in "The Others"), write good music and pick fine appropriate music of established composers (Puccini, Beethoven, Mozart and Richard Wagner). Like good cognac, the film is best appreciated by reflecting on all its attributes after the repast of viewing the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is very little I can say that hasn't already been said before, but I would like to share my view that this film is magnificent in every respect.The story revolves around the life of the fully paralyzed Ramón Sampedro, played beautifully by Javier Bardem, who wants nothing more than to end his life with dignity. As one other reviewer puts it, the major moral dilemma of the film is balanced on both sides by the fullness of life and the affection shown towards Ramon on the one hand, and his own desire to end life on the other. He considers life to be a living hell, and he is unable to see through the gloom to the beauty around him. There is no spoken intellectual argument for why he shouldn't kill himself - that side of the argument is presented by the tender and warm relationships that spring up around him giving him reasons to live. It seems as though everyone in the film wants him to live except for Ramon himself.The acting, the cinematography, the musical score, the writing - everything is superb. I was especially impressed by the performance of Belén Rueda, who is also one of the screen's great beauties (even at the age of 41).I highly recommend this film and I wish to pay my compliments to the cast and crew for an outstanding production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyway, I was talking about a friend the other day who is struggling with depression, among other things, and the question of suicide came up. It just so happened that I caught the 2005 Oscar winning film, Mar adentro yesterday also. Something came up halfway through and I restarted it from the beginning because I didn't want to interrupt the flow. It was magnificent, and if you have not seen it, you must.Those who visit frequently know I work with the developmentally disabled. I know that the disabled activists were not happy with this film, or with Million Dollar Baby. It is interesting when you think about it. We are constantly reminded to promote choice with out clients, but when that choice goes against what the activists want, they get upset. Sometimes, you just don't want to fight the fight anymore.The Oscar winning film, directed by Alejandro Amenábar, stars Javier Bardem, who some may remember as Felix in Collateral. I remember him as the Cuban poet and novelist, Reinaldo Arenas in Before Night Falls, a superb film for which he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar that he lost to Russell Crowe in Gladiator.The fact-based story concerned a quadriplegic who spent 28 years trying to die. The interaction with his friends and family will cause you to question the wisdom of his decision. Which ever side you come down on is OK, as he points out, for him, "A life without freedom is not a life." I am sure that is what upsets the activists, but it is clear that it is his choice.There is nothing I like better than a movie that makes you think, and this certainly accomplishes that task.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last year and at the dawn of 2006, Alejandro Amenabar's fourth film garnered prestigious prizes all over the world. It collected at least 50 rewards! I can only agree with these rewards. It is perhaps proof positive that the versatile Amenabar is more than ever a filmmaker to follow very closely.An inkling one had already suspected at the screening of "Tesis" (1996) in which he had ventured in the formidable world of the "snuff-movies" (beware French users! "Formidable" doesn't mean "terrific" at all but "dreadful") is that Amenabar doesn't fear to tackle to difficult topics according to different reasons a little like John Frankenheimer in his sixties heyday. Besides, the meandering "Abre Los Ojos" (1997) had a strong resemblance with Frankenheimer's "Seconds" (1966). Both gave startling results. "The Others" (2001) harked back to the Gothic fantastic of the sixties ("the Innocents" 1961, "the Haunting" 1963) and earned Amenabar worldwide recognition. Abetted by an astounding Nicole Kidman, he made us shiver with a minimum of means but a maximum of brilliance.Once again, Amenabar embarked in uncharted waters for him with a delicate topic: melodrama and the right to euthanasia. When one knows that in Spain, the official position of Spanish government about this is adamant, it underlines and reinforces Amenabar's ambitious side. An important part of Spanish population seems to be undetermined facing this problem. In the film, when Ramon strives to heighten public awareness through the publication of his book which sums up his motto: "life is a right, not an obligation", it's a courageous move from him."Mar Adentro" distinguishes itself from Amenabar's three previous works by its change of register. It's a more intimate and placating one but it eventually walks a fine line with these works because it revolves like them around death. It seems that Amenabar found his set of themes. What he had already done in "Abre Los Ojos", he does it again here: he doesn't do what the audience might expect in the treatment of his topic. Where a Hollywood director would have followed a well-defined way while favoring the inevitable case, Amenabar is more astute at this game: he grants it only a minimal importance in his scenario because he knows that Ramon's fight to attain death is already lost at the beginning of the film. Amenabar also appears to take a mischievous delight in referring to codes and conventions of the subject to better divert them through maverick schemes like for example when it comes to feed Ramon the corny chorus that life is worth living. One of the most memorable moments of the film is the conversation between the priest in the kitchen and Ramon in his bedroom with the assistant of the priest as the intermediary point. It is sheer genius and may underline Amenabar's anticlerical spirit which one had already guessed in "the Others".But Amenabar also quietly refuses a good pack of constricting conventions. There's nothing maudlin or morbid in his treatment of Ramon's last years of life and he also excluded useless pathos from his work. He spends the major time of the film, in Ramon's isolated house, a little like in "the Others", surrounded by a green, green country with the sea in the end. A perfect backdrop for his intentions. Obviously, Amenabar was much more interested by what went on in the head of his main protagonist and his relationships with his close relatives."Mar Adentro" is a hymn to life and love. One of Ramon's first inner thoughts, the aerial shot which flies over Spanish country to land on the beach and find Ramon and Julia kissing is a perfect example of it. Amenabar refuses to feel sorry for Ramon's fate and transcends his bedroom as a lively place. Besides, Ramon lived a nearly full life before his accident. He was a sailor and went all around the world. The intensity of his looks, the power of his imagination and his lines with sometimes a deadpan humor are enough to fill the room with an uplifting and lively aura and the film with a lyrical whiff. An amazing contrast for a lucid man who seems to have lost his taste for life. Although he has been standing still in his room for many, many years and despite his wish to die, Ramon is still able to talk about life and to love. I'd like to raise the fact that each of his apparitions is filmed without flashy effects. Julia and Rosa are both enamored with him and will finally understand Ramon's desire through a deep love to him.Still on the plus side, Amenabar's piece of work doesn't cease to surprise the audience through its constant humor which suffuses the whole movie. It could almost be worth the price of admission. And as usual, Amenabar's input in his work is total. He signed the evocative score and used a splendid cinematography. And who else but Mateo Gil could help him to pen the immaculate scenario? Such a seminal piece of work wouldn't be complete without the bunch of actors Amenabar hired. He excels in the directing of actors. Each character's persona fits each of them like a glove. Belén Rueda as a lawyer is far from the Hollywood cardboard character. Lola Duenas is a Rosa full of freshness and vivacity. But render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and to praise Javier Bradem's extraordinary acting.Amenabar's own standpoint on euthanasia eventually remains sitting on the fence and prefers to let the viewer think about this problem. This is the fourth magnum opus in a short but immaculate filmography. So far, the block for "the young prodigy of Spanish cinema" (a flattering but deserved moniker) is an unknown notion to him. If everything is alright for Amenabar and if he manages to keep his self-confidence, imagine the look his career could have in several years. Yes, more power to him!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great drama that doesn't get swamped by fake sentiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sort of movie isn't my thing at all. Normally these dramas are draped in fake sentiment and it leaves me feeling very queasy to say the least. However, I found myself with high hopes for this one because it's directed by one of today's best new directors; Alejandro Amenábar, and after seeing his debut; Tesis, along with the follow-up's Open Your Eyes and The Others, it's obvious that this man knows his stuff. For a movie that deals with the subject of euthanasia, you've got to expect a degree of sentiment; and this movie certainly has more just a degree of it, but the sentiment is never overdone and Amenábar never looks like he's manipulating the audience into the plight of the protagonist. This is the difference between this film; one told by a talented auteur, and the rush of sentiment dramas helmed by auteur's who are less than talented. Amenábar simply presents the plight, gives you a wealth of viewpoints, and it is then up to you to make your mind up about what you think. When it comes to the genuinely touching moments, therefore, we care because we WANT to care, and not because the movie is being forced down our throats.The story is that of Ramón Sampedro, a real-life Spanish man who fought a 30-year campaign for the right to end his life. As you would expect from a story of this nature, the film raises many questions about the value of life and whether it is worth living a life without dignity. The film plays out with a real life-affirming vigour, and there are several instances in the film that really will make you think. If a film can make you look at your own life and get you thinking about important issues, it's obvious that it's doing something right. The film is very bleak in it's approach, but this is offset by the uplifting way that we are able to see the character. Even though his biggest wish is to end his life; we get behind him, and wanting our hero to die is a strange situation for an audience to be in. Javier Bardem gives a great performance as the unfortunate victim, and he heads a very believable cast of actors that give it their all and help to make the film the success that it is. Despite the greatness of this movie, I really would like to see Amenábar return to horror-thrillers for his next flick; but at least he's proved that he can do other types of films too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thinking of the movie as a question poser is a wrong perspective, the way I see it. Mainly because what makes it different and like worthy are storytelling and characters as well as Amenabar's mastery of camera and sound, not the subject being debated.A definite gem is the film's title. So conclusive yet elusive in its nature, that it can but ignite a spark of interest. Mar Adentro, or The Sea Inside, is a strikingly poetic title, that doesn't only reveal part of the essence of life, but also part of its protagonist, played breathtakingly impressive by Javier Bardem. The film itself, despite being a film about death, is filled with life - an amazing paradox which elevates it past melodramatic puddles. Few things are more beautiful than seeing some of the contemporary Spanish and South American film directors at work: on one side of the barricade such as Almodovar and Cuaron, on the other Innaritu. Different styles, with Amenabar reaching toward the first two.</fullReview>

I felt that it was made to belittle others who disagree with assisted suicide. A film with a strong political message needs sympathetic characters on both sides. Ramon, the main character, is not very sympathetic in my opinion. I found that he was very snotty and ungrateful for other people (Rosa, his brother). If he really wants to be respected for his opinion, the least he could do is to respect the opinions of other people.I feel that the film forces the main character on the viewers instead of allowing him to prove himself alone. Yes, it's great to have a likable main character, but this movie just overdoes it. Ramon is never wrong and Ramon never pays for his rude behavior. In fact, it seems as if everyone is apologizing to him for his rude comments.The film was a good idea, but it just didn't work for me.</fullReview>

There are plenty of comedic moments that stop seeming a gloomy tale at all. Javier Bardem is brilliant as the paraplegic Ramon. He doesn't play for pity and Ramon comes across as a likable and funny guy who happens to be left in a position he just cannot cope with. Although sympathetic to his character Bardem isn't afraid to also portray other sides to his character. This makes it more real and means the audience can identify with the character. The supporting cast are great and I especially liked the performance of Lola Duenas as the lonely woman looking to befriend him. The ending is handled well and very emotional so get the hankies ready. I rarely watch films again within a year of watching them the first time but I couldn't help watch it again a couple of months later. For those that don't mind subtitles and enjoy some quality emotional drama this is a real treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The controversial subject matters means that it won't be for all audiences, but if you go in with an open mind you'll find a rewarding film that's well worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sea Inside is a fact based story of ship mechanic Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem) who has spent close to 30 years fighting to earn the right to die with dignity after he was rendered a quadriplegic following a diving accident.One thing that's refreshing about this film is that it didn't feel like a heavy-handed propaganda piece; this film basically just gives the audience an account and also an insight into Ramon's life (post accident). To me the film never felt manipulative, preachy, or sappy and for the most part we're just observing Ramon explaining why he wants to end his life. The screenplay is written in such a way that we're given perspectives from individuals who both support Ramon and are against Ramon, but again neither aspect is heavy-handed and it's all just very beautiful as a whole.The dream sequences provide us with some very impressive visuals, but they also exist to develop Ramon's character; here we have a man whose body is trapped, but his mind is very much free. If we stick with character development then one could also say that it was a good move to give us a bit of back story for Ramon - we're not given much, but there's enough given to make us emotionally involved.Another benefit of good character development and wonderful insight is that when I watched Ramon I didn't pity him as a person, but I pitied his predicament. I can't imagine what it must be like to lead an active life and then to find yourself bed bound and unable to move for 20 odd years. Although the film has pro and anti Euthanasia perspectives throughout its running time, it never over does either aspect and it will certainly leaves the viewer with a lot to think about when the film ends.If you've got an open mind then this is well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The factual story of Spaniard Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem), who fought a thirty-year campaign in favor of euthanasia and his own right to die. The film explores Ramón's relationships with two women: Julia, a lawyer suffering from Cadasil syndrome, who supports his cause, and Rosa, a local woman who wants to convince him that life is worth living.The film is directed by Alejandro Amenábar, who had previously made "Open Your Eyes" and "The Others". This is clearly the most critically acclaimed of the three, but there is no denying that he was consistently releasing great films."The Sea Inside" won the 2004 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, the 2004 Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film, and 14 Goya Awards. Well deserved, and further pushing Javier Bardem into the role of international star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem) became a quadriplegic and ends up battling for the right to die in Spain for 30 years. Julia (Belén Rueda) is a lawyer who helps him in this fight and they fall in love. He befriends Rosa (Lola Due?as) with her kids. She wants him to live.It's a biopic from director Alejandro Amenábar. I love the scenes where Ramón argue with Padre Francisco. Those scenes are electric. It's a movie that needs the conflicts. Javier Bardem is stationary most of the time and it's harder to generate physical energy. He does do some imaginary sequences where he gets up and even flies. They don't really excite me as much. This movie reminds me very much of "Whose Life Is It Anyway?" I wish there are more anger and more conflicts in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beauty inside.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Javier Bardem may just be one of the finest actors of his generation, and his role as a paraplegic fighting for the right to die added another impressive notch to his already eclectic body of work.El Mar Adentro has its share of beautiful moments, and it treated its core issue with sensitivity and intelligence (for the most part). The philosophical aspect of it was insightful, but perhaps underutilized.The direction, acting, and production values were all impressive. I was prepared to give this 8 or 9 stars, along with the dubious ranking of perhaps one of the finest Spanish dramas ever filmed.Unfortunately, the movie ends up shooting itself in the foot by proving to be a little over- directed. What killed it for me was the abundance of irritating montages that killed the flow, and made it seem like the director just wanted to quicken the pace in an easy fashion. Whenever the passage of time was shown with annoying fade in/outs and the maudlin music cut in heavy handedly, it caused me to zone out. It was like watching a hallmark channel version of a paralyzed Rocky Balboa.Other criticisms were the focus of the film. There was the protagonist of Ramon, there was the love triangle between Rosa, Julia, and he. There was the legal angle, Ramon's family, and the moral outrage expressed by characters like the priest. It felt meandering, and what felt like a build up to the court room scene was over in 3 minutes. There was too much attention paid to other characters who, frankly, didn't interest me as much as Ramon. I wish I could have gotten to know him a little better. And did I mention the music was intrusive? But as much as there were parts I resented, there was a lot to admire. One of the most gorgeous scenes was the depiction of Ramon's accident. Amenebar showed that their can be grace in even the most horrid and fateful of moments. Other highlights were Ramon's ability to escape his prison and visit the sea inside, where he visits his fantasies of the women he leaves behind. I only wish the man's imagination had been explored a lot more.Still, a worthwhile watch. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The effective use of symbolism and camera shots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The use of symbolism in the film Mar Adentro adds a deeper meaning to life and inadvertently causes the viewer to reflect upon their own meaning of life. Ramón reveals in the beginning of the film that he wants to die because it is an impossible journey for him to do the simplest things in life, such as touch, answer the phone, and in his case love. The effortless things that are often taken for granted are portrayed in the film when Ramón is on his way to the courthouse. It showed people riding bikes, animals having sex, and multiple windmills blades circulating around, which could easily symbolize that time and life keep passing and moving forward, while he is forced to stay immobile, causing him to want to go against nature and end his life. The deepest symbolic portrayal of life and death was in the end when Rosa and Ramón were admiring the view of the sea; the same sea that gave him his life and that gave him the opportunity to travel the world, but in the same token ideologically took his life away and paralyzed him. Furthermore, in this same scene Rosa's son was sleeping on Ramón and while the child was lying on his stomach it overemphasized his breathing. I interpreted this to symbolize the beginning of life and the ending of life because he was so close to his "dignified death." The portrayal of the youth and innocence of the child sleeping on Ramón while he was awaiting his suicide illustrated the complete life circle and how soon life can end.Not only was the use of symbolism effective, but the different camera shots captured the viewers attention and allowed a deeper connection with the character. For example, the use of extreme close up shots when Ramón was reflecting on his past allows the viewer to feel the depth of his sadness and even agree with his wishes to die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About a Man Who Wants to Die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hated No Country for Old Men. So much, I didn't realize who Javier Bardem was until I saw The Sea Within. I've also been on the edge of suicide, when I was in my 20's.I saw this movie on TV yesterday, with English subtitles which are not perfectly readable because of white background interference, and I'm still living with it. It was on IFC.The entire cast is excellent. The story is absolutely compelling. If you didn't fall in love with Million Dollar Baby, or even if you did, see this movie about euthanasia in present-day Spain. Just the cultural contrasts between Spain and America's "treatment" of people who want to die are astonishingly disturbing and true.But you have a far stronger mind than I, if you think much about Doctor Kervorkian and America's idiocy in regard to euthanasia during this movie. Like the story, the visuals are absolutely compelling. As is the dialogue. As are the scene cuts from the political sphere to the bedside in the home of the quadriplegic who simply wishes to die but can't find anyone who will simply assist him in doing it. Who's been bedridden in the house of his deeply stupid older brother, apparently for 28 YEARS, in Catholic Spain, a country already light years beyond Whatever-America's-religion-is in regard to doctor-assisted-suicides.These times in which we live! I suggest here and now that when America starts providing euthanasia as a health benefit, this movie be among the DVD's provided for viewing by "patients."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Euthanasia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie about euthanasia, I mean in the sense of if it's legitimate or not as a general rule. It's only the dramatic story of a man who becomes quadriplegic after and accident, being able only to move his head, insensitive along his whole body but entirely conscious and very intelligent. He feels he has no life quality that allows him to live with dignity and wants to die. Simply he is not able to put an end to his life by himself alone and needs to be helped and that would create judicial problems to other people. So the movie narrates his battle with judicial authorities to get the necessary authorization to be "killed" which is denied to him. But the movie is not only that. It's full of extremely moving scenes and the dialogues and silences are full of meaning. Through them we feel not only this man's personal drama but also of those who surround him and take care of him and try to help him. Javier Bardem is an excellent actor and does the role of the man who wants to die in a splendid way. But all the other characters are extremely well served by their performers. It's a movie about euthanasia yes but faced as a free individual choice which means that many quadriplegic people may chose to live like that which is also a legitimate choice. It's indeed a masterpiece that touches our hearts to the bottom. I only see a small flaw. In my opinion the introduction of the role of the female lawyer suffering on an incurable degenerative disease is unnecessary in the economy of the story but it doesn't spoil it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you love and kill somebody at the same time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is philosophical, and it deals with this philosophical question in a way that strikes a delicate balance without being too biased or one-sided. "Too" is added because subtly, it can be seen that the author is probably pro-"right to die", in his way of contrasting the right of to choose to die and the right of to choose to live despite her chronic illness.The director has done a great job to express Ramon's inhibitions which make his life lifeless - the fantasy scenes in which he flew to the sea and in which he kissed Julia are nothing but romantic, lyrical and surreal. Emotions is another weapon the director employs to make this movie unique and touching. I am deeply impressed by the way the emotions and relationships between and his family members (espcially between Ramon and his nephew) were laid out - very naked, genuine, very moving.The ending is open to all - to let everyone think about all these moral questions - What should society and the law do to this group of helpless people? Can you love somebody and kill him at the same time? Should the right to die be protected as the right to live? Is life any life at all without freedom? And is life filled with love from your family and acquaintances but with no love from yourself worth living? A very thought-provoking film cautiously and delicately crafted out by superb acting, wonderful directing and enlightening scripts, and without too much individualism and bias. It is you the audience who decide ultimately what is right, what is wrong. A worthy Oscars winner. A beautiful must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performance of Javier Bardem in the central role of the quadriplegic, Ramon Sampedro is nothing short of amazing. I cannot imagine what the intense preparation was like.Based on a true story, the film addresses the dilemma of euthanasia, particularly when the loved ones surrounding him do not wish it and value the life of the person. Very, very difficult.The direction and cinematography and soundtrack work together beautifully to evoke the limited life of Ramon, a life that can only be lived in his imagination which soars both in his writing and in his use of language. Women fall in love with him. But he is emphatic that true love will aid and abet him in accomplishing what he cannot do on his own - terminate his life.How this all transpires is the core of the movie. Not surprisingly, it won the Best Foreign Film award at the Oscars in 2005 and many other prestigious awards as well.Engrossing. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure that when people see that this film is the story of a man's twenty-eight year fight for the right to end his life, in the manner in which he saw fit, people might think it would be a depressing experience. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is not the story of a man's death. It is the story of a man's life, and the obstacles he confronted. Clearly, his was not the life he chose, rather it was the life he endured. Yet, this man was loved, and he loved, if not his life, the people in his life. The story was beautifully told. The photography was so lovely and inviting that I found myself immersed in the images. The portrayals were extraordinary. Every player in the film pulled me to their character to a degree that I could feel for all of them. I can only think of one criticism. The film was long. Yet, there were so many more things I wanted to know about the main character, his family and his friends. I strongly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth the effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I've wanted to see this film for some time now, I was also in a way dreading it. I always feel that way with "heavy" films that deal with subject matters that in a way make me think too much about my own mortality and existence. It's so much easier sometimes to live through life without having to think too much. Even about twenty minutes into it, I just wanted to turn it off and really just stop there forever. Ramon Sampedro, a quadriplegic, fights for his right to die with dignity.Ramon is a man surrounded by life. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever truly comprehend his wish to die... it never really bothered me that he wanted it, but I personally cannot fathom the idea under logical terms. What life is for him is different from me, and different from my neighbor or the President. It's the one thing in the world that is so real, but so abstract and inconceivable all at once. Still, I can't think of many other characters on the screen that I've held so much respect for as him. It's not even a conflict, I can't understand, but I understand his understanding so to speak. This film is so much about life, the imagery here is beautiful. Although based on a true story, the idea of the sea and how it's played up in imagery and dialogue here is astounding. I can't find the specific quote, but to paraphrase "The sea gave me life, and the sea took my life". It sums it all up, and beyond the context of this film the sea has always been this bringer and taker of life in mythology and literature. Nearly every creation myth I have heard begins in the sea, and quite a few apocalyptic ones say of the sea taken back the land. I also thought there was a brilliance in the men who surrounded Ramon, their presence seems to indicate in itself the stages of life. I'm sure you know the riddle, "What has four legs in the morning, two at noon and three in the evening?", it's of course man. Although not a baby, we have three walks of life in Ramon's nephew, brother and father. A young man, a middle aged one and the elderly father. This film that's about "death" is more about life as I see it.Although I wouldn't say this is a perfect film it has a lot going for it. The acting, I think a lot of it here is good, but Javier Bardem as Ramon is just wow. It's all in the face, and you honestly just fall in love with him. He's a man who inspires life, although he wants to shed his own. The cinematography and editing is excellent, one scene that really hit me hard was when Ramon is telling of the day of the accident. We go in a dream-like flashback that drifts from first to third person perspective. We are him as he jumps and then, we're out of the body as we see him hit the bottom, break his neck and then float in the water. This is mixed together with a narration, and he says that his life flashed before his eyes. The interviewer is looking through some old photos as she asked what did he see, he never answers. We just see these snapshots of his life, cut in with him drowning. It almost reduced me to tears, one of the most powerful scenes I've seen in recent years.One of the most powerful films I've seen in a long time, and honestly probably one of the best of this new century I've seen so far. I'm extremely happy I decided in the end to watch this one, it was well worth my time and effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>U.S. title "The Sea Inside" - Wonderful story about controlling your destiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on a true story about Ramon Sampedro, a quadriplegic Spaniard who, in his early 20s, suffered a tragic diving accident beginning a 28-year odyssey to find and then control his destiny. Ramon is played by Javier Bardem who creates more life for his character than most with working appendages. Chilean, Alejandro Amenábar, who is probably best known in the U.S. for The Others, directs the film. Rarely is a film made where every actor and scene are so brilliantly united that one can't help find themselves near the hearts of everyone who comes in contact with Ramon. The Sea Inside is so richly written that every single line of dialogue warms your senses. Within the first few minutes of viewing this film, you will be transformed from your seat and find yourself engaged in Ramon's life and desires.For anyone who feels the best films are made inside U.S. borders, you may be closing your eyes to an entire world of wonderful cinema! Go see The Sea Inside and within minutes you will appreciate what the world has to offer.</fullReview>

I also think it deals very gracefully with the central issue of euthanasia.This film is very personal in that it doesn't push a point of view on the viewer but instead asks us to make up our own minds on the subject.The director could easily have gone much further in showing the suffering and hardship of Ramón's life as a quadriplegic to reinforce the reasoning of his choice but the decision not to go down this road added an extra sense of credibility in my opinion.All we are asked to do is respect Ramón Sampedro's right to make his own informed decision in spite of our personal views. We are not asked to judge if a decision like this is right or wrong.A wonderful wonderful film, highly recommended.</fullReview>

Afterwards his life feels empty, his relationships with women are unsatisfying because he is paralyzed up to his head. He wants to end his life with dignity and fought the right to die if you already have one leg in the grave.He gets compassion from two different kind of women who support strong-minded Ramón on his aim to get to his ultimate goal.The Music which is composed by the director Alejandro Amenábar himself reminds me of those lively tunes of Highlands. I was captured in front of the powerful music. We want more!!! Sanpedro's story reminds us what is important. To know who we are and what we want. We shouldn't be afraid to speak what's on our minds! I salute the courageous Ramón who was brave enough to stand on his ground. People in the same situation can learn about this man but that does not necessarily mean all paralyzed people want to die.Two thumbs up!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Sea Inside' presents us with some interesting oppositions about a controversial matter which is one of today's biggest liberal beliefs. That belief is that people control their own lives, which includes the choice to end life support for the reason of not suffering. Usually directors take an approach to this matter by throwing one-sided accusations about the matter in hopes to change everyone's mind. However, this movie does not preach liberal views, but rather beautifully captures one man's life and portrays his pain and suffering.Javier Bardem (Oscar-nominee for "Before Night Falls") is heart-aching in his portrayal of a quadriplegic with the heart of gold. The supporting cast is also flawless as they both oppose and support Ramon (Bardem)through his struggle and decision of euthanasia. As Ramon's imagination takes him to places he can never reach, he feels isolated and alone being strapped to a bed, living in what seems foreign flesh.Director Alejandro Amenabar ("The Others") chooses the most beautiful scenery to portray the now worn-out man's childhood life. Also writing the screenplay and composing the theme, Alejandro brilliantly puts together a realistic approach to one of our society's biggest debates. One key scene at the end of the movie shows the complexity of both Alejandro's ability to write and direct as well as Jabier Bardem's genius performance.The fact that this movie is based on a true story is all the more emotionally painful. Definitely makes the movie all the more harder to watch. The completely gut-wrenching problem this one man faces sends waves of emotion to the viewer. A key scene shows just how painful life can be, as Ramon's father sits by his empty bed in complete anguish and shock. This scene juxtaposes another key scene in which Ramon's whole family try to support him as he makes his final decision.Utterly beautiful, and painfully realistic, "The Sea Inside" is definitely not a movie for the faint of heart. It takes a look at one of society's biggest problems and creates an immense aura of honesty around it. For anyone who knows the power of dilemma, this movie captures that in an almost surreal way. This is a movie that shows us the life of a man who's both full of life and lifeless. The inevitable fact still remains: life ends for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how wonderfully Javier Bardem portrays Ramón Sampedro in this touching movie about the quadriplegic Spaniard's fight for the right to die. This is a man who has resigned himself to his condition but in the process has gained the passion for dying, and yet he still cannot help but care about the lives of those around him. This is a flawed man, but an essentially good one who only wants dignity and sees that the only way to obtain it is through dying. Javier Bardem is Ramón Sampedro fully and completely and it is a joy to watch him work.The movie itself is also very good; it makes clear Ramón's beliefs, but seems to insist that this is his case and not that of all quadriplegics. Others may feel differently about living in this condition, but this film is a chronicle of Ramón's feelings about the situation. It does not take a stand on the issue itself but instead shows you this man's plight and the sound reasons behind his plans to undo it; in doing that, the movie challenges its audience to think for themselves and consider what they might have done in Sampedro's place.It is a sad and emotional movie, but there is also humor and joy to be found here too. Though it feels long at points, I recommend this movie to anyone interested in this subject or Javier Bardem's acting. It is a wonderful display of both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Joe Cool Review: Mar adentro(The Sea Inside)(2004)Starring: Javier Bardem as Ramón Sampedro, Belén Rueda as Julia, Lola Due?as as Rosa and Mabel Rivera as Manuela SampedroPlot: A man who has been a quadriplegic for twenty eight years wants to die and fights for his right to be euthanized. The story focuses on all the various opinions of his family and friends and outsiders as he just wants to die with dignity. Based on a real-life story.Openers: First of all, this is either the most depressing or the most inspiring movie I've seen in a very very long time. I'm not quite sure. I'm not going to get into my views of euthanasia, because that would make this review somewhat biased. I'm just concerned with the movie itself.The Good: Which, it was a fantastically done movie. You feel an emotional bond with a large portion of the characters, and regardless of your own views you'll find yourself seeing why they have the point of view that they do. For example, his brother does *not* want him to commit suicide. He gives reasons like that he would shame the family but you know it's because he loves him and doesn't want to lose him. This tension provides some of the more emotional moments of the movie. The acting here was extremely well done. You wouldn't think it'd take a whole lot to play a quadriplegic, but Javier Bardem does very well and makes you connect with his character, a man who had a wonderful life but had everything take a turn for the worst. The supporting cast all play their roles well, with Belén Rueda as Julia being the most sympathetic, as she has a terminal illness which causes her to suffer almost as much as Ramon.The Bad: There's not much wrong with the production of this movie per se. I would have appreciated more development of some of the minor characters that took care of Ramon, like Manuela. She seemed to be just there and her opinions or back story weren't explored enough for my liking. The movie is also depressing but that's not a flaw really. Just helps with the emotion.The Ugly: The priest character was very annoying. That was his purpose of course but damn I hate people with their own agendas who feel it's their right to interfere with the lives of others. He did help in providing a humorous moment in the movie(and for a movie like this there practically had to be some humor, in my opinion).Final Verdict: The Sea Inside is a very well done movie with both an emotional story and developed characters who the viewer will bond with very quickly. For a movie about a guy who wants to commit suicide, it actually has a healthy dose of humor and romance in addition to the main story, which only helps it. I highly recommend this one.Rating: ****1/2 of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mar adentro overrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Mar Ardentro and felt that I had to comment on this film. Euthanasia is a difficult topic in any field and unfortunately is can sometimes distort the true value of a movie. Many people have raved about the excellent cast and it's beautiful imagery/camera-work. Certainly Javier Bardem is an actor that brings something extra to each film he makes. To say that he encompasses the real Sampredo is a little silly since I don't think that any of the reviewers have known Sampredo personally. To lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed doesn't constitute a 'perfect' performance. Bardem just does what he does well...and that's it. The camera-work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself lacks to deliver. Sampredo here is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that he leaves his loving family behind and marries a woman that he only seeks out when the other will not help him in his quest for a dignified death. Now I'm not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia. The problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it. The movie's subject is so strong that you're almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter. I find it a weakness for the movie -unintentionally- portrays Sampredo as a unsymphatetic character. Someone who is much smarter then his family as portrayed in the simple cousin that doesn't "get" the double layered poem directed towards him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because HE thinks his life is undignified. A scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the "wrong" choice ending up in a far state of dementia thus indicating that Sampredo's choice was the right one. The woman that constantly seeks him out is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by Sampredo when she agrees to help him die. These choices make Sampredo into a calculated figure no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. Argumentive I would say it doesn't convince fully and I kinda think that Amenabar didn't intend on adding this unbalanced element in his film. For a young director it's still an impressive film and it certainly has it's strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo for instance). The camera-work IS impressive and the film is well acted. But 10 out of 10...no the movie doesn't reach that excellence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mar adentro is a serious film about euthanasia. That pretty much says it all. If you've never given the subject much thought, you should check out this one as it draws a textbook example of the moral dilemma, clearly taking sides with the protagonist.If, however, you have thought about this subject (maybe even seen a movie or too about it) and have a clear answer to the problem, there will be no moral revelations here.Substance notwithstanding, the film definitely has style on its side, drawing magnificent portraits of the Galician landscape and an excellent performance out of star Javier Bardem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mar adentro" (called "The Sea Inside" in English) tells the true story of Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem), who was incapacitated in a diving accident when he was very young. He was forced to spend the rest of his life bed-ridden. Sampedro finally decided that he wished for them to end his life so that he would not have to go on suffering. Naturally, there was a controversy about this.However, the movie focuses more on Sampedro's relationships with his loved ones, and looked at who supported his decision and who didn't. Seeing how he suffered, it is impossible not to sympathize with his desires. The movie is also important because it brings up the whole issue of when it is acceptable to take a life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film all focused on death (a fearful word). But after I finished watching the movie, I was not depressed but high-spirited. Life is precious indeed. But how to live is the point. Without experience, I cannot know how painful Ramon felt. But according to my knowledge, paralysation is definitely a horrible disease. Death became his tireless pursuing, after Ramon made up his mind.As time passed, Remond never gave up his faith. In fact Ramon love his family very much. Just look at his parting from his brother's house in the end. That really was heart-breaking moment. Nobody can deny it.Finally Ramon realized his dream. I felt happy for him. I really respect Ramon's choice. Everyone should have the right to decide one's life.The film fully deserved the best foreign film (Oscar). Javier Bardem played Ramon so good that if he had won the Oscar award (best actor) I would not be surprised. Humorous, charming, firm Ramon is impressive.Ramon, you will always be in my heart. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film with some caution - having recently cared for my terminally ill father. Javier Bardem brings great humour, strength and dignity to his role. We do share his character's awareness of the joys in life and empathise with his decision that he's clearly had enough of what life had to offer him. I certainly shed tears during "The Sea Inside", but not at the end. My experience of being with my father as he died was reflected with remarkable accuracy on the screen - the major difference being that my father had to endure two weeks of being unable to eat and days of morphine-eased suffering before his inevitable passing."The Sea Inside" shows there is the potential for great beauty and joy in life, and nothing to fear in death. The audience is forced to consider there own attitudes to the right to leave this life with minimum pain and with maximum dignity. It's also a very beautiful looking film, with some scenes that literally take your breath away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Full of Life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sea Inside, directed by Alejandro Amenábar, tells the true and controversial story of Ramón Sampedro, a paralyzed man who fights for euthanasia to take his own life. Needless to say, not all agree with his decision, including many of his friends and family, along with some other key figures.Sampedro is played brilliantly by Javier Bardem, and his every word is convincing and vivid. His imagination continues to thrive even as he wishes for death and longs to experience such an event. However, Bardem's character is far from one-dimensional, unlike the main character in other bio-pics, such as Kinsey. Writers Amenábar and Gil give so much life (ironic, isn't it?) to Sampedro in the material they provide, that we cannot help to sympathize with Sampedro, whether we agree with his actions or not.The film's story is of little interest compared to the vivacious characters Amenábar portrays. Belén Rueda plays Julia, a beautiful and troubled woman who is Sampedro's lawyer. The development of her relationship with Sampedro is beautiful and artistic, and the film only becomes more beautiful when Julia discovers Ramón's magnificent poetry. Lola Due?as plays Rosa, another influential woman in Sampedro's life, who wishes to be Ramón's friend, but who initially alienates him. Her troubles with her children and the men in her life constantly bring her back to Ramón, that he may comfort and console her.The members of Ramón's family also are very alive, and play their individual roles gracefully and uniquely. There are no significant one-dimensional characters in this film, which is a rarely-experienced wonder when it comes to film. The dialogue of the characters help develop them, making them real and filling Sampedro's words with wisdom. Going along with the beautiful words is beautiful camera work by Amenábar and cinematographer Aguirresarobe.The only problem I had with the film was its over-dramatization. The film works best when its subtle, not when there's quick-paced music and yelling and sobbing. The tears are more real when they flow silently, the music more moving when playing softly, and the dialogue more introspective when whispered and gasped.As far as political messages go, I feel that the film stays pretty balanced, but as Sampedro continues to have a profound and wonderful effect on the lives of others, the viewer is left wondering how the death of this man can possibly have a good effect on the world he leaves behind. Maybe it is the sound of the sea inside Sampedro that drowns out the sound of the voices of those desperate for hope.See it.Final Grade: A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Beautiful Moments, But Frustratingly Shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: This review contains spoilers."Mar Adentro" / "Sea Inside" contains some beautiful moments, and the cast is terrific, but the film, which wants to talk about big, deep issues, is frustratingly shallow over all. It's almost as if the director and screenwriter are afraid of getting in too deep, over their heads.The beautiful moments: Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem) tells his nephew Javi (Tamar Novas) that some day he will deeply regret making disparaging comments about his feeble grandfather.Ramon, a bedridden quadriplegic, imagines himself airborne, able to fly over the sere and steep countryside to the sea. "Nessun Dorma" plays as he flies.A young man, suddenly stricken by sentiment, runs after a van retreating from him. An old man ponders the belongings of his departed son.The cast is utterly wonderful. The actors have a substance and reality to them that seems beyond American film actors today. They seem *real.* Lola Duenas, as Rosa, an emotionally immature, working class woman; Mabel Rivera, as Manuela, Ramon's sister-in-law, who gives her life to Ramon's care; and Ramon's brother and grandfather, are so real that when they are on screen, you feel as if you are watching a documentary, and these are the real people involved in the dramatized events.Javier Bardem, one of the greatest actors working today, is flawless as Sampedro, a character I grew to thoroughly dislike. A brave performance.Of course, Ramon Sampedro was a real Spanish quadriplegic who worked for the legal right to have help in ending his own life.So far so good.But the film, ultimately, is shallow. It shies away from any serious exploration of the deeper issues of the euthanasia of quadriplegics.I worked with the dying for many years, and, later, I was stricken by a paralyzing and torturous illness, and have had much opportunity to explore the question of euthanasia and suicide from many angles.In the film, Sampedro insists that he is making a decision for himself alone, and that his decision has no import to anyone else. "I'm not talking about quadriplegics; I'm talking about Ramon Sampedro," he says.That's balderdash, and, more importantly, no one in the film is allowed to disagree with him. In spite of the excellent cast, this is Ramon's show, from start to finish. Just as, as depicted in the film, everyone dances around Ramon, the movie's intellectual point revolves, relentlessly, around him, without ever breaking free of his loud and egotistical orbit.Sampedro proves his own argument false. He poses, naked, for television cameras, so that people can see how, in his estimation, pathetic the body of a quadriplegic is. He commits suicide *on camera.* He takes his case to court, though we all know that euthanasia goes on everyday, in quiet agreements between doctors, patients, and families.So, so much for the idea that this is all just about one man.In any case, no man is an island, and a very public statement that one quadriplegic finds his own situation so unworthy as to be something that must be escaped from at any cost is going to have an impact on other quadriplegics' lives. It is a fact that within the memory of people alive today, it was government policy in the most powerful nation in Europe to destroy "life unworthy of life," and any movie that announces itself as addressing this issue has got to take that on."Sea Inside" does not. Rather, it uses an unattractive quadriplegic priest to serve as Sampedro's punching bag. Sampedro shouts the priest down with infantile comments like, "You'd like to burn me at the stake!" I mean, come on. This childish, Christophobic nonsense is the best intellectual answer the film can offer to the position that even paralyzed people's lives are worthy? Ironically, Sampedro never admits that his life is richer and more blessed than many others. People love him. He has family. He is a published poet. He's a national celebrity activist, rewriting the law. Women fall all over him. Poor Ramon! Look -- I know what it's like to be imprisoned in flesh that won't obey. I respect what Sampedro went through, and I don't have the answer to the ethics or morality around suicide / euthanasia, but I know that this film not only didn't supply the answer, it didn't even explore the question.The seal of the film's cheap, one-sided approach comes in the film's final scene. Sampedro had had an affair with Julia (Belen Rueda), a married lawyer who suffering from a degenerative disease.Julia agrees to kill herself with Sampedro. This promise gives him the first hope he's had so far in the film. Julia then abandons Sampedro, not even having the decency to blow him off in person, but by sending him a note.Sampedro is crushed, sobbing in the night, to be nursed by Manuela. We feel great sympathy for what is otherwise an arrogant man.After Sampedro dies, in a gratuitous scene, Julia is shown to be a ravaged, simple-minded shell of her former self. She can't even remember who "Ramon" was. Gene (Clara Segura), her fellow euthanasia activist who comes to visit her, looks at Julia as if she has two heads. It's a very cheap and nasty piece of acting. "Ew!" Segura seems to be saying. "This is what happens when you let yourself go to pot, rather than killing yourself when you are young, beautiful and fit!" It's a cinematic sentiment worthy of Leni Riefenstahl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important in general, bit of a bore for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from a country with some of the most liberal euthanasia laws (which I support) in the world, there's a huge mind-gap to be made into Catholic Spain to truly understand the controversy this movie surrounds, and the political sensitivity of the subject in it. It really takes time and effort to, to put it popular, get what 'all the fuss is about'.Fortysomething Ramon is clinged to his bed ever since a horrible accident in his late teens. The only thing he can do is move his head, talk and, most importantly, think. He's being nursed all these years by his sister-in-law, who lives with him, her husband, their father and her son.The story begins when Ramon hires a lawyer for his wish to die, Julia, who herself is suffering from a deadly decease. Herself, pro euthanasia activist Gene and a local woman who falls in love with him (Rosa), change his life in ways he never could have imagined. But his wish to die stands, and Ramon wants it done in a legal way to protect those who will help him do it.Instead of what it might sound like, Mar Adentro isn't a 'legal' movie, in which Ramon has his all-defining day in court. Although such a Hollywood film wouldn't work on this issue (it's too serious a matter for that), I sometimes during the movie wished the makers would have gone more 'into the controversy' (if you know what I mean), instead of focusing solely on Ramon. The fact that for long moments in the movie, nothing really 'happens' (oh boy this must sound horrible), makes you lose focus. Another problem for me is that we never really 'get' the other characters of the movie, they're just 'there' to get the story around Ramon right.Mar Adentro at times is a touching film, and undoubtedly an important movie in Spain and other countries, but my thoughts were wandering more than once during this picture. Without wanting to deny the importance of this issue, a little bit of extra pace might have served this movie well. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well acted but very manipulative film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood movies are always criticized for being simplistic, manipulative. This film is all that wrapped in a European package. The film is really a 2 hour pro euthanasia advertisement. It is not at all a bad film, it is well acted and has some truly great cinematography, but it has an agenda. It wants to present only one side of the euthanasia debate. it is about Ramon Sampedro a Galician that was fighting for his right to die in Spain. He was left a quadriplegic, leaving him immobile for almost 30 years. The film wants us to identify with him, he wants to die because he has no quality of life, he is imprisoned and wants to be free. Ones opinion of this film can depend on ones feelings on the touchy subject that it portrays. I personally haven't completely decided where I stand on the subject, so I went in thinking that the film would present the situation and let the audience decide. It does not, it presents the situation in such a way that I felt that I was being beat on the head. It is disappointing because the performances are good, especially Javier Bardem who plays Sampedro. The film wants so much to canonize this man that it seems that he isn't human. He treats people badly, he seems to know more about everything because of his affliction. Where the film goes totally wrong for me is in is portrayal of the other side of the issue. Sampedro's brother, who is against his wish to die is presented as an idiot, an authoritarian, funny thing is that his wife and son take care of Sampedro. There is also a scene in where a priest who is also paralyzed, wants to talk to Sampedro, the film treats this scene as comedy, it really felt insulting that the film would disregard someone that is in a similar situation to Sampedro's with such disdain because he chooses to live. One might argue that the film is about one man, but no, this film wants to make a statement from beginning to end, it is NOT objective.It may seem that I hated the film. I didn't, it is well acted and does have touching moments, but I felt so manipulated into being pro euthanasia that I was mad at the end. What had the makings of an intelligent treatment of a very difficult subject, comes off as heavy handed one sided soap opera. Still it is worth seeing, because of the performance by Bardem.

		<shortDescription>The Sea Inside</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Alejandro Amenábar (The Others), I noticed the leading actor and the premise of the film, and the fact the critics give it five out of five, so I was definitely going to give it a go. Based on the true story, this sees Spaniad Ramón Sampedro (Golden Globe nominated Javier Bardem, best known for his Oscar winning role in No Country For Old Men) fighting a 30-year campaign to win the right to end his life, i.e. euthanasia, and die with dignity. When he was slightly younger he became fully paralysed (none of his body, besides his head, can move) from diving into a shallow bit of water and breaking his neck. The film explores his relationship with two women, lawyer Julia (Belén Rueda) who supports his cause, and Rosa (Lola Due?as) who is trying to convince him that life is worth living. Despite wishing to die, he taught everyone he encountered the meaning, value and preciousness of life, and though he could not move himself, he had the uncanny ability to move others. Also starring Mabel Rivera as Manuela, Celso Bugallo as José, Clara Segura as Gené, Joan Dalmau as Joaquín, Alberto Jiménez as Germán and Tamar Novas as Javi. I will admit I did doze off towards the end, only because it was on at one or something in the morning till three something, but from what I did see, it is a very interesting story, and Bardem does an amazing performance, and I would definitely want to see it again for what I missed, well, and to enjoy what I didn't. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Achievement in Makeup, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic, quiet film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like this are the essence of modern cinema. I am amazing simply by how quiet one finds Mar Adentro. It is measured, calm, and relaxed. Still it is able to incite amazing passion, torment, and emotion beyond what most films are capable. The picture remains bright and vivid, the sets are utilitarian and tonally perfect, the sound design is transparent. Equally impressive are the transitions and picture effects, which link scenes with a fluidity that binds the theme from scene to scene. Amenabar, who did the score as well as half the writing and the film's direction, is an auteur in the truest sense. He has a grand vision for the work, and it shines. His biggest star is definitely Bardem, who gives the best performance I've seen since Bruno Ganz in Der Untergang. Fabulous work.On a side note, I recently had the opportunity to attend a screening of this film. I brought a friend, who was hesitant due to the subject matter. She did not want to "be depressed" by such a dismal theme. However, she wound up loving the film, finding it to be completely full of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Oscarizada" movie by Amenábar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His fourth film, the Alejandro Amenábar's "Sea Inside" (2004) awarded, means one more turn of nut in that obsession to control all the aspects of the reality. The death is presented here as part of the life, as something on what can be decided and is chosen by Ramón Sampedro because he says he does him more free; thing that ?as he writes the philosopher Juan Pablo Serra- "is false, because that would only do he more autonomous, in his case, to decide that his life is not worthy, when in fact the dignity is something that is had and not that he decides. But is that the first premise -the death as part of the life- is also false, for he already showed us Wittgenstein in his Tractatus that the death is not an event of the life, nobody lives of the death".However, Amenábar states that "the movie is or intends to be, first of all, a trip to the life and to the death. A trip to Galicia, to the sea and to the interior world of Ramón Sampedro". What yes is true is that the Galician quadriplegic has been personified brilliantly for Javier Bardem, with a big emotive role full of overflowing friendliness; that myth's a person who, after 28 years of irreversible illness, looked for help to finish with his life. Judging the decision taken by Sampedro -the Spanish judgeship did not make it either- does not correspond to me. And not dictating here either all the ethical aspects of his act, nor those that they have to see with a transcendent dimension of the life and of the death. However, as a specialist said, it "was not euthanasia -if this is understood in the sense of precipitating the end of the existence to avoid sufferings-, but of a suicide assisted", for little after the debut the friend that brought the cyanide to her would appear. Even then, the attractive image which Amenábar has wanted to give to his protagonist has to be stated; for he does not appear as a person that decides to die, but as a happy being, serene, conquering..., confronted with the Justice of toga, unpleasant and intransigent, and with an authoritarian Roman Catholic Church, which caricatures with an almost surrealist speech. This creative posture does not benefit his thesis.And neither the sentimental tone with which he conceives some scenes, full of normativeness and lyricism, that have a clear effect in the spirit of the spectator. A public that is sat dragged by the beautiful images of the natural scenarios and the deep humanity of the characters, all too perfect. In this sense, the same Amenábar recognizes his artistic manipulation: "For dramatic reasons, and to condense in those two hours what was the experience of Ramón, characters have appeared and others have disappeared. The character of Julia, for example, is a compendium of several women. One of the things that more surprised me of Ramón is that it was said that he had a harem of women to his around. Julia summarizes the women that fell in love with him when. On the other hand quadriplegic was already, the nephew, Javi, has to do with the real nephew, but have incorporated experiences of the nieces to him. Those changes allow the narration to be more fluid and more effective"."Sea Inside", undoubtedly has great formal perfection, besides a surrounding score -music written also by Amenábar-, with a song of Luz Casal that it intends to transmit a message of life and optimism. We are in the face of a work of remarkable aesthetic category, that contains a singing to the life and also to the death. On this last aspect, the Spanish filmmaker would pronounce himself like this: "I think that yes there is a positioning in the film, but we have wanted for both options to be reflected. But I yes, I am in favor. I can understand Ramón and set at his side". To such a purpose, the director has conceived an interview invented between a fictitious Father Jesuit and Sampedro that, for Manichean, subtracts credibility to his argumentation.With everything, the public has thrown himself to see "Sea Inside". And when for its hard subject it should be minor, the authors have managed to make it tremendously commercial by overcoming the suffering and to manipulate the real history skilfully. While, Alejandro Amenábar, sacrificing the rigor, justifies himself: "I wanted to make a movie of those that arrive to the heart of the people". Even he has captivated the members of the Academy Awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ramon has been a quadriplegic for nearly thirty years. He broke his neck when diving into a shallow pool of water. Ever since the accident he has wished he died that day and has fought since to commit suicide. He has fought against the law on euthanasia but has been denied the right to take his life. As he is bed ridden and cant move an appendages, no one will help him due to the criminal charges that will arise. His brother Jose does not want his brother to die, constantly trying to tell Ramon that life is worth living; no matter what. Ramon is taken care of by Jose wife Manuela; who agrees that Ramon has the right to end his life. A friend of Ramon Gene is fighting his legal battle, trying to have the courts grant him the right to his euthanasia. He has asked for the extra help of another lawyer; Julia. She understands Ramon and his circumstance, as she suffers from a degenerate disease; suffering from strokes. She at times has contemplated ending her life but has kept on fighting.When a woman Rosa she a news report on Ramon, she becomes interested in his fight; but for different reasons. She trys to make Ramon see that life is worth living, though her life is falling apart, being a single mother of two children and just losing her job. Rosa becomes infatuated with Ramon, but has denied himself the right to love, pushing everyone away; he's married to death, not to life.The Sea Inside is a great moving drama about life and death and the fight for one mans right to control his life. The topic of euthanasia is always a hard subject to talk about; its hard to say whether a person has the right to commit suicide when there are people involved in a criminal act. But this doesn't focus on the legal side, but more onto the human drama that drives this. Ramon is so sure about his death, creating such a morbid feeling that effect everyone. But though there is this emotion of death in The Sea Inside, there is this affirmation of life at the core of it.Alejandro Amenábar direction is great and the cinematography is just amazing; its so bright and colourful for this tale of death. All the acting is great. Javier Bardem brought much dignity to Ramon, but the best is Belén Rueda as Julia. Her character is so strong yet so fragile, always having to rebuild her life after one of her strokes, constantly having to learn to walk again and again.The Sea Inside is a great moving drama about the wonders of life and the world of death.</fullReview>

It takes you on a journey that shows the beauty of life, the beauty of death, and the beauty of life in death's presence.The remarkable element of this movie is the relationships it shows between Ramon and each family member/friend. They all relate to his hopes and his struggle differently.The cast is amazing. Javier Bardem was incredible, and was very well supported by everyone else.The most powerful scene, that will indeed stay with me are when Javier was leaving his home to go with Rosa. The brief shot of the father sitting by the empty bed was hard hitting to me, and the actors who played his family were especially powerful in this scene.The movie does a wonderful job of finding the humor in death, and in life for that matter. Sometimes these issues are just way too hard to handle if we can't find the humor.The writing of the movie is so natural. There are wonderful conversations that are just beautiful to listen to. It's hard with movies that are so powerful to always have a naturalness to them.Will be buying this movie soon, and watching it again even sooner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Again , Another Great Performance by Javier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Javier Bardem is a gift to the screen and the art of acting. Bardem puts on an excellent performance as Ramon Sompedro, a quadriplegic, who is dealing with the complexities surrounding euthanasia and the right to "die with dignity." A great supporting cast brings this very controversial topic a sense of substance and reality. Multiple approaches to the "right to die" argument are cleverly interspersed throughout this film. If you like Javier's acting in this role, you must check out "The Dancer Upstairs", directed by John Malkovich. Javier put his bets foot forward in every role he plays and gives each performance 110% effort. Don't be surprised to see this man win Best Actor in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you, Mr. Bardem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sea Inside is an imperfect masterpiece. It tells the story of a quadriplegic's heroic quest to die with dignity. With The Sea Inside, Alejandro Amenbar has made his most mature and ambitious picture to date. Thesis was an excellent debut, particularly considering the miniature budget and Amenbar's youth at the time of release. Open Your Eyes was good -mostly for being a prominent showcase for Spanish beauty Penelope Cruz- but like it's horrid American remake, Vanilla Sky, his sophomore effort's convoluted plot eclipsed the emotional resonance of a possibly romantic and profound picture. It was with Amenbar's jump into genre film-making with his American feature debut, The Others when I first noticed a talented filmmaker. On the surface, The Others was a cliché-ridden ghost story. But due to the strength and complexity of the characters and Kidman's most accomplished performance this side of Dogville, there was an omnipresent sense of dread in the blockbuster. Returning to his native Spain, Amenbar's Sea Inside eschews the plot contrivances and narrative driven structure his other films were somewhat blighted by. This is a low concept, character driven picture with a narrative arch somewhat void of the archetypal Hollywood elements. This bold and courageous directorial decision, though Amenbar appears to think he isn't up to the task. He lacks confidence in his ability as a director of drama and resorts unnecessary stylistics. Amenbar frequently applies hackneyed montages and pretentious series of dissolves to forward the chronology of the story. The Sea Inside is a character study and a multifaceted love story, but beneath, it is still a disease melodrama. Disease melodrama's are tricky for any filmmaker. A single missed step may lend the finished product a movie-of-the-week feel. Thus it's curious that Amenbar so frequently relies on montages and musical interludes, both aesthetic choices equated more with modern television than film.Since his direction, though uniformly strong in other respects, leaves something to be desired, the success of the picture falls squarely onto the broad, handsome shoulders of Javier Bardem. Lucky for Amenbar, Bardem has seldom had a role that showcases the range of his sublime dramatic ability. He is on camera in almost every scene and there is not a second wherein Bardem isn't committed to his character. His work in this film is as tough as it is lovely. Everything from the tenor of his voice to the movement of his neck and eyebrows. Playing a paralyzed character leaves Bardem with about an eighth of his body for expressing a massive range of emotions and Bardem uses this fraction more efficiently and gutsily than 87% of the planets other screen actors with their whole physicalities at disposal. His work in this movie is an example of what a performer can be; an artist. Bardem possesses a talent few other actors have today or yesterday, and unlike most of his peers on the other side of the Atlanic, he doesn't feel compelled to showboat or draw attention to his work. His performances here and elsewhere service the picture not the performer. We need more like him. The full rating I give this picture is almost wholly a tribute to Javier Bardem's staggering work. Having been robbed an Oscar nomination for this and an Oscar win for Before Night Falls, perhaps the awe and respect of a little geek from Chicago will help ease the blow. I have a feeling I am not alone in my opinion of his work.Thank you, Mr. Bardem.SPOILER!!!PS: This movie has an amazing screen kiss too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mar Adentro (The Sea Inside) is a wonderful and touching film. I have little to add to the very positive comments made by others; however, there is one caution.This film is spoken in Spanish, and the characters speak very quickly.To keep up, the English subtitles flash on the screen as quickly, and it is almost impossible to keep up with the dialog.Because of this it is difficult to experience the full impact of the film when viewed with subtitles.I must admit this is the first time a subtitled foreign film has presented this problem to me, and unfortunately I know of no solution.In spite of this drawback, I recommend the film most heartily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow... Fortunately there are good movies in the world too, after the disaster I witnessed yesterday (Kingdom of heaven). This was considerate, thoughtful, beautiful, tender, real, careful, intricate, sweet, impressive, and makes your mind work and wander...'Mar Adentro', by Alejandro Amenabar.It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Movie of 2004, and I think a movie has rarely earned it more. If only that Hollywood dream factory would realise that more often... Based on a true story, played out in the fantastically green area of Galicia (I just HAVE to visit that corner of the Iberian peninsula too, having seen most of it), it speaks of life and death, the right to live, the will to die, the unspeakable and yet tight bond between ordinary yet so special people, the grey area of moral obligation and real-world legal inhibitions.Go and see it, listen to the words, see the images, and hear the music, and be reminded once again how lovely fragile and beautifully cruel life is.Not the easiest movie to see, as we do not always want to be reminded and confronted of such matters. And, perhaps too obvious to say, but go with someone that you can find comfort, support and strength with, as you will need to be able to talk, to express your wonderment, your thoughts on such hard choices that have to made in life. It reminded me of loss that everyone has suffered at some point in life, reminded me of another who had such a strong tie with the sea, someone who also passed away too early, with dignity as well, but who left a great void in many lives. And yet, not being selfish, I am probably not the only one there in the movie theatre who had to think of someone who was taken away by the simple and complex cruelty that is our mortality.Think, learn, live and cherish... what more can we do?</fullReview>

A real life drama, speech like a poetry, directed by Alejandro Amenábar with a GREAT acting, perfect story and music written with passion.He loved life so much that he wished to die. Thsi is one of the rare movies made me cry but not because of being sad but being happy. How life is precious that is given to us.Even in bed he gave hope to other people, he was always smiling, one day a man asks him "whay do you wish to day, look you always smiling" he answered, "if you depend on someone, you learn how to cry smiling"my English is not enough to express it sorry. its rare. this move is a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a few extra reasons for loving this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "choices" made by both the director and lead actor in this film make it the masterpiece that it is. Just to illustrate with a few tidbits: Alejandro Amenábar chooses not to have anyone voice over the letter that arrives from Julia, together with the first copy off the press of Sampedro's book. The obvious thing to do would have been to have it read in Julia's voice or with the eyes/voice of Sampedro. Instead, we are left wondering exactly what was said, though in the end it's quite clear from Ramon's reaction. Or take Amenabar's decision not to include the classic eye-grabber, "based on a true story," or to throw in at the end something like "on January 12, 1998, Ramon Sampedro took his life. The Spanish people still await a judgment on the legality of euthanasia." These decisions not to spell everything out force the audience to enter actively into the film's narrative and we feel the story all the more strongly because of it. And the choice made by Javier Bardem to play Sampedro with a wry smile on his face for most of the film was ingenious and captivating. It was a decision that drew you into Sampedro's life in a way that would not have happened had Bardem played the character as someone overtly depressed. This role, together with his creation of "Santa" in the film "Los lunes al sol" ("Mondays in the Sun"), demonstrate that rarest gift of an actor: to be able to elicit sympathy and liking for an entire nation based on the characters he plays, a gift he shares with Mastroianni and Gassman, who were capable of making you love the Italian people with the roles they created.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful movie, superbly acted on every account and a powerful story about the basest of human fears/desires. The idea that we should all choose our own death and time of death in crisis is one worthy of debate. However, the film quickly lead me to believe that this was a tribute to a man not a film that is seriously considering euthanasia It left me feeling that the director was at last unwilling to explore the true depths of the sea inside. I feel like it missed a genuine opportunity to forward our discussion of euthanasia by quickly descending into stereotyping and caricatures in juxtaposition to Ramon Sampedro. Without a doubt, this is a must see movie but not a 10 because of the reliance on emotion to ebb it's way in to our social consciousness. A movie that takes itself this seriously needs to be willing to take the leap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although there have been some very eloquent comments already made about Mar Adentro (The Sea Inside), I feel compelled to add my few words to pay homage to this work of art.This young director, Alejandro Amenabar, has created a film that has all the elements of a classic...one that will go down in cinema annals as a poetic masterpiece.And what are these elements?...First, a moving and original screenplay, then great direction (including visually rich, emotional cinematography), and equally splendid performances...with the outstanding one given by Javier Bardem..and a beautiful score.The particulars of the story have already been addressed both here and in the press. The basic line is of a quadriplegic who, after 28 years of bedridden confinement, opts to end his life...but comes up against church and state opposition. Those are the bare bones...but how those bones are fleshed out into a profound and sensitive paean to love, life and the human spirit is what constitutes the real genius of this film. Certainly, in my estimation, the finest in many, many years.Do not miss it!!</fullReview>

I'd like to say that the actors, each of them, are fantastic with peaks of simple excellence for Bardem. It could have been dramatically easy to fall into smarminess, going above the lines, biasing the painful quest of a human being to a "pamphlet" on euthanasia. The balance yet is perfect, actions and development aren't given away at all and Amenabar plays with the emotional tension like a skilled violinist on a Listz piece. The photographic and scenographic support is accurate, delicate and perfectly harmonic with the context. It let me exhausted (other than moved/thoughtful) and sensitive as after a Finnish sauna of the soul.</fullReview>

However, I don't want a bunch of people arriving and just discussion their feelings/emotions. If that's the case, a documentary would have been much more fitting. Bardem's performance is a thing of beauty, and the main recipient of the the 2 and a half stars I give it. Obviously, due to his condition, he isn't going to get out and about. In saying that, the most memorable moments are those out of the bedroom. The accident, the imaginary flying, the courtroom scenes etc. In one way it emphasized his desire to die, and how his life was kept in this one room, but it didn't make an interesting film.</fullReview>

The direction was brilliant with movement being a bit part of the film, i.e. the movement of the water, of the dream sequences, etc. I have to admit that the it was done so well that I actually felt that Ramon's skilled ability to reach the sea inside of himself gave him a life that was worth living. His ability to reach that place clearly transcended to the women in his life that loved him deeply. In fact, with his mental vacations and the lovers in his his life, it was perhaps better than many.

		<shortDescription>Journey of a Man's Wish To Die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one scene in this film where Ramon Sampedro is laying in his bed, looking out through his window at the world outside. He slowly gets up from his bed, runs and literally flies through the window, over the beautiful Galician landscape with such speed and beauty till he finally arrives at his destination point: the sea where he meets up with the woman he has fallen in love with and passionately kisses her. Then, cut back, he's still in that bed, eyes longing so badly for the freedom to simply see the sea with his own two eyes.Its moments like these that make The Sea Inside soar, as the audience becomes Ramon Sampedro, flying over the landscapes to the one thing that made his life worth living. The Sea Inside is exactly that: the endless depths of the mind that Ramon has been reduced to. He dreams of seeing the sea again, of seeing his nephew grow up and become successful, yet at the same time, he dreams of ending his life in a way that will not burden those that he loves.This film offers no simple answers to such a controversial issue, it only tells one point of view of one man who does not parade his beliefs around, only offers them at face value to those who will listen. This is what makes the film so insightful: that those with opposing views to the issue can maybe see a different perspective within the film. Sampedro rather stresses the point that he had lived a life traveling the world, meeting people, working a job he absolutely loves, and living his life to the absolute fullest. Yet after his accident, he was confined to a bed in his older brother's house, spending hours staring out the window, completely dependent on his family to care for him.Javier Bardem does wonders with this character, acting in a role where facial expressions mean everything since he can not use any other part of his body. His eyes speak volumes of words, and the language Sampedro uses shows just how intelligent this man really is. Bardem delivers his words without wanting pity or sympathy from those around him. This is his life and he wants no special favors as evidenced by the presence of Rosa who at first meets Sampedro to convince him to live, then slowly falls in love with him. Bardem is severely restricted in this role, yet because he is such a charming actor, the audience was easily able to sympathize for him.The Sea Inside offers beautiful cinematography for the dream sequences that occur. The script, though repetitive at times, was always insightful of the tribulations Sampedro went through on a daily basis for nearly 28 years. His wanting to die, because he viewed life as "a privilege, and not an obligation" as he so elegantly put it. The film is profoundly affecting to the viewer, though it offers no answers to the issue that is euthanasia. But if you go into this film with an open mind, you will leave the theatre knowing the reasoning behind one man's journey to die with dignity and for that, I recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meditation on life and death left me at sea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sea Inside" is something of a mistranslation. "Mar adentro" actually means "out to sea". The main character, Ramon Sampedro, is a paraplegic who injured his spinal cord in a diving accident and has been confined to his bed, immobile, for 26 years. He longs to return to the sea, and does so in flights of fancy. The film's official English title is admissible as poetic licence, since Ramon carries the sea inside himself, breathing its briny air from afar, but not seeing its shimmering surface.But I must admit the film left me at sea, or adrift in a shifting sea of philosophical views about life and death and their ultimate meaning. In particular, Ramon says he believes there is no afterlife -- we simply return to the nothingness from which we came. He fails to address the great issues of where we come from and why we here. Moreover, his statement begs another question. If death is nothingness and oblivion, why would we not cling to even the dreariest, most paltry existence, rather than no existence at all? "The Sea Inside" paradoxically shows that, even after Ramon's death by assisted suicide, he lived on in the poetry he wrote and published, the memories of those who loved and cared for him, and of course now the film itself."The Sea Inside" is a paradox in many ways. It shows us a man who yearns to die, but lives more intensely than most ever do ... a man who says he cannot love (that is, have sex), but is surrounded by love (that is, caring) every day of his life ... a man who longs to be free from the limitations of his disability, but fails to see how he has enslaved those around him.Javier Bardem (Before Night Falls) gives a bravura performance as Ramon Sampedro, one that will undoubtedly be remembered at Oscar time. He is surrounded by a solid supporting cast.The film is, for the most part, an honest, unflinching, clear-eyed look at the issue of whether people should have the right to die with dignity rather than endure degenerative and life-diminishing physical conditions. There are occasional lapses into sentimentality and, as noted above, intellectual dishonesty. But these are minor flaws that do not overly detract from the quality of the work as a whole.The scene where Ramon "flies" out the window of his bedroom and out to the sea was something of a disappointment, and I thought the choice of "Nessun dorma" from Puccini's "Turandot" was less than inspired. ("Birdy" contained a similar sequence that was far more memorable, and with much better musical accompaniment.) Ramon's death scene also pulls its punches. We are told that death by ingesting potassium cyanide is painful, but it seems as though Ramon only experiences a few hot flashes. The film should at least be honest about the fact that death may be a consolation, but there is nothing easy about dying.For all its inconsistencies and minor flaws, "The Sea Inside" is a must, especially Javier Bardem's brilliance in the leading role.See it before night falls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my short life, I'm 22, I've never seen such a beautiful movie. I really don't care about all the hype about Euthanasia and free will. What I see in this movie is the story of a human being. For a person like me, this is a story worth telling not just to make people cry, but to make them think about life, to show them what other people think in other parts of the world. Ramon is just a man who did what he wanted, being such a dual person, a poet that wants to die is really the biggest irony, he kept fighting for HIS cause. Life is really ours, WE chose what to make of it, may it be a successful or a damned one... So WE should also chose what to do with it, even if this means to end it. That is a choise each one of us makes when facing a situation like the one Ramon faced and is no business of anybody else but him (and god if you believe in him)to make it. I just wanted to say go see this movie, try and be as sensitive as you can and enjoy a beautiful movie, a very well made movie (technically speaking) and enjoy. After all, this is what movies are made for. To enjoy them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Serious Debate Made Visually Enthralling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sea Inside (Mar adentro)" successfully accomplishes what few movies do -- create an enthralling entertainment out of a debate about a serious intellectual issue.The key to how writer/director Alejandro Amenábar has done this is by giving each component of the debate a visual and emotional counterpart with very individual characters who have personable, understandable idiosyncrasies. This is both a very particular situation of one man and a universal one.The discussion of assisted suicide is partly opened up by beautifully entering into Ramón Sampedro's mind as he remembers his old life before he was quadriplegic from a diving accident and fantasizes what life could be like if he could move. As played by Javier Bardem, he also is full of wit, dynamism and humor to keep our attention throughout.The court room scene that is the usual centerpiece of Big Idea Movies with its convenient verbal duel is only a minor event as the issues are more nuanced and complicated as we care about so many different well-acted characters with their own feelings, reasons and tangled relationships.We see the full panoply of types of love -- paternal, familial, filial, fraternal, celebrity worship, platitudes, professional respect, romantic, loyalty, and unselfish open-heartedness. We also see people of different classes who have different resources available to express themselves, from selfless deeds done day in and day out to poetry, though we can only presume that Ramon became an intellectual through his long years of no physical activity as the rest of his family is not.But the active camera is also key. For example, one debate with a quadriplegic priest is shouted from the ends of a winding staircase that neither can navigate. When Ramon leaves his room we feel the effort of many people involved and the blast of a newly opened environment.There are a few factual points that are a bit confusing and we can only infer time passage through such background counterpoint as a developing romance, pregnancy, birth and growing child and another character's gradually increasing disability.The use of opera is a bit heavy-handed but the cinematography is lovely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite of the central subject of dying, "The Sea Inside" is actually a lively film, full of cherished moments of being alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is co-written, co-produced, edited, directed, and the music score composed by Alejandro Amenábar ("Open Your Eyes" aka "Abre Los Ojos" 1997 with Penelope Cruz, "The Others" 2001 with Nicole Kidman) - no small f?te, and how masterful at the age of 32! Despite of the subject of a 28-year bed-ridden fight to 'die with dignity,' it is a surprisingly entertaining film about Ramón Sampedro, the people revolving around him. It's a script that's full of life, presenting different aspects of the living.There is a maturely quiet, big-hearted sister-in-law whose a housewife and mother - Manuela, superbly played by Mabel Rivera; a persistent young single mother who's sort of a 'groupie' in want of life lessons - Rosa, spunky and befittingly portrayed by Lola Due?as; an intellectual woman lawyer, fragile and frustrated by the limiting degenerative disease she possesses - Julia, a keen nuanced performance from Belén Rueda; a cheerfully supportive activist/pregnant wife/mother-to-be - Gené, played by Clara Segura. Then there are the men: José, Ramón's ever-frustrated elder brother, refusing to accept his brother's terminal predicament; Joaquín, his father, taciturn and sad about a son dying before he does; Javi, the teenage nephew, eager to help Ramón yet there's much he's to learn about appreciating life; and there's Marc, Gené's husband and Ramón's lawyer represented in court; and Julia's husband, a small part yet the thread of 'lifeline' to Julia..And of course, there's the incomparable Javier Badem outdoing himself. What a performance! A man basically in bed all the time, almost motionless due to his quadriplegic state, yet he's full of movement using mouth, eyes, head, tongue and wit.Amenábar's script, written with fellow filmmaker ("Open Your Eyes") Mateo Gil, is sensitively flawless. The repeats of Ramón's flashback moments of the fateful accident are aptly paced; the imagined flying sequence and encounters by the beach are at once powerful and beautifully tender; the inclusion of the priest visiting scene raises thought-provoking questions about such imposing generalizing assumptions that can be so wrong. His own scoring of the music is an integral part of Amenábar's directed films - it definitely adds value to the storytelling, providing various hues and tones to the performances of the actors. Cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is well choreographed with yet another personal effort from Amenábar's own film editing."The Sea Inside" truly deserves your attention and viewing. Filmmaker Amenábar may not provide answers in his film, but prompts thinking - if not questions - about the meaning of life, of death and living that go hand in hand. As Ramón leaves in the van, the passing by scenes of nature, people, animals seen beyond the window denote the rhythm of life is vibrant and celebrated with the upbeat (Celtic) tempo of the music we hear. His journey is not at all dismal but pulsating to his own heartbeat.Hm, the technical detail approach towards the end just might briefly reminds one of Errol Morris' "Mr. Death" yet the poetry of it all is steadily sustained throughout the film, very much to the credit of Badem's mastery. Alejandro Amenábar has once again delivered a wonderful film experience beyond compare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't quite hit the spot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to see Ramon's problem. In the course of the brief period covered by this film, two women fall in love with him, he writes and publishes a book, enjoys celebrity status, earns a great deal of respect from those who know him, and is surrounded by caring and accommodating relatives. He has a more fulfilling life and achieves more than most of us do in our own four-limbed lifetimes. On top of that, he is absolved of any of his own shortcomings - none of it is his own fault - doesn't have to endure the drudgery of work, and can take solace in the fact (if he cared to) that he could well have ceased to exist at the time of his accident many years earlier. He could also get out and about in a wheelchair if he wanted to.Of course, someone has to feed him and wipe his bum, but that seems to be all that is bothering him. If he still has some legitimate gripe with fate, all I'm saying is that he has less excuse than many other people in similar situations, and this rather undermines the film. To really tackle the issue of terminating life by your own hand, we needed somebody whose life is truly lost and empty - at least someone who does not publish a book for chrissake - an achievement arguably as valuable as having children.It begins to puzzle us too much that Ramon cannot accept his lot, and I don't think the film is intended to be a psychological mystery. Alright then, assume that Ramon still has a problem facing life. This is where the film should really have delved into the meaning of life and death, but didn't. The truest moment in the film comes where he berates himself in the night for simply not wanting to live. This means there's something else within Ramon that the film, despite it's pretentious title, does not even begin to touch, never mind tackle or explain. And despite his evident literary talents, Ramon never adequately explains himself.We must simply assume that Ramon is an unsentimental old so-and-so. But there's the paradox: if Ramon is not sentimental, he wouldn't write poetry and dream of flying out the window (rather an immodest ambition). If he is truly sentimental, he wouldn't want to die on account of the intrinsic value of the sentiments themselves. The film tries to have it both ways and this leaves one feeling unconvinced, dissatisfied, and feeling somewhat manipulated.Javier Bardem has an easy time acting in bed (virtually anyone could take on such a role successfully). The role of the lawyer just confounded things. The real beauty in the film was in the peaceful and serene atmosphere the film evoked, and in Ramon's relatives, who stoically got on with their lives but who were forced to live with Ramon and his deathwish on a daily basis for many years. One suspects a movie about any one of these family members would have been just as interesting and rewarding.All in all a nice film but one that doesn't go anywhere deep enough or tell us anything important enough about the subject it wanted to tackle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far worse than other reviews might make you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that I didn't approach this film with any bias. I think Javier Bardem is a great actor and I liked Amenabar's "Thesis" very much. I don't have a fixed opinion on euthanasia and I intend to judge this film's quality, not its ideology. That said...Is it just me, or the script sucks? It's full of clichés and platitudes. Given such a controversial topic, it should have been quite original, with at least two or three twists and turns. Instead, all we get is: "I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die." "Maybe you don't wanna die because of (insert cliché here)." "Hum... No, I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die."And what's with the actors? Rueda is absolutely contrived, she acts like she's playing Blanche from "The Streetcar", an old diva with mannerisms. Bardem? I usually love the guy, but here he made me want to puke after his thirtieth fake smile in half an hour. The only actor I can truly commend is the one who plays his brother. He's marvelous, but he's got too little screen time. The nephew is also good, but his role is not that demanding.Amenabar knows how to direct a movie, but his work here is uninspired. I gave the film a vote of 6 because of some great cinematography. Still, a few sweeping shots over beautiful countryside are not enough to make me like this film or recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>having just finished watching this movie, i wonder how many have had even a little taste of what that man felt for 28 years. i'm not going to pull the technical aspects of the movie apart as i'm not qualified to do so, suffice to say i watched it all and felt for his family who were indeed as his brother in his frustration pointed out "his slaves". i doubt you will find a handicapped/disabled person anywhere that does not feel that they have forced their families into that position..unwillingly of course, both sides are captives in a situation both have to make the best of, yes i do have firsthand experience of what i talk of, i had a stroke a few years ago , i only know that watching that movie and on rising to come to computer after wards being grateful that i could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mar Adentro" is a story about a quadriplegic fisherman who has fought for a 30-year campaign in support of euthanasia and his right to end his own life after his diving accident. I see again there are both hater and lovers for this movie. Personally I adored the performance of Javier Bardem as Ramon Sampedro. It is not easy to act out a crippled man. I really think he gave something from his soul to the movie. Other than that the other actors and actresses are pretty good too. The messages of the movie are really great."Now you tell him that moral issues are not resolved through polls." "the Institution accepts the death penalty and condemned for centuries to the bonfire those who didn't think in the right way" are just some of the great quotes by Ramon Sampedro. Yeah you may think whether they had to make a reference to Hitler or something between the lines but what I really think the movie wraps its message in a great way and I never thought it has some sort of demagoguery in it it is there a realistic piece of life. Don't care about the haters just watch it yourself and decide!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No easy answers - true to life and death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this film because I thought that its theme of Euthanasia might be of interest to junior doctors and medical students. There is not a doctor in sight, and the themes of life, death, disability, family, friendship, society, religion and the law are dealt with in a living manner. The questions have no easy answers, no one is free of the ties of love and tradition, and even as Ramon dies I only felt confusions and questions still circling his bed. This was no trite "euthanasia is right" film, but showed all the grey painful areas of dying, love, and family. The only wrong stance to take in euthanasia is that it is a simple issue! I found the film very dramatic and realistic - these people are like living humans in a real world - it could almost have been a "fly on the wall documentary". Oh by the way it is in Spanish with English subtitles - I knew no Spanish, but by the end of the film I knew the characters. Watch this film if you need to think about life before, during and after life.!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a great movie and Bardem is one of the best actors of our times. I enjoyed it, the music was great, the story was really very very touching. And of course, what can anyone say about the fantastic direction of the man who gave us masterpieces like "The Others". To my opinion, Amenabar is a "huge" director and this is verified after every new movie of the man. I simply adore all of his filmography, but this one "Mar Adentro" is something else. I should not forget to mention of how great the screen play was. It is a very touching story but it never collapses to melodramatic situations neither forces our tears. It's main subject is dignity, living and dying in dignity, and that's says it all. It is a movie that can teach us the true value of human life, filled with deep and human emotions. Already classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See Inside the Goodness of The Sea Inside</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinematic insiders called "The Sea Inside" one of the most emotional films in recent history. Director Alejandro Amenabar's biography on Ramon Sampredo, the Spaniard quadriplegic who fought relentlessly his right to die, did walk away with the Best Foreign Film Academy Award. Sampredo was a quadriplegic for almost 20 years after the diving accident that caused his handicap. Javier Bardem's performance as Sampedro was a model of excellence in Thespianology. Bardem dove into the role of Ramon in "The Sea Inside" with precise courage, humanity, humor, and ruggedness. It ranks as one of the premier challenging performances of the year. Many were not on their feet when the Academy did not announce Bardem's name as one of the Best Actor nominees. However, I must mention "The Other" hero of "The Sea Inside"; that would be Mr. Amenabar. The director of the critically acclaimed "The Others" did not a skip a mortal beat with "The Sea Inside". He is quickly becoming the "Alejandro the Great" of films focusing on death. "The Sea Inside" is no doubt controversial, and it will cause viewers to discuss numerous Euthanasia issues. However, that is part of the effect a powerful film. "The Sea Inside" will surely resurrect sporadically in numerous current real life events dealing with Euthanasia. We just had a high profile one here in South Florida with the Terri Schiavo controversy. "The Sea Inside" does live up to expectations. See this important film today! **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sea Inside explores humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem) was a man who had his whole life in front of him until a freak accident transformed him into a bed ridden quadriplegic whose lasting wish is to die with dignity. So begins a true story of an exceptional individual whose mission in life is thwarted and aided at various turns in The Sea Inside.After nearly three decades of living as a physically inept victim of a diving accident, Ramon meets a lawyer who he hopes will help him win a court judgment to allow him death. His only stipulation is that the lawyer be afflicted with a degenerative condition if only to understand his similar plight. The lawyer, Julia (Belen Rueda), is physically crippled, but that does not prevent her from trying to help Ramon. In fact, the married lawyer comes to know her client as an intelligent, witty soul whose only misfortune is his lame body. She grows to love him through conversation and his poetry which will figure prominently as time progresses. At the same time, a local, single mother, Rosa (Lola Duenas), is attracted to Ramon from watching his television interviews. The two women have their own affections for Ramon, and through him, they are enlightened and rediscover their own purpose and feelings. This is a man who wishes to die, but he is clearly in full control of his mental faculties. Ramon has been nursed for years by his brother, sister-in law, and nephew. This is a family that loves and cares for their helpless kin and is torn by the notion that he wants to end his life. As court battles are appealed to the highest level, Ramon must decide if he is to take matters in his own hands and with the help of loved ones.Director Alejandro Amenabar (The Others) has tackled a story that could have been utterly depressing and claustrophobic in its setting, but, instead, has depicted a compassionate study in dignity and truth. The difficulties in dealing with a controversial subject like euthanasia are dealt with in a well written script by Amenabar and Mateo Gil. In fact, the screenplay addresses the subject by contrasting Ramon's choice as being his individual right even though he does not begrudge others in similar conditions who wish to live. He does not judge them just as they should not judge him. He even has his own means of escaping his empty existence by living out fantasies that carry him by flight to the beach where his life changed forever. It is the sea that begins and ends the film appropriately enough. The sea took away his life, and it is the sea into which he retreats. In these dreams of fancy, he can walk and even romance an unafflicted Julia. Reality and fantasy meld in ethereal imagery. It is fascinating throughout the film to observe the contrast of his middle aged form with his former, strikingly handsome, younger man. The film utilizes flashback cuts to great effect as it connects these moments. One instant, he is dreaming and the next he is drowning.Javier Bardem (Before Night Falls, Collateral) is proving to be a chameleon of an actor as he is utterly convincing in his portrayal even in mimicking the warped physical state of Ramon's body and its gnarled limbs. In any other year, he would rate an Oscar nomination. In fact a case could easily be made in a year deep with great male lead performances that an alternate list of nominees could have included Bardem, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Bacon, Paul Giamatti, and Liam Neeson. As his two female admirers, actresses Rueda and Duenas are quite good.Although the film can never quite escape the limited theatrical nature of the plot, it does a good job of opening up the scenery and allowing its characters to grow. One may wish to learn more about Julia's relationship with her husband, and perhaps a little more background on Ramon's brother would have filled out the story better. There is also the feeling of inevitability given the story's premise.Audiences may not agree with the movie's themes, but the film certainly earns a good deal of respect for its point of view. While some may be turned off, those who are curious about the subject matter or want to understand more about this real life person will find this to be a good character study about a man of conviction and the love that surrounded him.*** of **** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie today at a press-viewing in Stockholm, Sweden. It premieres this Friday and it will be very interesting to see how a movie like this does at the box-office. Alejandro Amenábar is to me mostly previously known for "The Others" which is a completely different film compared to this one.We first meet Ramon Sampedro when he has been paralyzed for 26 years after an accident. He is confined to one room, taken care of by his brothers family, and his only contact with the outside world is a window facing the mountains. He doesn't feel his life is lived in dignity and is fighting for his right to die, for his right to euthanasia. In this struggle he meets people and touches their life, helping them to understand and value their lives even more.This is a very emotional movie, and not a movie to see with friends on a Friday night. Every scene is packed tight with emotion, sometimes even too tight. It seems director Alejandro Amenábar also realizes this and tries to add some laughs, with mixed results. The story is no doubt touching, but what really stayed with me was the acting. The talented Javier Bardem is magnificent as Ramon, and the rest of the cast are also very good. Combined it makes this one of the most well-acted movies i've seen so far this year.Probably many people will feel that the subject matter here, euthanasia, is very difficult. There are many arguments and reasons to feel one way or the other about it, but i feel that Amenábar does not preach here. In the movie the characters discuss both for and against it, and in the end it's up to you to decide how you feel.What disturbs me somewhat with the movie, and the thing i had a problem with, is that Amenábar is very melodramatic. Through the whole movie he uses all the little techniques (dramatic music, dramatic camera, close-ups) available to enhance the emotional impact. This becomes almost bothersome in the end, as if Amenábar didn't himself believe the story and the actors were powerful enough. Like something else was needed for the impact he wanted. Because for me the story about this fascinating man, and the excellent acting, would be enough to keep me interested. The way it is now the movie becomes almost pompous.Still though, this is an interesting movie, and recommended viewing. I rate it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not going to comment on the rights of one person to die, or suicide or anything like that. I have read already too many people commenting on that. I went yesterday to see this movie in the cinema and I can't stop thinking about it since I left the place. The directing is good, very good, the cast is good, very good, everything is good, very good... but the performance of Mr Javier Bardem.... what can I say ?... I really don't have much words. He left me speechless. He is so so so so so so brilliant !. His acting is the only one big reason to give a movie with such a tragic story a charming atmosphere of hope. I don't think is completely a sad movie, and that is due to Bardem's acting in which he takes us beyond sadness to see such a terrible thing as wanting to die as something close to the human heart, to each and everyone of us. Bardem is telling us not to be afraid of death, but to welcome her. I have seen Javier Bardem in 'Before night falls', in which movie he acts tremendously well and for which performance he was nominated for and Oscar Award, and to tell you the truth, he wasn't on that movie half good that he is on 'Mar Adentro'. I really don't know what Hollywood is thinking about, but in my opinion, Bardem should have been nominated again for the Best Acting Male Performance and he should win. I have never seen any actor in a long time acting like he does in 'Mar Adentro' taking all spectators in this roller-coaster full of intensity. Why wasn't he awarded with the Golden Globe ? I honestly don't understand it. I truly think he was completely robbed. How can America ignore him so much ? Is anyone telling me that Leonardo di Caprio's performance in The Aviator is better than Bardem's in 'Mar Adentro' ?. Find me a better acting male performance this year, come on, see if anyone can find a single one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fascinating and great performance by Javier Bardem - this was a really thought-provoking film which deserves to be seen more than once, so deep are some of the emotions which resonate through this film and the many relationships within it.A real landmark in contemporary Spanish cinema - definitely Amenabar's most mature film and perhaps his best film in many respects.For those people who have come on here to make negative comments - I don't understand what film you were watching, but the one I saw was the most powerful and moving film I have seen in years.Ramon Sampedro in many ways can be said to have been an example of life, of how live one's life - when so many of us take our lives and those of others for granted, and don't appreciate what we have. A film that makes you re-evaluate things, and it made me come away wanting to see it again.A film that will stay with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the subject matter this film has amazing grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is open to all debates from both sides but what can't be argued about is the lead performance that gives so much life to a character that spends his days lying in a bed. Based on the true story (somewhat) of Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem) who has been a quadriplegic for the past 30 years and has also been fighting the Spanish courts over his right to die. Ramon was a young man when he suffered a diving accident and has always thought that he should have died right then but was pulled out and saved. Members of his family take care of him and he gets visitors from time to time but Ramon has made up his mind about what he wants.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Ramon has a lawyer named Julia (Belen Rueda) who suffers from a degenerative disease and she fights for the euthanasia cause on his behalf but she starts a romantic affair with him and together they decide to help each other in ending their lives. As time passes Julia changes her mind and now Ramon must ask the help from Rosa (Lola Duenas) who lives nearby and is also in love with him.This is directed by Alejandro Amenabar (The Others) who is well on his way to becoming one of the best European filmmakers working today and clearly (I think) the film agrees with the character and the issue of euthanasia. But the beauty of this film doesn't necessarily come from the subject matter and instead it's the performance of Bardem who with very little movement gives a quadriplegic character so much life and vivacity. This can also be a flaw to the story because Ramon lives comfortably and is in no physical pain so his decision can be open to debates. In fact, the character Julia who is suffering from a terrible disease herself is actually someone who is ultimately going to be in worse shape. This film doesn't exactly pity Ramon and shows him living well but it wants viewers to understand that he feels the way he does based on his thoughts of what's right for him. It's a personal decision in which his only concern is for anyone that is caught helping him which is why he wanted the courts to rule in his favor. The subject matter is up to each viewer and their (so called) morals and beliefs but with Amenabar's careful direction and Bardem's glowing performance this is easily a film that deserves a look at by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...but I always wake up..and I always wish I was dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mar Adentro's essence is contained in that sentence, the fact that a person, although feeling and, in general terms, having a life, may deeply wish not to exist. In the case of Ramon Sanpedro his illness, he was a quadruplegic for around 27 years, made him decide to be dead. The beauty of this film mainly resides in its powerful focus on the influence Ramon had on the people around him, the life he was giving to them, while keeping always his desire to leave this earth, and his, to him, sad existence. There is no global moral in this story, he doesn't want to talk about what everybody should do but just what he wants his life to be, part of his family understands, the other doesn't, as actually happens with most problems everywhere. Amenabar, although very young and maybe still a bit naive in his approach to feelings, manages to write a wonderful movie about life, freedom, love, and eventually the ultimate meaning of dignity. Javier Bardem performance does not need any adjectives, just go and see it for yourself. A must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fighting for one's dignity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Alejandro Amenabar brought us his thriller Open Your Eyes in 1997, he brought us with the movie that re-examines one's right to die.This is the first time i am watching Javier Bardem's performance, which leaves me a deep impression on playing Ramon Sampedro, a quadriplegic who is fighting for his right to die with dignity legally by ending his misery through euthanization. After lying on the bed for 27 years, 2 woman steps into his life and he was in a struggle: Rosa, a married factory worker who teaches him that life is beautiful, and it's not worth for him to die despite his disability to move from his head below. Julia, a lawyer who supports his idea, and fully supported him when she feels the pain he goes through after a stroke falls on her. With Ramon's family members and friends who was there to struggle his idea (with his family strongly against him dying, and his friend support the idea of euthanization.) he decided to go on with his idea of dying, even if it means he must use publicity to change the view of the society.Euthanization and morality were placed on the spotlight on the recent Golden Globe winner for Best Foreign film. As euthanization is still not approved/recognized by most countries, Amenabar challenges the society with legalizing euthanization when one was in a very bad state of health or totally disabled, he/she can opt for euthanization if they feel that living in the world with disabilities is a misery. If one choose to be euthanized, does it mean that one was had his life ended legally by the officials, or does it mean that it was a step faster towards murder? The Sea Inside is one of the few movies which goes backwards from the social norms. While other movies encourage one to live on with life, despite their disability, The Sea Inside is looking into whether one should choose to end their life early, so as to end the misery of the rest and the person themselves. Ramon choose to be euthanized as he do not want to become a burden for his family members and friends. If his brother, who was the head cum the sole breadwinner of the family, dies in an accident one day, who will suffer more in the end? Not Ramon, but more rather, his family members. His disability has also took away his freedom, where he used to be a sailor who loves traveling. All and other factors leads him to strongly support the idea of euthanization. This is the opposite of what the government and the society has been doing: helping one who is disable to love life and enjoy life.The Sea Inside has make one think twice about ending their life, and the society's view on euthanization.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if Ramon Sampedro had known about stem cells?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the entire time I was watching this masterpiece from talented Spanish director Amenabar, I could not help but wonder what would have happened if Ramon Sampedro had known about stem cells?Embryonic and adult stem cells hold out the promise that in 10-50 years it may be possible to implant some of these cells into an injured spinal cord and, in a short time, these cells would replicate and replace the injured ones, thereby enabling the spinal cord to heal the injury to some degree.Of course, chances are that their use would never allow for Ramon's complete recovery, but maybe -- just maybe -- it would have been possible to allow Ramon regain some feeling in his feet, or possibly even the use of one leg.How would have Ramon would have reacted to this possibility? On the one hand, he did not feel that he could live his life in "dignity", so it's possible that even something as slight as regaining feeling in his feet would not have been been sufficient for him to reconsider euthanasia.On the other, if stem cells would have allowed him to regain the use of one leg, then maybe -- just maybe -- that would have been "dignified" enough for him for him to reconsider.It's too bad we will never know what Ramon would have done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swirling emotions in a sea of grey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine asked: "Doesn't one have to be pro-euthanasia in order to like this movie? Is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to end their lives?" Interesting questions.As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in The Sea Inside. Think Ramón Sampedro addressed this in the movie as well. It is he who wants to die. It is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death. He is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics. Though his pioneering work, depending on one's perspective, may prove beneficial or damaging to quadriplegics down the road, his primary objective is a personal one. But one thing this movie does (my opinion anyway), is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forth.After my first viewing of The Sea Inside, I walked home in a conflicted blur. I struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion; why would Ramón want to die? Given the love, care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on Ramón by the people surrounding him, why would he doggedly cling on to his hurtful decision? Then, on my second viewing, a shared thought between Ramón and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness. It threw up a telling observation: "...total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy." Most human beings crave for such an intimacy. Of course, how much we value such "needs", depends largely on the individual.As a person with a familial-biased sensibility, I empathised strongly with the caregivers in this movie. Why can't Javier consider the sacrifice and the love from his family and friends? Is he blind to it all? I would think not. The miracle of The Sea Inside therefore, is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war. When we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one, whom has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intent to die, what then is the right thing to do? Is caring for and keeping this loved one alive, against his or her will, a pious gesture? Does it show up the worth of our love? Or does it merely soothe our "selfish" fears of irreplaceable loss? With so much understanding accorded to caregivers, wouldn't their invalid charges, by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival, also be an overlooked act of sacrifice? Rhetorical or not, how much is "dignity" worth to an individual? Is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege or a right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their eventual decisions in life (as in death)? A torrent of questions the movie might have asked, answers to which, I'm in no position to provide.In our eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro-life or pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's engulfing the people most intimately affected, the caregivers and the ones they care for. The Sea Inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them. Intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the nature of "sacrifice" is never one-sided. In this tug of war, we should endeavour not to win arguments, but to intently observe and hopefully determine, who is the "stronger" party to make that sacrifice.The Sea Inside is a sobering film. It opened my eyes to things I don't wanna see. And for that, I am grateful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amenábar's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen 'The Sea Within' today and I loved it. The actors of the movie are wonderful (specially Javier Bardem, of course), but I thought that Belén Rueda would have a better role. Lola Due?as, Clara Segura and, specially, Mabel Rivera perform excellent interpretations. And I cannot forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist).There are two technical aspects I loved very much: Aguirresarobe's photography and the score by Amenábar himself. I liked the song, 'Negra sombra' ('Dark Shadow'), by Luz Casal with music of Carlos Nú?ez.In short, I think that the Spanish Academy should choose 'The Sea Within' in order to compete in the Oscar Awards. I liked other Spanish productions, such as Almodóvar's 'Bad Education', but Amenábar's film is much better than them. 'The Sea Within' deserves all the awards.</fullReview>

However, "Mar adentro" simply couldn't keep me entertained for more than an hour; first, I feel it's too monotone, it's just Ramon talking about random stuff all the time. Second, there isn't a single likable character for you to be connected with. I agree that the subject is interesting and provocative, but this film is, sadly, bad executed. I don't know if it's director's fault, but it seems to be that the writer is the guilty one. I must admit I left this movie before it reached one hour, since I couldn't feel any interest to what could happen next-- and that's a rare thing that I do. So, in conclusion and in my point of view, "Mar Adentro" is a badly executed movie with a good subject, that's why I dislike it. Please don't hate on me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, so... Dry and Doctrinaire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is manipulative along the same lines as 21 Grams, only grayer and less intriguing. It manages to be maudlin while clamoring tersely about its supposed allegiance to social- progressive causes. Amenabar comes off as kind of haughty as a result of the movie... especially in his treatment of mainstream Spanish views on euthanasia. (Pity those stupid, retrograde priests.... OK yeah, I know the clergy can be problematic, but so what? I did not learn anything from the portrayal of the paraplegic priest as a misguided, dull throwback -- frankly I thought Amenabar might be above injecting this kind of hectoring BS into his movies... THIS is the author of "The Others" and "Abre los Ojos"??? I'm not only disappointed, I'm a little embarrassed for him). What worked was Bardem, as usual. And the actors who played Sampedro's family were all superb (minus maybe the grandfather, who was written as a joke or a tearjerker in turns and consequently suggests zero depth). Also very good was the woman who played Rosa. The rest of the cast are puppets in the hands of Amenabar, and in a character like Gené you really get a sense that the director is either going through a slump or experimenting with his own limits, as Gené fails to add anything resembling humanity to the movie and is instead the machine that keeps the movie dryly moving (I don't think this was the actress's fault, but the director's). Oh that Amenabar's next film could bring us again the well-paced, virtuoso originality of the director! Amenabar is a brainy, almost coldly intellectual artist, and he handles displacement and melancholy (heck, emotions in general) in a technical way that imbues his contemporary and fantasy material with the impact of Greek tragedy. Usually he is fantastic at this. And perhaps it's the element of real life that gives him trouble here. Or maybe he is trying to emulate Hollywood too closely and fails of necessity (he admitted he based the relationships in Mar Adentro on Spielberg). In any case, this movie fell flat for me and it's too dry and doctrinaire to be appealing as a tribute to Ramon Sampedro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline, I won't do it.However, I'd like to restate that Bardem's interpretation is terrific, as also are those of the other actors and actresses in this film. Reading the previous comments I've noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film doesn't show points of view opposed to euthanasia and that those little present are ridiculed. In my honest opinion this is far from true.There are many characters that move in a gray zone between loving Ramón Sampedro and wanting him to stay, and understanding his desire to die. Most obvious of those are the family. For instance, Ramón's sister-in-law never talks for or against euthanasia. Another such character is Gené (the social rights activist) who, in the last moment, tells Ramón to re-think it all. The scene clearly shows that she doesn't want him to die.Then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia. Ramón's brother is clearly against it, as is his father ("There's only one thing worse than the death of son, and it's having a son that wants to die.") Other users have commented that the discussion between Ramón and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that Ramón is GOOD and the priest is BAD. Well, no doubt the scene is comic, but that doesn't mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. From my point of view, the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince Ramón to keep on living using arguments totally alien to Ramón's thinking. The priest's speech goes on the line of "God gives and God takes", "We aren't the owners of our own lives, they belong to God"... and so on. The comedy arises from the fact that Ramón is atheist and all the priest is saying to him is therefore nonsense.This film is the antithesis of manicheism, it leaves the spectator the chance to think on the subject and make up his/her own opinion. And above anything else is a chant of FREEDOM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again Almenábar has provided us with a top quality film. This director is amazing, and he's proven that he's equally talented and effective when crossing genres. The excellent character development of the movie, through dialogue and personality quirks, but with more subtle details as well (Ramon's father's gaze), allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very closely, making the importance and emotional impact of the events which take place all the more profound. The visuals are at times, simple, at times stunning (the dream to the beach), and I think Almenábar's films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music - it matched the film's varying moods flawlessly.More than just a film about euthanasia, which in itself is an important issue, this film tackles the duality of a man who at times genuinely seems to enjoy life (albeit in a quite limited way), and yet one who is unswerving in his desire to die. The overwhelming sadness of the film is punctuated by well-timed quips of humor, which seem all the funnier because they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy you will certainly feel.Although clearly in favor of euthanasia, this film does an excellent job representing the myriad points of view of Ramon's friends and family. Most poignant was Ramon's father, when he said, despondent, "There's only one thing worse than losing a child. That the child wants to die."Excellent writing, acting, directing, cinematography, music - 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Javier Bardem can't rescue "The Sea Inside".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sea Inside" ("Mar Adentro") is a Spanish film based on the true story of Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem), a quadriplegic since a swimming accident in his twenties. In the three decades after his paralysis, he turned himself into an activist for euthanasia, begging anyone and everyone to let him die.That is the premise of "The Sea Inside", and it is established in the opening moments, a fact that is primarily a negative for the movie. While the direct nature is appropriate for the main character and appreciated, in that there is no pretense or obliqueness, it also hinders the overall strength of the story. Like a soprano holding a beautiful note, the theme is interesting and powerful initially, but as it continues to pound away for two hours, the point soon becomes shrill and redundant, leaving you desperately hoping for something remotely uplifting to break the monotony of it all.Under the directorial hand of Alejandro Amenabar ("The Others", "Abre Los Ojos"), the cinematography is largely unremarkable, although perhaps that was intentional, because it highlights a few choice shots all the more. Most of the movie takes place indoors, where the photography consists of normal angles and framing. But on the occasions that Sampedro visits his Sea Inside, the walls are eliminated as he soars over the rolling countryside through breathtaking helicopter shots that marvelously capture the exhilaration of his journey.Without a stellar leading performance, "The Sea Inside" could nearly be a propaganda film by political lobbyists. But Javier Bardem (most recognizable in America as crime lord Felix in Collateral) meets the challenge. Paralyzed for virtually the entire movie, Bardem works only from the neck up, yet still manages to capture the aura, persona, and most importantly the strong will this man who lived to die. But even that excellent performance can't overcome the overwhelming dreariness, with nary a vestige of hope to cling to.Bottom Line: A sometimes difficult viewing experience that is generally well-done but ultimately unrewarding. 5 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Euthanasia: A real-life story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar is by now the best known Spanish director and he still refuses to give in to large sums of money to make another Batman-sequel and is to be commended for that. He tackles one of the toughest ethical dilemmas here with the perspective of quadriplegic Ramón Sampedro and his quest to end his own life with dignity and without judicial trouble for those staying behind.Amenábar has himself a very clear position on the matter (he's pro-euthanasia legislation) and he tends to have a somewhat preachy style. All arguments against euthanasia are either coming from religion or law, but Amenábar comfortably avoids other arguments against from other fields (one for example being that social acceptance leads to pressure on terminal patients). There is some balance in the movie brought back when Julia is alive as she can't decide about her own death any more. As Ramón's is a true-life story, Amenábar correctly tries to be faithful to the material and seeks more dramatic moments from the visuals he creates around the story, not from extending the story beyond known facts.Javier Bardem is outstanding here due to the obvious physical restrictions and hardly recognizable if you know him from other parts, like Before Night Falls. Although the music is traditional it has still great dramatic impact. Cinematography is above average. Also many scenes with Julia, Rosa and Ramón are framed in such a way that the transition is seamless. Note also the beautiful opening sequence: A white frame opens and becomes a view on the sea, hence life and the story in a nutshell (and of course a parallel with 'painting' the movie on canvas) The death is done with such realism it is in contrast to the warmth of the rest of the movie. No room for emotions and sentimentality here, just a person dying without any drama. Mar adentro makes Million Dollar Baby look like a cartoon; here we watch the real thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drama about euthanasia without prejudice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place in an impalpable grayness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamor, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary. If such is the form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be." Marlow in Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness"It's difficult to make lyrical the subject of death in any work of art. Yet movies have recently made bold attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is embraced as a part of the cycle of all living things, and it can be chosen rather than legislated. "Chosen" is the operative word for Alejandro Amenabar's Sea Inside, based loosely on the true story of the Galician sailor Ramon Sampedro. It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice clothed in love, poetry, and friendship. If it sounds like Barbarian Invasions (2003), in which a cancerous professor says farewell to lifelong friends and loves before he takes his life, then you are right. In fact, Sea is better because it spends more intimate time with the protagonist before he goes, a remarkable feat with not one of those moments in the least dull or uninteresting.Javier Bardem as Ramon has expressive eyes and commanding voice for the romantic quadriplegic, a combination of tough realist and poetic sufferer. Belen Rueda plays the disabled lawyer Julia, who becomes an imaginary lover for Ramon, increasing in radiance as her life degenerates with disease. Added to the already almost soap opera circumstance is Lola Duenas as Rosa, a blue collar visitor who initially tries to dissuade Ramon from seeking death but quickly falls in love with him. Talk about romanticizing disability?This guy has unbelievable luck attracting substantial women, and he can't move a finger. But talk he can, proving the ultimate argument about what women want: love that speaks, not just makes.I will refrain from mentioning the major motion picture now up for an Oscar that features euthanasia as its climax in order not to spoil the experience for first timers. Sufficient it is just to say both films are successful in opening up both sides of a contentious subject without forcing a specific point of view. The religious right has a right to complain that the former film and Barbarian Invasions celebrate suicide; it has no right to accuse the beautifully balanced Sea Inside of the same."A life in this condition has no dignity," Ramon says. The irony is he conducts himself with supreme dignity that makes anyone question his determination to end his life. "The Sea Inside" is a formidable entry in 2004's Oscar nominations for best foreign language film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfulfilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this is a good movie, I was disappointed. It's no surprise that it won the Best Foreign Film award at the 2005 Academy Award. This is what Oscar lovers call "Oscar Bait". This is the type of movie Academy voters go for.This is the true story of Ramon Sampedro who fights with the Spanish legal system to allow him to end his life after becoming a paraplegic. It sounds strangely familiar. Last years Foreign Film winner was Barbarian Invasions dealt with the same type of issue, as did Million Dollar Baby, which one best picture this year. When you think back to the people and films that win Academy Awards, it's usually those that die or have dying people in them. My point is, The Sea Inside is "Oscar Bait", which doesn't make it a great film necessarily. It will probably make you cry, but it's designed only to do so.Javier Bardem does a decent job as Ramon, but the film lacks in the development of Ramon's relationships, which should be what the film excels in. Ramon has two conflicting relationships with two very different women, but neither relationship makes the movie worth it. The surface seems attractive, but nothing is ever explored fully, which is disappointing.Although I'd recommend this movie, it disappoints me because of what the movie could have been. You want it to move you, push your intellect, and break your heart. It may do all three of these thing, but only half way, leaving you wish they had just gone the distance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Javier Bardem an Oscar, NOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw "Before Night Falls", Javier Bardem had just been nominated for an Academy Award. I thought "he's got it!". He didn't. I watched "Mar Adentro" last night. Please give it to him this time... This is an actor. Convincing, touching, emotional, brilliant. See also "Los Lunes al Sol" and you will understand what I am talking about. He is an absolute chameleon and I swear it's not only the result of make-up work. This movie is so beautiful, so well done, the characters are so real. Congratulations to Alejandro Amenábar (how about a Best Director nomination?). I also have to mention the make-up artists. I can't think of another word but magnificent. I really hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves. As far as I am concerned, it already has...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Javier Bardem Dies Hurray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was relieved when Javier Bardem dropped dead but he was pretty lousy taking advantage of that innocent woman who was stupid enough to love him. The hero was a real creep with that luminous smile he manipulated everyone. All he seemed to be really interested in was sex and so what is life without sex? Nothing. Instead of carrying the entire wheelchair up and downstairs, wouldn't have made more sense just to carry him and the priest separate from their wheelchairs? All the other characters were puppets: his dumb relatives, the irrelevant priest, the brain dead lawyer, the dopey girlfriend. They didn't even have to be alive. They could have been played by animations. Does this film prove that euthanasia is a good idea? Are we supposed to kill the jerks of the world? Javier Bardem is a great actor and the movie was easy to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best movie filmed in at least the last five years. I've always believed that making people cry is far more difficult than making them laugh. If you want to see 400 adults crying out loud in the same room, go see this movie. It's breathtaking. Javier Bardem performs the role of his life. You will cry, you will laugh, you will smile... The most deserving fact is that in Spain everybody knows about Ramon Sampedro. Personally I knew the full story and even the end of it. So, the excellence of the movie is in the way that the story is told. And in this field, Amenabar is a THE master.This movie is a MUST.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one delivers! Amenabar's finest so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tesis", "Open your eyes" and "The Others" were proof of Amenabar's talent and skill as a filmmaker, but (in my humble opinion) were also flawed films in their attempt to outsmart the audience, always offering one turn of the screw too many, favoring cheap thrills, twists and turns over depth and resonance. Lucky for everyone Amenabar chose a subject for his new film that would not allow a surprise ending, focusing on characters and the emotional ties that bind them. The result is a little miracle of a film, beautifully written, photographed, scored, acted and directed. Everyone involved in this film delivers a carrer-high performance,behind and in front of the cameras, from the wonderful cast (Bardem shines, but Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Clara Segura and Lola Due?as give the film an amazing authenticity) to Aguirresarobe's exquisite lensing. The film taps on many relevant issues and emotions effectively , it addresses heart and mind with equal power and delivers a final punch that stays with you long after the credits roll. This is a brilliantly executed film that not only will stand as a landmark in Spanish cinema, but will surely become a pleasant surprise when it opens in the abroad (Sony Classics has paid a record 6 million dollars to distribute it) Don't be surprised it it manages to get in the Oscar race... There's no stopping Amenabar...Buen trabajo, Alejandro!</fullReview>

It's about life and death. About love and hate. It's A MOVIE. Something that seems American filmmakers had forgotten!. Amenabar shows that he is one of the finest and greatest movie makers of the 21st century. To you: Handful of desperate movie creators, learn something about sensations, emotions and language of cinema. See this movie, it can't painful you. Just begun to understand what emotional European directors can do. Good luck. Your way it's hard, i hope you'll get it.The movie of the year has arrived at Spanish Cinemas.

		<shortDescription>Boring and cheesy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bardem is great. Actresses are great. But Amenabar did not have to do it like this. It is OK that he defends his position on the euthanasia, an extremely delicate issue. But doing it like this makes him lose his point: the movie is a false, offensive to the intelligence, full of tricks and even sometimes extremely boring. Some scenes are advertising material, more than a movie. Women are incredibly attracted to this mind-sick man who wants to make someone to kill him, not understanding the implications of that. He seems not to care about no one and thank them for their caring, love and attention. I think that Amenabar might have make people think about this issue in a different way but the way he chose to do it I believe is not correct. He could have make his point more powerful exposing the other side of the coin without mocking it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great. Another foreign film that thinks it's Fellini. On top of that, we have to have more propaganda about murdering disabled people.I see no reason why we have to be inundated with these thinly disguised euthanasia commercials.I found nothing redeeming about this film. What can be redeeming about a man without the courage to carry on, in spite of some adversity. It does not take courage to commit suicide. That is the action of a coward. Sharing this "wish" with his woman simply inflicts her with the same illness he has. If this had been a film about a man's courage to go on, in spite of his problems, similar to the Jill Kinmont story, that would have made it a great film.If you're interested in seeing true courage, check out the movies about Jill Kinmont, the former skier who was disabled after a bad ski accident.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underpinned by fascist ideas on the nature of life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something rotten about this film, and basically the way it turns a sinister and twisted character into a hero by exploiting our sympathy with his admittedly horrible situation. Sampedro, like many who have lost hope, chooses suicide. The fact that he has been contemplating it for more than 26 years probably makes his condition worse, but the belief that we should do whatever anyone asks, even if it means ending a life is in my opinion profoundly wrong. What a contrast to the uplifting example of the scientist Stephen Hawkings, who suffered a far worse condition for far longer! Yet with the morals upside down, the film revels in hero worship, and the people who disagree with are painted in simplistic idiotic terms. There's little room for subtly especially in the encounter with the priest(deliberately manipulating the real life encounter which was with a much younger priest). In that way I suppose the film is on a par with Riefenstahls Triumph of the Will. The insidious idea is that everyone should have to right to take their life, when they feel they cannot live it anymore. It makes no difference whether you are physically or psychologically damaged, there are people evidently who believe you have the right to choose. The same people are likely to make a case for abortion. Its all part of the current trend to get the suffering or sufferers out of sight, brush it under the carpet, mammy will say its. OK, and we all feel very happy with ourselves. So we go down the slippery path of believing that some lives, just ain't worth living, and then we'll decide that as some people can't really decide for themselves then we'll bring in the state to decide for them. Enter Adolf Hitler straight from that other Oscar contender "der Untergang". Hitler of course believes that he carrying out exactly what Nature does in disposing of the weak. Under his regime, there were forced abortions among the "weaker" strains", the mentally handicapped were quietly put away and the Jews were "humanely" liquidated by using gas. He would have applauded this film, and why not for it is in line with his philosophy..."some lives are just not worth living". I differ from Ramon Sampedro, Hitler and all the people involved with making this film. Human life is sacred, it is not a right, it is a gift and an obligation. Nobody chooses to be born. Then who can choose death. Its not about religion, its about protecting the weak and helpless, something this film does a lot to undermine!</fullReview>

The only way you could think this film has any quality to it is if you cannot speak Spanish, are dyslexic, and spent the whole time reading the subtitles and not looking at the rest of the screen.The depth of exploration of the subject of assisted suicide is greatly surpassed every week by watching the likes of Casualty(BBC Drama series).The writing beggars belief. It appears to have been written by a 16 year old studying Spanish as a fourth language. None of the characters have any depth and are entirely two dimensional.The makers of this film owe me.

If the entire movie must be read then it kind of takes away from the movie and becomes something else. It does have an excellent rating as far as I am concerned and I couldn't wait to rent it. But, once I did it was a real let down. Out here in Boardman, Ohio I could not find an English version to anything similar.
