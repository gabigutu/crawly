		<shortDescription>An overlooked, intelligently produced and directed film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I applaud John Singleton for being brave enough to film "Poetic Justice" -- it's a real triumph in presenting a story that looks beyond Hollywood's usual stereotypes of urban youth. If you are looking for a typical gang-bangin' shoot em up angry urban film...look elsewhere, because that genre is miles away from Singleton's storytelling. This film has precisely what black audiences say they are looking for - depth, real characters with a number of real layers....and yet people say they cannot get into this film. I say watch it and simply feel the messages being conveyed through the hearts of the characters. Tupac Shakur's performance saddens my heart....because he had so much potential as an actor as proven with his performance here. I was fortunate enough to actually meet and compliment him on this performance, which is at turns skillful and all his own. He had that quality that film actors envy in that the camera loved him. Janet Jackson gives a skilled performance as well, and the two have a natural chemistry that works here. This film is worth watching...it's one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A John Singleton movie that's a lot better than reviews would suggest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poetic Justice is the type of film that will sneak up on you. Some parts of the movie are a little slow, but as a whole the movie is very good. Director Singleton is able to bring a certain mood to this film; wavering between dark, funny and compassionate. Justice (Janet Jackson) is a directionless and lost female who expresses her wants and sorrows through poetry. Because of deaths in her family she is alone.She reluctantly agrees to go on a mail trip with a friend (Regina King) and her male comrads. Little does she know that she would find her diamond in the rough in Lucky (Shakur). Although Lucky has a very hard exterior, Justice; through many trails and tribulations locates the good in him. It turns out that they (Justice and Lucky) are just what each other needs. Some may not be able to relate to this film, but if you can chances are you will really like the movie. This movie was not really made for mainstream audiences, just for certain people. I am one who was taken in by it, and it is one of my favorites. Great movie which probably appeals more to demographically urban viewers. Regina King and Joe Torry do a good job of providing support to the lead actors throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not bad at all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poetic Justice is an urban film but within this catgory it stands out from alot of them in its own way. The movie uses some very interesting elements that I was familiar with and like most urban films they use realistic characters. The camerawork is nothing new but some of it is really good to look at. Janet Jackson is good as the somewhat uptight poet/hairdresser who is mourning the loss of her lover while on a night out with him as is Tupac in a rather different role from the ones he has in Juice, Bullet and Above The Rim. Not only is the role different but as a man it's impossible to not relate to him as you see his struggles in his life including one powerful scene in which he catches his baby's mother smokin' crack and having other men in his daughter's presence - I thought this worked great because I know how I'd feel if I had a kid and my baby's mother is bringing other men around my kid: I wouldn't be too happy. The road trip is where you begin to see all the characters(Pac Shakur, Janet Jackson, Regina King and Joe Torry) develop and John Singleton wastes little time doing that during that time...Poetic Justice is a movie deserving alot more credit than it's getting but too bad there are people out there with stupid stereotypical assumptions so idiotic it can get someone angry8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the other review and simply had to comment on it. This was a great movie. Perhaps not filled with action. But it takes the poetic point of view and happily surprises you. It's in my DVD - shelf at home. Janet is showing a great acting and so is Tupac. My boyfriend weren't that crazy about it, so I've come to realize that it take a special kind of person to want to see and understand the movie at it's fullest. Since i write poetry in my spare time maybe that explains my passion about this movie. In all, I think you should rent it if the review at the back cover tempt you, it's pretty much what you get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the truly excellent films of the 1990's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film after becoming addicted to 'Boyz n the hood'and 'Higher learning', I think John Singleton is one of the greatest filmmakers working today and Poetic Justice is a great example of a truly dedicated and talented filmmaker. The story starts off with Justice (played brilliantly by Janet Jackson, what a surprise)who witnesses the slaying of her boyfriend at a movie, justice becomes very depressed with life and feels nothing but loneliness. She expresses this by writing poems in a notebook to reveal her pain for her lost love and for the pain of living in America's South central l.a district. Lucky (again played greatly by Tupac Shakur in i feel his most personal and greatest role from 'Juice' right up to 'Gang Related')is a postman with nothing to look forward for in his life except to look after his daughter and a dream of rapping his pain for the hood. Together they go on a road trip with two other friends and learn on how to live again and to find their way in life. The performances are great, Singletons direction is wonderful. If your a fan of other 'hood' movies than this you might find a little different from the others. But nonetheless a deep hearted gem. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silly tired ass clichéd manufactured mechanism. A series of words forced together to be passed off as dialog in a boring meaningless movie. Preaching self-absorbed--Identity Politics is bullsh*t, identity is an illusion, that's a biological fact--anyways this movie is a product of sad wishful thinking. The 1990's as awesome as the grunge scene was, was a decade built around false hope. Poetic Justice is the perfect metaphor for the 90's failings, desperate clinging to hope rather than actually doing something-catch phrased based reasoning- unfailing faith in people being able to be more than just sh*t throwing apes. At least the 90's gave us Pavement- maybe someone's gonna save me my heart is made of gravy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'll be the first to admit that this is nowhere near as good as Boyz in the Hood, however, it's not as bad as some make it out to be. The acting is somewhat lacking, but the story as a whole is moving. If you're a diehard Singleton fan, or are just in the mood for a pretty decent movie, go for it, you've got nothing to lose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Justice for all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After making the effective tear-jerker Boyz N The Hood, John Singleton returns to the field of film with Poetic Justice. While this one is significantly different from that masterpiece, it still has its perks and a solid message to add to its formula of an urban-drama. It is the second film in what Singleton has branded his "Hood trilogy," but yet, it is definitely the weakest of them all.The plot: Justice (Jackson) is a young woman who lives in South Central, Los Angeles, and is still grieving over the loss of her boyfriend who was murdered during a silly confrontation. Justice writes numerous poems, and narrates them throughout the film. The actual poem were written by writer Maya Angelou, but the authenticity of the writing is the least of our concerns.Justice works as a hairstylist, and one day, a mailman named Lucky (Shakur) waltzes in one day trying to flirt with several women, when Justice and her friend play a mean joke on him. Karma has its way of reuniting the mailman and the stylist when Justice's friend Iesha (King) forces her to come along on a trip to Oakland with her boyfriend Chicago (Torry) and his coworker Lucky. Justice needs to go for a hair show, so reluctantly agrees to hitch a ride in Lucky's mail-truck.From then on, the film plays like a buddy road-trip film lacking the buddies. These characters must tolerate each other to survive the trip, but social and emotional conflicts continue to get in their way. Some of these situations feel genuine, but others feel contrived and meant to happen only so the film can advance.Poetic Justice is very distant from its predecessor, with the only similarities being the setting and the fact that Lucky's uncle, seen in the end of the film, looks a lot like Laurence Fishburne's character in Boyz N The Hood. I can't quite figure out why this one is inferior to them. Maybe it's because the characters aren't as well developed and dripping with charisma, maybe because each one of the characters can be bitter and selfish at points in the film struggling socially, or maybe it's just because.In Boyz N The Hood, Cuba Gooding Jr. was extremely developed to the point of almost going overboard. In Baby Boy, Omar Gooding was extremely developed. But in Poetic Justice, about a chunk of Janet Jackson's personality is almost snatched away. Same with the ending being a little perplexing and open for explanation.But this can all be overlooked by two things; the writing and the acting. John Singleton manages to squeeze the premise dry in terms of character dialog. It feels like real discussions being had by real human beings. And Tupac Shakur's acting talents are definitely the strongest point in the film.Poetic Justice has three meanings when I look at it. It describes redemption for one's previous actions, the character herself in the film, and what the slick writing achieves in this picture.Starring: Janet Jackson, Tupac Shakur, Regina King, Joe Torry, Tyra Ferrell. Directed by: John Singleton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the only reason i don't rate this film higher is because i always thought it was a tad long. john singleton, i love your work! like spike lee ( with a lot of his films) and ice cube (with 'friday' and 'barbershop') you've caught a time and place that's only clear to those that have lived it, or at least have knowledge of its existence. all of you capture black young'uns (east and west coasts) as they were lived during the times depicted in the films. wonderful stuff! great acting, solid story, everything is more heartfelt than not, it's why i go to the movies! i hope u and spike and ice cube and tyler perry (silly as he can b!) and the whole slew of other black filmmakers continue for many years to come. i love your work, your honesty and your sincerity. this is good movie-making, maya angelou's poetry is a plus and a bonus!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my taste but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a white man over the age of 50, so this film wasn't really made for me. That doesn't mean there wasn't anything here, and I could see that this was a quality production.This film had occasional laughs, which was good because it could get very depressing at times.I really liked the family reunion, where the movie's main characters pretended to be part of the family just to get some free food and found themselves being accepted rather than questioned. I got the impression they might come back someday just because they liked being with these people. This is also where Maya Angelou delivered an elegant performance. Yes, this film was worthy of her, and she added something to it.As for her poetry, not my style. Janet Jackson did a great job reading it offscreen, but again, not by sort of thing. For many people, this will be a wonderful part of the movie.One of my favorite parts of the film was the scene at the gas station/convenience store, one of the few places I heard recorded music that appealed to me (Tammy Wynette's "Stand by Your Man").Actually, a lot of the background music was smooth jazz with violins or synthesizers that pass for violins. It was actually kind of pleasant compared to the rap and other styles the main characters liked.Family was important here. Although Jackson's character didn't seem to have anyone except her cat, at least she had friends and a job. I did like the cat and its friends, in the one scene.Chicago was probably my favorite character. He was funny and likable, most of the time.Janet Jackson has a nice smile and she can have a nice personality when it is called for. Sometimes here, she had to be depressed or angry. That's fine. She did it well.And this is my third or fourth time seeing the talents of 2Pac, who was taken away too soon. Although it was not necessarily his finest work, he did a good job here.I mostly know Regina King from "227". Has it really been that long? She was so much older even here, but she did a good job. Beautiful mountains and magnificent bridges added to the scenery. Some scenes, and not necessarily pleasant ones, let us enjoy these longer.These people live hard lives and have tragedy all around them. That's why this is not an easy movie to watch. But having family around means a lot.It may not be for you, but if you need to get outside your comfort zone, this will be a worthwhile experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love Janet but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie was very uninteresting. The movie centers around four people traveling to South Central, LA on a postal mail carrier, come on! Maybe Janet thought Singleton had another "Boyz n DA Hood" in mind with this project "Poetic Justice", but after "Boyz n DA Hood" Singleton moved to less edgier movies to mundane movies like: 2 Fast 2 Furious, Baby Boy, and Shaft. Tupac and Janet give believable performances, but the plot is dull and dry. Seeing it once is definitely more than enough. Janet made the comment during the promotion of this movie, that she had a difficult time finding the right script before reading "Poetic Justice". She explained that most of the scripts she read were "too violent, too corny, too much profanity, too something... " She failed to realize that this movie was just too boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just the worst movie, it has no redeeming qualities for any characters. I watch it in parts out of sheer boredom. I hope Janet fulfilled her fantasy of being a hooch. The one bright spot is Tupac, I'm not that big of fan of his music or past lifestyle. But the young man could act for the most part. I'm really happy that John Singleton is either on hiatus or something, his films express everything that's ugly and embarrassing regarding some in our culture.Mr. Singleton, there are enough problems in our culture without you finding the worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely have I seen a modern movie about romance that was so angry and bitter--and all without purpose. The Maya Angelou poetry seems out-of-place in a story about a beautician's rocky courtship with a troubled postman in South Central L.A., and yet it practically sounds like music next to all the "F--- you"'s and N-words. Some may argue this constant foul language is "realistic", but the majority of the film is unconvincing in its relationships (which are puzzling, to say the least). Janet Jackson has a sweet smile, and looks attractive in her corn-rows and floppy hats, but the mercurial tone of the picture is up and down, back and forth, and finally we just give up on 'Justice' and all her scowling friends. And what about that ratty beginning at the drive-in? ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance in the hood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Justice (Janet Jackson) loses her boyfriend when someone shots him right in front of her on a date at the drive-thru. It's the violent world of South Central L.A. She withdraws into her hairdressing job and her poetry. Lucky (Tupac Shakur) is a postal carrier who is sweet on her. His ex is a drug addict whom he has a daughter with. Going to the hair show convention in Oakland, Justice has to ride with Lucky in his mail truck. He's going to his friends to work on his music. They argue. He throws her off his truck. And then they start to talk to each other.This is more of a romance within the gritty backdrop of violence. It's a surprising follow up to director John Singleton's debut 'Boyz n the Hood'. Justice is an angry character. Janet Jackson doesn't play it quirky or lightly. She is just bitter. She doesn't have the sweetness. Tupac shows that he was a good actor. It's a fairly safe romance. I like the minutia of everyday life. I don't really buy the romance. The chemistry is slightly off. I think it's Janet, but it's not fatal. It doesn't help that I find the poetry annoying. Her grumpiness just got me down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good try but scrappy, over use of swearing and a really badly miscast Jackson foil it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Justice is in love, sadly in Compton things happen and her boyfriend Markell is killed at a drive in. Since then she has worn black and stayed away from men and just written her poems. However when she is taken on a road trip by her friend Iesha she finds she has been set up with her boyfriend's friend Lucky. At first the two don't get on but over the course of the trip the four fight, make up and learn.Singleton was always going o have a hard time with that `difficult second film' but at least he had honourable intentions. This sees him step away from the easy ghetto flick and goes for something deeper. And it is a good try but it's deeply flawed. The overuse of swearing may be necessary and realistic but it is overdone here and spoils many scenes ? he could have toned it down a bit and kept realism. Also the plot is very broken down ? we have a trip that never seems to get dark but has too much in it for just one day surely? Also each stop is supposed to show us another aspect of `the black experience' other than the protagonists ghetto existence. However this doesn't work as it makes the film feel aimless and episodic.The main failing is sadly, Janet Jackson. On one hand it's not her fault ? the poems are those of a more mature woman (Angelou ? who plays aunt June) and they don't fit with her. The clearest example of this is watching her stare into space, rubbing her chest as she `writes' `Phenomenal Woman'. But also she is really poor ? she doesn't have the range to make the character believable and the rest of this falls as a result. Continuing the musical theme Tupac is a talent sadly missed. He shines here and, although the swearing etc isn't hard for him he does the more emotional stuff much, much better than Jackson. I can't sing his praises enough ? for me he made this watchable when I was getting bored of it. Other musicians include Tone Loc and Q-Tip?..was this some sort of label push? Regina King is poor ? her constant talking like a Jerry Springer guest etc is really tiresome and her `partner' Torry is just as bad ? whose idea was it to have he constantly brushing his hair for no reason? Was it the only way we would get that he's vain?I will give credit to Singleton for trying. I especially liked the way he brings the `black urban experience' into contrast with the white idea of cities in movies in the first 5 minutes. We open with shots of a lit up and pretty cityscape of LA with Gerswin-esque music playing a la Woody Allen's Manhattan. However this image of how Allen views his city is revealed to be a movie in a drive through in Compton ? this, he's saying, is the black reality. A very clever start I thought (and props for Billy Zane and Lori Petty for agreeing to be in yet another bad movie ? even if it's a fake one!)Overall I wanted to like this as it was a brave step for Singleton. However the plot needed more work ? and the whole ` black experience' stops could have been removed or toned down to just be `stops' without the agenda. However the casting of Jackson sounded time on this project ? she really can't even get near the ability needed for this role ? with a better actress, who knows?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetic Justice - Not poetic enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping the main character, played by Janet Jackson, would lead to more adventures, like making a career out of her poetry composing, or befriend a nicer guy than Lucky (Tupac). After her boyfriend is killed at the beginning, Justice dives into despair and writes poems to escape her depression. She is dragged along for an anonymous ride with her friend and her boyfriend plus Lucky, which ends up in nothing but arguments and domestic violence. Why is Justice hanging out with these people? She could have made it big with her poetry and gotten out of South Central, get her dreams started and move on from her harsh life. Instead nothing really happens except that she and Lucky seem to share the same views on violent social life, which turns out to be boring.John Singleton seems to put in more bitchy, annoying domestic and social arguments between his characters in this film, Higher Learning, Baby Boy and this film unfortunately lack the deepness of his outstanding directional techniques he used for his first feature film, Boyz In Da Hood. 2fast 2furious and Four Brothers are taken out of the ghetto, but they don't share the rawness and desperation of Boyz. Shaft, on the other hand, is a change to the director's inventory and also shines a few "behind the camera" genius sparks he first showed us in his Oscar-nominated film Boyz In Da Hood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following the phenomenal success of his directional debut, Boyz N' the Hood (1991), director John Singleton would return two years later to helm the second installment in his trilogy about South Central Los Angeles, Poetic Justice. The heroine of the film, Justice (Janet Jackson) is a young woman in mourning of her late boyfriend, whom she lost to gang violence. After this incident, she becomes distraught, swearing off men so that she may concentrate upon her poetry (actually written by Maya Angelou) and her job at a local hair/nail salon. However, when Justice is scheduled to attend a hair show in Oakland, her car stalls. Left with no other option, she takes up the offer made by her friend Iesha (Regina King) to car-pool along with her, her husband Chicago (Joe Torry) and Chicago's friend Lucky (Tupac Shakur). However when Justice and Lucky meet, neither is exceptionally pleased to have due to the fact Justice turned down Lucky when he made a pass at her in the salon. However, during the journey, they begin to establish a relationship even as that of Iesha and Chicago's degrades. The main problem with Poetic Justice is that the above plot synopsis is far too uninspired and unimaginative, which is in direct opposition to Boyz N' the Hood. That film was raw and gritty. Uncompromising in its approach, it attained John Singelton well deserved recognition and praise. Poetic Justice however is not. While violence in south central L.A. is still present, it serves as background, not the entire story, one that is ordinary. However, Poetic Justice is not a terrible film. In fact, it's quite good for the most part. As the film progresses, Singelton captures the viewer's attention by presenting the audience with the contrast of the quartet's relationships. As Justice and Lucky become closer, Iesha and Chicago become further distanced. In addition to this aspect is the dialogue (also scripted by Singleton) which is consistently truthful. As Lucky, Tupac Shakur is excellent. He provides a thoroughly convincing performance throughout without effort. Opposite him, Janet Jackson is not on par. She's fine when not required to display any immense emotion, but when that time comes, she feels somewhat amateurish. Unfortunately, the film concludes with a very weak ending. Once our party arrives in Oakland, the film unravels and becomes deprived of its focus and solidity. From John Singelton, director of Boyz N' the Hood, I was expecting far more. However, I remained entertained throughout if not entirely satisfied. It's not as brilliant as Boyz (which I advise you see first), but Poetic Justice is still recommended. Grade: B-</fullReview>

I had a hard time figuring out the plot of this one, on the surface level it was evident enough, but no, I thought there had to be more to it...It turns out I was wrong, all there is is the surface level. It doesn't stand as a romantic movie, it doesn't stand as a road trip movie, it doesn't stand as buddie movie. I'm actually depressed that Maya Angelou was in it,but I am comforted in the fact that she doesn't have to make a living as an actress. But it does strike a cord in me. I once dated an artist in university, I spent a lot of time with her and her friends, the film reminded me of them: shallow, pretentious, and totally awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, honestly, if you werent born and raised in L.A. you probably wouldn't be able to relate to this. However, I was born and raised in L.A., and all of the characters speech, slang, and laid-backness reminds me so much of people I know, including myself. It especially reminds me of being a teenager in high school, and all the boy drama and fights where all we did was swear at each other. It's very easy for me to identify with, and I think as long as you're from Los Angeles, you should be able to relate to this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you read along in that tone and not feel like you are making fun of your own race of people. The time would arise when someone would need to get the people to do something to save themself and due to this mind tripping experiences it because a cause of grudge management. Testing because of a on screen Kiss and setting up a vicious murder on anyone only sways you all to another world of failing at your predestined goal. Make better sense and stop with the whining and finger pointing and all things could become fruitful for you and your generations down the line. The work is only good enough for you all to become more arrogant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's was great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It really gave me insight of the world. Although I didn't understand some of the poems though. But Tupac wasn't acting. He describes real thug life, where people really die in front of your face. Too bad Tupac is dead now. R.I.P homeboy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Singleton's Finest Moment, But Still Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's clear what Singleton attempted to do with this one, and I'd say it was a noble effort. Of course the script could've been tighter and the climax stronger and more rewarding, thus resulting in a more worthwhile film. However, in the film's defense, the charismatic Tupac shines while convincingly helming the sole well-conceived role. He's the best reason -- perhaps the only reason -- viewers should join in on the film's road trip to Oakland. He's subtle but confident, forceful but not heavy-handed, complex but genuine -- all the things that have also made him a legendary (and sorely missed) rapper. On the other hand, regarding Ms. Jackson... Well, I'll attempt to simply and kindly take the high road and say she probably shouldn't attempt to act again (unless she takes some drama classes). Janet simply doesn't get it. She doesn't understand the craft. She "acts" throughout the entire movie, something a skilled and experienced performer would never be caught doing. Perhaps Singleton was just too smitten with her to inform her that performing requires more than just emoting and script recitation. I understand that fans of Janet's music will invariably take issue with my comments, but if they'd simply separate her on-screen skills from her (heavily studio-enhanced) musical skills, I believe they'd have to agree with me. And it doesn't help that Janet's character (Justice) isn't a well-written, fully-developed and focused role; that's Singleton's fault -- not Janet's. Also, in the movie, fans of Maya Angelou will enjoy her cameo and the verses she wrote for Janet's character, a poet. And the fan(s) of Regina King will appreciate the challenging, range-revealing character stretch she takes on: she portrays a sassy, shallow, one-dimensional young lady with an attitude (that's something we've never seen her play before). Overall, Poetic Justice isn't one of Sigleton's finest moments, but again, revisiting Tupac's performance makes it entertaining and somewhat worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Singleton has not, and probably never will make a good film. Poetic Justice is sophmoric, trite and sanctimoniuos garbage. As in all of Singleton's films, racial stereotypes abound. Weak performances by Shakur and Jackson don't help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ain't bad at all, changed my perception on a few things, not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i picked a copy of this up at a yard sale last week thinking this would be interesting. And it was. I never knew much about tupac's acting, or janet jackson's-- and both were well fleshed actors.Tupac's pretty attractive! What a shame he was taken from us so early.Some things bugged me from a director's eye point of view. The trip the four people take to the Bay Area is supposed to be in one day, yet they make like a million stops along the way and there is always the same amount of light out and they stop at places that you would never be able to stop off at from the 101 or the 5.Creative license I guess. And also people were hooking up when they shouldn't have.I also thought some of the poems were OK... but then I found out Maya Angelou wrote them. Hmph, I guess we all have weak moments.Overall, it's good, it didn't move me emotionally, it was just interesting. It was interesting to look at it as a study of how violence and loss can seep into our personalities, at least in the personalities in the movies. Sometimes the character's comebacks when they were fighting each other were more poetic than Maya Angelou's crap poems.So lesson is, if you see this at a yard sale, pick it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film... with one small exception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poetic justice was a good film, and well acted, with one exception. To me, Janet Jackson simply wasn't convincing in her role. Through no fault of her own. I believe the problem was that she is too big an entertainment personality to be able to play anyone besides herself. It's difficult for the audience to get past the fact that it's "Janet Jackson" on the screen and see the character. Similar to when Madonna tried to portray Evita Peron. A strong character, and a good story, but you couldn't help seeing "Madonna" every time you look at the screen. I realize big names are intended to boost box office sales, and I respect that too. After all, show business is BUSINESS. Still, I think it would be good if casting directors would hire good actors instead of known celebrities and respect the integrity of the writing, as well as the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "Poetic Justice" is a painful experience, but serves to show the name "Jackson" will open you some doors even if you happen to be the sibling without any talent.Best avoided even if for whatever bizarre reason you find Ms. Jackson's music compelling.</fullReview>
