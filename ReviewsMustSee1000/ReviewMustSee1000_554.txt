		<shortDescription>One of the finest thrillers ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening five minutes of the film are a marvel. Almost completely devoid of dialogue the scenes portray visually more story than most modern thrillers can fit into two hours. This is about the best book-to-film conversion I've ever seen. The cuts, where they are made, are logical and some locations are combined. From Forsyth's first, and probably best book (written in less than 5 weeks) this film contains nothing that does not drive the story forward. The character of the Jackal is brilliantly finely drawn. He doesn't contain any of the cliches that you would expect to see in a film written in the last twenty years (he doesn't display mental instability, or have flashbacks to some event in his past). He never tries to justify his pernicious occupation to anyone yet, strangely, doesn't come across as an evil man. Simply as a professional doing his job. The French police inspector is wonderfully underplayed and is as far away from the he-breaks-the-rules-but-he-gets-the-job-done cliche as you can possibly imagine. He is first seen attending to his pigeons and upon being told he is being put on the case simply says "Oh God..."....Zimmemann's direction is great and the scenes are beautifully photographed - particularly in Paris.This is an all-time great film. Definitely in my top ten. I suppose I must put something in negative so it makes for a balanced review so errr.... I think the French minister is wearing a very bad wig. Beyond that -marvelous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that creativity and 'Hollywood formulas' are at cross purposes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many films of recent years have had the potential to live on and become "classics," but all too often the 'Hollywood formula' for success makes them obsolete in a few short years. Having seen the 1997 remake, I was reluctant to watch the original, released in 1973. But I am certainly glad that I did. I would probably rate the original version a 9 had I not seen the newer one but I couldn't resist comparing the 2 and ultimately giving it a 10. It's historical accuracy might leave you wondering whether it is a true story or not because all of the characters are genuine and believable. It is intriguing, clever and offers a bit of suspense, all in the absence of romantic departures, gratuitous sex and unexplained violence. It's a well-researched, well-written story that was expertly adapted to film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just a masterpiece. It is probably the prime example of how the film industry did such a better job with movies of this genre 30 and 40 years ago. I was comparing and contrasting this with the original "The Manchurian Candidate," both films dealing with assassination, but taking totally different paths -- one with a brainwashed assassin, the other with a coolly professional one. But in comparing this film with more-modern films -- including the remake of this one -- it's amazing how everyone involved 30 or 40 years ago used dialog, character development, fantastic cinematography and other such tools to craft an incredibly complex and tense work. You might have trouble remembering one actor from this film, but you can't forget their characterizations. Nowadays, it's nothing but special effects. Everyone got a lot more for their money in the era when this film was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, almost documentary quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily one of my favorites, if not THE favorite. The cinematography is excellent, and has so many shots that seem to be done with long range or hidden cameras. This style makes the film seem so real! There is a scene in a market where the Jackal is shopping for disguises, and he (the actor Edward Fox), bumps into a woman shopping without turning to look or acknowledge her, that seems absolutely REAL. I don't know, but if I had to guess I would say that the camera was hidden and that she was not an actor, but a French woman out shopping. I would like to know more about the use of the public as 'extras' in this film. The story is excellent, and the implied menace of the classy Jackal is really excellent. 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies just ooze with class and "The day of the Jackal" is an example of such a film. It's one of those movies that you never seem to get bored watching. Even if you know what's going to happen and the the thrill and tension is taken out, it's still a fascinating watch. The documentary style format and no music score (which is so important in many movies) does not in any way detract from the atmosphere that is created by Zinnerman.The casting of Edward Fox was a crucial decision because he was believable as the Jackal who effortlessly portrays himself as very thorough, cool, methodical, professional assassin who is never flustered. Yet he is also a ruthless cold blooded killer who has no problem disposing with anybody who appears to get in his way, might compromise his cover or is simply just in the wrong place at the wrong time - - - you see it's nothing personal! From the slimy forger right up to the French police officer at the end I counted five murders ( I'm presuming the old woman he karate chopped at the end was killed).In addition he does not appear threatening nor intimidating to anybody, he just blends and does not draw attention to himself.This would explain why he is able to take people into is confidence. (unlike Bruce Willis who has assassin written all over his face in the 1997 version). The Jackal looks relaxed and classy as Caltrop, an irritated tourist as Duggan, a nervous limp wrist-ed school teacher from Denmark and a very tired WWW I cripple. All of them are believable characters which he plays during the film and none of them look like assassins.The movie moves at a good pace and in all honesty defies it's two and half hour status, the atmosphere is created by the back ground noise of the environment not the music score and of course that changes from England, France and Italy which of course provides great cinematography throughout the movie.The support cast are also very good in their respective roles but particular praise has to go to the Jackals arch nemesis Lebel played by Michael Lonsdale ( who was Drax in the Bond Movie Moonraker) who despite some near misses and some gut wrenching setbacks eventually corners the Jackal. He is not fooled by a war veteran who appears to be a cripple. This is an interesting point because what the movie does well is show how difficult it was for a lone assassin to elude various agencies and law enforcement authorities from interpol when the word is out to apprehend him. This would be particularly prevalent in post WWW II France and continental Europe where identity papers are compulsory and the power of the state far more intrusive than in other countries. Today with Email, cell phones, internet, satellite surveillance and CCTV cameras which are everywhere today it would make the work of the jackal that much harder to pull off.The Jackal had a chance to bail out when the mission was compromised but decided to push on despite knowing that the odds were increasingly being stacked against him. ( In theory he did pull it off, if he had not been careless with his shot on DeGaulle, although he would not have got away). Lastly, the ending had a nice touch , the viewer did not know who the Jackal was, he was not Caltrop, the irate flat owner at the end, he certainly was not Duggan we knew that ? where did he come from? He was laid to rest in an unmarked paupers grave. A mystery for the viewer at the end!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the growing impatience of the modern film-goer, it's no wonder people can't watch this film today. It's long. There's no music. People don't talk enough. The violence isn't bloody. The photography is very boring. The ending sucked. These were just a few of the complaints that I received upon screening this to about 50 high school students at a recent film club meeting. It was my week to show a movie, and I wondered how people might respond to this. Well, we started with 50, and by the end, there were about 7 kids left. Allow me to explain.This film, has a very specific look and feel for its time. Set in the early sixties, we follow a fictionalized account of an assassination attempt on the life of Charles De Gaul. The OAR, a conservative underground movement angry about De Gaul's ending of the war in Algeria, decides they must take back power. Ultimately, almost all of their attempts have failed, so in desperation, the OAS decides to hire an outside assassin to eliminate De Gaul. At the time, this scared viewers, the thought of controlling and altering government, through illegal action. In a way, it's comparable to Grisham's Runaway Jury, in the sense that the law has few boundaries when change is wanted. The OAS hires the Jackal, played with dry cool by Edward Fox, an amazing underground assassin, with a reputation preceding him, even if he isn't supposed to exist. Now, in accordance with the IMDb's rules concerning spoilers and revealing the ending, I won't divulge much in the ways of plot, but I must say, this is an excellently crafted piece of political thriller. From the novel by Frederick Forsyth, and scripted by Kenneth Ross, the script merely acts as a smart guideline for the action. Fred Zinnemann, directing his first film in several years, observes the actions of The Jackal and the French Secret Service's attempts to capture the Jackal with a carefully detached eye. He pays close attention to detail, much like the Jackal, leaving little room for error. Several people complained that the direction was boring, but really, it's very smart in its simplicity. Zinnemann allows for his actors and action to play out in very realistic manner, giving the film an engaging sense of time, making its viewers engaged in what's happening. The straight, no nonsense photography and lack of music add to that feel, giving this film much more credibility. Oh, and the settings utilized incredibly well too. The only noticeable style in this film is the editing, in its creation of clever transitions, like cutting shots, while using the previous soundtrack. Michael Lonsdale plays the head detective for the French Secret Service with collected calm. Highly aware and patient, he creates a smart and understated hero for the film. Meanwhile, on the other side of the political scandal, we have Edward Fox's Jackal, a super cool, highly resourceful, and highly aware individual. He too, practices the art of patience, and at any set- back, he's able to resourcefully able to work his out of it. But, don't try to negotiate with Mr. Jackal, because if he must come to it, he has no qualms about hurting someone in order to protect himself. A very amoral, if not fascinating anti-hero for this film.The film was released in July of 1973, as an action thriller for Universal, labeled as dime a dozen action flick by publications such as the New York Times. Yet its gained longevity because of it's it tight plotting, nuanced performances, realistic action, and dark and unusual humor, this film will live far beyond its years. This film transcends the typical Hollywood action genre by being smarter than the average thriller, and by patiently waiting for the Jackal's next move, it's hard not to finish this movie. Some might speak of Michael Caton-Jones 1997 remake favorably, but the only reason people may think it's any good at all is because of impaired judgment from excessive repeat viewings on USA network... But seriously, while the remake is violent, stylized, and dull, the original is engaging, smart, and thoughtful. My only complaint is the ending's similarities to the original Manchurian Candidate's finale. But even so, this film has a satisfying conclusion.To those who think that is long and boring, try sitting through this with an open mind. Unfortunately, modern audiences have tricked into thinking that good film-making consists if gritty realistic violence like Gladiator, or irritatingly hyperactive style and pace like The Matrix. This is film of great substance and intrigue. I'm 18 and in high school, and even I was willing to give this a chance, and it's one of my favorite films because of that. It's movie making in the true sense of the word, because it shows you a story. So please, forget about your MTV or Jerry Bruckheimer produced material, and try something thoughtful and interesting. This may be long by today's standards, but it's well worth the wait in the end. -Blake Goble, film watcher, maker, and addict</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish espionage thriller...neat location photography...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From start to finish, this is one stylish espionage thriller that qualifies among the best of its genre. Handsomely photographed in some colorful European locations and impressively acted by the entire cast, it showcases EDWARD FOX as "The Jackal" in a performance of smooth villainy that is convincing all the way. The film's final thirty minutes are worth waiting for--as is The Jackal's final disguise that convinces the French authorities to let him pass. Fred Zinnemann keeps it all moving at a steady pace and there's never any letdown in suspense since the film has the power to draw you in from the start.Based on Frederick Forsyth's best-seller about the painful preparations an assassin makes in an attempt to take the life of Charles DeGaulle, it belongs in the same class with a film like THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, almost documentary in approach.The British cast is excellent with Michael Lonsdale doing an outstanding job as the relentless detective. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie turned up on TCM last night and I found it to be outstanding. The movie has a very handsome look with terrific shots of Paris and Italy. The lead actors, Edward Fox and Michael Lonsdale, are actors that are rarely seen by American audiences which I thought helped the viewer really get into the suspense of the film. This is unquestionably Edward Fox's most memorable performance.The movie is extremely suspenseful even though the viewer knows that the Jackel will not be able to assassinate Charles de Gaulle. While there were several assassination attempts against de Gaulle, he survived them all, so you know the Jackel will fail. Even though you know that, it is fascinating to see the Jackel assemble his false identities, his weapon, his forged papers as he methodically and dispassionately goes about his trade as the world's finest assassin. Michael Lonsdale is also outstanding as the premier French detective who is given carte blanche by the government to hunt down the Jackel by any means necessary. The movie is set in 1963 and so it is a bit jarring to listen to the cops talk about how they will be getting a copy of the Jackel's fake passport that evening as it is flown to them from Britain---how did they get along without faxes and computers? Given the tenor of our times with every sensible nation turning things upside down to find terrorists, it is interesting to see how authorities try to stop an assassin forty years ago. Throughout the movie the Jackel remains an enigma. Other than getting a ton of money, we have no idea why he's an assassin. The Jackel also takes some extraordinary risks---taking time to seduce a Frenchwoman while he knows the cops are hot on his trail and then going back to her only to murder her after she reveals to him that the cops have already approached her about him. Then, even though he has half the fee already in the bank, the Jackel continues on with the assignment even though he could easily back out of it. Knowing that the police are searching every hotel in Paris, he brilliantly goes to ground by going to a gay bathhouse and spending the night at a man's apartment. Is the Jackel bisexual, gay or is he simply doing what is necessary to stay out of sight? This is a terrific movie all around and very superior to more recent suspense movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a true story. It is a fictional account of what could, in theory, have happened following the August 22, 1962, real life assassination attempt by the OAS terrorist group, on the life of French President Charles De Gaulle. In the film, the OAS tries again, this time using a simpler plan, one involving a lone gunman, a professional killer who calls himself ... the jackal (Edward Fox). The jackal is the archetype of the modern political sniper. The screenplay and Fox's performance present him as suave, sophisticated, intelligent, resourceful, and methodical. He is a risk taker. All of which makes him extremely dangerous, because he has no moral scruples.We watch the jackal as he prepares meticulously for his assignment. As the clock ticks toward the moment of kill, the plot alternates between the jackal's daily logistics and the frantic efforts of Detective Lebel (Michael Lonsdale), hot on the jackal's trail, but always one step behind him. Kenneth Ross' efficient screenplay and Fred Zinnemann's expert direction create a film with steadily building suspense.In lieu of unnecessary background music, sound effects engender a sense of realism and immediacy. The ticking of a clock, the sound of footsteps, or doors opening and closing, help to place the viewer in the scene, as a silent partner. The use of echoes further heightens the already elevated suspense. And adroit cinematography creates menacing visuals, characterized by dark backgrounds, creepy overhead lights, and noirish shadows. Augmenting all of this, the film's minimal dialogue, attention to detail in production design and costumes, the excellent acting, and the brilliant editing seal the film's deserved reputation as a film of unusually high technical quality. The overall result for the viewer is a truly suspenseful and realistic story not easily forgotten.My only significant complaint is the film's strange climax. I personally found it to be elliptically counterintuitive. Notwithstanding this, "The Day Of The Jackal" deserves a very high recommendation for viewers wanting to see a political thriller along the lines of "Three Days Of The Condor" or "The Parallax View".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... How am I supposed to review a thriller I liked a lot ? It's much easier to write comments on a thriller I disliked , a good example being that really crap movie with Bruce Willis hired by the Russian mafia and IRA man Richard Gere trying to stop him . I think you know the movie I'm talking about Frederick Forsyth writes thrillers that not only entertain you but educate you too and Kenneth Ross has written a screenplay that reflects this type of writing . The characters aren't cyphers created just to push the plot along , you can really believe these policemen have been solving cases for years ( notice how the policemen are either dowdy or gruff or both . Very realistic ) while you just know " The Jackal " is the world's most effective hit-man . Director Fred Zimmerman films the movie the best way possible - As a docudrama . Okay it might be a little slow and European to some tastes thirty years after it was filmed but compare it to the aforementioned remake and tell me what ones more nailbiting and compelling ? No contest is it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chilling yet on the ball at all times-type of a detective story and international mystery stirred up into a magnificent and skillful thriller.The O.A.S., the French version of the I.R.A. are determined more than ever to take out the current president, General Charles De Gaulle, at any cost. And after the last attempt on DeGaulle went undone, an Englishman who is only known as the Jackal (Edward Fox) is hired to finish the job even though he wants to do it his way.Once the word gets out, a noble Paris detective, Claude Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) is chosen by his superiors to apprehend the Jackal before he can pull off the assassination.The movie is based on the novel written by Frederick Forsyth ("The Dogs of War", "The Fourth Protocol") and the adaption made by Kenneth Ross is remarkably accurate and retains mostly of the mind-numbing suspense.Well-known director Fred Zinnenmen (the original "High Noon" and "From Here to Eternity") handles the film like a picture frame, keeping it clean and avoiding any of the typical Hollywood methods, especially the climax. If there another movie that could ever match or get close to the same level of ferocious intensity of this movie has. Wolfgang Peterson's "In The Line of Fire" with Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich seems to be the best exception and after that, I don't anyone has matched this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, Wonderfully Straightforward Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1963, France. French President Charles De Gaulle (Adrien Cayla-Legrand) has decided, after a popular referendum, to allow the North African nation of Algeria independence from France. This action leads to the death of hundreds of French residence in Algeria and bloody conflict which extends to Europe, as disgruntled French army officers form the OAS, a terrorist group which strives to assassinate De Gaulle. After a failed attempt on the President's life, the leaders of the OAS are tried and executed, and the organization is in tatters. The surviving leaders of the OAS hire a professional assassin (Edward Fox), codenamed the Jackal, to assassinate De Gaulle. Using a bewildering array of disguises, false passports, and other tricks, the Jackal works his way through Europe, being tracked by a frantic French bureaucracy led by milquetoast Police Commissioner Lebel (Michael Lonsdale). It's up to Lebel to find and stop the Jackal before August 25th, Liberation Day, when the assassin will make his move.Based on the gripping if very long novel by Frederick Forsyth, Fred Zinneman's "Day of the Jackal" is one of the best of its genre. It succeeds largely because, as Roger Ebert said, "it knows exactly what it's talking about". Though fictional, the film's look and feel gives it an air of authenticity that few, if any, other thrillers could hope to match. The film has an almost documentary air about it, which is one of the major reasons it is so successful.Much of the credit is due to director Fred Zinneman. Despite having a lengthy career making such classics as "High Noon", "From Here to Eternity", and "A Man for All Seasons", Zinneman is generally overlooked when it comes to great directors. Certainly, it's understandable why. Zinneman's films typically do not contain much in the way of flair or flash, at least when it comes to photography. Zinneman's direction is straightforward, unpretentious, with no fancy camera angles: he allows the script, sets, actors, and action on screen to do the work. This might not be the accomplished method of film making, but it works wonders in Zinneman's best films, particularly here. The lack of stylization creates the aforementioned feel that this story could happen in real life.Other elements contribute to the film's success. The lengthy, in-depth, and almost labyrinthine source novel is reduced by screenwriter Kenneth Ross into succinct, economic dialog which conveys as much information with as little verbiage as possible. Georges Delerue's score functions much the same as his work in Zinneman's "A Man for All Seasons". There is little actual music, other than diegetic music from marching bands or street musicians, which adds immeasurably the look and feel of the movie.What makes or breaks the film, however, is the cast, and this film is truly unique in its acting. The film recruits a huge, very talented cast of actors from both sides of the English Channel, and every performance is wonderfully understated, free of histrionics or theatricality, which makes the film all the more believable.Edward Fox is marvelous in the title role. He plays the assassin as the ultimate detached professional; unconcerned about politics or individuals, he simply does his job and does it well. He can be counted on for results. He is neither arrogant nor cocky, just an expert who knows what he's doing and will go any length to achieve it. Fox is completely, utterly, and chillingly believable as the Jackal, and one is torn between rooting for him to succeed or for him to get caught.Also fantastic is the Jackal's nemesis, Commissioner Lebel, who is played in an equally understated performance by Michael Lonsdale. Lebel is not an action hero, nor particularly exciting; he is a no-frills, straightforward police inspector who uses his brains, intuition, skill, and more than a bit of luck to track down the Jackal. Lonsdale and Fox give two of the most utterly believable performances ever captured on film, a testament to both actors.The rest of the cast follows suit, although few of the other characters have as much screen time. Cyril Cusack plays the charming gunsmith who builds the Jackal's perfect weapon; Delphine Seyrig is a middle-aged Frenchwoman who begins an ill-advised affair with the assassin; Derek Jacobi is Lebel's dedicated assistant; Tony Britton as the crusty Scotland Yard investigator who gives Lebel his first break in the case; Jean Martin and Eric Porter play the desperate OAS members forced to hire an outsider to do their dirty work. These are just a few of the many fine performers in the film, and all give well-rounded, believable performances."The Day of the Jackal" is a brilliant thriller that still holds up well almost 35 years later. By capturing the essence of 1960's France, and by creating a completely believable atmosphere, Zinneman draws the viewer into the film. It is unlikely that the viewer will be able to lose interest as the plot moves along. A brilliant thriller, and a masterpiece for all time.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good rendition of Frederick Forsyth's best seller based on real events, it deals about an intelligent English assassin (Edward Fox) who is assigned by OAS to assassinate General De Gaulle. OAS was a terrorist group formed by French vets of the War of Argelia and committing terrorist acts preferentially after its independence (Evian,1962). The Minister (Alan Badel) assigns the mission to locate Jackal , being appointed his best investigator named Lebel( Michael Lonsdale) and assisted by his helper (Derek Jacobi). The film develops the preparation of the assassination including identity forge, weapons purchase, among others.This is an interesting thriller lavishly produced by John Woolf who after that he made ¨Odessa file¨ also by Frederick Forsyth. It's full of action, tense, high intrigue and is very entertaining. From the beginning to the end the tension and suspense is continued . In spite of the fact that the runtime is overlong, is neither tiring , nor dull , but thrilling . Cool performance by Edward Fox as elegant and cunning murderer. All star cast formed by prestigious secondary actors as French : Michael Lonsdale, Michel Auclair, Alan Badel, and British : Cryil Cusack, Maurice Denham, Eric Porter, Timothy West,Ronald Pickup, Donald Sinden and others uncredited, almost extras: Edward Hardwicke , Andrea Ferreol, Feodor Atkine and Howard Vernon. And marvelous secondary actresses as Olga Georges-Picot and Delphyne Seyrig and including some of nudism. Beautifully photographed by expert cameraman Jean Tourneir. Suspenseful and atmospheric musical score by George Delerue.The motion picture is stunningly directed by Fred Zinnemann who had a lot of experience from his formers classic films as ¨High Noon, From here to eternity, Man for all seasons ¨, among them. Rating : Very Good , better than average. It was such fine movie that had a great success at the box office. It's remade in 1997 by Michael Caton-Jones with Richard Gere and Bruce Willis as Jackal but is inferior version and bears only slight resemblance to the original movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine international crime thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fred Zinneman, the director, has put out some pretty low brow stuff, like "High Noon," but it's all done with craftsmanship. This one is just about the opposite of "High Noon," a thriller in which not a moment is wasted. Everything that happens is relevant to the plot and concise. Not only is the movie built around direct cuts from one scene to another distant one, the cuts are made on actions, sometimes actions that are only half completed. You have to keep your eyes open. If you blink at the wrong time, for instance, you're liable to miss the way Edward Fox gets hold of Per Lindquist's Danish passport.It's a battle of wits between the hired, cold-blooded assassin (Fox) who is out to kill Charles DeGaulle, and the team of French detectives and generals who are out to stop him. Fox eludes them with invention and foresight but detective in charge (Lonsdale) doggedly track him down. I don't suppose it's giving much away to reveal that Fox does not succeed in assassinating DeGaulle, since all interested parties must already know that DeGaulle died of a heart attack. (The headlines of the Philadelphia Examiner were unforgettable -- "DeGaulle Keels Over," later amended to "DeGaulle Drops Dead.") The movie spells out the details by which Fox acquires his different identities and how and why he changes them. If you don't know how to get a false passport, watch this and find out. There are a lot of characters in this movie and a lot of locations but not once are we confused about what's happening or why. It's a splendid script. The acting is professional all around. David Hardwicke is tucked away in a small part. Michael Lonsdale as the detective has the proper proletarian face and modest demeanor. Fox has the necessary Saville Row certainty. And what a life he leads! Driving around the Riviera and the Maritime Alps in his sporty Alfa Romeo convertible, lodging in the finest hotels, boffing the elegant but foolish Delphine Seyrig, earning a cool half million for one job -- and this in the days when the dollar was worth something, murdering anyone who gets in his way. The kind of life any normal person would give an arm and a leg to lead.And it all goes down as smoothly as a draught of Pepto Bismol. There is only one brief exchange of gunfire at the end. There are no fist fights or assaults. Fox kills a couple of people in the course of his journey but they're all over quickly, sometimes off screen or in shadows. Nobody loses his or her temper. No one shouts at anyone else. The humor, and there ARE a few amusing moments, is subdued.If I were teaching a class in film appreciation I would show Zinneman's version back to back with the more recent "The Jackal" with Richard Gere and Bruce Willis. The final exam would consist of one question. "Which did you prefer?" Then I would flunk everybody who chose the later version.Bruce Willis changes his identity in a whimsical way. In every scene he seems to wear a different wig or something. Fox assumes only three false identities, an English tourist, a Danish schoolteacher, and a French veteran. And we understand precisely why he MUST change identities. Fox's murder weapon is a cleverly constructed .22 caliber rifle, a stark miniature. Willis's murder weapon is a gigantic cannon that looks capable of taking out a tank or maybe a battleship. Everything in the later film is both overblown and sloppy, a Gongoristic mess.

		<shortDescription>Very well-done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining drama about a killer for hire named the Jackal (Edward Fox) hired to kill Charles DeGaulle in 1962. It follows step by step his preparations for the assassination and the authorities trying to track him down.Story has a huge cast of mostly unknown character actors which makes it seem more believable (i.e. in the 1997 remake Bruce Willis played the Jackal and you were always aware you were watching Willis). Also Fox is all too believable as a killer. The plot also takes place all over Europe jumping around from country to country. Despite the large cast and multiple story lines I was never confused and thoroughly engrossed. Expert direction by Zimmerman helps also. I have one small complaint--it goes on a bit too long. I was a little bored by the final half-hour. Still, this is a well-done thriller worth catching.I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" Except for the President, we are now the most powerful men in France "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frederick Forsyth is the imaginative author behind this suspenseful and riveting tale concerning the attempt on the life of the Former President of France, Charles de Gaulle. From first to last, the director has embed this dramatic film with the believability of actual fact. Years ago, during his tenure as President of the Republic of France, De Gaulle gave Algeria its Independence. French army veterans felt betrayed by him and the government decide to assassinate him. There were several attempts, all of which were either botched or failed miserably. Thus the basis for this movie. " The Day of the Jackal " is the story of a secret group of retired Agerian officers called the O.A.S. who promised to kill de Gaulle, opt to hire an expert assassin to carry out the deed. That man is an Englishman, Paul Duggan, (Edward Fox) who is given the code name 'The Jackal'. He is a professional marksman with a perfect record of assassinations around the world. Aware that OAS officers want de Gaulle dead, the French police put a 24 hour surveillance on them. They capture and torture one courier who reveals the new attempt and discover the contract killer is little more than a ghost. Nevertheless, they hire the best detective in all of France, Commissioner Claude Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) to discover the identify of the killer before he kills the president. Derek Jacobi plays Caron his assistant and both men have the impossible task of finding a nearly invisible man. While the police are informed of his task, they do not know much else and therefore allow the Jackal to find a perfect location for the deed. Once in place the assassin waits for his target, who is precisely on time and only a few seconds separates the two cops from their quarry. The entire film is well paced as is the storyline. The acting is superb and contains some well known actors like Cyril Cusack as The Gunsmith, Alan Badel, Tony Britton, Adrien Cayla-Legrand as The President and Maurice Denham as General Colbert. It is easy to recommend this film and the selection of Edward Fox was a stroke of genius. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day of the Jackal is a brilliant thriller and my all-time favorite movie. If you love this film as much as I do, you will probably agree that writing a comment to it is a responsibility in itself.I do not simply want to shower The Day of the Jackel with praise as I personally can not find words befitting. I would not like to attempt analysing my favorite film because I admire so very much the natural way in which - in all simplicity - it allows a fascinating story to meander through screen time.Allow me instead to advise anyone not yet familiar with this masterpiece, to watch it.When you have seen The Day of the Jackal you will be - over time - rewarded with the most precious gift that only the best of movies can offer; a fond memory of cinematographic excellence combined with endless strands of story lines resonating in the mind.The Day of the Jackal is unique in perfection through directness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most satisfying and beautifully-made films I have ever seen. Based on a best-selling novel by Frederick Forsyth, the movie depicts an assassination attempt on French President Charles De Gaulle in the early 1960's. Using live locations in Italy, France and England, the movie moves towards the climax with hardly a pause and much viewing pleasure along the way. The leading actor, Edward Fox, has appeared on BBC television shows and in supporting roles in other movies, but nowhere does he come close to this performance as the cold and meticulous killer. If you have not seen this film, watch it on TV or get the DVD. It will give you two and a half hours of the most entertaining cinema you will see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This feature is one hell of a thrill ride as the mind of an assassin is pitted against the mind of a detective who is trying to stop him. Edward Fox as the Jackal and Michael Lonsdale as Claude Label are two of the very best performances on screen. This version is far superior to the later version with Bruce Willis. Especially when the object in the later version is strictly fictional and the victim in this version was a real historical figure. The direction was excellent and the cutting of the action is reminiscent of the films noir of an earlier period. This is not a film to be missed.

		<shortDescription>The original and always the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in August 1962, France faced a major crisis as army members, opposed to the decision by De Gaulle to grant Independence to Algeria banded together into the OAS and sought to kill De Gaulle. Following their failed attempt in the Paris Suburb of Petit Clamart (very faithfully recreated in the film) this film asks the question, what if the OAS tried again with a professional assassin? Casting Edward Fox as the assassin, codenamed Jackal is probably one of the best decision in film history. He doesn't look dangerous and even for someone like me who abhors guns and violence, it's hard not to admire his coolness and professionalism. The film turns into a deadly game of cat and mouse when the French authorities learn of the plot but not wanting to create a panic, only one man, Comissioner Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) is given permission to find him. Lebel in many ways is similar to the Jackal, he doesn't look like your average cop but he is incredibly professional and diligent.The film sticks faithfully to the early 1960s and is shot very stylishly, going to the real locations from Genoa, the French Rivieria and Paris. Zinneman's direction is also very precise, everything you see on screen has a meaning, nothing is superfluous and although it's fairly long, the film builds gradually to a climax rather than jumping in.Please don't even consider the terrible 1997 remake, stick with the original and enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iconic assassination thriller spawning faux-doc aesthetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An echt-1973 movie. There are plenty of them in this year; films which seem to belch belligerent independence from the screen. From an virtual unknown in the title role and unmodulated (if implicit) scenes of homosexuality, to daring to run for over 2 hours largely without music, this is another exhilarating winner from this richest of movie years.I think what I like most about the film is its pace. The economy with which Zinneman tells the story is stripped right down. There is no patronising voice-over or script-embedded exposition. Consequently, those moments where we're not entirely sure what's happening act as moments of suspense, not so much twists as notches in the grain of the plot. It's a wonderful, organic piece of thriller-narrative film-making.Edward Fox is as horribly calculating and driven as Zinneman could possibly have hoped, really compounding the cad of The Go-Between that hastened his casting. Michael Lonsdale's pursuing detective Lebel is brilliantly understated as his humble doppelganger. It amuses me to think what Lebel would have made of his extrovert contemporary Jimmy Doyle in the second French Connection film! The smattering of oh-so familiar British acting talent also invest the long list of tropes with real character - there is a super, unobtrusive sense of ennui, pride, professionalism and mordant humour even in the briefest of exchanges. No doubt the naturalism of location and non-acting extras rubbed off on the pros. I also feel inclined to mention the marvellous performance of Delphine Seyrig, managing function, beauty and pathos in her 2 1/2 short scenes as Madame de Montpellier.For all that the cast understand the nature of the film and inhabit it so fluently, it's Zinneman's attention to all the detail that's so satisfying. There are more wonderful location views than in any Bond film but shot with a marvellous photographer's sense of their innate value - they are not presented for the viewer like trophies. I cannot imagine that Paul Greengrass, our contemporaneous master of shaky-cam action-thriller realism cannot have absorbed the well-executed 'verité' of this film as an early initiation of his own art. I also admire one or two of the stunts. Above all, I simply love the Liberation Day set piece which is almost symphonic in its editing construction, crescending masterfully into the long-awaiting climax of this fantastic film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best espionage/political thrillers ever made. I have seen this film many times, and it never gets old. Despite the fact that I know how it ends, how it progresses, it is always riveting, fascinating, brilliantly understated, brilliantly acted, and superbly directed.The film hasn't really dated at all. Many of the events it depicts did in fact happen, and while the film itself is not based on an actual assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle, the film is certainly plausible and the film has a documentary feel to it. De Gaulle did pull out of Algeria in 1962, infuriating the far right wing in France. The steps taken by the French detective (played wonderfully by Michel Lonsdale) are as meticulous as you would expect from a detective attempting to save the life of the president of his country. Today if a film like this was made (in fact, this was remade as an awful film in 1997 just called The Jackal), it would have been filled with smarmy wise cracks, girls with enormous breasts, lots of bloody, unmotivated violence, CGI everywhere, actors/actresses with Botox, political correctness toning down some ugly truths about humans, and it would have twice as many cuts. The film, directed by Fred Zinneman (A Man for All Seasons, High Noon, A Nun's Story), is beautifully paced and very subtly directed. It's one of his finest films, and one of the best thrillers of the 1970's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is what a thriller should be like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jackal (Edward Fox) is a professional hit-man who has been hired by a French terrorists/resistance (depending on your point of view) group to kill Charles De Gaulle. For a tidy sum of money The Jackal accepts the job.This film has all the elements of what a good thriller should be like. The film is tense and the tension never goes away but that doesn't mean that things are rushed. I wouldn't call the film heart pounding but it certainly does hold your attention. The characters don't make any stupid or illogical decisions but everybody (both the Jackal and the police who are trying to get him) act professionally with every move having been calculated beforehand. We see how the killer prepares for his job, the intricate technical details of what go into such a thing. A very interesting thing to see instead of simply rushing past those things to focus mainly on action scenes.Edward Fox makes for a great Jackal. He is a focused professional who always knows what he is doing. The French police somehow find out that an attempt will be made on De Gaulle's life so they begin a desperate search for the culprit.Director Fred Zimmerman is the man who brings all these elements together and weaves them into a solid film that holds up to this day. This film is far superior to the 1997 remake with Bruce Willis.Recommended if you want a good escapist thriller with which to escape from the world for a few hours.</fullReview>

I just want to call the two scenes Between Fox and Cusack to your attention as an example of this film's excellence. Two gentlemen, masters at their crafts, discuss an item to be made. The scene is quiet and low key. The older man could be making the younger man a suit, the questions he asks are matter of fact and to the point. The chilling thing is that they are discussing making a special gun, and those questions are not "Single or double breasted?", but "Will it be a head or body shot?" He doesn't care who this stranger is going to shoot. He just wants enough details so he can make the gun right for this purpose. It scared the daylights out of me when I first saw it.</fullReview>

Something unprecedented happened at the local premiere: there was a standing ovation.I saw this film fifteen years ago and remembered little about it. I saw it again tonight. It is extraordinary.Uncluttered, straightforward and clinical, yet peculiarly the most sophisticated thriller I can remember seeing, it is an example of just how a film can be "popcorn" while thoroughly respecting the film-goer's intelligence all the same. Patience and scrutiny is rewarded, not by punch, but by engrossment. Neither peaks nor troughs in suspense, but an even level all the way to the end.What a refreshing concept! I would have given this film a 10, if not for the fact that it loses some impact by having the french speak in English tongues amongst themselves. I give it a resounding 9. Watch it with your whip-smart science student nephew, along with Kubrik's "Paths of Glory". He'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You gotta hand it to the Brits. They truly know how to make a captivating thriller.After seeing 1971's "Get Carter" I enjoyed another great ride with this story of a British assassin, known only as Jackal, hired by Organisation Armée Secr?te (OAS) to kill French president Charles De Gaulle. Consisting of disgruntled former French army officers and foreign legionnaires, the OAS felt De Gaulle betrayed France's interests by granting independence to Algeria so they decided to take him out. After several failed assassination attempts they turn to Jackal (Edward Fox), an outsider with a proved track record, who agrees to do it for $1,000,000.His planning is so meticulous and thorough that at certain times it's easy to forget what he's about and start pulling for him. Movie is not shy about showing us the gritty details of an assassination plan, either. In fact, I have serious doubts if many of the 'do it yourself' scenes would make it past the censors in today's era of global terrorist threat. As he does his legwork jumping from Vienna to London to Paris to Genova against a colourful sexy European scenery we get a romanticized portrait of an ascot-wearin', Alfa Romeo-drivin' assassin who leaves nothing to chance (thankfully this never approaches the cheese level of your average James Bond flick).My minor complaints about "The Day of the Jackal" are more logistical in nature and have to do with how quickly the French police and Scotland Yard get on Jackal's trail when they have pretty much nothing but his possible codename to start with. Also, entire first act is spent portraying him as a cunning, calculated professional with a nose for sticky situations, yet in the latter scenes he makes many reckless choices when laying low would clearly be a more sensible option. Even if you buy his decision to proceed to Paris instead of returning to the safety of Italy when he knew police were hot on his trail after figuring out his first assumed identity, what exactly was the thinking behind the decision to go on with the plan even after police had his second false identity and ran hourly bulletins on TV. Even if he somehow managed to kill De Gaulle that day, did he really think he could successfully leave Paris afterwards? Why such a revolutionary resolve? After all, unlike OAS, he's in this only for the money. But, anyway....And yes, I full well realize that this is not a biopic and that without the preceeding there probably wouldn't be a movie - so everything is forgiven.The undeniable facts remain - "The Day of the Jackal" is a thoroughly fun, charming and stylish thriller and that's an even greater feat considering its serious historical and political backdrop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coldly efficient like it's central character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like the novel from which it was based on, The Day of the Jackal is a detailed, compelling and cold thriller. Frederick Forsyth has never been an author who imbues his characters with much humanity or depth; he is much more adept with presenting technical and political aspects in fine detail. This served him very well in the case of The Day of the Jackal, a novel that not only was detailed in these ways, but also was primarily about a cold calculated professional killer, whose lack of depth or real identity was actually a positive for the story. In other words this story was perfectly suited to Forsyth's style.For those who don't know, the film is set in 1963 and is about a French right-wing political group who want president Chares de Gaulle assassinated because of his decision to grant Algeria independence. They hire a professional killer with no ties to them to carry out the difficult task.Edward Fox plays the titular character with the requisite cold efficiency required. He is very much an anti-hero, as while he does murder some innocent people he is also the only figure in the film to really get behind. The French authorities are shown to not be slow to use brutal methods on their enemies themselves, while the two policemen assigned to the case are so lacking in charisma that it's just very hard to get behind them in their pursuit of the villain. If there is a fault with the film it must surely be that we as viewers are drawn to the Jackal and his against-all-odds mission - I think most people want him to succeed ? and I'm not entirely sure this is what the film-makers actually intended.The period detail and French locations are lovely, so cinematically this is a very attractive looking film. It's well-paced and direct with no wastage. We never get into the Jackal character's head ourselves as viewers, there is a definite distance and we don't always immediately know why he does certain things. This only adds to the compelling voyeurism of watching him on his deadly mission. Despite the genre, there is a definite restraint shown in the depictions of violence. It's often implied or shown just off-screen. The focus of the film is very much on the way in which the assassin navigates through his mission via different methods of subterfuge. The film could not be further away in style from the laughable 90's remake The Jackal, a film that seems to do everything in an opposite way.The Day of the Jackal is overall an excellent political thriller that combines intelligence with a gripping narrative. It shows how this kind of material should be presented on screen, where less can absolutely be more. The way that it always stays within the realm of the plausible is one of its strongest suits too. All this combined with its enigmatic central villain make it a superlative film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"In Me you see the honor of France"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most remarkable men of the last century in my humble opinion was Charles DeGaulle of France. When I was eleven years old he came out of retirement and established the Fifth Republic of France which has survived to the present. I remember as a kid and an adolescent some of the tantrums on the international stage he would throw and be a general pain to Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson.But later on I read a biography of him and clear as a bell I remember what he said about how he saw his role in World War II. "In me you see the honor of France" was the quote. And I thought about it and by God it was true. True for him more than anyone else I could think of. At a time when his country was conquered, when so many more senior military officials either became outright collaborators with their new masters or just played for time to see which way the wind blew, this man would not yield. He was a junior one star brigadier general and when everyone above him yielded, he did not. He and the Free French who served with him carried the honor of their country. Maybe in our history that could only be claimed about George Washington.So only a man of DeGaulle's stature could have gotten France out of the colonial entanglements of her past. Especially Algeria across the Mediterranean who some viewed as part of France. The disgruntled French who had to leave Algeria, mostly army and colonial officials formed an extremist organization called the OAS and made a few attempts to assassinate DeGaulle. The Day Of The Jackal is a novel version of one of those attempts.As we know Charles DeGaulle gave up the Presidency of the Fifth Republic in 1969 and died a year later. Still Fred Zinnemann with no real box office names in his cast of players made one of the best films of the Seventies and one of the best thrillers of all time. Remarkable when you know what the outcome will be.French Intelligence gets a hold of the plot that a lone contract killer called 'The Jackal' has been hired by the OAS who can no longer trust their own network as it has been so compromised to kill DeGaulle. The killer they hire is Edward Fox, an Englishman who is thorough and meticulous in his preparations and as cold as the climate the penguins live in. When the French pick up on him, he manages to elude them a couple of times. He kills three people in his trip to Paris, necessary for him to complete his mission. Among Fox's dead are a woman he picked up during a hotel stay just so he can get her car as his has been spotted. Another is a gay man whom he picked up in a bathhouse in Paris who gave him shelter and then heard the French police were looking for him. The third was a forger who tried to hold him up for more money.Fox even has a weapon especially designed for him to conceal as he goes across the border. I won't say more, but you have to see the weapon he designs for himself. Alan Badel who plays the French Minister of the Interior assigns his own deputy Michael Lonsdale as the man to track down and apprehend the Jackal, dead or alive. Lonsdale who doesn't appear in the film until about a third of the way through is a tireless and dogged adversary who also has to deal with an informant in his own department as the OAS has planted a woman with one of the senior officials to Badel as a mistress/spy. Playing Lonsdale's assistant in an early role is Derek Jacobi.The Day Of The Jackal is at the top of the list in suspense movies. Alfred Hitchcock could not have fashioned suspense and terror any better than Zinnemann does here. Do not miss this film if it ever broadcast.And this review is dedicated to Charles DeGaulle who carried the honor of his country on his very tall frame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of filmmaking but with no heart--cool and cunning stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Jackal (1973)This is a remarkable movie. It's long, it has a slow, steady pace, it is about a French President in the early 1960s many of us know nothing about. But it's bracingly sharp in its direction, in its photography, in its remarkably efficient editing. There is something perfect about the construction, and the final complexities made transparent.I read the book many years ago and was riveted at the time. I think it's what we now call an airport novel, but it was well written (by Fred Forsyth) and the plot about an assassin out to kill the president had an urgency that made sense, even to a young American. The precision of the main character in his effort to get close enough to his target to actually shoot him dead was memorable. And it transfers perfectly here.Director Fred Zinnemann is no stranger to great movies. "High Noon" is likewise a perfectly constructed film and is studied for it, and "From Here to Eternity" has taken on its own kind of legendary status.What "Jackal" lacks is something to feel for, some bit of warmth, or a sense of wanting what is right to happen. Because it's a cold movie where the main character is officially the antagonist. He's cunning and cruel, and we never learn why, there is no psychology involved, just an acting out of smart murderous professionalism. It's almost like this very Old Hollywood director has shifted to the post-1967 New Hollywood mode of upending expectations, and so here we spend almost every minute with the assassin, and are meant to identify with him.And want him to succeed. You see, we are meant to want the President of France to get shot in the head from long distance by a single exploding bullet.Well, you'll have to see how it plays out. There is an ostensibly positive side, a French official in charge of finding and stopping this assassin, and we are given time with his efforts. I don't know if it's on purpose, but these scenes, which are scarce at first but which multiply by the end, are relatively drab. We kind of want him to succeed, too, but not more than the other guy. We put up with his mustachioed relevance as a kind a caricature. The assassin is far more suave, good looking, and frankly smart, the loner against the system, the one I, as the loner in the audience, am committed to.Give yourself a good block of time for this because once you start you are unlikely to want to stop. Unless of course you find it boring right from the get go, which means the style isn't going to work. And in that case you ought to jump ship and try a different kind of movie. For me this was excellent stuff, tightly made, acted with restraint, cool to the touch, and very smart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there were an award for sheer single-mindedness, this film would win a lifetime- achievement. I don't think I've seen a movie more dedicated to following through on its premise. With near excruciating detail, the two and a-half hour narrative follows out a plot to assassinate French president Charles de Gaulle by disgruntled Algerian colonialists who hire a professional hit man known as the Jackal.Now you might think 140-minutes would provide plenty of critical material to write about. But, in my little book, the sum-total doesn't. Instead, the screenplay consists entirely of following out the tactics of police pursuit and criminal evasion, producing results that are, nevertheless, riveting as heck. That's mainly because the screenplay shows the Jackal's painstaking preparation, though much is done in silence such that we don't know why he's doing what he's doing. We find out, however, as the chase unfolds and he puts those preparations into practice, allowing him to stay one-step ahead of the police pursuers. It amounts to an exquisite game of cat and mouse, and is about as well played as any thriller I've seen. But you have to stay alert since the Jackal operates mainly in silence.If there's a downside, it's probably some seemingly pointless interludes where police functionaries walk along corridors to somewhere. I'm guessing these were included to give us a taste of the richly ornate interiors of high government offices since the walking itself doesn't advance the single-minded plot. Still, these scenes, along with the many sunny outdoor shots, do lend an eye-catching background to all the maneuvering.Anyway, between the expert screenplay, fine acting, and colorful European locales, the movie is richly deserving of its first-rate reputation.</fullReview>

If he had Willis' assignment, he would have gotten it done.But, he had to deal with the European versions of the CIA/FBI and they were not restrained in how they handled investigations. With just a thread, the French police inspector carefully puts together a case with as much precision as his prey. It was a game of cat and mouse that kept you on the edge of your seat for two and a half hours without noticing the time.That is because of director Fred Zinnemann and the fact that he kept things moving along beautifully.If you want to see how a thriller is done with craft and cunning and without special effects, then this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put it simply, DAY OF THE JACKAL is THE thriller of the 1970s. With nary a car chase or shoot out in sight, it manages to cram as much excitement into its running time as the entire BOURNE trilogy thanks to the combined wonder of expert direction and a faultless script. Highly detailed and never less than compelling, this film follows the exploits of a professional assassin about to embark on his biggest job yet ? and we follow him every painstaking step of the way.Fox ? entirely chilling and somehow commendable, despite his ultra ruthlessness ? is a lead you almost (but not quite) want to win out come the end, purely because of his professionalism and his attention to detail. Michael Lonsdale works well as the detective cast opposite him, always human and likable, but the real winner is the script/directorial combo. Like SOUTHERN COMFORT, it's a film to keep you guessing until the final nail-biting moments and dare I say it, there's never a dull moment. An outstanding and exceptional piece of film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fred Zinnemann's excellent film, "The Day of the Jackal," is the story of an attempted assassination of President Charles de Gaulle. The way the film unfolds, almost as a documentary, one would assume it's a true story. Actually, it's from Frederic Forsyth's novel.The Jackal (Edward Fox) is hired by the OAS, a militant underground group that opposes de Gaulle giving independence to Algeria. The group has learned the hard way that a man who survived -- in fact, led -- the Resistance in France during WW II is not easy to bump off. After shooting something like 110 bullets into his car, de Gaulle exited unscathed. So the OAS turns to an outsider, a crack assassin who carefully plans each step leading to de Gaulle's assassination. He is forced to think on his feet and kill a lot of people as unforeseen circumstances happen along the way.If the Jackal is working hard, so is the French Security. Due to bank robberies in France by the OAS, the French government figures that the OAS needs to fund something. The OAS chief is captured and tortured. Security walks away with the name: The Jackal, and realize that De Gaulle may be in danger. There is no way to find the Jackal: They can't detain him at the border since they don't know his name. Government assassins can't destroy him if he's in another country; they can't arrest him in France because they don't know who he is. The can't search for him; they don't know what he looks like. The government calls in a man recommended by the Police Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner Claude Lebel (Michael Lonsdale).With precious little to go on, made worse because the entire operation must be kept secret, Lebel and an assistant (a young Derek Jacobi) start the step by step police work necessary to uncover this man. It's a massive job.Absolutely fascinating film showing the careful preparations on the side of both the police and the assassin and the roadblocks each runs into. Edward Fox is brilliant as The Jackal -- even with precious little dialogue, he manages to show his coldness, preciseness, and quick mind. Lonsdale as Lebel seems like a real police detective - underplayed, exhausted, unflappable, and dogged. A wonderful performance.Truly excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jackal's last laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frederick Forsyth is not one of my favourite people. When he appeared on the B.B.C.'s 'Question Time' some years back, he came across as a stuffy, right-wing Colonel from 1935 who's travelled forward in time and hates everything he sees. My dislike of him as a person does not colour my view of him as an author;'The Day Of The Jackal' is one of the finest British post-war thrillers.It tells how a group of extremists, mostly drawn from the French army, band together to form the O.A.S., dedicated to killing President Charles De Gaulle as revenge for his making Algeria independent. Riddled with informers, and with the authorities closing in on them, they decide to recruit from outside; an unnamed Englishman ( Edward Fox ) calling himself 'The Jackal'. He agrees to kill De Gaulle but only for a fee large enough for him to retire on. They agree. As the Jackal puts his plan into operation, the police - led by Inspector Lebec ( Michael Lonsdale ) - commences a manhunt across Europe...The book was surprisingly turned down by almost every major publisher before seeing the light of print. They probably thought that as De Gaulle had only recently died ( 1969 ) in real life, the book was of no value as a suspense thriller. They were wrong. The film, directed by Fred Zimmermann, begins excitingly with a failed O.A.S. operation and never lets up. Hitchcock could not have done better. Fox is superb as the mysterious killer ( he can kill using his bare hands ), jumping around the continent under various identities, at all times one step ahead of his pursuers. The scene where he practises shooting in the woods I could watch all day. The actor was not as well known then as now, giving his performance added credibility. Had they used someone famous, I think it would have negated the suspense somewhat ( this happened in the 1997 remake, which had Bruce Willis as 'The Jackal' ).The wonderful supporting cast includes Anton Rodgers, Donald Sinden, Terence Alexander, Cyril Cusack, Barrie Ingham, Alan Badel and Ronald Pickup. Delphine Seyrig ( of 'Last Year at Marienbad' ) plays a rich woman the Jackal seduces while staying at a hotel.The film was a critical and commercial success. A year later, Forsyth's 'The Odessa File' was brought to the big screen ( starring Jon Voight ), but failed to replicate its success. A number of books in similar vein duly appeared on bookshelves, clearly inspired by the 'Jackal', most notably Jack Higgins' ( a.k.a. Harry Patterson ) 'The Eagle Has Landed' ( about a wartime plot to kill Churchill ).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's always something fascinating about a film that takes a well-known historical event and twists a fictional story around it. Not only does it effectively add a true sense of realism, thus increasing the suspense and visceral intensity of the plot, but there's also that inkling of a feeling that perhaps the story isn't fictional, after all. It goes against all our logic, but the sentiment still sits at the back of our minds; as far as we know, maybe there was an assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle on August 25, 1963 that was promptly covered up by authorities. Of course, Fred Zinnemann's 'The Day of the Jackal (1973),' based upon the acclaimed 1971 thriller novel by Frederick Forsyth, never purports to be telling a true story, but it remains a exciting consideration. The film follows a cunning, ruthless assassin ? codenamed the Jackal ? as he plots to sniper the French President, as well as the frantic attempts of authorities to capture the anonymous man before he can carry out his plans.Unlike most thrillers concerned with capturing a killer before he can strike, 'The Day of the Jackal' spends most of its time with the assassin himself, where we watch him intelligently and artfully drawing his meticulous plans and putting them into execution. The Jackal (Edward Fox) is a man of few words; a silent and scrupulous professional who never allows emotion to affect his work. We come to recognise his sly brilliance in everything he does, and yet the film never celebrates his cleverness, and admiration is not an emotion with which we are willing to respond to him. On the opposite side of the moral scale is Deputy Commissioner Claude Lebel (Michael Lonsdale), a shy and softly-spoken detective who reveals himself to be a surprisingly cunning and resourceful investigator. The means by which he and his colleagues break-down the Jackal's impenetrable scheme is genuinely captivating and intriguing.Given the story's historical grounding, it is inevitable that the assassination attempt be unsuccessful, though Zinnemann manages to infuse the story with a continuing air of suspense, which slowly escalates as the fateful day ? Liberation Day in Paris ? approaches. 'The Day of the Jackal' joins the ranks of such films as 'All the President's Men (1976)' and 'Zodiac (2007),' which somehow manage to maintain the tension despite their conclusions never being in any doubt {though, admittedly, those two had the added burden of a completely factual story}. Despite the phenomenal success of Forsyth's novel, the film adaptation was a box office failure, which Zinnemann later blamed upon having an unknown in the title role. Nevertheless, 'The Day of the Jackal' is now considered a classic thriller, which also spawned an average 1997 remake, 'The Jackal,' starring Bruce Willis and Richard Gere.</fullReview>

The film's pace is relentless and not a frame of it is boring. I simply loved the Technicolor look of 1970s Paris and I was surprised at how it actually still looks largely like that today. Inserting film action flawlessly into a real "Liberation Day" parade without the help of any computer graphics was European film making at a high point.

		<shortDescription>The professional hit-man's professional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frederick Forsyth was a popular journalist with a nose for murky stories of wars, coups, mercenaries, corruption and assassinations in murky countries. What makes this masterful and beautifully shot adaptation of Day of the Jackal so compelling is the almost fly on the wall view of a professional hit-man - the best money could buy - going about his business. A grey character who can pass unnoticed in almost any situation, unflustered and immensely resourceful, The Jackal (Edward Fox) - we never know his real identity - has only one focus. Human contact is solely to achieve that goal. Even his sexuality he casually uses to that end. There is no glamour just rational necessity - a human life only of value for what it can do for him. The only person he genuinely appears to relate to is his underworld gunsmith - each recognises the other as a craftsman at the top of his respective craft. The target is President Charles De Gaulle, at the time (1962) about to commit - in the eyes of the French settlers in Algeria - the ultimate act of betrayal and treachery: to give Algeria back to the Algerians. Not a remote colony but a Department of France, generations of French settlers had lived and died there. One million Algerians had died in the fight for independence. France is divided as is its army. A faction plots to kill De Gaulle but even this faction is riven with informers - hence the employment of the faceless nameless stranger. The two central characters are The Jackal and the policeman (Michel Lonsdale) - the family man who has placed on his shoulders the Herculean task and lone responsibility of protecting the living embodiment of France herself: Charles De Gaulle. The last 30 minutes especially is nail-biting stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fred Zinneman's masterful adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day of the Jackal captures to true spirit of Frederick Forsyth's exceptional first novel. Kenneth Ross' script deserves praise in its ability to preserve more than just the essence of the book, an attribute often absent from many recent book-to-film adaptations. During the early 1960's, the OAS (Organisation Armee Secret) waged a terrorist campaign against French President Charles De Gaulle's administration. Angered by the loss of French lives after De Gaulle abandoned the French colonial war in Algeria, and hoped eventually to remove him through a coup d'état.With an incredible attention to detail, Fred Zinneman's masterful direction is superb, and his typically deliberate pace builds to a tensely anticipated and remarkably satisfying finale. Edward Fox gives his finest performance as The Jackal, a free lance assassin hired by the disillusioned OAS. Likewise, Michel Lonsdale's performance as the chief inspector who is overwhelmingly burdened with the French Government's pressure to save the life of the President from the unknown assassin is especially noteworthy. Cyril Cusack as the gunsmith also deserves special mention. The locations are truly authentic, taking us through some beautiful European settings and cities during a particularly unspoiled period, before the age of fast food and urban and suburban blight. Footnote:While one may shudder to imagine comparisons with Bruce Willis' so-called remake, The Jackal, it had nothing to do with the Forsyth book. Furthermore, it brought angry protests from the creators of the original film because it had retained the original title, The Day of the Jackal. Zinneman, along with Forsyth and Ross, forced the producers to change the title to The Jackal. The producers claimed they were adapting Ross' screenplay and not Forsyth's book, a dubious assertion, to be sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anatomy of an assassin not to be confused with '97 ripoff...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first third of DAY OF THE JACKAL could be called an Anatomy of an Assassin. Brit actor Ed Fox plays the cold-blooded shooter, code-name Jackal. The rest of the film is a rollercoaster ride that documents the uncovering and pursuit of a would-be assassin that you could call Crime and Punishment. Together, you'll see one of the most tense thrillers ever made. The Jackal is a man like any other. Or so it seems. He works hard for his money. He studies. He observes. He prepares. He also kills, at will, anyone who will get in the way of his objective: the real-life assassination attempt of France Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle.I'm not sure how accurate the story is in regards to history, but history tells us de Gaulle was not shot in 1963. He sure as hell was shot at, though. Fox's performance is so convincing and suave, we start to cringe when he gets cornered. The life of a professional assassin is a lonely one, but he'll use some women and others along the way. Nothing fazes him.The film is extremely smart. The French security for de Gaulle, led by an independent commissioner, are right on the Jackal's trail, but always one step behind. Just when they seem to catch up, he rubs one in their face by disappearing like Houdini. As for the Hollywood remake, starring Willis and Gere: not even close. Not even worthy of mentioning in the same breath. With the original, we have a true attempt during tumultuous political times on the life of a French General. The remake has the killer after a Hillary Rodham Clinton look-alike, pure fiction. I sense a pattern here...Just watch the true one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Thrillers are Supposed to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the opposite end of an assassination scale from, say, The Interpreter, there's Fred Zinnemann's The Day of the Jackal, maybe a quiet second to the original The Manchurian Candidate for sheer, unnerving suspenseful pressure.What Zinnemann has done is to create a terrifying political-assassination thriller that looks and feels like a cross between a home movie and a documentary. It works on two diametrically opposed levels. It's clinical and cold, a dark tale of the plot to kill President Charles DeGaulle in the early 1960s, that is both elegant and sun-washed in its European locales. At the same time, TDOTJ is a personal look at two characters, the assassin and the policeman, both of whom are sympathetic. You admire the humanity of Michael Lonsdale's investigator, but you also feel a kinship with Edward Fox's Jackal, mannequin-like in his cold efficiency, but admirable in his intellect and chameleon-like adaptability.No matter how much you don't want to do it, you find yourself rooting for the bad guy, mainly because he's so good when he's one-half step in front of the law.That's why The Day of the Jackal works so well. It's more than an advertisement for visiting Europe (although Italy and France look very, very inviting). As an American, you may find yourself somewhat ambivalent toward DeGaulle getting whacked. It's the fact that The Day of the Jackal is a suspenseful, clinical, and human story that makes it so very good.Much like The Manchurian Candidate's Raymond Shaw, who is such a psychological basket case, but you forgive anyway, "Charles Calthrop" is a killing machine you know you must not cheer for, but you do anyway.Fred Zinnemann's been messin' with your head, a bit like the Jackal messed with that watermelon in the forest.</fullReview>

What struck me most about the film is that the first two hours is non-stop plot. Just about every scene develops the plot in some way. There are so many small details that you pick up on repeated viewings. Even something as mundane as the Jackal buying a melon in an Italian market is for him to go off and do target practise to calibrate his rifle.The Jackal's preparations are meticulous, ingenious. Inspector Thomas's efforts to track down the Jackal's various identities are laborious. But with Lebel leading the police work, they are never too far behind the Jackal.Zinnemann's directing is perfect too. There are wonderful shots, camera angles. The plot development in the first 2 hours is relentless up until the Jackal getting into position. Then there is a sudden change of pace. Almost nothing happens for 10 minutes, all we see are various aspects of the Liberation Day preparations. It's clever because it gives us, the viewer, a breather before the final denouement.I give this film 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Hit-man film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Avoid the awful 1997 remake. Neither Bruce Willis and Richard Gere can hold a candle to Edward Fox and Michael Lonsdale. This older movie is the real deal and an espionage classic in it's own right.The Day of the Jackal (1973) was directed by Fred Zinnemann. His previous film, A Man For All Seasons, won him two Oscars (best director, best picture) and four other Oscars including best screenplay. Zinnemann was at the top of his game when he made this movie.It is France in the 1960s. Algeria is still in French hands, but the local population clamours for independence. Opposing this is ultra right wing French nationalist terrorist cell, the OAS.In the movie one of its military leaders makes the ludicrous claim that the French have always lived there, revealing how pathologically disturbed right wing politics can be. The OAS has so far failed to stop the Algerian independence effort, both facts proving that while the OAS might be a formidable force, its leadership is totally xenophobic and somewhat eccentric; angry men out of touch.Their group however is made up of current and former French officers, so they are not without resources and manpower, some of whom are willing to die for their violent cause. After French President Charles de Gaulle moves to quite rightly hand back Algeria to the Algerians, the OAS of course see this as an outrageous betrayal and immediately set about hiring an assassin to murder him. Enter Edward Fox as wily hit-man "The Jackal". He cares naught for politics. He does however care about this one last retirement score, evading authorities and staying alive long enough to enjoy it. This is Edward Fox's best ever performance. The decision to cast him as the sharp eyed determined yet unassuming assassin is one of the great casting decisions in cinematic history. His every movement, expression, however subtle, tells you at a molecular level what this character was born to do - hide in the general population patiently and strike fast when the opportunity presents itself and then escape quietly before anyone is aware he was ever there. Fox has a small unassuming frame so as not to obviously intimidate anyone, where a larger man is more likely to be remembered. He looks like a Hitchcockian "every man"; he blends in smoother than coffee in milk, entering and leaving unnoticed everywhere he goes. He doesn't have Jimmy Stewart's height to stand out in a crowd, or Cary Grant's memorable dashing good looks. He is however nondescript and lethal.No one is ever able to give a description or remember his several fake names. Even the police overlook him. Fox's performance is just sublime. His calm demeanor and well groomed appearance belies his lethality and puts everyone quickly at ease; Always the consummate professional.The man assigned to hunt him down is the best detective France can muster, Commissioner Label played by bilingual French born Michael Lonsdale. This is one of the best mirror image portrayals of villain and hero in movie history; They are both as cunningly efficient and determined as each other. Based on Frederick Forsyth's novel of the same name, both he and director Zinnemann left no stone unturned in revealing how The Jackal prepares for the hit. It's the hit-man version An Actor Prepares. This is a brilliantly written, directed and acted film. If you like espionage films about assassins, this is the best movie around bar none. The Day of the Jackal (1973) deserves a criterion bluray edition. Please help that effort by emailing distributors if you can. Thank you.</fullReview>

Hitcock went to great pains to demonstrate how hard it is to take a human life in his film Torn Curtain, Fred Zinneman apparently never watched that movie.

		<fullReview>The Day of the Jackal is directed by Fred Zinnerman and adapted to screenplay by Kenneth Ross from the novel of the same name written by Frederick Forsyth. It stars Edward Fox, Michael Lonsdale, Terence Alexander, Michel Auclair, Alan Badel, Tony Britton and Denis Carey. Music is by Georges Delerue and cinematography by Jean Tournier.As the French political climate reaches boiling point over the Algeria situation, underground organisation the OAS plot to have President Charles de Gaulle assassinated. When an attempt fails the OAS members not caught are exiled in Vienna and decide that bringing in an outsider to kill the President is the best way forward now. That outsider is an Englishman, code name The Jackal, a methodically cunning and deadly assassin?Wonderful, the kind of character driven thriller that has become in short supply over the decades. It's all so simple, even sedate, yet this calm approach serves the plotting perfectly. After the initial set ups we follow The Jackal (a super icy turn by Fox) on his mission to kill General de Gaul. His planning, the people he meets, the people he has to kill to stay one step ahead of the authorities. From cons to weapon smuggling, to disguises and sexual encounters, it's thoroughly compelling from Jackal's story arc alone, but the frequent shifts to the hunt for him by a whole ream of suits and detectives is also fascinating viewing.Backing Fox up is a raft quality performers, a cast very much in tune with the material to hand. Delure's musical composition is purposely of the minimalist breed, Tournier's photography is period compliant and smooth, while Ralph Kemplen's excellent editing was rightly nominated for an Academy Award. Zinnerman does sterling work from the director's chair, amazingly keeping a two and half hour movie free of extraneous scenes or pointless exposition. Everything is relative, it really is a film to stay focused with, to give it respect by giving it your undivided attention. So go the bathroom before sitting down to view this truly great and smart thriller. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Day of the Jackal" is one of the best films of the 1970s. However, oddly, it was only nominated for one Oscar--for film editing. Perhaps this film was one that just slipped under the radar or maybe the competition was just too stiff that year, all I know is that is one of the great suspense films.The story is set amidst the tumult of the French losing Tunisia and Algeria. In the 1950s and 60s, nationalists in these two North African countries began fighting the French government for their independence. However, most Frenchmen thought of this land less as colonies and more as part of France itself--and these folks were determined to fight long and hard to keep these lands. As for the French government, they fought hard to keep this land but eventually realized it was an unwinnable war and looked to bring the troops back to the mainland. And, the extreme elements within France saw this as a betrayal. In fact, one group was so upset that they plotted to kill their leader, President Charles de Gaulle. This film is specifically about an assassin, known as 'the Jackal', in his plan to carry off the assassination. What makes this a great film is that the assassin is a cold, calculating and brutal man--played by a rather nondescript but very convincing Edward Fox. In fact, the portrayal is so riveting and convincing, you can't help but getting sucked into this film so expertly directed by Fred Zinnemann. See this one.</fullReview>

The detective is not a James Bond type however. Rather he is a quiet, low-key, slightly frumpy looking man who is none-the-less very good at his job. You're never sure who's going to win in this story, and in fact your not even sure who to root for. Which is great. There's not a lot of gratuitous bombing, sex, violence or what not in this film.

		<fullReview>STORY: The Day of The Jackal is set against the struggles of the paramilitary organisation the OAS in France and their attempts to kill President Charles De Gaulle. With the exact same story as the book, it focuses around one fictional attempt in 1963 when the leaders hire a mysterious foreign professional assassin. It follows this man (The Jackal) as he plans and prepares the assassination whilst the secret service and police detectives launch a secret manhunt for this unknown killer. The film is all about suspense so very little action actually occurs in this film. It may be a little slow for some tastes but I honestly think that's what makes the film so unique. It had me on the edge of my seat almost throughout, and there was no need for recent Hollywood style guns blazing action. It's a film for the intellectual. Also as one reviewer mentioned, it is completely free from clichés. Our killer is never made out to be inherently evil, just a professional doing a job. Similarly, the leading detective on this case is as far from the 'maverick who never plays by the rules but always gets his man' cliché as he could possibly be. This is a definite plus in my books and is what really let the re-make down (the one with Bruce Willis), it was just too American with too much action and too many character clichés. DOTJ has a flawless plot for those with the patience and attention span to go last more than five minutes without a fight or chase scene. The fact that it is based around factual history allowed me to become fully immersed in the film 5/5EXECUTION: Aside from having a brilliant story, the film is also executed remarkably. I'm told Edward Fox (The Jackal) made his name off of this film and that does not surprise me at all, he plays the part exactly as I would have imagined having read the book. He definitely steals the whole show. The other acting is great for the time it was made but is not in the same league as Fox. The film is directed almost as if it were a documentary which suits the style. Again action fans will be disappointed and probably bored by this but I felt it added to the realism. Similarly the fact that there is no soundtrack caused me to become more involved with the characters. I should point out that the film does sometimes show its age especially with the use of the infamous 1960s 'judo chop of death' but I can honestly say it didn't bother me or effect my immersion at all possibly because it's not an action film and the small number of deaths throughout were not a major part of it. The directing style topped with some near perfect acting mean DOTJ is almost perfectly executed, any minor nitpicks can be attributed to its age. 5/5VERDICT: In this day of films basically being poorly done remakes of the Bourne films with ridiculous stunts and strong character clichés, an intellectual film is greatly appreciated. I can see why this film became a classic in the 1970s and I believe it is a timeless masterpiece and a fine example of how films don't need action, swearing or unrealistic characters who 'let their gun do the talking'. Clever dialogue and a very suspenseful story at the expense of fast paced action mean this film won't be for everybody. But those who appreciate a more realistic film which makes them think cannot go wrong with the Day of the Jackal. 5/5 + 5/5 = 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different than the other!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until this night, I had never seen a Fred Zinnemamm film, everybody told me he was expectacular, and then when I finally see a Zinnemamm's movie, I realized, they were right.This director's sense of what is really necessary in the film just amazes me, there are scenes in this film that he saves us from large sequences, with incredibly simple takes, like the one that The Jackal enters Madame Montpellier and in the next take we see them in bed, and I can name many others very elegant scenes, the first one for example, it's very simple and it shows with great objectivity the first attempt to kill the president.And, like the direction, the plot is very simple and well made. If you compare to "The Jackal" with Bruce Willis, where he made a huge weapon that fires projectiles as big as a pen, and it's fired by remote control, you'll see that simplistic and effective plans can be way better than the sophisticated ones.While watching The Jackal's preparation to the attack, I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, it's interesting and entertaining to watch, everything is very well explained, for example, throughout the movie The Jackal uses four different passports, and you know exactly when and where he's changing his identity.Verdict: With simple, but brilliant plot and direction, this movie is has something different than the others cat and mouse movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thriller not to be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Forsyth's book of the same name, this is a typical Fred Zinnemann movie. Whatever I have seen of Zinnemann, his movies are all build-ups to a thrilling end or climax. High Noon can be given as an example. In this case, it is a British Contract Killer code-named "The Jackal" Vs The French Government Officials who want to stop him from killing the French President. The Jackal is hired by a group of rebels who call themselves the OAS to kill the French President. The movie can be broadly divided into two sections - The Jackal's planning and plotting to kill The President which includes forging documents, stealing passports, flirting with women, getting a custom-made weird gun created etc. And on the other hand, the efforts of French officials under the leadership of Police Commissioner Lebel to stop the Jackal from inducing this 'National Emergency'. The Jackal is always one step ahead of the French Officials throughout the movie except the thrilling climax. Zinnemann has taken great care of the minute details due to which Critics can point out very little or no loop-holes in the plot. This movie which has a very complex plot could have gone completely wrong in case of bad direction. But Zinnemann has made sure that it does not happen. Acting wise, Edward Fox who plays The Jackal has done an average job. The person who impressed me was Alan Badel who played Commissioner Lebel. A great thriller not to be missed.Rating : 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic text book example of making an exciting thriller. All praise goes to great director Fred Zinnemann for his brilliantly executed example of film making. This is again a very good example of telling a complex plot with clarity. The visualization of the thrilling best seller book (written by Frederick Forsythe) is so convincing that you can't find single fault. It's not suspense thriller &amp; yet you can't keep your eyes off for a single minute &amp; that's the real beauty of the film. It's story of a code name of professional killer "Jackal", who was hired to assassinate the French president by a group of French people. The portrayal of "Jackal" is suave &amp; smart &amp; Edward Fox has played his part with impeccable performance picking the minute details of smart assassin characteristic traits. The movie is shot with detailing exterior of 70's France &amp; not in Studio. The movie also suggests the commending work of French Police investigation very exhaustively but "Jackal" is smart &amp; how can they stop him is a thing to watch rather than make you read the spoiler. I also appreciate the particularity of planning of assassin; whether it's getting false passport or driving license, getting disguises, carrying a lightweight thin smart sniper gun etc. etc. The movie is 2 hour 20 minutes unstoppable journey of thrill.One of the finest thrilling movie of 70's. Do I have to say- "Must watch"?Ratings-9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film never drags. While complex, if you pay attention, the details in this story render its excellence. Great casting, incredible cinematography... historic! This film has it all. If film can ever be art, this one is likely a prototype.French rebel-patriots desire to assassinate de Gaulle after he liberates Algeria. After failed attempts to kill him, they hire The Jackal to finish the job. The Jackal is effective, ruthless and nobody's fool -- he also manages a quick and hot affair with a French Nobleman's lonely wife.A shrewd, high-ranking French detective is brought in on the case as are the full crime-detection resources of the British and U.S. Governments once 10 Downing Street is alerted to the fact that The Jackal may be an Englishman! Of course, as we near the end, it is a race for time since de Gaulle refuses to hide behind closed doors.Perfect levels of suspense prevail at every moment. A "must view." I find myself re-watching this film on DVD at least once monthly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Day of the Jackal in Germany back in 1974, with German subtitles. I watched it again recently &amp; realized that it had to've been a great film, since I recalled nothing specific, except that it was exciting. Movie is a fictional account of an assassination attempt on French Pres. DeGaulle in 1963, just 3 mos. before JFK was killed. DeGaulle had been a hero of the French resistance but incurred the wrath of senior military people by ceding Algeria its independence in 1962. We follow a pro hit man (Edw. Fox) hired by a group of the disgruntled Army officers as he prepares to kill DeGaulle. We're mesmerized as The Jackal (in French, chacal, presumably an anagram of the killer's real name) jumps from one meticulous procedure to another, including altering the exhaust system on his Alfa Romeo to accommodate his custom-made rifle. The detective assigned to track down the unknown would-be assassin is just as meticulous, if less enthusiatic. Fast-paced &amp; engaging, with no dross.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dangerous, cold and extremely professional murderer,known as "The Jackal" is hired by a group of terrorists, all of them unhappy with the way in which the France's politics is being conducted. He receives the mission to kill the General Charles De Gaulle.Building his plan accurately, he is chased at the same time by all the international authorities, that fear for the De Gaulle's life, and the hunt is set in the whole Europe.Fred Zinneman adapted the famous Frederick Forsith's book with extreme fidelity, and he accomplished one of the most frightening and tense thrillers of the cinema history.Using quick and accelerated cuts, abrupt cameras' movements and zoom effects (that later were adopted and improved by the excellent film director John Frankenheimer), Zinneman not only gave us a significant masterpiece, but also reinvented the proceeding of how to ally suspense and action.The suffocating photography seems to constantly suggest danger and fear, and the strong and vibrant sound track combines with the nervous and explosive plot's climate.A great box-office hit,"The Day of the Jackal" proves that it takes more than shooting and fights to create a nice work and attract people to the theaters:it also takes talent and a well-written, interesting plot.Edward Fox gives an outstanding performance as "The Jackal", portraying his character in a quiet and silent form. Even being slow in some moments, "The Day of the Jackal" maintains the tension and guarantees some hours of fright and entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movies that I have chosen to spend time watching time and time again have the same ending- the good guys win and get the girls. Sure, there are twists every now and then, but in Fred Zinneman's THE DAY OF THE JACKAL, the thrill becomes visible in thriller. Don't get me wrong, (spoiler...) the good guys do win, but the real good guy, the one who you've cried with, cheered for, and smiled at throughout the movie, does not survive. Edward Fox plays the Jackal perfectly. He is carefree with others' lives, but with his own, he missteps not once. The problem with his position was the ease in which a government can keep track of things, which we should be happy about, unless our career is in the line of assassination. The use (or lack thereof) of an in-depth movie score is captivating, a key part in the thrill. Also, the lazing nudity is somewhat awkward, but well placed. It is not over done, nor is it hidden. It is there, and very natural. It is amazing how Zinneman does not over-emphasize the Jackal's death. It is simple, no blood, no screams, just bullets and a burial. And I love the 1956 Alfa Romeo Guilietta Sprint Veloce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant classic thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What we have here is a top quality thriller from Fred Zinnemann! The film is based on the book by Frederick Forsyth and follows a story surrounding the assassination of French president, Charles de Gaulle. The film is, apparently, historically accurate - personally, I can't say whether it is or not, since I don't know much about the situation it follows; but I do know that the film continually achieves it's aim of thrilling the audience, and that's what is most important from my point of view. The film apparently bombed at the box office; and that's hardly surprising, as French history isn't a big point of interest for many other countries - and the fact that it stars an unknown actor in the lead role ensures that the film was on the back foot from the beginning. However, audiences back in 1973 don't know what they were missing - as thrillers don't come much more assured and classy than this one! The film follows the French Foreign Legion as they hire a professional assassin to dispose of the president. We then follow said professional, as well as a French detective as it counts down to the supposed day of the president's death.This is something of an odd thriller, as director Fred Zinnemann continually keeps the action relaxed and there is no music score; or obvious attempts to build tension. All the suspense flows from the central plot, and by keeping everything relaxed - the film has a 'calm before the storm' atmosphere throughout, which serves both in being foreboding and ensuring that the audience always wants to know what's going to happen next. Zinnemann hardly shows the target upon which the whole movie revolves around - namely, President de Gaulle, and this is of benefit to the film as it means that the action can focus on the more important plot threads of the assassin and the detective. The acting is good throughout, with unknown actor Edward Fox doing well in providing a frighteningly incognito performance as the Jackal. The plotting is good also, and Kenneth Ross' screenplay is perfectly pitched in providing thrills, as well as focusing on the implication of the plot itself. Overall, this is a finely tuned and classy little thriller and one that should not be missed by anyone that calls themselves a film fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent portrayal of two professionals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of this movie involves two men. One man is out to kill De Gaulle, and the other is trying to stop him. Both are professional, and they carry themselves in a professional manner. This is the greatest strength of the movie. Neither Lonsdale or Fox "act" in this movie. They don't go for any overblown dramatics or make any big speeches. They focus on the job at hand, which is to portray two men who are solely concerned with their job.This movie is a chess game, played between two professionals at the top of their game. The movie is shown from the perspective of both men. We see the assassin planning and executing this mission, and we see the policeman unraveling the plot, and later pursuing the assassin.There are no leaps of logic or unbelievable coincidences. We see the value of meticulous preparation and of detailed police work. The only lucky break the police get is in the initial discovery of the plot through the abduction of one of the conspirators, a break needed to set up the plot of the movie, but this is the only time that the police get such a break.This movie is well worth watching, not only for the enjoyment of the movie and plot itself, but also to see an excellent example of restrained film making. This is a top notch thriller, one of the best examples of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter how often I watch this movie, I just never grow tired of it. It's a movie that I always enjoy watching and I find it to be a very entertaining one.The movie has a wonderful story. It's also an unique one, because it for once focuses more on the bad guy than on the good guys. The movie follows the assassin, nicknamed the jackal, on his mission to murder the French president De Gaulle. We see his preparations and how he slowly maneuvers himself into positions, and mingles with people and blend in with the crowd, all to achieve his goal. Of course not everything is going as planned and he has to improvise his way through situations, at times, while the police is getting closer and closer to finding out his true identity- and his track. The entire story is extremely well constructed and build up fantastic. The story takes it time to unfold things and everything eventually leads up to the fantastic end finale, that truly is unforgettable, as is the entire movie as a whole.The cast is also a reason why this movie works so very well and is an unforgettable one. The cast of the movie is not filled with some 'big' well known names but rather with some excellent, lesser known actors, that were cast because of their abilities to play the character and not because of their well known name. Edward Fox shines as the jackal and he perhaps plays his most memorable part out of his career. Michael Lonsdale, who plays the main 'good guy' of the movie but yet is only introduced half way through the movie, also plays one of his best and most memorable roles.It certainly is a good and at times tense thriller but it mostly also is a very entertaining one to watch. It's no heavy movie and despite its long running time, the movie never has a slow or lesser moment in it. It's a very consistent movie, due to it's well written script and most excellent directing, from multiple Oscar winning- and nominee, director Fred Zinnemann.For the people who can appreciate a movie with a well build up thriller-story, this is a most definite must-see! Truly one of the very best thrillers and also certainly one of the most enjoyable ones ever made. It's yet another essential '70's viewing.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Jackal succeeds on every level: entertainment, suspense, historical drama, and pure filmmaking. Veteran director Fred Fenneman, best-known for "High Noon" and "From Here to Eternity", does a masterful job of capturing the post-war tensions swirling through Europe by showing us an assassination plot against Pres. DeGaulle of France through the eyes of the people directly involved. A feeling of war-time intrigue pervades the story even though it is set in 1963, 18 years after the liberation of Paris by the Allies. While the Allied governments continue to celebrate past victories, we get the sense that there are many issues left unresolved, scars that haven't yet healed.Enter "the Jackal", a suave, young assassin played by Edward Fox. France's Secret Army Organization (OAS) wants to kill DeGaulle; they explain that "we are patriots, not terrorists." Mr. "Jackal" doesn't care: his price is "Half a million -- Dollars, not francs." That was a LOT of money back in 1963, but the "patriots" have no choice -- their own attempts have failed miserably, and they have only one chance left.There is a definite "Holmes vs. Moriarity" feel to the chase that ensues between the Jackal and the hapless French detective assigned to find him. The assassin changes identities like he changes clothes, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake; plus the detective must deal with an informant tied into France's Cabinet of Ministers. Director Fenneman lets the plot thicken slowly and carefully, with an eye to detail and nuance that is rarely seen in modern films.Add this DVD to your collection. I promise that you will enjoy this movie again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this movie on TCM, (long may they run!). I, personally, like some of the anti-hero movies and this movie, among others of the seventies, is excellent. To me, it represents the disillusioned decade, even though it is set in the sixties. You just don't know who to root for...For those who critique the photography: It seemed to come across as almost like a documentary, not unlike "Network"...my opinion. I noticed that, unlike "Network", they started off with narration, but after the beginning you heard no more of it.As for the pace: My young charges, (a.k.a. My Kids), have noted that modern movies have too fast a pace. I would have to say that even "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy tried to stuff too many visuals into the film, especially the last two films. Give me some time to breathe! This being said, I did find myself nodding off toward the end of "Jackal"...My favorite part of this film is the end. At the ceremonies, we find our detective almost frantic, because he KNOWS Jackal is there, but doesn't know where. As I watch the detective trying to be everywhere at once, searching, wondering, all of a sudden it hit me; I don't know where he is EITHER! Just about then he comes up the street on his crutches...It was a great hook!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vive le Jackal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These days, it's fascinating to see Edward Fox playing crusty old gents in episodes of "Midsummer Murders" or "Agatha Christie's Miss Marple" when you know that back in the day, he was a super-fit assassin who could kill with one blow from the back of his hand.In fact he was just about the best hit man ever in just about the best thriller ever. Although "The Day of the Jackal" was made in 1973, with not one smartphone or desktop computer in sight, it is still the police procedural par excellence.I love all the detail as Edward Fox's methodical Jackal plans to assassinate Charles De Gaulle, and how Michael Londsale's equally methodical French policeman, Claude Label, plans to stop him.When I first saw the movie in 1973, many of the British actors such as Maurice Denham, Derek Jacobi and Cyril Cusack etc., were familiar, but over the intervening years, they became almost like old friends, turning up in countless movies and television shows.The French actors and extras were perfectly cast, from the tough-looking characters playing OAS and Action Service men to the Citroën chauffeured members of parliament, and the beautiful widow who uses her charms to get information about the government's plans.A few years ago, I lent the DVD to a friend who watched it with his teenage son. When I asked what they thought of it, he told me his son thought it lacked action ? I think he felt the same. That attitude goes some way to explaining why over the decades; the ratio of action-heavy movies to films of depth has risen exponentially.The more you see of Fred Zinneman's movies the more you appreciate how good he was; a perfectionist. Where it could be argued that the movies of many of his famous contemporaries went off as they aged ? Ford, Huston, Preminger ? his movies never did. Even his last one "Five Days One Summer" is a beautifully understated and underrated cult classic.However there is little doubt about "The Day of the Jackal" ? it's a lesson in how to put a film together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Portrait of the Contract Killer as He Plies His Creepy Trade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, set primarily in early 1960s Paris, offers a close look at a person who spends his life accepting contracts to kill other people in exchange for large wads of cash. The Jackal is a cold, calculating and very intelligent killer determined to succeed in his mission to whack the president of France, Charles de Gaulle. It does not matter much why this supposedly needs to be done. He agrees to kill on behalf of a fringe group of self-styled patriots who are incensed that Algeria has been granted its independence by the president. (As though it were his to confer!) The question how assassinating the president might alter the French renunciation of Algeria as a territory is not really treated in the film, but one surmises from their quasi-religious fervor that the members of the group somehow think that they can spark some sort of political revolution.The gist of this film is a close-up view of the contract killer in action?including the intricacies of his plan and his amoral (or is that immoral?) modus operandi?and the French police and security forces as they attempt to stop him. It's quite a story, with plenty of suspense and twists and turns, but the best part is the realistic and convincing portrayal of the sociopathic Jackal, who will stop at nothing to complete his contract and receive the second half of the huge amount of cash which awaits him. I regard The Day of the Jackal as one the best films on hit men ever made, right up there with Le Samoura?. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this movie is a Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movies seems to me more intense and captivating when shown can be real. And this is a mandatory condition for action movies, thrillers, science fiction, etc.As we all know, most of Hollywood movies (even non-action) still very much lacking credibility because, among other things, they use exaggerated and unnatural methods to create a more dramatic (but unrealistic) effect in the viewer.A lot of thrillers could have been much better if it were not for this craving of "happening things" every second...thus all the magic is lost.This movie is full of magic. And this magic means that you believe what is happening.There is very little music in the film, and is unobtrusive. Photography is nothing gimmicky, and the actors performance is very natural. Special mention to the two women have a small role in the film: Olga Georges-Picotbut and Delphine Seyrig: their performance are remarkable.Editing is also the opposite of a modern film: the pace is perfect, and takes it's time when needed. Today the shots do not last more than a few seconds, and the action scenes hundredths of a second ... as a video clip or a Coke we drink in a minute and then we throw away. I prefer to drink red wine Petrus 1973 Pomerol and taste it slowly...</fullReview>

The thing I like most about the film is how deep it delves into the preparation needed for a hit-man to preform his assignment. It serves as one of the most reliable book to movie adaptations ever never leaving out anything important. Another cool thing is that it uses no soundtrack, it just uses natural sounds like the ticking of a clock or the sound of cars and people to show the time passing by. A movie well worth watching multiple times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arguably the finest cat-n-mouse thriller ever made. Fred Zinnemann's film of the Frederick Forsyth best-seller is so well put together and so exciting it's nearly hypnotic. Edward Fox is the eponymous assassin, hired to kill French President Charles de Gaulle. Michel Lonsdale is the cop charged with tracking him down and stopping him. Filmed at break-neck speed with excellent acting, great cinematography by Jean Tournier and astounding editing by Ralph Kemplen. Fox &amp; Lonsdale are excellent and the large supporting cast includes Cyril Cusack (in quite the unusual role), Derek Jacobi, Alan Badel and Tony Britton. The always interesting Delphine Seyrig has a very odd cameo. Shot in France, England and Italy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense Thriller which will keep you glued to the edge of your seat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel of the same name by bestselling novelist Frederick Forsyth, the film is about a professional assassin known only as the "Jackal" who is hired to assassinate French president Charles de Gaulle in the summer of 1963.Though the assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle and subsequent capture, trial and execution of Jean Bastien-Thiry a member of the militant French underground organisation OAS really happened, the part about the remaining OAS leaders hiring a contract killer codenamed the Jackal is purely fictitious and never happened in real life. The film spans the period between the time the attempt on Charles de Gaulle's life is made up to the time the Jackal gets his chance to take him out. The excellent administration of Charles de Gaulle manages to discover that a second assassination attempt would be made and immediately set up a task force with detective Claude Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) heading the investigation in the hope that they can catch the Jackal before it it is too late... An excellent cast, script, background sound effects and photography make this film one of the best in its genre.Other films based on Frederick Forsyth novels: The Dogs of War, The Odessa File, The Fourth Protocol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, there are Literally Thousands of Movies out there with lots of Gunfights, Explosions, Sexy Ladies, Fisticuffs and Expounding Musical Scores, this is not one of them. It decides to take an Approach of Clean and Cool Detachment. A Docu-Style that is as Refreshing as it is Riveting. It is a Compelling Piece of Cinema in the way it is so Meticulous and Calculating. Heavy on Detail and the Pacing, Editing, and Exposition provide the Suspense and the Drama. The Film Effortlessly Divides the Story between the Assassin and Law Enforcement with Crisp, Lean, Dialog and the Action comes from Preparation, and like the rest of the Movie, there is nothing that is Padded or Unnecessary.Its Tension is in its Restraint as both Sides are Increasingly Clever and Resourceful as Things move along with the Elegance of a Streamlined Sports Car. Minimalist in Style but not in Production, it Masks its Difficulties with an Anti-Style that becomes Hypnotic and Attains a Style of its Own. No Visceral Attempts are made but they are Forthcoming. No Pretensions as the Taut Tempo comes from the Technicalities and both Protagonist and Antagonist are as Cold and Calculating as they need to be. This makes for a Fictional-True-Crime Thriller that is a Heartless but Palpitating Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow and precise procedural, a little after its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A police procedural in the guise of a political thriller, "Day of the Jackal" is impressively-detailed but more restrained than many of its peers. Star power and the promise of intense action took its genre cousins "The French Connection" and "Three Days of the Condor," for example, to $40-50 million finishes in 1971 and 1975, respectively, but the slower-boiling "Jackal" barely broke $16 million. In quality of production, "Jackal" excels but seems to hearken back. It has the feel of an early 1960s film (and since it is set in 1963 that is appropriate), with the clothes and the cinematography and even the posh European setting all feeling right for a slick actioner of that era. The plot follows detectives and assassins, the first always half a step behind the second, but there is none of that stuff called "grit" that defines so many crime and espionage movies from the 1970s onward. Everything is in broad daylight, beautifully-shot with the smooth, washed-out look of director Zinnemann's other color productions like "Julia" (1977) and "A Man for All Seasons" (1966), and the necessary violence is handled perfunctorily and virtually bloodlessly. Nobody shouts, the one car crash is an accidental fender-bender, and when a French minister is implicated in an embarrassing security breach in the middle of a briefing he quietly apologizes and excuses himself. Nobody makes a scene. The decision to go with a low-key script is interesting, especially since the audience presumably knows that President Charles de Gaulle was not the victim of assassination and therefore knows from the beginning how the main plot will end. But the strength of a procedural, as opposed to a thriller, is not always in tension but in detail and the depiction of characters, and in these respects Zinnemann is master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For some reason, this film doesn't get respect it deserves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It usually gets anywhere from 3 to 3 and 1/2 stars (out of four) from every "professional" reviewer. Unfair! A real thriller, start to finish. Although, Fox was something of a skinny runt, he had no trouble killing several people in seconds,with no struggle, with his bear hands. Hardly believable, but an excellent film just the same.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!Two items: Was the Jackal supposed to have slept with the homosexual he met at the Turkish bath? A: I just finished the book, and answer is NO! He said he wasn't feeling well, &amp; slept on the couch. Whew!Why did he have to kill the rich broad he slept with? She knew nothing about him and couldn't have been a threat to him. Unless it was just to steal her car?A: Again, book says she WAS a threat to him, since she'd gone trough his belongings, listened in on his phone calls, and even accused him of being the Jackal. I wonder why this was left out of the movie? This would have created some tension, and answered a lot of questions from viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched a lot of thrillers of this era and it seems to me that "Day of the Jackal" is the cream of the crop. The story of a far-right group's attempt to assassinate French president Charles de Gaul in 1963, this movie isn't particularly political in nature - it really isn't concerned with arguing to the viewer that one side or the other was correct. I'm convinced that this is actually good for a thriller, as it lets it concentrate on, you know, thrilling the audience, rather than delivering some political sermon, which will inevitably distract some or all of the audience from the suspense. The source material, the Frederick Forsythe novel, helps the movie in that it was, for its day, an apparently accurate imagining of how one would go about assassinating a world leader, exploiting holes in security that existed at the time to generate fake identities, smuggle weapons past customs and security, and so on, to the extent that the novel was a bit of an embarrassment to various countries when reporters learned the tactics it describes actually would work. Part of a thriller is realism - it's hard to care about characters and events we don't feel are realistic, it's why we laugh at deaths in dumb action movies and cry at deaths during say, Schindler's List - so the realism has to be an asset here. The movie is steeped in realism, down to the assassin's gun-maker describing why mercury is the best chemical to use in making explosive bullets, or how he had to use stainless steal for the gun's barrel. A major reason this movie works is it's not full of unrealistic "Hollywood" constructions and tricks but you actually feel like what's going on is a pretty accurate depiction of an attempted political assassination.The movie's direction is top-notch, weaving together the stories of the right wing conspirators, the political and police investigation into the assassin, and of course the assassin himself as they all get closer and closer to the moment of truth. It is all done in carefully edited interchanging scenes - we might see a spy seducing a top government official in one scene, and just before it gets tedious there's a cut to the assassin going about another stage in his planning. It's generally done quite well, building the tension in a way somewhat similar to the classic police procedural "The Naked City" which ends similarly with a highly energetic climax, the natural way to end the slow and deliberate build.If the movie does have a fault, it seems to be the middling section just before the Jackal arrives in Paris where he is involved in a car wreck. I fail to see what this really adds to the story except length, and it confounds the story of his relationship with the french Noblewoman, and is the only part of the movie that veers slightly into not seeming realistic. Still, the movie adaptation does thankfully shorten the novel's unnecessarily complicated treatment of the Jackal courting a homosexual Parisian to provide him with cover.I have now seen most of the big-budget thrillers of the 1970s and I must say "Day of the Jackal" is at the top of the list. It's one of the more engaging movies I've seen lately. It's a shame that its lack of star power seems to have doomed it to obscurity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A towering, classic work by Fred Zinnemann</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best thrillers ever is this documentary-style film of a contract killer's preparation and stalk of President Charles de Gaulle. British actor Edward Fox is the blonde foreigner who moves from one European capital to another as he prepares to cash in on the biggest assignment of his career. The film is long but moves at a good clip and is gripping throughout and the suspense and planning are what carry the film to its climactic endgame. There is almost no musical accompaniment in the movie as the Jackal meticulously plans for the big moment. His path crosses with interesting, if not sympathetic, characters as he closes in on his quarry, and the film becomes a game of chess between the assassin and French detective Claude Lebel. Director Fred Zinnemann's picture is truly a classic work that may never be equaled for its professional look and presentation, great cast, and wonderful drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic text book example of making an exciting thriller. All praise goes to great director Fred Zinnemann for his brilliantly executed example of film making. This is again a very good example of telling a complex plot with clarity. The visualization of the thrilling best seller book (written by Frederick Forsythe) is so convincing that you can't find single fault. It's not suspense thriller &amp; yet you can't keep your eyes off for a single minute &amp; that's the real beauty of the film. It's story of a code name of professional killer "Jackal", who was hired to assassinate the French president by a group of French people. The portrayal of "Jackal" is suave &amp; smart &amp; Edward Fox has played his part with impeccable performance picking the minute details of smart assassin characteristic traits. The movie is shot with detailing exterior of 70's France &amp; not in Studio. The movie also suggests the commending work of French Police investigation very exhaustively but "Jackal" is smart &amp; how can they stop him is a thing to watch rather than make you read the spoiler. I also appreciate the particularity of planning of assassin; whether it's getting false passport or driving license, getting disguises, carrying a lightweight thin smart sniper gun etc. etc. The movie is 2 hour 20 minutes unstoppable journey of thrill.One of the finest thrilling movie of 70's. Do I have to say- "Must watch"?Ratings-9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie one night after renting it from a local movie store. I was pleasantly surprised by the plot and detail that went into this movie.French radicals want to have the famous French leader assassinated. They hire a professional hit-man whom they call "Jackal." The movie gives us the views of both the Jackal and the crack cops who try to catch him. The Jackal is a very skilled hit-man and the steps which he take to attempt to assassinate the French leader are shown in the movie. The countermeasures are also shown.This movie is extremely entertaining because it shows you the side of the assassin, not just the police. You actually feel for the hit-man after a while.This movie gets a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a decent rendition of the novel--an exciting interesting page turner. Maybe even it was better than the novel as it only took 2 hours instead of 10 or so to get through.My only problem with basically a well done movie was there are too many non French looking small part actors. That makes sense since they all spoke English. Also the street scenes have pedestrians oggling at the cameras in the distance. The close up one's often look self conscious.I guess the movie was made in a period not that long after a time when orientals were portrayed by Caucasians with eye make up. So why not Americans speaking English playing French maids etc...And it is a trade off if the movie were produced today it would likely have all kinds of annoying PC stuff in it.This movie certainly keeps you engaged.Cars: I like looking at the old cars some one mentioned some of them were out of the correct time frame. I noticed that and also wondered why a very rich woman living in a giant châteaux would drive a Renault Floride (an inexpensive little convertible).RECOMMEND</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day of the Cold Assassin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superb, tense thriller which unfolds methodically like some amazing documentary, Forsyth's and Zinnemann's tale of political assassination remains one of the best, if not THE Best, of the modern thrillers. The plot involves the latest plan of French extremists to kill French President de Gaulle and takes place in 1963. When I first saw this about 25 years ago, I was almost convinced I was watching an actual chain of historical events, somehow captured by surreptitious cameras all over Europe. The extremists hire an outsider, a professional assassin (the innocuous-seeming Fox), as a last resort. Edward Fox's portrayal of the code-named Jackal is still the greatest interpretation of what a real professional assassin is like. Later films usually depicted assassins as flamboyant, unusual-looking killers, but here it's understood that in order to be successful, such killers need to blend in (even in the remake in '97, though Bruce Willis underplayed, he still stood out in a crowd).This film is also unusual in that the audience is usually following along with the villain, Fox (meticulous in his planning), rather than a hero. When the French authorities get wind of the assassination plot, a cat-and-mouse (or cat-and-rat in this case) game ensues all over Europe, with the cunning Jackal always a step ahead of the combined police forces. We learn a bit about the Jackal as the story progresses - he truly is a cold killer when called for (in his eyes); he's obviously quite intelligent, coldly calculating, and a master planner. He must have a huge ego and loads of arrogance, continuing his plan even when he later knows all of France is aware of him. There's also something of a British aristocratic air about him. But we don't learn all that much - he remains a man of mystery, a strange cypher moving about the environs of Europe. He's a somewhat fascinating character; just count yourself fortunate you never wind up socializing with someone like him in a Turkish bath or similar locales.The rest of the cast are top notch, all character actors who disappear into the roles of supposedly real historical personnel. Lonsdale stands out as the main detective on the case; he's also obviously very intelligent and others are usually underestimating him. You sense he's the only one who has a chance of figuring out the Jackal's next move and perhaps out-thinking him. Even the Jackal admits early on that de Gaulle has the best security force in the world! But, in the end, the Jackal really proves to be smarter than all the law-enforcement officials. It's a fitting, perfect finale to the lengthy chase. Really excellent.</fullReview>

There are numerous shots of various clocks. Because of the time-frame of the story (early sixties) everything is analog. Found a couple of plot-holes, but they're so nit-picky I won't even bother putting them out there.Also found the early interrogation scenes much, much more disturbing since the Abu Ghraib scandals became public.Be patient, not every scene is action-packed, and you will be richly rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The creme de la creme of suspense films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is, without a doubt, my favorite of all time. It is the epitome of what movie making should be, in my opinion. It takes a simple premise and slowly builds on it from many angles until finally the tension is released right near the end. Nothing is given away until the end. Nothing is obvious. The surprises just don't stop coming. Needless to say, I was at the edge of my seat, in true suspense, the entire time I watched it the first time, back in 1973, when it was released, but even today when I put the film on, I find that I have no trouble focusing and keeping my attention on the screen and the story.The acting is superb. The protagonist does an EXCELLENT job of building his character, and the supporting cast does a great job in putting the rest of the pieces together in a nice, neat package.I later read the book, which fills in some of the nuances that would be difficult to capture on film, but the film stands extremely well on its own, believe me, in telling the story. And it is true to the book in almost every way, something I really respect in movie making.If you haven't ever seen the movie, I would recommend going to the nearest movie rental store and either renting or buying it ASAP.My rating is 10 stars out of 10....I won't comment on the nineties remake except to say that it a feeble attempt at retelling the story. Focus on the original--THAT is where the action truly lies!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Superb - NO SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incredibly good film. Fox delivers a masterful performance, largely non verbal, of the kind only seen in films such as Get Carter (by Michael Caine). The supporting cast is excellent, Lonsdale and Jacobi are a joy to watch as the police, hot on Fox's tail. The Jackal himself is so ingenious that one cannot help wishing him to succeed - hands up all those who grin when he does not take that turning for Italy. Though - not wanting to spoil the fun - we do feel that Lonsdale is formidable in his pursuit.As for the sentiments of other users that the film is slow; the pace is unrelenting in its furthering of the plot - there are no superfluous elements and one need look no further than how quickly the film ends once the final nail is in the coffin to see where the film's sympathies lie in terms of indulgent elaboration. So many of today's films lack this concise execution and the confidence that a story can be told in actions and significant dialogue without incessant (and largely visceral) use of music and trendy editing.Thus, Day of The Jackal stands the test of time to rival most modern thrillers - strip the latter of their various production value gimmicks and one is rarely left with such a sturdy yarn as this. There is nothing whatever to adversely date Day of The Jackal - no holes barred or corners cut. A first rate thriller, 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawless thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful, stylish, unrelentingly tense thriller. Despite its storyline about the chase to catch an unknown assassin hired to kill de Gaulle, the movie is surprisingly free of gore and graphic violence. In fact, the only uncomfortable depiction of violence comes, ironically enough, while the police are torturing a terrorist for information. Edward Fox's Jackal is an efficient, surgical killer, who dispatches those in his way without superfluous brutality. This almost mechanical, impersonal sort of killing is one of the most frightening aspects of his character; through it we catch glimpses of a completely dead soul under the charming, attractive surface the Jackal presents to the world.This movie relies on the viewer's intelligence to pick up on the subtle hints and nuances scattered throughout; as the Jackal crosses the border, we see his silent glance at the other travellers being stopped: tall and blonde, like himself, and we are immediately inside the mind of the killer, recognizing that the police are already on his trail. Michael Lonsdale is great as the deceptively slow-moving, soft-spoken Inspector Lebel. It is agonizing to see him being patronizingly thanked and dismissed by the Cabinet when he has almost captured the Jackal, only to be frantically summoned back after the confident officials have wasted precious time trying and failing to close in on the assassin themselves. We can feel Lebel's frustration as all his hard work is wasted, and in the end it all comes down to trying to spot the killer in the massive Liberation Day crowds. Although the outcome is a matter of history, this film still keeps the viewer tense and wondering how it will all end right up to the last moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I'd remembered it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film as an astonished child, and because it was withdrawn from TV (apparently because its DIY guide to assassination was too informative), it began to grow a talismanic importance in my memories. The reasons for my astonishment were legion. Here was a film that dared to reject the tyranny of character cinema in favour of pure mathematics. There is a spare, beautiful geometry to the plot. A wants to shoot B; C wants to protect B; C goes after A. Nothing is allowed intrude on this angular perfection - the plot is an inexorable tracing of clean lines.I also loved the concomitant fact that the film rejected conventional notions of heroes and villains. There is no character whatsoever in this film, just parts of the plot's design. We are frequently shown weapons being pulled apart and put together, trains,. vehicles, roads, and especially clocks - we are simply watching a mechanism, the assemblage of clockwork. Imagine if THE TERMINATOR was really about the Terminator: JACKAL's characters are all robots, walking through their inevitable paces. This gives the film a strange dreamlike effect.The film is quite sly about its mechanical effect, and plays with our atavistic need for human empathy. When the Jackal goes to a graveyard, and stands by an infant's grave, we think we might be getting biographical information, an explanation of why he does what he does - maybe this infant was his brother. But he's only looking for somebody's identity to steal. Later, we are given a travelogue of Paris through his eyes. This is very attractive and humanising, until we realise that he's looking for a vantage point from which to kill.JACKAL is very brave in never letting this up - as Hollywood proved, his character could be reduced to mush. Here he remains a killing machine, and the climax is very chilling: the only reason the Jackal doesn't succeed is the purest of chances (this was much more plausible than I'd remembered). This was another reason to love it - the use of the detective story. Here no crime has been committed - the police are in fact chasing two phantoms - this unknown Jackal, and a projection into the future (the crime).Finally there was the setting, in the world's most enrapturing country, France.Of course, having seen much more films since, JACKAL could only disappoint. The remembered tightness of the plot was actually highly porous, which is normally overlookable, but fatal when the main character IS the plot (see below for an amusing point-by-point review of its flaws). The film's amorality was still beautiful, but the indifference to actual politics nagged me, although, even if de Gaulle's dodgy track record was overlooked, we got some idea of how close to a police state his France was.Most disappointing though was the direction. Zinnemann just doesn't seem to know what to do with this wonderful material - it's ironic that his supposedly 'humanist' films are let down by his mechanical direction, and yet he can do nothing but prettify a confection of pure mechanics. Can you imagine what a work of genius this could have been in Melville's hands? There were two amazing films about hitmen in the decade prior to JACKAL - LE SAMOURAI and IL CONFORMISTA - so this just isn't good enough.And yet it almost is, thanks to Edward Fox. Although he is still a machine, the most fascinating parts of the film are when he breaks down. Zinnemann uses some quietly remarkable effects, more effective for them being sparse, of the Jackal losing control, whether it's through slow-motion, breaks in sound, or whatever, which almost confers a Melvillean grace. These are all the more powerful for not derailing the plot, and not being explained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Suspense Movie Ranking High</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Film ranks high in Suspense Movies List. It's too sophisticated to understand by Easy Movie goers. It's shot in France, Italy and England - so, it preserves some charm for this part of Europe for times past and long gone. It is, by the way, pure European thriller with local cast and directed by Austrian Fred Zinnemann (1907?1997) who made score of Films for Hollywood studios. Maybe I won't get credit but it resembles a Hitchcock movie by the intricacy of plot and evolving of drama, narrated in documentary style.The gem of performance is Edward Fox as hired assassin "Jackal". This is anagram for name coming from (Cha)rles (Cal)trop. The Jackal uses forged identity by falsifying birth certificate of dead person (Paul Duggan) and stealing two other passports. He then kills 5-6 people on his way to the Paris Plaza where he misses President De Gaulle by inch and get eliminated by Commissar Lebel (Michael Lonsdale). Two women participate in the Movie - Delphine Seyrig as middle-aged Frenchwoman who is killed after an affair with the Jackal; plus, Olga Georges-Picot as Denise (his link to Algerian terrorists that pay half million dollars for targeting the President). All is based on true story documented by Frederick Forsyth and written as a novel.I proceed to reminiscences of today, which is 40 years from time. Today, my friends, such a Movie is impossible to procure or even protocol. We live in a World where everything is being watched, filmed, listened to, recorded, tracked, entered on databases and put on lists. Targeted are government and private agencies, big business and ordinary fellows, fraudsters and organized crime. The World is daunting array of electronic gear ... This is citation from book on "Total Surveillance", published by Piatkus in 2000 (author is not mentioned for discretion).I ask, subsequently, the following question - should people like Julian Assange and Edward Snowden be perceived as villains for publishing secret American documents. After all, their starting point was ECHELON system for intelligence gathering - based on signal interception by radomes (those giant golf balls on Earth landscape). I recede now ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the 'Jackal', Killing The President is All in a Day's Work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fred Zinnemann's 'The Day of the Jackal' is a patient, studied and quasi-documentary translation of Frederick Forsyth's best-selling political suspense novel. The film appeals more to the intellect than the brute senses, as it traces the detection of an assassin hired to kill French President Charles de Gaulle.The story is set in Paris during a week in August of 1962. President De Gaulle (played by an uncanny look-alike), by granting Algeria their independence, upsets right-wing extremists and disgruntled war veterans, who form a secret terrorist organization known as OAS and vow to assassinate him. The film opens to a failed attempt on De Gaulle as he rides in a motorcade. After the OAS culprits are arrested and their leader executed six months later, their new leader and his three top aides secretly hire a mysterious Englishman- the eponymous Jackal (Fox) - to assassinate the President. Jackal accepts the offer and begins his methodical work to prepare the assassination. In the meantime, French security services receive some information about OAS plans and decide to hand over the case to Inspector Lebel (Lonsdale), the best investigator in France. But he doesn't even know who the jackal is. He learns the name "Jackal" from an informer in the plotter's ranks and cleverly pieces together the identity of the killer-for-hire.What follows is an intricate and meticulous story with a parallel structure that details the Jackal's preparations for the assassination and Lebel's efforts to stop him. The major asset of the film is that it succeeds in maintaining interest and suspense despite obvious viewer foreknowledge of the outcome. Director Zinnemann faithfully follows the source, presenting a precise, almost discomfiting reconstruction of the story. He directs it with the skill of a master craftsman, creating a riveting cat-and-mouse game between the mysterious lone-wolf hired assassin known only by his code name and the master policeman in charge of the investigation. He does a fine job of presenting the narrative in such a precise way despite offering no psychological analysis or humor, building in tension to the concluding assassination attempt. Playing the titular Jackal, Edward Fox is superb as the coldly impassionate killer. He's boyishly charming, impeccably groomed, possessed of an easy laugh, and casually ruthless. Michael Lonsdale is properly plodding, yet magnificently analytical as the detective tracking him down.The Day of the Jackal is a polished, electrifying thriller, mercifully unburdened with heavy political digressions. The screenplay meticulously assembles an incredible array of material, and then Fred Zinnemann choreographs it so that the story - complicated as it is - unfolds in almost documentary starkness. Telling the story very methodically, by exposing small details that would later be important pieces of great puzzle, he manages to achieve a dignified tone and compelling pace seldom seen in latter-day thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless political thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Fred Zinnemann's "The Day of the Jackal" faithfully follows the Frederick Forsyth best-selling novel (The Dogs of War), which presents an unpretentious and precise reconstruction of the story. Zinnemann's low-key approach is a textbook example of how to make an exciting and sophisticated suspense film without relying on overblown action sequences or flashy visual effects. Zinnemann establishes a pace that is deliberate, but never boring.An underground terrorist group in France, the OAS, decide to hire a professional killer to assassinate French President Charles De Gaulle (Adrien Cayla-Legrand) after their previous attempts have failed. Their next move is to hire a professional assassin, an English hit man responsible for several high-profile assassinations. Charles Calthrop (Edward Fox) accepts the contract to assassinate the President, and takes on the alias of 'Jackal'. The Jackal methodically prepares to put his plan into action: gathering a new identity, collecting forged documents and a French passport, and finally a custom-built rifle. Top French police investigator Lebel (Michel Lonsdale) learns the name 'Jackal' from an informer in the plotter's ranks and cleverly pieces together the identity of the killer-for-hire.As with all good thrillers, it's the chase leading up to the climactic finale that is the best part of watching the plot unfold. In relating its tense tale of political wrangling, the intricate and meticulous story develops with a parallel structure that details the Jackal's preparations for the assassination, and Lebel's ongoing efforts to stop him. Fox is superb as the coldly impassioned assassin, and Lonsdale is magnificently analytical as the obsessive detective tracking him down. Despite its measured pace, the tension slowly mounts as the Jackal closes in on his high value target, and the authorities pull out all the stops to find him first. A taut, fascinating, and timeless political thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fox is the Jackal ... the President is the Prey ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In thrillers' orthodoxy, the effectiveness of suspense relies on the outcome's unpredictability. If the main character is a killer, there has to be chances for his success, and any slight intuition that he might not accomplish his mission would severely undermine the film's value as a thriller.However, there is no rule without exceptions, and on that level, "The Day of the Jackal", released by Fred Zimmerman in 1973, is a fantastic school-case proving that thrills can be efficiently driven regardless of what they're leading up to. The film, adapted from Frederick Forsyth's best-seller, centers on a professional killer, Edward Fox as 'the Jackal' assigned by the underground army group OAS to assassinate General De Gaulle, on anger for his granting the independence to Algeria, thus betraying his vows to the French Army.And there are reasons why the 'Jackal' demands half-a million dollars for his services besides danger and De Gaulle's difficulty to be 'approached': he's giving them France on a silver plate, he'll never be able to work again and they can use their networks to rob banks and jewelries ? not to mention he has to make sure he can escape after the killing. Naturally, all these precautions hardly matter on the long term, we know De Gaulle will live, but it's less in the killing than the way its planning is masterfully and meticulously constructed, Zimmerman displays indeed a level of craftsmanship matching the Jackal's professionalism.'Professionalism" is a key word enhancing "The Day of the Jackal"'s cinematic greatness. The film chronicles with a documentary-like realism all the steps, every single move anticipating the assassination. To obtain a passport, he uses the birth certificate of an Englishman who'd be his age if he didn't die at 2, he then moves to Genoa to order false passports from a forger and a lightweight rifle with telescopic sight and a silencer from a gunsmith. Meanwhile, he spots the apartment in Paris with the best view on Place du 18 Juin 1940, duplicates the key to the upper flat, and steals a passport in London's airport from a Danish tourist.To spice up the plot, the French Secret Services spot the location where the OAS members exiled and their investigation concludes on another plot against the President. They have clues that a fair-haired Englishman visited the place but nothing else. The way their services collaborate with other foreign agencies, mainly Scotland Yard, use registration cards from hotels prove the Jackals's precautions right, he rightfully expected that the cover to be blown (not without the use of torture) ? but the thrills come from the whole cat-and-mouse game between European police bureaucracies and one man who single-handedly challenges them all.That's one of the greatest delights provided by "The Day of the Jackal", and Fox' performance is crucial here. He appears like a highly-educated upper-class Englishman who can easily go unnoticed in a summertime France full of tourists, we eagerly follow him in his tour all over Europe (the escapism of "The Day of the Jackal" is another strength worth mentioning) and even when he's told about the French police's progresses (a spy was hired to become the mistress of a French minister), he manages to slip through the net, using his boyish charm to seduce a bourgeois woman or a Danish disguise to seduce a Parisian in a Turkish bathhouse.On the other side, professionalism is also working, and Inspector Raymond Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) is given full power to track and find the 'Jackal' In total secrecy according to De Gaulle's orders, De Gaulle wouldn't change his schedule, let alone the August 25 celebration of the Resistance Day, coincidentally the likeliest time for the assassination. Zimmerman swings back and forth from the Jackal to the Police, from the borders to the hotels, with an advantage in time, the Jackal intelligently exploits. Luck or hazard are never parameters, it's essentially the courage and the nerve of a no-nonsense man who trusts his professionalism.Back to that professionalism thing, there is an interesting sequence in Genoa, where the Jackal takes the rifle from the gunsmith (Cyril Cusack) : the man proves his reliability by not asking questions and remaining all matter-of-factly over the killing-marvel he created. On the other hand, the forger tries to blackmail the Jackal and gets exactly what was coming to him. The parallel between the two attitudes highlights that no matter how 'malevolent' he is, the Jackal has 'ethics' , there is a way you should deal with him and a way not to. Still, he can kill any by-passer on his deadly path, women and even older ones won't be spared.Indeed, no matter who die, De Gaulle remains the man-not-to-be-killed. "The Jackal" still has an interesting body count. Some murders are cold-blooded and particularly brutal but they provide the required two-dimensionality for leading villain. And by that, I don't mean the man lacks depth, but what to expect from a professional killer who's only dedicated to his last mission? He can't show anything but what is shown is enough, and the contrast between his elegance and ruthlessness, as for the Inspector's average appearance but undeniable competence, two opposite at the top of their game, is enough to thrill us.And as a thriller, "The Day of the Jackal" is a heart-pounding combination of suspense, realism with regular outbursts of violence, it's a two-hour and 15 minutes race against the clock that never seems to long. Granted the outcome predictable, it's not in the 'what will happen' but 'how it will'. The editing answers to the 'how' and is curiously the only Oscar-nominated aspect of the film; frankly I would have nominated it for Best Directing and Best Writing as well, one of the greatest thrillers of the 70's</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The late 60s and early 70s were the golden age of a certain breed of spy/espionage/conspiracy movie. Think such films as "The Parallax View", "The Conversation", "Three Days of the Condor", "The Spy Who Came In From the Cold", "All the President's Men", "Capricorn One", "Chinatown", "The China Syndrome", "Executive Action", "The Conformist", "The Manchurian Candidate" "Marathon Man", "Black Sunday", "The Mackintosh Man", "The Odessa File", "Executive Action", "Seven Days In May" and the political thrillers of Costa Gavras, Gillo Pontecorvo, Hitchcock and Jean-Pierre Melville.One of the most famous of these is Fred Zinnemann's "The Day of the Jackal", which stars Edward Fox as "The Jackal", an assassin hired by ex-army extremists to murder Charles de Gaulle, the French leader who upset many by announcing his plans to grant Algeria its independence. Michel Lonsdale, a familiar face in spy movies, is cast as the shrewd police inspector hot on the Jackal's tale.Touted by Zinnemann as an antidote to the then hugely popular James Bond movies, the film dispassionately watches as the Jackal slowly and methodically plots murder. The film offers little conventional action and violence (its most violent scene consists of a watermelon exploding), Zinnemann content to observe from afar as apparently mild mannered gentlemen talk about contracts, future kills, counterfeiting and the building of specialist weapons. The Jackal is himself portrayed as a somewhat aristocratic, upper class Englishman. A man for whom killing is a respectable business when done with care and finesse. Mirrored to the Jackal are a band of police inspectors, equally methodical, dispassionate and efficient. The action bounces from London to Paris to Vienna to Rome, a form of globe trotting typical of the genre. Zinnemann juxtaposes those whom the Jackal relies on ? gunsmiths, forgers, underground hoodlums ? with those upon whom the police depend.As with most of these films, it is a woman (and possibly also homosexuality?) who causes our hero's plans to collapse. This is an off-shoot of noir, untameable women bleeding into a forever conspiratorial cosmos.The film's primary influences are Jean-Pierre Melville and Hitchcock. Melville for its detached, procedural-like narrative devoid of humour and overt psychological analysis ("The Samurai", "Army of Shadows" etc) and Hitchcock for the wry, devilish pleasure Zinnemann takes in watching evils planned and committed with utmost civility. "Will the gentleman be moving?" a gentlemanly gunsmith asks the gentlemanly Jackal, referring to the gentlemanly General Charles de Gaulle. Tonally it's "Dial M For Murder", little devils plotting devilish deeds with much formality.8/10 ? One of Zinnemann's better films, though overlong and with little replay value. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Professional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliant film adaptation of a classic novel, Fred Zinnemann's "The Day Of The Jackal" uses every twist and turn of Frederic Forsyth's original story to produce a nail-biting feature of suspense and mystery. What it lacks in engagement, it makes up for in true professionalism.After yet another dispiriting failed attempt on the life of French President Charles de Gaulle, the commander of the right-wing terror group known as the OAS decides to bring in an outsider, to be known only as the Jackal and played brilliantly by Edward Fox as a perplexing amalgam of cold-blooded ruthlessness and charm.Because he's a killer who hasn't worked in France before, the Jackal "won't have a police record," the OAS commander explains. "He can come and go as he pleases. Officially he won't exist." That makes matters tougher for those French security officials who catch wind of the plot and focus on stopping the Jackal, most especially Inspector Lebel (Michael Lonsdale), a stooped and perpetually tired figure whose walrus mustache and caterpillar eyebrows contrast vividly with the smooth, perfectly fit Jackal."Day Of The Jackal" works that way throughout, contrasting shots of the Jackal in his element (luxurious postcard vistas and beautiful women) with Lebel and his agents working in smoky, cramped offices or overbearingly ornate boardrooms where circumspection rules but leaks are a constant risk. Zinnemann deliberately downshifts from any signature shots or Hitchcockian setpiece sequences to offer a well-paced storyline that pauses on isolated moments of well-observed human behavior, like chauffeurs taking a cigarette break or priests at a ceremony being checked for hidden weapons. You really feel you are watching a documentary of events from 1963, not a work of fiction shot nine years later.One of the charms of this film is its overwhelming European-ness, from the casual practice of realpolitick (how Zinnemann got French cooperation to shoot a film which portrays their security service as harshly as it does is a wonder) to the way the word "aluminum" is pronounced "al-LOO-min-EE-um" rather than "al-LOO-min-um". It's not quite believable set as it is in the 1960s, with all those people in shaggy haircuts looking at the camera in street scenes, but the location shooting is a definite plus when it comes to establishing "Jackal's" rich, lifelike texture.Maintaining suspense is a challenge, for we know De Gaulle will not be killed. It's how the Jackal moves closer to his target, and stays ahead of his pursuers, that makes the film work, the same as it does with the novel.The film does drag, and there are elements that seem to stretch longer than needed, e.g. a car crash that temporarily derails the Jackal or rigorous analysis of a series of torture tapes that yield a vital clue. But the ruthless concentration builds up intense momentum toward a sudden end, and a lingering question: "Who the hell was he?" That's the sting at the tail, the Jackal's one undeniable victory and a marvelous endnote for this grimly glorious film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>August 1963 was a stormy time for France.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day of the Jackal is the fictional story of an assassin hired by the OAS (a French right-wing terrorist group that was active in the 1960s) to kill President Charles de Gaulle. This film was an adaptation of Fredrick Forsyth's novel of the same title.I've already laid down the basic plot, but I'll elaborate on the story. After a failed attempt on de Gaulle, the leader of the OAS (Col. Bastien-Thiry) is executed and Col. Rodin assumes control. Col. Rodin and the other two top OAS men decide to hire a contract killer who only they know the true identity of to assassinate de Gaulle. The Jackal has one contact in Paris who keeps him informed, but does not know who he is. The French authorities know that the OAS is planning something and kidnap Rodin's adjunct. Under torture, the adjunct reveals the only thing he knows, the killer's code name; The Jackal. Naturally, after some investigation, French security determines there is a plot to kill de Gaulle and have Police Commissioner Lebel investigate.This is as deep into the plot as I'll go because I don't want to give anything away. What makes this story interesting is that French security and OAS know only of his existence and his code name. In addition, the Jackal's disguises and tricks of the trade (for lack of a better term) are fascinating. The thing that I really enjoy about this movie is the cast. Many fine actors from both Britian and France were used (Michel Lonsdale, Derek Jacobi, and Eric Porter to name several). However, Edward Fox gave probably the finest performance as the Jackal. He's cold, effective, and calculating the very essence of a contract killer.The movie does not completely follow the book. Some say the movie is awful, some say the movie's good despite the differences. Personally, I am of the latter opinion. Why not find out for yourself?Either way, it's a lot better than the Bruce Willis version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You watch the Bruce Willis version of the Jackal and you think that is so cool, but you don't know cool until you see Edward Fox do it.Fox is the epitome of cool. The guy even wears an ascot, for god's sake! Most people today don't even know what an ascot is. He carefully plots his moves and is methodical in his precision. He kills with cool detachment. If he had Willis' assignment, he would have gotten it done.But, he had to deal with the European versions of the CIA/FBI and they were not restrained in how they handled investigations. With just a thread, the French police inspector carefully puts together a case with as much precision as his prey. It was a game of cat and mouse that kept you on the edge of your seat for two and a half hours without noticing the time.That is because of director Fred Zinnemann and the fact that he kept things moving along beautifully.If you want to see how a thriller is done with craft and cunning and without special effects, then this is the film for you.</fullReview>

The acting is first rate - there are numerous faces that we recognize but whose owners we cannot readily name - Maurice Denham,Cyril Cusack, Derek Jacobi, even Edward Fox. Why is it that actors with English accents can convincingly play Frenchmen or Germans, of any era, while those with North American accents invariably sound totally out of place? In "Jackal" we even have a mixture of French characters with Gallic accents and others with English accents! The on-location filming adds a large degree of reality. Fox is charmingly cold-blooded and amusing. Every time I watch this film I find myself rooting for the villain! Altogether a first-rate movie that is well worth re-watching. Although clearly a sixties film this masterpiece has aged well.</fullReview>

The hit-man is known only as 'The Jackal', a cool, enigmatic, cold-blooded individual, superbly portrayed by Edward Fox. The film is bolstered by a terrific support cast, particularly Michael Lonsdale as the dogged French police detective on the Jackal's trail. Filmed on location in Britain, France, Austria and Italy, the film has a distinct continental flavour and is complemented by some beautiful scenery. The film always keeps the viewer engrossed, there are plenty of twists and turns and is an enjoyable, intelligent thriller - if only more films today could be like this!</fullReview>

Edward Fox portrayed the Jackal exactly as I had envisioned him (mannerisms, body language etc). I am absolutely love the image of sixties Europe that is weaven in the scenes of preparation. It fustrates me that the dire Willis/Gere film, The Jackal, has been called a remake.If only Hollywood looked to films like this not just to copy, but for real inspiration we may have some genuinely decent films being made again. Tarantino is clearly an admirer of films of this genre and era and has made some of the best films of the last 20 years.

This is a real tour de force from director Fred Zinneman who tells the story of the jackal (a name for a hiremurderer who has to kill President De Gaulle as he gave Algeria independence) and it reads as a book. The problem is that you are getting such a big fascination for the killer (superbly done by Edward Fox) that you hope they never catch him and it's not simple to do so as The Jackal changes every day his identity. Later this movie had a remake with Bruce Willis and you can watch that too (especially for Bruce) as apart from the idea these are two different movies, but this one from Zinneman is an absolute classic!</fullReview>

In short, it is a classic.It is amazing that one can make a thriller out of a story where anyone who knows their history already knows the ultimate answer. But art, like life, is a journey, not a destination.This is a fascinating era. (I also have the excellent `The Lost Command' with Anthony Quinn, which deals more directly with the French war in Algeria.)With the ending in doubt only because of the willful suspension of disbelief, how does the film `work'?It works with clean, crisp story telling. Scenes are rendered with a direct realism, rather than contrived or belabored `grittiness'.We are taken behind the scenes of political power, to find what we have always suspected, that cynicism and brutality are essential to the greater cause of `patriotism'.Great performances all around, with the ultimate payoff that every audience craves to see, that it is the skill and guts of the individual that makes the difference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder why you don't hear a lot about this film as it is obviously a gem of the genre. Look at a list of all time favorites and I doubt if you will see this one; yet it has elicited many positive reviews on this board.....so we are right and they are wrong (whoever "they" are)!! What a thriller this is....right from the start it grabs you as Edward Fox works his magic as The Jackal. Fox had played many roles over the years, usually an upper-class twit who is being cuckolded by his wife/mistress. Here he is perfectly cold and methodical and he portrays the hired assassin to perfection. Michel Lonsdale, known to most American audiences as Drax, one of the James Bond villains, is also perfectly cast as the tireless hunter of the Jackal. The supporting cast is spot-on as well.The film, based on the best selling novel, will enthrall you with it's complexity and characterizations. Even though history tells us the Charles DeGaulle was not assassinated, we are still held captive by this film. It's a winner!!!</fullReview>

Naturally I snapped it up and went home and stuck it in my DVD player.

		<fullReview>DAY OF THE JACKAL is the tale of a plot to kill Charles De Gaulle by rouge elements of the French military. A assassin is hired from outside of France to complete the assignment. EDWARD FOX gives the performance of his career as the hired killer with the disarming smile. MICHAEL LONSDALE is also good as a French intelligence officer trying to track the killer down. This is a exceptional film. It is not glamorized, fake, or overly pretentious. The characters are believeable as is the story. Fans of Tom Clancy style novels will enjoy this film. I like FRED ZINNEMAN's style...he uses understatement rather than over statement when the assassin character kills someone. This serves as dramatic effect in the sense that we can't believe this man with the killer smile just did all this. He leaves the event to our imagination and off screen...all we see on screen is the loving, yet, sinister...smile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many amazing things about this film. I decided to rent it after I had seen the appalling The Jackal (1997) which tells the story as a tangled up completely gratuitous action movie. The Day of the Jackal is none of those things. In fact the way in which the story unfolds is so systematic that it is rather like a documentary. We start with a brief background spoken in about 4 lines by a narrator. Then we see various scenes which show the turmoil that existed in France at the time of 1960. This is followed by the scene in which the Jackal is hired to assassinate President Charles de Gaulle. The Jackal himself is a fascinating character. Played by Edward Fox, he is not the clichéd silent, deadly type, instead he is boyishly charming, quick-witted and wonderfully arrogant - especially during the meeting with the OAS. When going about his job, step by step, he is a dedicated professional and will do whatever it takes to get to the next step. He can be very dangerous and if someone tries to outsmart him or take advantage of him, they meet a sudden, unexpected end. Simultaneous to the progression of the Jackal, is the police investigative work. The case is headed by a detective called Lebel, played with great modesty by Michel Lonsdale. As the Jackal goes through various stages in preparing for the assassination, so too does Lebel and the audience are really allowed to become involved in the case as the police attempt to pin the Jackal down before it is too late. This is a fascinating insight into the work of a detective and proves very exciting as the Jackal must always keep one step ahead of the police. To sum up, despite being made 25 years ago, this is one of the most skillfully made movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day of the Jackal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Fred Zinnemann (From Here to Eternity, A Man for All Seasons), I knew I had to see the five star rated original before the Bruce Willis remake. Basicaly, set in 1960's France, many surviving members of the aborted French Foreign Legion have attempted to assassinate President General Charles De Gaulle (Adrien Cayla-Legrand), and he is now one of the most protected men in the world. Desperate to get the job done, an assassin known only as The Jackal (Edward Fox) is hired to kill the leader in return for half a million dollars. Throughout we see his preparations for the assassination, including his weapon choice and places to hide for the shot. The French police meanwhile, led by detective Claude Lebel (BAFTA nominated Michael Lonsdale), are on his trail and trying to catch him, with only some misleading and fake passport identifications to help them. The day of the big parade the President will be attending approaches, and The Jackal and the police are both set to make their moves, it is just a question of whether the villain we have grown to admire will succeed and get the long awaited shot. Also starring Alan Badel as The Minister, Tony Britton as Inspector Thomas, Cyril Cusack as The Gunsmith, Donald Sinden as Mallinson, Derek Jacobi as Caron, Eric Porter as Colonel Rodin, BAFTA nominated Delphine Seyrig as Colette, Olga Georges-Picot as Denise and Timothy West as Berthier. Fox is masterful in the leading performance giving the role a good depth and intrigue, you could almost say your on his side, but Lonsdale does well as the good guy too, it is a magnificent thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Screenplay and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Very good!</fullReview>

What makes the film work is the casting, with no big-name stars; I loved the actor who played the Jackal, very low key and unsuspecting. I'm a big fan of political thrillers.....it's great to see the original. It's very hard for me to consider the joke of a movie, 1997's 'The Jackal', a remake of this suspenseful, well-made thriller. It's basically a cat-and-mouse game, but its execution is very cleverly done. The tactics used by the Jackal were just astonishing....making him that much creepier. A solid political thriller.*** out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-modern procedural</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Day of the Jackal', a cat and mouse tale of the French police on the trail of an assassin, is an early example of a procedural thriller. Far more so than most such films today, it centres on the mundane details of police work, the heroes do their work in their offices and we're thankfully spared the too common 'action' scenes that normally punctuate stories like this. Unfortunately, the pacing and editing are a notch down on modern standards, ensuring that for the film to work, we really have to believe every detail. Probably the greatest obstacle to this is the fact that all the dialogue occurs in English, with English actors in all the roles - in a story that passes from London to Vienna to Genova to Paris, this represents a wasted opportunity and the chameleon-like qualities of the Jackal are thus lost. In conclusion this is a brave but dated film. The period details (gorgeous French cars and prodigious amounts of smoking) add to the atmosophere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is an excellent thriller, dry and direct, without special effects except for the most important, understatement. Cool in the description, as the main carachter is, without any moral, only describing facts that happens. But this is not a documentary but a more mature movie than movies of today. I think that people in the past was more attend to the political situation, so a story of the killing of de gaulle was more compressible than today. How can you do a movie about a glacial killer without identity if you are a too emotive director? I don't think that J.P. Melville can does better then Zinnemann. The decision to not use music, dialogues and tricks made Day of the jackal more intense and deep than other movies of the same gender. my vote 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of movies like Le Serpent (1972) and Topaz (1969) ,it only comes naturally that I consider The Day of the Jackal a masterpiece,and a peak of its genre,that of the suspense shows;comparatively,how stupid and flawed are many of the suspense movies made during the last two decades!"The Day of the Jackal"'s script is a very logical and well drawn one,this logicalness is a source of the mind's joy,as the successive steps of the French policemen's investigations are easy to follow.After the loss of Algeria,a group of reactionary military conspirators,OAS, attempt to assassinate De Gaulle because they consider him guilty of a national disaster,France's retreat from the colonies.This group's leader,a colonel,is arrested and executed (occasion for us to enjoy Zinnemann's comic:see the colonel's self assurance,his naive belief that no soldier would shoot him).The OAS hires a political killer,who gives himself the name of "The Jackal".In France,the mission of capturing him goes to deputy commissioner Lebel,the best detective Paris had.The Jackal is described as a well groomed man.His way to Paris is paved with murders.The young Edward Fox does a delicious role as a tough killer,elegant and supple and always dressed up.The way he smiles,the way he smokes sedately make him an interesting and sharp character.Even if his mission is to kill De Gaulle,he still finds time to seduce a gorgeous woman.The script seizes the incongruities of life.But on the other hand,this contract killer is not made to look endearing;on the contrary,he is all the way sinister,hideous,bestial.There are tho very beautiful women in "The Day of the Jackal":Mrs. Olga Georges-Picot,as "Denise",and Delphine Seyrig."The Day ..." is an epitome of the cool. The pace is amazing,and the director's mastership is undeniable.To sum up,in this excellent suspense show we have Fox' outstanding role as the Jackal,a logical and well developed script,plenty of action,a gorgeous pace,an interesting subject,two attractive actresses."Day of the Jackal" has intelligence and charm,it is an intelligent movie,and an elegant one;it has no ballast,and it is entirely suited to its purpose,a movie to enjoy,to take delight in;the few very good actors it has are in a prodigious form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Political Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Frederick Forsyth's novel, "The Day of the Jackal" is settled in France during General De Gaulle's presidency where a group of former Desert Legion officers (the O.A.S.) that feel betrayed by the president's policy to give independence to France's African colonies, decide to have him killed for treason. After failing in their own intents, they hire a professional to do the job. From then on Fred Zinnemann builds a great film shot on location through Europe and aided by a very good screenplay and photography.The first part of The Day of the Jackal deals with the Jackal's meticulous planning and preparation for the murder (where?, when?, how?); and the second half with the execution of his plan. Both parts are most interesting and well handled and lead to the splendid final sequences when you even doubt whether the man has succeeded or not. The film is a perfect cat and mouse chase as the French Secret Service -that knows a killer will attempt against the President- does his job too and starts to run against time.Edward Fox, a fine British actor, plays the Jackal most convincingly and some how you feel kind of sorry for his bad luck at the last minute (considering this is a movie we are talking about, of course); the man is a true professional with no feelings or scruples when it comes to his work. The French officer assigned to stop him is played by Michael Lonsdale in perhaps his best performance in movies. He is a true professional too."The Day of the Jackal" lasts 2 and a half hours, but you can be sure you'll enjoy every minute of it if you like political thrillers with a real fact background (the OAS really existed and attempted against Charles de Gaulle several times). The 1997 remake with Richard Gere and Bruce Willis though perhaps entertaining is clearly inferior to this one.</fullReview>

Character development is one of the things that screen writing students are told is absolutely fundamental to a story and yet this film proves it is a nonsense. We know virtually nothing about any of the characters except Lebel, and even then all we really know is that he likes Pigeons and sleeps heavily.When you've got something as beautifully taut as this, you don't need to care about the characters.One slight moan though. At the end, when the Jackal is shot, he seems to fly against a very flimsy wall. Was this filmed on a Blake's Seven set?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The OAS must recruit an assassin from outside their ranks to kill Pres. DeGaull. What no one expects to see is a debonair, disciplined, and determined Edward Fox, The Jackal.Director Fred Zinneman (High Noon, From Here to Eternity, A man for all seasons, Julia) keeps the action tight and moving. I have to ask myself How did they he get the parade scenes? Realism and plausibility keep the movie together. You don't know what the Jackal is doing until 2 seconds after he does it, then the little light bulb does off: That is why he set up an apartment months in advance, or why he hooked up w/ a guy: to stay out of hotels.The actors on both side of the English channel are terrific to watch. I was cheering for the French and English Inspectors. They epitomized skilled, dedicated, seasoned investigators who did things very, very well despite the handicaps of having two govts watching their every move or leaking vital secrets. Two cheers for a young Derek Jacobi. YOu can see him later in Ken Branagh's Henry the V. He is one of the many fine actors in this film.All in all a wonderfully suspenseful movie. Once you watch this movie you get a good sense of comparison of how very little can be done to show a lot of action. No blood and guts but you know that people die. Compare this version to Bruce Willis' over the top, "show the severed arm, show the tongues flicking in the air (when he plays tonsil hockey w/ his male lover), and glass starts flying when he unleashes his machine gun. Heck, The Jackal (Edward Fox) uses a gun made from a crutch and you know that someone's head will explode like a watermelon.Lots of class and suspense at a bargain price.Jerry Naradzay</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day of the Jackal is a good thriller. It certainly had the Fred Zinnemann touch, you never knew what to expect. Edward Fox made you believe he was a bad guy and did without the usual physical motions and angry looking snarley facial expressions which is common in movies today. Fox just looked the other person straight in the eye and told them how it was. Michael Lonsdale from "Moonraker", gave a good performance as a good guy this time. Jean Tournier's cinematography is great and Ralph Kemplen's editing is superb. The Day of the Jackal is without a doubt better than the 1997 film "The Jackal" which had the same idea but the entire plot was different. My only problem with this is that it runs too long and has a few scenes in this film had no purpose what so ever. Why did Edward Fox get involved with a female? That was a waist of time and took down the pace of the movie. This is a good movie and worth your time. *** out of ****</fullReview>

Not only the sights but the sounds make you feel that you are right there participating as an observer of the action. The sequences that flash back and forth between the hired hit man and the police are well paced.The suspense holds the audience not only to the very end of the film but raises an unanswered question which the viewer takes home after the movie is over.Only a great director like Fred Zinnemann could make this into the masterpiece which it is.</fullReview>

See how killers also need to make love, and see how amazingly they can cut and kill their feelings. In the end, I thought the killer would have made no mistakes..... he has covered for all his errors in his journey, but DeGaulle was too lucky.This movie is better than than its highly commercialized remake --- you know that movie starring Dick Gere and Bruce Willis?

		<shortDescription>fantastic and smart movie - contains spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this today for the first time in ten years, and it really impressed me all over again. This really has to be one of my favorites. Great performances by all, especially Fox and Lonsdale. Wonderful European locations.The pacing is right on; the beginning is deliberately paced, as a plan is meticulously put together. As the French authorities gradually piece it together (always one or two steps behind the Jackal), the tempo increases as it always seems either that Lebel is about to get his man, or that the Jackal is so far ahead of his pursuers that all is lost. When it's time for the assassination, you WILL be on the edge of your seat.I loved the way little seeds are planted early in the film that blossom later, like the medals that the Jackal buys at the bazaar. You might think he's just out antiquing while waiting for his gun and forged papers, but the medals turn out to be crucial to his plan. And the early scene where he surveys the vicinity of the upcoming Liberation Day proceedings is key - every detail that's established in that sequence comes into play later on. And then there's the wonderful subplot wherein the British focus on one Englishman, Charles Calthrop, who just &gt;has&lt; to be the Jackal. Accordingly, they center their entire investigation on him, and somehow it eventually leads Lebel to the Jackal. Then in a postscript, we find out that the English were wrong, and Calthrop was just some random guy who didn't have anything to do with anything.It's obvious that a lot of research and attention went into making this movie (and, I assume, the Frederick Forsythe novel it's based on). All the details seem right. The Jackal plans everything to a T, and it's all very credible; you never once ask, "How in the world did he do that?" Similarly, Lebel and his task force (and their English counterparts) break the case through endless grunt work and intelligent guessing, not ridiculous leaps of logic or absurd coincidences. Again, you never have to suspend disbelief to accept that they figured this or that out, because the dirty work they have to trudge through is right there on the screen.I should also add that Olga Georges-Picot has one of the most perfect bodies you'll ever see, and in one scene, you get to see a whole lot of it.In summary, "The Day of the Jackal" is a precision-crafted film that assumes that the viewer can think, can retain information that's more than 15 seconds old, and doesn't need to see a massive explosion or kung-fu battle every five minutes. Sadly, they don't make 'em like this very often anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective period piece...(Possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture (and the novel its based on) is knda sorta the true story of a professional assassin hired to whack Charles Degaulle in 1963. I say "kinda sorta' because an assassination attempt did happen---just not in this exact manner.Curious thing that this movie has been around since I was 12 years old---but I had not seen it until now (over 30 years later)--Still, I was familiar with the basic bare bones of the story--I think that I read the Reader's Digest condensed version of the novel at some point. The film is an effective period piece from the 1970's about the 1960's. Wonderful Euro street scenes can be found throughout the movie. The whole thing moves along its course with a deliberately understated energy. This film reminded me for all of the world like an expanded, slightly more sophisticated British version of the old (seventies) American TV series "Hawaii Five-O"--I don't mean that as a put down--it is just that the pacing and observation of both the criminal and the police in parallel is quite alike. The performances of the actors are purposely shaded and in a sense secondary to the story---even the hired assassin (played marvelously by Edward Fox) remains a mystery. He is hired to kill De Gaulle for $500,000--with $250,000 upfront. This represents several million in 2004 dollars. His real motives for making the attempt to kill De Gaulle however seem rather more complex than just for the money. Consider that he still has an opportunity to bail out on the plot intact (and with a down payment safe in his Swiss bank account) after learning that the plot is discovered. Instead he continues on to Paris instead of returning to the safety of Italy. He continues on the mission even though his position becomes ever more precarious the closer he gets to his target. He must realize, of course, that his chances for success are small and that he may be hunted for the rest of his life--even if he manages to escape the scene. Still he moves on - propelled-it seems-more by a strange professionalism somehow bound into a type of conceit that doesn't allow for turning back. Almost suicidal in some respects.--</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another one of the many cases where the original is far superior to the remake. The original closely follows the book which in turn follows the historical events of the day.The suspense and the dogged determination of Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) to catch the elusive Jackal (Edward Fox) far outstrip the Hollywoodized remake with Willis/Gere. The Willis/Gere version is more intent on explosions than adhering to the facts of the story.The remake has a different country, a different target, and characters and situations that simply did not exist in Frederick Forsyth's wonderful book.But there is no explaining why Hollywood feels the need to take a great story, chop it to pieces, and then produce a wholly unacceptable film by trading on the title alone...too bad!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gripping adaptation of Forsyth's novel. Fox's detailed planning is the highlight of the this film rather than the finale. It succeeds in translation to the screen better the "The Dogs of War" which also had a very detailed buildup in the novel. The finale is more realistic than the Hollywood version and the movie is better all-round. Fox's character develops well as the story progresses and one's opinion of him changes appropriately especially towards the end. He's well cast as are the supporting actors. Good European travelogue is a bonus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt I needed to comment on this film after reading the only other review of "The Day of the Jackal" I have seen on the website. Although the beginning may be a little slow paced for the average film goer used to watching Movies like "Bad Boys 2" or "The Matrix" the middle and end are without question up there with the best crime thrillers of the 70's such as "The French Connection". The film remains faithful to the book in almost every detail and this may be why some may find it "tedious" at times, but in the right mood and environment this film is a tremendously enjoyable experience. Definitely worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best suspense thrillers i've seen, and certainly the most faithful adaptation of a novel, which, in itself is equally good. The story line follows more or less exactly the novel's. The characters are perfectly cast for their individual roles and, as a result, are very believable. For instance, Michael Lonsdale as inspector Lebel fits his role perfectly, and so does Edward Fox as The Jackal. The plot lacks the usual holes which are common in many movie productions, due to the well thought-out and (I guess) researched novel and screenplay.Nothing in this movie is exaggerated, nor withheld, which makes it even more believable. It projects a credible image of how police work really is done, that there's a lot of basic out-in-the-street routine work that gets the job done, and not by blowing things up and/or engage in reckless car chases. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but that's another story, and another context.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film grips one from the beginning and by an accumulation of small details takes one to the final moments, that even though one knows the outcome, you still aren't sure. It is a great film by a great director. Fred Zinnemann had a long distinguished career in film making and is probably under rated today. It is a seemingly simply made film, but no scene is too long, no dialogue is too verbose, no performance too melodramatic. It is a great orchestration of the elements of film.As the Jackal Edward Fox is magnetic. It may well have been his best work as a film actor. You are drawn and repelled by him. There are scenes without him but his intelligent, cool and determined assassin hovers over the whole film. The scenes where he kills are understated, filmed in low light, and thus more disturbing. As the pursuing policeman Lebel, Michel Lonsdale is equally excellent. More of him in the film would have been great. The other actors give good support. Cyril Cusack as the gunsmith and Ronald Pickup as the forger are particularly creepy.In comparison the 1997 re-make is poor. Why try to rebuild Mount Everest?</fullReview>

It's PG for (surprise) frontal female and rear malenudity, implied sexual situations, subdued violence.

		<fullReview>Must be about the fourth time I have seen this film, but it is still one of the best in this category. Quite apart from the fact that Frederick Forsythe turns out rather good novels, among which this one is certainly a good read and I think one of his first, one of the most worthy features of this film is precisely how well the book has been adapted to the screen.The film quickly develops a firm tempo: the sequencing of scenes is gripping as the pace remains at a constant level, not too fast, just right, keeping the atmosphere tense from the opening to the closing scenes. It is, perhaps, one of the best films I have ever seen in this respect.Edward Fox as The Jackal is fine, unrepeatable; but even so Michael Lonsdale as the French Detective Lebel almost overshadows him: a truly superb interpretation, never overacted, beautifully controlled and balanced, wonderful characterization.Fred Zimmerman's direction is magnificent: he holds the line with the telling ? taught, tense, each scene driving inexorably to the next, never a seond wasted nor cut: everything just spot on. He achieves what other directors in other films more or less classifiable as "thrillers" were not able to even approach in the perfection of timing and sense of rhythm. Good supporting cast, Delerue's music helps things along, and the photography is good. However, I can understand the fact that the unreality of everyone in France speaking English is highly unlikely. I think perhaps a little bilinguism might have added more reality; a little like in Soderbergh's `Traffic' (qv) which used English and Spanish side by side very effectively. I think it fair to say that cinema has changed greatly in the meantime.However, all in all, nearly thirty years later, `The Day of the Jackal' remains as one of the best films in this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller that actually thrills!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why on earth do screenwriters today think that an unfathomable plot will mean that a thriller will be more exciting? They should take a look at this masterpiece of suspense from 1973 and see how a simple plot can translate into nail-biting tension. Edward Fox gives a chilling performance as a professional assassin hired by the OAS to kill General de Gaulle. The French Police are soon on his trail and what follows is a superbly taut thriller as the killer stays one step ahead of his pursuers. The screenplay offers enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat, but without you getting lost. The film has been criticised for a lack of characterisation. Granted, but this is actually an advantage rather than a flaw as director Zinnemann never pauses the action to indulge in what would have almost certainly been dull moralising. Besides, very soon you actually find yourself actually on the side of the ruthless killer rather than the police! As superb as the cast is, the most credit must go to Zinnemann, who never lets up on the suspense and plot and brilliantly judges the entire film to keep your palms sweating and your heart in your month right up to the thrilling climax. This is an object lesson in creating a thriller that does what it what it's made for: thrilling. It is also infinitely more exciting than the high-tech paranoia based pap that is the norm these days.</fullReview>

Sure there are holes in the plot, there really aren't that many scripts that are totally immune to close scrutiny. I guess they should be but according to a view shared by many writers and directors once a reasonable level of realism has been reached it isn't terribly important to go all the way.In my opinion this film is light years ahead of the "remake" that can only boast about decent looking opening credits. DotJ is an interesting picture of France or at least Forsyths vision of it. Although based on real events the story is pure fiction and should be looked as such. As a plain thriller this is a good film once one sets the expectations on the level of reality rather low.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all of the novels by Frederick Forsyth that have been turned into motion pictures this is by far the best adaptation of one of his stories to the big screen. Edward Fox is dead on as the cool precise contract assassin who plans with attention to detail perfection his hit of French President Charles DeGaulle. Michael Lonsdale as well is dead on as the soft spoken but knows his business Detective assigned the seemingly impossible task of finding the person no one knows. The film never loses the viewers interest even during some of the slow scenes. The dual story line i.e. the plot to assassinate and the job of trying to stop the assassination is handled very well. This picture is far superior to the remake starring Bruce Willis, Richard Gere and Sidney Poitier. If you're going to rent 1997's "The Jackal"pick this one up as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, Methodical, Engrossing Thriller Of Assassination Attempt On The French President</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1963, the Organisation De L'Armée Secr?te, a right-wing French terrorist group, hire a mysterious hit-man codenamed The Jackal to assassinate President Charles DeGaulle. Can he pull off this remarkable crime, or will Police Inspector Claude Lebel find him first ?Based on the bestselling 1971 novel by Frederic Forsyth, this is an exciting European thriller with great locations (Bloomsbury in London, Genoa, Montparnasse in Paris), a gripping storyline throughout and an unusual premise; we know DeGaulle wasn't killed, so we know the ending to the picture. How then does it hold our interest - it becomes the story of how close The Jackal comes to succeeding, and, much more significantly, the story of his methodology. We see him meeting his contacts, preparing his fake identities, smuggling his weapon across the border, constructing disguises, avoiding detection. He plans everything carefully, but also improvises and adjusts his schemes as and when required. He is truly a phantom, and as such this film is the blueprint for many good hit-man thrillers which came later (In The Line of Fire, Léon, Grosse Pointe Blanke). I must confess I don't usually like Fox, but here he is pretty good, mostly because he has very little to say and the movie is so matter-of-fact. He is well matched by Lonsdale as Lebel, the steady, commensurate professional detective, and the cast has some interesting supporting players like Cusack (the genteel gunsmith) and Pickup (the ill-fated forger). With good photography by Jean Tournier and first-rate editing by Ralph Kemplen (who won an Academy Award), this is a well put-together thriller by old pro Zinnemann, and the touchstone assassin character study movie. Followed by a sort of sequel, The Jackal in 1997. Trivia - if you like Citroen DS cars there are a lot of them in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS There are always political leaders on the verge of being assassinated. Whether it's the American President, a Dutch politician or someone else, there is always a bullet with someones name on it. In the 1970s, Hollywood created a film version of the fictional attempted assassination of President Charles De Gaulle. Based on the Frederick Forsyth novel, the film adaptation of "The Day of the Jackal" is a dark and intelligent affair. Brilliantly acted by Edward Fox and others, it is beautifully shot and tense throughout.President General Charles De Gaulle has granted Algerian Independence. After constantly failing in their attempts to assassinate him, survivors of the now defunct French Foreign Legion know that they can't get anywhere near him. Hiring a mysterious assassin known as 'The Jackal' (Fox) to strike, they set in motion a Europe wide cat and mouse game between the law and the would be killer.From the opening moments, "The Day of the Jackal" is an intense and powerful film. Cleverly set out, the entire situation is set up through one short introduction and one brief assassination attempt. From this moment on, the story sets off at lightning speed as Edward Fox's assassin is constantly moving from one place to the next, setting up events which won't happen for a further hour and a half. Fox is awesome as this intellectual killer with a penchant for killing. We are shown a meticulous English gentleman who isn't afraid to break a few necks to achieve his goal.There are some truly awesome moments in this film. Whether it is the fast paced conclusion, the twist at the end, or earlier moments of delight (for example the transformation of the white sports car), there are exquisite parts of this excellent film. Beautifully acted and beautifully thought out, it never allows you to relax and you are enthralled from start to finish. Brilliant.</fullReview>

I had joined the choir of the local Greek Orthodox Church, and our practices were at 7:30 pm on Thursday nights. Our choir director was a stickler for showing up on time, so you incurred some serious embarrassment/grief when you showed up late. On one particular Thursday evening, I decided watch some TV and eat dinner before going to choir practice. Big Mistake. While channel surfing, I came across The Day of the Jackal and literally could not leave until the movie ended. I showed up almost an hour late for practice and incurred the wrath I deserved from the choir director, but it was worth it. I have never seen a movie with so many twists and turns where both the villian and the hero are so relentless and resourceful. Watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One minor complaint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that is great about this movie has been said, so I would just like to comment about what I thought was a (minor) flaw: the language. (Actually, one reviewer already brought this up, too, but just for emphasis...) There were both French and English actors cast, but the language was English. I think this film would have been greatly enhanced by the use of subtitles; have the French people speak French or English, whichever the occassion demanded. It's just very strange to have actual French people speaking English amongst themselves and very, very British people cast as Frenchmen. Very strange; almost silly. Also, sort of silly was the fact that Derek Jacobi sounded to me to be effecting a French accent. Whatever for? None of the other British people even tried to appear French at all.The situation is different from that of, say, the film Papillon (incidentally of the same year as Day of the Jackal), which was targeted towards an American audience. That film might also have been better served if the dialogue was in French, but then it might then not have featured Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. There was no real reason not to have French dialogue in Day of the Jackal, imo.However, this does not ruin the film and doesn't take away from it. It only keeps a great well-paced, exciting thriller from being virtually perfect well-paced, exciting thriller. They don't make thrillers like this anymore. Kind of a shame, but it also makes the film shine all the more.</fullReview>

In the book, everything is logical, the assassin just one step ahead of the pursuers who, against all odds, do a tremendous job. In the film, the element of chance was introduced too early and it almost spoils it. It should have been reserved to the final scenes (shooting of de Gaule), like in the book.

		<fullReview>A group of partisans, anarchists, or terrorists or whatever, plan to assassinate President Charles DeGaule and recruit expert hit-man and crack-shot 'Jackal' played by Edward Fox.It's an absorbing and convoluted movie entailing detection and evasion, as seen from both sides of the criminal divide.Fox plays the suave but ultimately quite ruthless ex-public-school persona that we've seen several times before. The style is therefore nothing new. We have almost come to expect it. And here Zinnerman directs him with typically cold-cunning effect. There's a number of other British character stalwarts, and several French actors providing an authentic flavour to what is ultimately their own national crisis.Although the whole movie has a nicely-paced plot with plenty of dramatic moments, the effect has a rather starched feel to it. Tension never really seems to build. We see the Jackal murdering accomplices and innocent stooges alike; we see him narrowly escape capture; he even has a road accident. But there is no cumulative effect. They are like a series of minutely-observed tableaux. Some have described it as almost a documentary; yet it still lacks some essential component to transpose the story into drama. I never got to know the Jackal as a human being. His willingness to murder suggests a psychotic mentality. His protagonist French detective is equally two-dimensional. And I think therein lies the problem. Story is 'something that happens to someone you have been moved to care about'. In this movie, Zinnerman signally failed to induce my empathy for anyone.Still well worth a watch for the meticulous realisation of the murder plot and its ultimate thwarting, but I find it an unsatisfying experience for all of that.</fullReview>

And the secret to its success is the almost anonymous cast. Of course we recognize the horse face of Fox, but he is rarely the lead. And of Lonsdale, he has that career beauracrat look down perfect, almost as if Maigret had been called to the scene. And we don't get a high powered female star to play the brief romantic foil to Fox. Too long? Where should we cut? The weapon's technician? The sleazy forger? The discovery of the leak?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the 1960's and based on Frederick Forsyth's novel of the same name, French militant underground organisation OAS enlists the services of a British assassin, called "The Jackal", in order to kill president Charles De Gaulle. The film is dragged down by some poor dubbing and at times iffy acting. It also looks very cheap and lacks music as well. While "The Day Of The Jackal" is based on a great story, it is regretfully to short to accommodate it properly and thus feels compressed and ragged. All in all, a great story not executed very well, resulting in a decent movie, no more, no less. Unfortunately, doesn't do Forsyth's excellent novel justice, though is somewhat solid throughout as the main story is thrilling.Later Bond villain Michael Lonsdale is the shining light in the movie, performing very convincingly as main protagonist Claude Lebel, while Edward Fox is fine as The Jackal as well.

		<fullReview>The Day of the Jackal The reason world leaders like to wear military uniforms, while in office, is that they remind the populous that their president has killed innocent people before and could easily do so again.And while the French President does wear his general's threads here, he is not the one employing violence in this spy-thriller.After he gives Algeria independence, an upset group of French radicals plot to assassinate Charles de Gaulle (Adrien Cayla-Legrand).Following a number of failed attempts, the faction finally decides to hire a contract killer codename: The Jackal (Edward Fox) to carry out their hit.From the hire to the kill shot, The Day of the Jackal is an in-depth and engaging account of the methodical preparation that goes into an assassination plot.The worst part of sniping someone from afar with a rifle, however, is convincing the target to wear that bull's eye t-shirt you gave them.

The note of the lack of musical score and direction, in the Zinnemann pastiche was clearly stated here.Mood and sound effect replaced, replaced an orchestral stringed ensemble, to provide the atmosphere to this classic and timeless story. The casting was a bit of a BRIT luvvie fest. With a number of them ala Jacobi/Britten &amp; Denholm going on to great flourishing Beeb careers. Michel Lonsdale Le-Belle (Hugo Drax MOONRAKER) and a small cameo role in (RONIN) to note: Ed Fox was really the only choice for the bard of the title role, in question really. Great ageless piece of celluloid as fresh as the day it was released. Confirms my remarks about the 70s, the most successful and highly creative period in history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly superb film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a number of things which can spoil to a large degree an otherwise superb movie. There are several of these present in this film, yet it overcomes everyone of them, and is an outstanding presentation. (Of course, any Forsythe story helps a great deal.)First, there is no doubt as to the success (or rather "lack of ") the "Jackal" will realize in his focal purpose, since we all know De Gaulle wasn't assassinated.Second, the film is very long, just under 2-1/2 hours, and many otherwise fine productions suffer from this extra length above the norm.And third, Edward Fox's lead character is a calm, deliberate, methodical killer - who murders unhesitatingly and with an eerie dispassion to permit moving towards the accomplishment of his mission. Yet, even without condoning this activity and purpose, and disdain for life on his part, we can't help but admire his smooth execution (an inevitable pun) of his necessary actions as the climax approaches. Any film/character who can achieve this is to be applauded for both strength of story, as well as the lead actor's performance.I saw this film recently, for the first time in several years, and the fact that it is now nearly 30 years since production, and more than 40 since the period depicted -- and knowing the precise turns of events in advance -- I enjoyed it just as thoroughly as when I first saw it.This is a true masterpiece -- both within its genre, and among films of its period, whatever the story or plot scenario.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another one of those good films that could have been great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fictional story of The Jackal(though I do believe that there once existed a man with the very same codename and of the same profession; well, technically, he still does exist, as he's still alive, but incarcerated) is a great piece of literature(so I understand; unfortunately, I haven't had the pleasure of reading the book by Frederick Forsyth myself, but I understand it's excellent). Fortunately, it translates onto the silver screen pretty well. Unfortunately, it didn't get a better director than Fred Zinnemann, who I haven't seen other films by, but I assume he just either didn't "get it" enough to do it right, or he just lacked the talent to keep the story interesting and give it the amount of tension that it needs. However, whatever it is, it's certainly too bad. The story is great; the film could have been too. The plot is very, very good, but it drags a little too much, and the pace is too slow for a movie that expects you to sit through 145 minutes, just under two and a half hours. The direction is a little sloppy, and unless you're very interested in knowing about The Jackal and his mission, which I admittedly was the first time I saw it, you probably won't sit through the entire thing, simply because in the end, it's just too stale and boring. The acting is good; I didn't find any of the characters poorly portrayed. The characters are well-written and credible, but I'm not sure whether to chalk that up to Forsyth or the scriptwriter. From what I understand, the film is a fairly good and accurate depiction of the book. The cinematography is nothing special. The film doesn't do that good a job of creating suspense or tension. The direction is, like I said, somewhat stale. Unless you're very interested in watching an accurate, realistic and fairly thorough depiction of how a truly professional assassin goes about assassinating one of the most powerful men in the world, you won't enjoy this movie. That digs quite a chunk out of the audience, I would imagine. Then again, maybe there are a lot of people who, like me, enjoy watching an entirely professional assassin conduct "business". All in all, a fairly good thriller, but only for a limited crowd and doesn't stand repetition too good, since, well, once you know how it ends, the film has nothing left to offer, apart from the good story, which you might as well read(since, by most accounts, the book is better). I recommend it to fans of films dealing with assassins and assassinations, as well as very big fans of thrillers. If you do not like this movie within the first few minutes, then you most likely won't like it at all. Just a little warning to those who find the direction as bland as I do. Good, but could(and most certainly should) have been great. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1973 pace was slower in general</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of Jackal would seem tedious by today's standard pace-- Nowadays everything on screen goes so fast and loud that 30 yr old films seem very slow-- films made in the 50's, 40's and before seem so slow that most young Americans cant watch them. Although Jackal was not a classic, it is like an old standard song-- never really gets old-- it captures Europe in the early 1970's, especially France after the Algerian defeat and the rebellious OAS generals who did try to kill De Gaulle. The film is always watchable, in part because there are no "moviestars" (Edward Fox was hardly known at the time, outside of Britain) making the film more realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jackal Hits The Target!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>France, 1963 and President Charles De Gaulle survives an assassination attempt by a terrorist underground movement known as the OAS.Three of its members are killed in the attempt while the others are arrested.Undeterred by this failure the group decide to try again but this time using a professional hitman - The Jackal, a young Englishman (Edward Fox), who demands and receives $500,000 for the job.After a lot of research coupled with false passport, ID cards &amp; car licenses, Fox needs a certain kind of gun, so he gets in contact with a gunsmith (Cyril Cussack) who designs &amp; builds a lightweight, build-it-yourself rifle.Satisfied that with both the weapon and the false papers, The Jackal prepares to track down and kill the President on Liberation Day.However, the French Secret Service are already on his tail after successfully interrogating one of the OAS members from the original assassination attempt. Will they kill the Jackal in time!?Based on the Frederick Forsyth bestseller, director Fred Zinnermann does a faithful reproduction for the big screen. Zinnermann's last film was the 1966 classic, "A Man For All Seasons", so it was a welcome return to form after so many years away from the industry.In spite of the many flaws that littered the film, coupled with an over complicated storyline, Zinnerman keeps the film ticking over nicely with a good combination of thrills &amp; spills but without letting it get too out of hand with all guns blazing.Instead Fred opts for a very low-key approach, introducing &amp; identifying the main characters with a deft but detailed way. Fox, for example, is a typical English gent/playboy but with a methodical &amp; calculating mind for detail. While his nemesis in the French Secret Service, Detective Inspector Label (Michal Lonsdale), is almost his equal for guile, patience &amp; wisdom, as he tries to unravel the many twists &amp; dead ends the Jackal leaves in his wake.However, there are moments when the film seems to crawl along before anything of interest happens, especially during the final 20 or so minutes.The dialogue also feels too complex &amp; overburdened at times, and one wonders why The Jackal should want to choose something as important as Liberation Day to kill the President. Much as I admired Fox's business-like nature covering his tracks, it did bother me a great deal as to why he should choose such an obvious date when his own practical common sense would have told him that both the police and the Secret Service would be out in force to protect De Gaulle during such a major French celebration.These little quibbles aside Day Of The Jackal is one of the best political thrillers to come out of Hollywood. Unfortunately, however, Hollywood tried for a 1997 remake with Bruce Willis at the helm, The movie stank &amp; bombed at the box office and was derided by fans &amp; critics alike as a dreadful travesty and subsequently should be avoided at all costs.****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>don't get the love for this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's August 1962. Extremists from the Army called O.A.S. attempt to assassinate President Charles de Gaulle for giving Algeria independence. Six months later, many in the group are arrested and their leader sentenced to death. In desperation, they hire The Jackal (Edward Fox) to kill De Gaulle for $500k. They rob banks for the money. The authorities are trying to discover the scheme.I don't get why the love from everybody for this movie. Even compared to other action thrillers of the era, this is rather mind-numbing. I'm OK with watching the minutia of planning but this is a bit too long with that. I love the European locations. However the action is shot poorly. This is 2 years after 'The French Connection' and feels like a step back. It is a boring thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great thriller with a horrible pedigree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's enjoyable, without a doubt. The pace is excellent, and the film does a superb job of showing us the parallel intertwining threads of the Jackal and his pursuers as they spiral from tense perigee to baffled apogee. The Jackal's ingenuity in the times when he's close to capture is clever enough to make him a sympathetic character; while Lebel's brilliant detective work ensures that the audience's loyalties are with him too. With the viewer rooting for both sides, everybody wins, of course.But, oh! - what a ghastly creation is The Jackal himself. Fox plays it perfectly, because he is to the manor born. I'm sure Freddie Forsyth was delighted with Fox's portrayal of his upper-class assassin - Eton-educated, SAS-trained, ruthless efficiency with a touch of humanity that lasts only while practical. Tough enough to deal with the lower orders, but ready to snuff them out in a moment when they reveal their swindling natures. Tough enough even to take favours from a kindly bath-house poof when needs must (and to perform, presumably, the abominable acts the deception required, though of course we're spared the details of *that*), but able to cleanse himself by killing the man shortly thereafter.The Jackal's true proclivities are very hetero, of course - and among his own social stratum. We see him pluck a sophisticated aristocrat whose coolness crumbles before his charms. His couplings (naturally) impress her enough to shelter him from the hovering hunters. But this is not enough to guarantee his safety, so she too is snuffed out without a thought. Asking for it, she was.The demeanour of Fox's Jackal is most reminiscent of Rowntree, the sadistic prefect in Lindsay Anderson's If...., and it seems clear that his genesis would have been just those circumstances. He's an Establishment figure whose profession just happens to be murder - an anti-Bond, replacing courage with psychopathy, sexuality with oiliness, and cool with frigidity. I bet Forsyth wishes he could be like that.The Jackal's interaction with the gun-maker comes closest to a meeting of minds. It's an impressive scene, in which the cold professionalism of both parties is designed to awe us. "Will the gentleman be moving?" asks the machinist in his quiet way. Yes, the unnamed target is in reality just a head to be turned to a gory spray like a melon, but let's at least nod to the fact that he's a man, and even assume that he might be gentle. Ooh, how chilling.This is not an admirable person. There probably are real people like this, and they should be made into cat-food. There are certainly countless people who believe, hope or wish they were The Jackal. I suspect that Forsyth and Fox are among them, and that, really, is what's wrong with both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who is the Jackal? Spoilers follow.Day of the Jackal is certainly one of the better thrillers of the 1970s and isn't so concerned about subtexts like Dirty Harry and Jaws. While visually on par with early 60s material, 'Jackal has an ace up its sleeve in the narrative department. Some of the scenes try to use visual illustration to convey key plot points, but the cinematography is less than mediocre.This is a film about story and not about linking one content idea (i.e. set-piece action and sex scenes) together with another. One thing I find hilarious is how the movie tells you everything you need to know in the first 20 minutes, then makes you forget all about it in the next two hours. To save yourself most of the trip, just fast forward to miss all the nagging subplots that aren't as lively as Ronin. Since Fred Zinnemann isn't a visual auteur, I'll give him the reprieve I wouldn't grant to Luc Besson and Jean-Pierre Jeunet.While, in hindsight, this is a totally predictable outcome as are many films of the 70s like The Omen. I am struck by Zinnemann's use of peace and subtlety, even when at times he is being all to obvious in both actions and force. This isn't a great movie, but it has more strengths than such commercial trash as Mission: Impossible.Overall, you don't need to see this movie to understand the suspense/thriller genre, but it doesn't hurt as opposed to All the President's Men. The acting is poor, but it is more technical and fabricated than meticulously crafted. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A terrorist group hires a hit-man to assassinate French President de Gaulle. There is an excellent, 90-minute thriller trapped inside this leisurely-paced film. If only Zinnemann weren't more interested in making an epic than in telling a gripping story. The inclusion of mundane plot details saps the film of much of the excitement. The story is also somewhat confusing early, with too many subplots and characters. The ease with which the authorities track down the Jackal is not believable, and the finale is underwhelming after the big buildup. Sadly, the two actresses in the film, Georges-Picot and Seyrig, both died young.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Acting and script was from a age when Frank Zimmerman was cutting edge. ie the 1940s.The was just to many holes in the plot for me to enjoy this film. Consider the following.The Killer, was not thought to be French, so they say the British "Do who have any assassins on the Loose ? " to which they reply, yes, we suspect a Charles Calthrop of killing the Dom. Rep. President but have never bothered to investigate.His code name was a cryptic clue to his used name of Calthorp, how stupid was that.Applying for a British passport takes 6 to 8 week, he managed it in a day.There is no way of checking death certificates against Passport applications. This still the oldest trick in the book for assuming a new identity in the UK. However they managed it in a couple of hours.He managed to buy a forged driving licence and other documents, so why not a passport. How unlikely is it that you could pickpocket a passport of someone who bears a passing resemblance to you and use it as your own.The detective in charge was told he had all the power he wanted to conduct the investigation, however he never drafted in any extra personal except for one.The woman admitted to the detective that she slept with the Jackal (after lying first) , but was not planning on seeing him again. Why on earth didn't the detective have the house watched, just in case the Jackel turned up, which of course he did.Where did he get the paint from for the Car, this would have looked suspicious when presumably his car was checked coming over the border.He managed to do professional respray job of the car in an hour or so. Anyone having had a car re-sprayed knows this takes 3 days allowing for drying and several coats.When they Stole the woman's car, why leave it parked right outside the train station where it would be immediately found and indicate that he caught a train to Paris. Put it in a long stay car park you fool or somewhere out of view.When the train arrived in Paris, why didn't the detective ring the train station and have if met, instead for getting in his car as rushing across town himself, and of course arriving too late.A 70 years old Politician reveals state secrets to a 20 years old bit of crumpet Throws herself at him and keeps asking probing questions. I don't think so. Why did she have to get up in the middle of the night to replay the information from his phone. Obviously she would get caughtThe Gun he used looked like a pee-shoot.I could go on and on. A truly amateurish, dated film, so bad even the Bruce Willis remake is more watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique setup, but the last part is too rushed to stay in tune</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie clearly stands out among the conspiracy thriller of the 70s. Maybe we could eventually point this out as a big mistake since the political background is made much too clear in the beginning, leaving not the slightest obscure force under wraps for us to chill. On the other hand we can't complain an American director can be that much careful about a 100% European story.On the uptake the Day of the Jackal starts out very well, provided you're not French and already know the whole thing about the Petit-Clamart assassination attempt. At some point the audience is rooting both for the uptight professional, the Jackal, and the French officer who relentlessly tries to hunt him down.Then, once the police starts getting precise information about the Jackal the suspense is rushed in an awkward way. The Jackal, charming yet cold as a snake until then, becomes less likable as he reminds us he is just a cold-blooded murderer. The increased pace of his road to Paris lacks the real elements of a chase. Yet the Police doesn't seem to get the upper hand, so we're let to wait for the events to unfold which is the other way to call an ill-conceived suspense.Basically I think we can analyze the unsuccessful part in this movie as adaptation traps. A killer in a book is a suspenseful device. Following a killer on screen would mean to empathize. Wrong way. But without the Jackal here we only get half a story, right? Maybe the solution is in not drawing the Jackal as a transparent man in the crowd, but more an evil superman like Fantomas or Mabuse. Well I may be wrong but this Edward Fox low profile but upper class character really left me dissatisfied in the end.</fullReview>

(Readthe comments from "Pete Kelly" for details... I won't bother.) Theonly comment I have to add about the obvious holes in the plot is,why does the police commisioner, who has the entire police forceof France at his disposal, have to be the one who discovers theJackal and single-handedly mows him down with machine gunfire at the last moment? (If the character had been developed a bitso there was a feeling of mano-a-mano between the two, OK, I canbuy that; its fiction; but there's not- he's just an anonymous French[usually half-asleep] beaureaucrat with a fuzzy mustache)Even though the Bruce Willis-Richard Gere vehicle wasn't muchbetter, at least it had a little tension, pacing, and an ending; not theanticlimatic patience-testing of this one.I MADE myself sit down and watch this one after seeing bits andpieces of it for years; another two hours of my life I'll never getback.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something less than "great"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the holes in the plot have already been mentioned except two that I found really annoying. #1 (and it's a flaw in just about any "paid assassin" type of flick), is that a steely-jawed, unflinching, consummate professional hit-man MISSES his shot, when the chips are finally down. #2 The hero of the flick really does nothing all that remarkable anytime in the movie. Just what abilities does this - rather mousy-looking - guy have that warrant the confidence that everyone places in him. I'm still wondering.And the idea that anyone could kill as effortlessly as "The Jackal" also strains credulity to the breaking point. None of his victims ever even make a sound. He simply touches them and they collapse - graveyard dead.The movie is fairly well crafted I guess, but it's age is really showing now. The pace is moderate at it's quickest points and almost grinds to a halt at times. And the ending is simply a throw away. I think it was probably more impressive in the early '70s...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film of a best selling novel, Day of the Jackal was one of the truer versions. However, today in 2004, the unfortunate problem is the dated nature of the cinematic techniques used. It feels very 70ish and looks it.The story, however, is as important today as it was in the 1960's. We still have terrorists or freedom fighters resorting to a violent solution to achieve their goals. The intricacy of the planning and the 'almost' nature of the hit is, though, a powerful view of the way those who are committed to a cause will act.Overall, a valuable, if dated, film to highlight the lengths some people will go to achieve an ultimate prize.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director's and script writer's skills consist in knowing what to take out and packing a whole intricate book in two hours. Like a comic book, they suggest developments rather than show them. For example: a woman's dog scares a rider's horse; the woman apologizes to the rider. Next time we see them, they are lovers.Sometimes they take out too much, and you miss out what is going on. The last few scenes for example, are a total let down, you are left scratching your head as to how they got there.Visually it's not so great, in parts it looks like somebody's old super 8 shots.

		<fullReview>But don't go see it again if you like to keep it in favorable memory. We liked it a lot the 1st time and made that mistake to watch it again: it revealed a riddle of flaws. How can a deGaulle! assassin in a 'can never work again' job, not have a backup ( hand-) weapon? But lets not get ahead of ourselves. 140 gunshots in 7 seconds - we witness how the rear window of deGaulle's Citroen shatters and falls out, so the back of his head and his shoulders, become visible. Yet when he arrives minutes later in that same car, the rear window is almost completely in place again. Mr.Jackal was presented as an intellectual ( and experienced ) assassin, but Zinnemann made him throw a suitcase ( which did not cross the border with him ) into plain sight knowing the cops are on Mr.Jackal's trail. And leave the scene of a license-plates-theft in sight of the victims, where the natural thing is to avoid being seen. Three sections of his gun tubes would not fit inside the Alfa Romeo exhaust pipe shown : recognize the 'cut' between wrapping and shoving it in. And how did he smuggle i.e where did he hide the rest of his crutches-assembly ? The lil' Alfa don't have enough hidden spaces. If it is midnight in Paris, it's not "7" in D.C. -not am nor pm- and NOPE no daylight saving in '63. There was no paint-gun yet operable at 12v (invented 1971) Accident-scene: if the driver of the Peugoet 404 died in this crash, there was a considerable 2nd impact-site. And sure the cops were able to tell there was a 2nd vehicle involved in the accident. How then can LeBel order only 10km radius search and ...'watch for 2 suitcases' ... ???? No 40yr old average human being suffocates another 40yr old healthy human in 10sec with bare hands ( or get them unconscious and kill ) without a sound or struggle. If you are 70+ yrs of age, would you climb the top of a 30ft ladder to break thru a window when the hallway-door to that same room has a handle and a key-hole ? Tulle station, machine-gun flic. Q "Danish?" A "Please?" and then Q "What is your business here?" A "I'm a schoolteacher on holiday" After pretending not to understand the word "Danish?" every cop in the world would've arraigned 'Mr.Lundquist' after his 2nd answer.That "midday train to Paris" has 3 different engines. The 1st minister-meeting was from 7pm to about 10pm. According to the light however, LeBel's wife ran to the dove-house to tell about Berthier's car late morning or early pm. And when LeBel arrived, the ministers hallways were showered in mid-daylight.Mr. Duggan could not have been Mr.Duggan anywhere; according to LeBel the passport was issued JUL.30th and quoting LeBel " no need to go back any further "France's entire law-apparatus at LeBel's descretion was hunting the wrong car : the Alfa's license plate was not GE1741 as LeBel had his assistant write down.From LeBel's office to Gare Austerlitz was more than 30minutes - under good circumstances thru 1963 Paris' street-traffic. It is also said in another IMDb'ers comment that they certainly had plenty of manpower at a major Paris-train station. A simple phone-call would've accomplished a better job. The 'rushing-to-the-train' scene is complete nonsense whichever way you look at it. Was there a problem with the film's budget, that Zinnemann couldn't afford to avoid ( or cut ) vehicles that didn't yet exist ? In '63 there were no BMX bikes in Genova or anywhere on this globe, no Renault R16, Peugeot 504 or 304, Vespa Scooters with square headlights, no Citroen Limousines with 'chinese' around-the-curve looking headlights ( we're sure you can find 2doz more wrong 'voitures' ). This piece became a science-fiction. Or is Pontius Pilate starting Ben Hur's race with a flare-gun and 'The Godfather' driving Ford Mondeo's and Chevy Lumina's ?And once LeBel discovered the open window - his logical and fastest option ( duty? ) to prevent the Jackal, was to get to deGaulle less than 10sec away. Not climb 6 flights by foot to "top floor" for a shootout. Compare the explosion of the melon with the tiny " puff " of Jackal's shot at DeGaulle. An explosive bullet would've caused a 5inch crater in the cobble-stones, not to speak of the 150 'dezibel' at impact less than 5ft from DeGaulle's head. In a 100ft diameter everyone would 'duck away' after such a bullet's impact on granite. It is human reflex.*** All those things can truly 'disenchant' ? it'll throw you off as they say. Zinnemann and Ross budged massively.However much of the above we didn't recognize quite AS badly at first watch, 'cause plot and places ( thanks to FF ) are pleasurable and manage to distract and occupy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very tedious.It requires a lot of patience to keep watching,yet you're expecting a great finale.Unfortunately,the climax is pretty anticlimactic,and certainly not worth the wait.The film succeeds as a tour around Europe but fails as a suspenser.It's slow and unrewarding,with one plus: Fox's on-target performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Done, But NOT Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not understand why this original is rated higher than the remake. The remake, in my opinion, is much more enjoyable than this original.The pacing in this film is terrible! It is so slow and has long blocks of uneventful meanderings, such as to put One to SLEEP! This is a horribly dated spy vehicle centered around the old cold war between France and Great Britain, which seems intriguing on the surface, but it delivers SO LITTLE intrigue as to render the entire production boring and ultimately kills any quality of enjoyability it might otherwise engender.I hated it, though it does appear to be the favorite in the original vs. remake war.It rates a 5.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dullest Thriller Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>well, it's a strong contender that's for sure. I actually was expecting a pretty decent film but it just helped confirm by belief that Zinnemann's film for the most part are distant and lifeless for the most part. Granted I really like A Man For All Season.This film revolves around an assassins in 1963 and the job he's been hired for by the OAS. The job is to kill the president of France. For such an exciting sounding premise the film is a bore.It's directed in a disconnected manner that makes every detail of the film static. IT jumps around as the assassin prepares for the job which consists of very little yet takes 2 and a half hours of film time. Mean while the police know the OAS has hired an assassin to take somebody out and are scrambling to find out how he is.Thing is the police just seem to magically come across information regarding the assassins identity and where abouts, they do very little investigating and info just seems to fall into their laps.On a side note, something that interested me is that the film seems to have been a huge inspiration on Spielberg when it came to shooting Munich. The film makes much us of telephoto lenses and zooms in a very similar manner to Munich. Hell, Spielberg even cast the lead detective from Jackal as "Papa". That said Spielberg's use of telephoto lenses and zooms works much better. He used them in a way that brings you closer to the action were Zinneman used it to keep you away.Something else that I found funny was that before watching it, I read Ebert's review. He said "It's two and a half hours long but feels like fifteen minutes" do to how "spellbinding it is.I could have only hoped it went by that fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grossly overrated.... disgrace to the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought the DVD considering the fame of the novel. The movie was a big disappointment. Pathetic direction, mediocre actors, non-existent music. Edward Fox himself has done the worst job. He in no way fits the description of the jackal in the novel, where he is supposed be well built, with grey cloudy eyes. The scene where the jackal kills the forger is beautifully portrayed in the novel, whereas in the movie its a flop. The story as described in the novel has not been followed at many places. Each and every actor contributes to the disappointment.The direction and photography too are poor. When I logged on to check the reviews, I expected it to be full of jeers, though again I was wrong...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something not happening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies, plays, literature of all sorts... has evolved to convey narratives... whose raison d'etre is to convey how something unusual happened, or convey where people, confronted with dilemmas or challenges, did something remarkable. There are few renowned stories in any medium in which nothing of any note occurs.But throughout film history, befuddled film-makers who have no idea what they're exploring, foist something onto an audience that has no reason for existing; Movies like Falling In Love (a complete fizzle with DeNiro &amp; Streep), Kubrick's The Killing... Day of the Jackal. These films lack anything of substance or meaning occurring along the way, and frequently lack a climax of any sort. In all their details, it's not possible for them to stray from the central idea, because there is no central idea. With other duds (The Royal Tannenbaums) a viewer is unable to say what the hell it was even about, except that Wes Anderson collected a bunch of Neat-O scenes he wanted to film, to make himself look hip. Vacuity.I cannot even get my mind around what the appeal was supposed to be for this fictional assassination attempt ...which fails. (!?) The narrative form didn't arise to tell stores in which nothing of interest occurs, en route to a faled larger event, which was in itself a complete fabrication. What? We have such strong need for anti-climaxes, that we have to invent stories of things not happening?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>torturously slow movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like wooden dialogue and indistinguishable characters, this is the film for you. Day of the Jackal is an excellent cautionary tale for the aspiring screenwriter eager to learn what "techniques" to avoid.This movie is a disaster but fun, if you watch it from that perspective and remove your brain from your head. I gave it one star but recommend it anyway, as long as you fast forward through tons of "important" dialogue, film can-loads of extraneous location shots, cheap sets, soap opera-lit interiors, and wildly bad acting. This is like a camp version of "The Man From UNCLE." Or "Get Smart." Except it goes on way past two hours. And these guys are serious. I thought the French cops couldn't solve a bungling caper and they know who the "Jackal" is? It IS a good movie to talk back to, make jokes along the way, supply your own dialogue, fill in the blanks, balance your checkbook, call your lover, throw junk at the TV. But don't watch it all or you'll go crazy or die of boredom. In the end you won't know or care what happened whatsoever. I kept expecting President De Gaulle and his detail to turn and start firing on the production crew.The movie takes place in France, but it's one of those movies where just so you won't have to be bothered with actually reading subtitles, everyone miraculously speaks English. Some speak English with an English accent, some with a French accent. Just to confuse things a bit, the assassin the French rebels hire actually is English. Needless to say, this may confuse some viewers a little. The English are rude snobs as usual. As far as the actual content of the movie is concerned, there's not much to say. It was an uninteresting series of scenes strung together with no real passion or originality.Dullest thriller ever? Well, it's a strong contender that's for sure. I actually was expecting a pretty decent film but it just helped confirm by belief that Zinnemann's film for the most part is distant and lifeless. Granted I really like A Man For All Season. This film revolves around an assassin in 1963 and the job he's been hired for by the OAS. The job is to kill the president of France. For such an exciting sounding premise the film is a bore. It's directed in a disconnected manner that makes every detail of the film static. It jumps around as the assassin prepares for the job which consists of very little yet takes 2 and a half hours of film time. Meanwhile the police know the OAS has hired an assassin to take somebody out and are scrambling to find out how he is. Thing is the police just seem to magically come across information regarding the assassin's identity and where abouts, they do very little investigating and info just seems to fall into their laps.I found the movie dull, dull, dull. BUT, if you are a foreign film buff or a Political Drama fan, or gullible then this movie is possibly for you. I remember watching this as a kid and enjoying it. Also, the "fancy pants" English assassin character is just not believable. This film has not aged well.This 2-plus hour film was not a return on the time investment. Very dated, perhaps it was exciting or groundbreaking when it was released but today it just doesn't hold up. Some scenes drag on and on, while others (such as the ending) stop so abruptly you'd think no one went back to check the final cut. The assassin in the film is so unbelievable as a ruthless mastermind specialist killer it's hilarious. This thrill-less thriller ranks right down there with the other 1970's over-hyped "thrillers". Again, in their own time and context, perhaps these films worked. But today, not a chance.Don't get me wrong; I'm not big on car chases and exploding buildings and all that. But yes, I do want the story to MOVE ALONG. This story moves at a snail's pace... it PLODS along... I had high hopes for it, but about 2/3 the way through I snoozed, and was glad for the relief from this torturously slow movie. In case you didn't notice, the keyword is: SLOW. Worthless.</fullReview>
