		<shortDescription>Spielberg's 1st "Serious" Film Is Beautiful and Powerful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker. The fact is, Steven Spielberg, probably our greatest story-teller, has been doing this in various movie formats for years. THE COLOR PURPLE, at the time, was considered risky, especially after action classics like JAWS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. In hindsight, this film should have come as no surprise, for Spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in E.T. Critics called COLOR PURPLE his entrance into intellectual fare. It is quite an entrance. No special effects, no swashbuckling, just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by Alice Walker. One surprise is how Spielberg could present such a moving film about African-Americans in the deep south. Slavery is gone, but in the south depicted here, it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves. Spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience. This is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations. It is the first in a line of films people either didn't see or wouldn't see because there are no aliens. EMPIRE OF THE SUN, ALWAYS, SCHINDLER'S LIST, etc.. His awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because A) he uses mostly untrained, first-time actors, B) he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen, and C) it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years. It is almost epic-like in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single Academy Award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insult.Whoopi Goldberg is fabulous as the tortured Celie, an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive Danny Glover, who she only knows as "Mister". The film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with "Mister". The PG-13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the Walker novel. This is not "The Burning Bed" in Georgia by any means. There is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected. It happens gracefully. Goldberg perfectly plays a human being, someone in need of love and someone who deserves it. The films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when Goldberg and her sister, Nettie (played by Akosua Busia) are separated, maybe forever. (Possibly foreshadowing Holocaust separation of child and parent?) You may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequence.The color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people. There really is something to live for, but love triumphs over all. Spielberg bashers take note: the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens.RATING: 10 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply beautiful really is the only way to describe such a wondrous film, one which warms the heart, nourishes the soul, and brings a tear to the eye. This statement is neither hyperbolic nor exaggerated, one of many reasons I suggest you see this film.The film opens in 1909 when Celie (Whoopi Goldberg in her feature film debut) as a young girl, as well as a victim of incest, impregnated by her father. Unattractive and unloved, separated from her beloved sister and children, Celie has no other option than to be wedded to an abusive, impoverished, and philandering husband named Albert (Danny Glover), a man who treats her no better than a slave. However, Celie's life forever changes when Albert returns home in accompaniment with his mistress Shug (Margaret Avery), a beautiful Blues singer.In spite of the seemingly hopeless situation the film's plot provides Celie with, the Color Purple is not a tale of her despair, but rather her triumph, one which is immensely inspiring. Stellar in every aspect this film is, including Stephen Spielberg's highly credible direction, the acting, especially of the four most prominent stars: Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey (both quite impressive in their debuts), Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery, the plot, etc. As one of my most revered novels and films, I definitely recommend the Color Purple. Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkably moving story from the maestro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly wonderful film from the guru of directing, Mr Steven Spielberg. This great director has suffered much criticism throughout his career. He was slammed by a lot of the press for 'never really growing up' and it took SCHINDLER'S LIST to quiten these critics. However almost ten years before his remarkable account of the Holocaust Spielberg directed this gem.It is the moving tale of a young black girl born into a male-dominated world, and tells the story of her gradual loss of identity followed by her defiance in reclaiming the life she lost. This was Whoopi Goldberg's remarkable screen debut that assured her of major stardom, and it is not hard to see why. Her fear towards her husband is frighteningly real, as is her silent rebellious side that ventures outwards in the last section of the film. Danny Glover paints a horrific image of a cruel husband, and still manages to give us a valid reason why he acts the way he does, before a moving conclusion to his character's development. The part of Sofia is also expertly played by Oprah Winfrey, especially during the Christmas reunion scene when the viewer can't help but share her pain through to joy. A special treat is an appearance by Laurence Fishburne (then Larry) in a small role.It is cinema such as this that proves Steven Spielberg's genius. You will often forget that it is him you are watching (not least by the lack of another genius, Mr John Williams), but it only adds to this director's credit that he is so versatile. If anyone passed over this film as a possible blip in Spielberg's career (as I shamefully did!) watch it now! You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>huge achievement from Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film version of Alice Walker's hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel (written largely as letters from the central character Celie to God) was a massive Oscar success, and rightly so.In the role of the abused and awakened Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles. Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, the fiery woman tamed by fate. Others in the cast fleshed out the characters Walker had introduced so clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's abusive husband; Margaret Avery as Shug, a force of change for the good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the preacher's wife; and the much-missed Carl Anderson (otherwise best known as Judas in the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar) as preacher Samuel.Beautifully paced and sensitively written, 'The Color Purple' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature-length drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK when I was young, I wathced this film with my family and I thought that it was so boring. Then when I got older, I understood this film. It really is a powerful film. This film will bring tears to your eyes literally. The Color Purple is an incredible story about a woman named Celie who grows up living at the mistreatment of a man named "Mister". Whoppi Goldberg's performance is amazing. She should have won that Oscar. The rest of the cast is amazing. I cannot say enough about this movie. It really is a piece of African American History. This film is not just a "movie" it is a piece of beauty. This film will be cherished forever and ever. If you do not like this film, then you need a wake up call.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Commenting on the 20th Anniversary of this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2005,this will be the 20th Anniversary re-released of one of the most unforgettable motion pictures ever devised for the screen. However,this movie is worth seeing since it comes from one of the most distinguished directors in Hollywood......The man who brought us the greatest films ever made..."Jaws","Close Encounters","Raiders of the Lost Ark","E.T.", "Jurassic Park","Schindler's List","Hook","Poltergeist","A.I.-Artficial Intelligence","Minority Report",and so many more.But this movie,"The Color Purple" was one of the most powerful and meaningful films ever made and to this day it stands out as a classic example of great cimema at its finest. Based on the novel by Alice Walker(who wrote the screenplay with collaborator Menno Meyjes),and directed by Steven Spielburg.I saw this film at a premiere they had in 1985,and to this day it moves me in such a way that I had never felt,and it is moved me to tears every time I see this masterpiece,20 years later. This film showcased a lot of brilliant talent,since it had an all-African American cast which starred Danny Glover,Whoopi Goldberg,Margaret Avery,Oprah Winfrey,Adolph Caesar, Laurence Fishburne,Rae Dawn Chong,Akosua Busia,Desreta Jackson, Willard Pugh,Leonard Jackson,Carl Anderson,and a lot more.The film is worth seeing! Highly recommended! Grand performances all around! Anything that has to be directed by Steven Spielburg is worth seeing. Great drama at its best! It also goes to show how unfairly African-Americans were really treated back then,not just by their white counterparts,but by their own race as a whole,and this movie shows that how really cruel that is. It was one of the top ten grossing boxoffice movies of 1985,and was nominated for an impressive 12 Academy Awards including Best Picture,Best Director,and Best Actress(which Whoopi Goldberg should have won!)not to mention musical score from composer Quincy Jones. See this in the widescreen version on video and DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgotten Spielberg Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice Walker's epic novel is put on the big-screen by director Steven Spielberg and the results are excellent. The film deals with the maturity and independence of a mistreated black woman (Whoopi Goldberg in an Oscar-nominated role) from the years 1909 to 1947. The audience gets to experience all of her triumphs and tragedies through the film's running time. A very strong cast of supporting players make the film memorable as well. Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Rae Dawn Chong, Margaret Avery, and Oprah Winfrey (the last two Oscar-nominated) all shine with the great screenplay and Spielberg's subtle direction. Somewhat forgotten on Spielberg's list of credits, but still one of his very best films. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A White Supremacist's Wet Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning. But sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty? Nobody should love that." - Lucius Shepard Set in the Deep South during the early 1900s, "The Color Purple" opens with Celie and Nettie, two African American sisters. They're playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather. This motif ? innocence interrupted by men ? permeates the entire film.Director Steven Spielberg then launches into a series of short sequences. Celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather, gives birth in a dirty barn, has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry local widow Albert Johnson, a violent oaf who repeatedly rapes her, forces her to cook, clean and look after his children.All these horrific scenes are given little screen time, and are surrounded by moments of pixie-dust cinematography, a meddlesome symphonic score, incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work. The cumulative effect is like the merging of a Disney cartoon and a rape movie, a jarring aesthetic which caused Stanley Kubrick to remark that "The Color Purple" made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes. Ten minutes? He lasted a long time.The film is often said to deal which "racism", "sexism" and "black culture", but this isn't true. Alice Walker, the author of the novel upon which "Purple" is based, is an in-the-closet lesbian who attempted to write a quasi-feminist tale of female liberation, self-discovery and which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women. For Walker, women must bond together in a kind of matriarchal utopia, black sisterhood and female independence celebrated.Spielberg's film, however, re-frames Walker's story through the lens of comforting American mythologies. This is a film in which the salvific power of Christianity overcomes the supposed "natural" cruelty of men. A film in which Albert is a bumbling fool who constantly finds himself in ridiculous situations. A film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows, the cast comprised of lecherous men (always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins), stereotypical fat mammies, jazz bands and gospel choirs.This is a film in which blacks are naturally childlike, readily and happily accepting their social conditions. A film in which blacks are over-sexed, carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions. A film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible (Albert lives in a huge house) and in which black men are completely inept. This is not the Old South, this is the Old South as derived from "Gone With The Wind", MGM Muscals, "Song of the South", Warner Cartoons, "Halleluha!" and banned Disney movies. In other words, it's the South as seen by a child raised on 50s TV. It's all so cartoonish, so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that black novelist Ishmael Reed famously likened it to a Nazi conspiracy.Of course, in typical Spielberg fashion, the film ends with family bonds being healed. Walker's novel, meanwhile, was resolutely anti Christian. Walker's women think "God is a white man for white folk and hates women", and even used the Bible to mocking prove that "Jesus was black" and that white churches are a "conspiracy of control". Believing that traditional notions of Christianity operate to suppress women and blacks, they then turn atheist, ditch their minister fathers, and then, upon renouncing patriarchy, begin to trace a movement away from Christianity and traditional, Western family units and toward an African, tribal form of spiritualism and/or community (paganism, lesbianism etc are just some of the means by which Walker's characters symbolically reject all white conventions). Spielberg reverses all this. His women reconcile with their fathers, the film focuses on Christians and Christian churches, and all hints of a spiritual alternative outside of patriarchy are erased. Because Spielberg is uninterested in the wider black community, and in any socio-historical context, the film eventually turns into both a hate letter to black men, and a bizarre caricature of black life. Elsewhere Spielberg's camera busily fights for attention (Celie's kitchen contraptions belong in a cartoon or "Home Alone" movie), every emotion is over played, sequences are loaded with extraneous visual pizazz, racist caricatures, emphatic musical cues and inappropriate musical numbers. Couple this with Quincy Jones' ridiculously "white" music, and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history: a feminist tract filmed by a daddy-loving white Jew in the style of Disney and Griffith and scored by a black man trying to emulate John Williams.Problematic too is the lack of white characters. Note: the film's men aren't portrayed as being rough to each other, nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which emasculates. No, they are cruel by nature. And the women, whether quietly suffering like Celie or rebellious and tough like her sister, persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them. A better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed, rather, it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse, that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts (whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles) and that African American domestic violence occurs largely because of socio-economic factors.And so there's a hidden ideology at work here. Late in the film one character tells another that since he didn't respect his wife, she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites. The implication is that blacks need to return to their African roots to restore their own dignity and that persecution is implicitly their fault; be good in your own minority community and you won't run afoul of the dominant white culture.3/10 ? Despicable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film captured my heart from the very beginning, when hearing Quincy Jones' first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows. This is truly a film to cry and die for...! The whole cast gives the best performance in a film I've seen in years and Spielberg has really outdone himself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey(oh lord!), Danny Glover, and the others, all give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character, and we grow with her, we grow strong together with her, throughout the movie, and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she's at her most arrogant, and shows us that "sinners", indeed, "have souls too". The always sympathetic, charming Danny Glover makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music of(I'd say sir)Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this splendid film! The photography, the music, the director and the music makes this beautiful, soulful movie into an experience of life. You don't want to miss it! "Sista'...remember my name..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vintage Spielberg In Both The Good &amp; Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with many Steven Spielberg films, this is a beautiful-looking movie, scene-after-scene almost looking like paintings. To me, that was the main attraction of the movie because the story - although powerful - to me, wasn't as appealing as the rich visuals. It's also one of those films almost guaranteed to bring a tear or two to ones eyes at the end.This is much more involving story if you are a woman or black person, because you can relate more to the characters in the film. As with typical Hollywood, political correctness rules: most of the men (white or black) are bad while the women (mostly black) are all good. If you are a male watching the movie, this bias in the story can be very annoying.Individually, I remember first watching this (I've seen it a couple of times) and being surprised what a good actress Oprah Winfrey was, and how appealing was Whoopi Goldberg's character "Celie." Goldberg became a star after this film (also for her comedy appearances on TV) but I always thought this role was, by far, her best or, at the least, her most appealing.Rae Dawn Chong never looked prettier and Margaret Avery played a real charmer. Danny Glover was effectively nasty. You wanted to punch his lights out!Overall, expect for what I mentioned above, this was good storytelling and certainly an involving, emotional story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you say, "syrup"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers.I'm sorry, but Spielberg didn't deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right in that vote. (Other Oscars for best actor nominations and such... that I don't know about. But it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) The way Spielberg directs this is so contrived, so meddlesome. While watching this movie a distinction made during a Film as Art course I have taken was screaming at me: "Sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered. Sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life." This is over-the-top sentimentality. When in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity, as Celie and Shug Avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from Nettie they have found? There are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film: all the men crowding around Miss Millie's car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away; Harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a cheap slapstick gag); the whole troop of revelers heading from the Jook Joint en masse to the chapel, as if magically entranced by the choir's singing... on and on. Nothing rings true. I even wondered if Harpo's name was chosen purposefully because it's his wife Sophia's real name, "Oprah," backwards. Spielberg isn't above such "cuteness."It's not that Spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion. Schindler's List was amazing, deeply touching for me, and I greatly admire Saving Private Ryan too for its realism, even if the story is a bit contrived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A powerful insight into the life of a mistreated black woman in the Deep South"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This stunning and enthralling portrayal, directed by the marvelous Steven Spielberg, is a true gem for reminding the world of the hardships of the ancestors of America's black peoples. Celie, an uneducated black woman is mistreated by her father, her "Mister", her step-children and almost anyone she is forced to endure ? aside from sister Nettie of course whose companionship, I believe, reiterates an important message: to love each other no matter what.The brief injections of comedic satire in the picture enable Goldberg, in her debut, to show the world what she really is ? a comic. A Golden Globe Award-winning and Oscar-nominated performance allows Goldberg to profess the destitute situation of the protagonist. One feels this was Goldberg's time to shine and really did thoroughly deserve that golden statuette from the Academy in comparison to her actual Oscar-winning supporting performance in 1990's Ghost. Nonetheless, the lack of real acclaim for this picture doesn't take away its drawing and moving storyline to see if, for once, Celie can really be happy.I didn't really recognize much of the supporting cast of the movie, expect from Oprah Winfrey. Now, I was not expecting much from Winfrey's performance as time and time again you get the occasional 'pop' and 'TV' stars who try and make the 'transition' into film. However, I was pleasantly surprised of Winfrey's portrayal of a distraught and let's say 'difficult' housewife Sofia. Although her character, I felt, did in a sense perpetuate the stereotype of the "big angry black woman" which I believe the film was trying to move away from. All in all, Winfrey garnered both an Oscar and Golden Globe nomination.One of the most beautiful pictures I have seen in years, and, not a single Oscar win, that I'll never know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trouble With The Color Purple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Color Purple (Steven Spielberg, 1985) can now be seen as a kind of cinematic watershed. It was a sign of the times but also of things to come: what was still unusual in 1985 would become commonplace by 1990. Since then, movies based on this mentality have become pervasive. Around that time, black men came forward charging that the movie was sexist (for perpetuating negative stereotypes of black men) as well as racist (for pitting black men and women against each other instead of white society). What caused their fury? In a nutshell, it was that every male character, without exception, is either a hopelessly stupid buffoon, a &#xfb01;endishly evil tyrant, or both. And every female character, without exception, is a purely innocent victim, a quietly enduring hero, or both.In The Color Purple, this cinematic world - viewers know it only from what they actually see and hear in movie theatres or on television - consists ultimately of a battle between the forces of light represented by women and those of darkness represented by men. Unless viewers supply other information from their own world (and thus contradict what is "said" by the movie itself) or from Walker's novel (and thus add at least some depth of humanity to the male characters), they must reach the conclusion that men are inherently worthless.What has made the male characters so worthless or evil is never shown; they just are that way. Was it because of the appalling conditions black people endured in the rural South of sixty years ago? Possibly. But if the situation was so destructive, why did only the female characters emerge with their dignity and humanity intact? From what viewers are shown, only one conclusion is possible: something innate in women allows them to rise above degradation, while something innate in men prevents them from doing so.Four women are triumphant and four men defeated: Harpo, the oaf who keeps falling through the ceiling as if in a rerun of Amos 'n Andy, is taken back at the very end by his long-suffering wife. No discernible change has taken place in him, while she has grown in wisdom and tolerance. Mister, a kind of black Simon Legree, eventually repents of his evil ways. But the last scene &#xfb01;nds him so crushed by guilt that he cannot bring himself even to ask for Celie's forgiveness. She, meanwhile, has successfully transcended the past and can thus move on into the future. Even in contrition, then, the men are worthless. At their best, in other words, they are irrelevant anachronisms.Given the roles presented, the only people who can actually identify themselves with the characters on-screen are women, whether black or white. No healthy man, black or white, could possibly do so, not only because all male characters are so unspeakably vile and so incredibly stupid but also because they are so uncinematically lifeless. Unlike the women, the men are not really people at all. They are wooden caricatures who represent crimes or pathologies, cardboard cutouts that exist in only one dimension, straw men set up to be knocked down - in short, not complex human beings in whom male and female viewers can see some of the good and evil in themselves. But this movie is not addressed to male viewers, not even to racist, white, male viewers. Apparently, the possible reaction of male viewers was considered irrelevant. The movie indicates that men are irrelevant once they stop persecuting women. In the &#xfb01;nal shot, the camera looks upward at the women, thus conferring visual monumentality and dignity on those who have escaped from their men and gone off to live together. Their pride and independence is thus emphasized in precisely the same way as the brutality and evil of the men, Celie's father and husband, were at the beginning.There are many positive things to be said about this film - the performances, the photography, and especially the direction by Spielberg, who at this point in time was still close enough to the peak of his powers to make anything he put his name to worth watching. But the message of the film is an ugly one, something that bypassed so many of its viewers when it was first released, and to look at the many reviews surrounding this one, continues to do so now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have won at least a few Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing that this film ( though nominated for 11 ) did not win any Oscars and Mr Spielberg was not even nominated for Best Director. This is a film about a young girl dealing with abuse who tries to find love and family. The fact that the characters are black is secondary but also educates those who are ignorant of just how bad things were for blacks in the south, not just because of racism but because of the problems that the community itself chose to ignore. Incest is a strong subject for any film to cover but Mr S does it brilliantly in a way that moves all the right emotions in us.Danny Glover plays his role perfectly,Whoopi Goldberg shines out as the main character and has never really repeated her performance in any film since,Oprah Winfrey is amazingly good and deserved an Oscar, Margaret Avery,Adolph Caesar, Laurence Fishburne,Rae Dawn Chong,Akosua Busia,Desreta Jackson, Willard Pugh,Leonard Jackson,Carl Anderson,and other cast members all did a fine job and each character comes to life.So why was this film snubbed by the film academy? Maybe it is racist? Maybe it is the strong sexual subject matter? Whatever the reason it will go down as one of the worst decisions in Oscar history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-"Schindler" masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a love/hate relationship with Steven Spielberg. I love most of his films, and I hate that I do. It would be so easy to simply discount his films as commercialized and mainstream, and some *are*, but they are almost always excellent. That was why I was so astonished by Schindler's List when it was released ? instead of sharks and superhero archaeologists, suddenly we had this incredibly profound film that was *so* well done. Having said that, I would have been less astonished had I seen The Color Purple first.*Possible Spoilers*The Color Purple follows the tragic life of Celie (Goldberg) who has to contend with being impregnated twice by a family member, is essentially sold to a man so she can be his wife, a mother to his children from a previous marriage and resident slave and whipping post, all before the age of fifteen. Through the years she goes from being completely beat down and oppressed to gaining a voice through the help of friends and other loved ones. I was completely riveted while watching this film, despite its length. The characters are so rich, and the story so full and well paced that it was impossible to get distracted, rather I wished that the film was actually longer. There was one moment that gave me pause, when Glover's character suddenly had a change of heart, but at that point I was so enamored by the film until that then that this made me raise an eyebrow, but it was easily forgiven. While the entire film is brilliantly executed, one particular scene to look out for is the scene when Celie is reading Nettie's letters. The incredibly creative way that Spielberg mixes the content of the letters with Celie's surroundings is almost awe-inspiring. The Color Purple is not an entirely feel-good film, but it is a compelling and one and masterfully done.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Color Purple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now &amp; then a movie touches your soul in a way that most movies only strive for. The Color Purple is a deep emotional rollercoster that takes you to a place you've never been. If any movie deserved an Oscar that year, this is the one. Whoopi Goldberg plays one of the many unfortunate girls that was "purchased" to take care of a lazy, sorry, pathetic man &amp; his kids. This was something very common &amp; extremly sad in its day. The story taps into many areas of abuse...between mental, physical, &amp; emotional. The character that Whoopi played was forced to stay away from her family by the man who used her. He kept her away from "real life" because he knew he really "needed" her instead of her needing him. So, after years of being treated like she is completely beneath this berserk &amp; crazed man, she finally relizes (with the help of his friends, his other girlfriend, &amp; his family) that she is worth a whole lot more. By the end of this movie you feel so frazzled that you don't know what to expect for an ending...almost as if you are afraid. The ending however enforces that old saying, "what goes around, comes around." Z. 1-10 (10+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heart-warming drama that doubled as a good change of pace for Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg took a break from doing blockbuster action and science fiction films to direct the endearing drama THE COLOR PURPLE. Whoopi Goldberg stars in her most dramatic piece of work as Celie, the quiet, down-trodden African-American woman forced to endure thephysical and emotional torment delivered to her by her own husband, played with frightening intensity by Danny Glover. An example of how much trouble Celie has to go through is the way she's forced toaddress her husband, by calling him "Mr." Is that abuse or what? But admist her pain, Celie gets by by keeping faith in the Lord above. All performances involved, and Spielberg's surprisingly subtledirection, make for a great dramatic movie. A definite must-see for fans of movies that touch the heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tribute to African american women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this film was up for the Academy Awards and did not win in any category. For the life of me, I cannot remember what it was up against, but one thing I can say: It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit.Essentially, it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with. Along the way, we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie. Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film. And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely, not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent "Beloved" did. I encourage anyone of any race to see this film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly believe that I became a Spielberg fan after seeing "The Color Purple." The acting is exquisite, the cinematography flawless and the powerfully gut-wrenching story is sure to make anyone forget they're watching a film. It's a shame that it was robbed at the 1986 Academy Awards. This film is highly underrated. Whoopi, for instance, is so convincing as Celie. You feel as if you've lived her life with her. Danny Glover, Oprah, Margaret Avery - all incredible. If you have not seen this film, you must. It's one of Spielberg's most poignant dramas. I'd say that his only "better" films are "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan" ... as far as dramas go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling, tear-jerking masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that Whoopi Goldberg had been nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as Celie in this film, I was not at all surprised after seeing it. She was compelling, she tugged at your heartstrings, and you can't help but cheer for her when she finally stands up to Mr., her husband who had made her life so miserable up to this point. Another performance I very much enjoyed was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia. I was surprised, to say the least, that she could act this well. She was funny, strong, but she was also weak in some respects, like any other person.Now, as with all movies, there were a few things I would have changed. I wished it could have been more like the book, where Celie and Shug Avery are full-on lovers, complete with cheating and reconcile, whereas in the movie, all they have is one little kiss, and after that are only friends! The former, in my opinion, establishes Celie as different from others, and sort of makes her more sympathetic in that respect. Another thing I liked better in the book than the movie was that Mr., AKA Albert, apologizes to Celie for all he's done to her and becomes her friend, sympathizing and trying to help when it is found out that Shug has been unfaithful to her. In the film, this development of his character is present, just not very clear.Even though it has flaws, what movie, no matter how wonderful, doesn't? It's still beautiful, sad, the acting is still top-notch, and I guarantee you, if you don't at least FEEL like crying at the very end, you must have ice-cold water running through your veins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true affair of the heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Genteel, softly spoken drama from Steven Spielberg was his first real venture into this genre. A departure from his normal adventure/fantasy fare, it paved the way for his 1993 success, "Schindler's List".Based upon Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal, angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the fault of continuity and Menno Meyjes' scrambling screenplay. "The Color Purple" is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame. This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. A real shame that maestro Spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director.Performances are strong throughout, with Whoopi Goldberg making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken Celie who just yearns to be loved. Danny Glover lends solid support, though his "Moses" was a superior turn for him in "Places in the Heart". The standout showing comes from the unheralded Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the single minded, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising, upper class white woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong.Quincy Jones ( co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion. Editing from Michael Kahn is sound as always, while director of photography Allen Daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious Southern scenery.This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions.Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considered 1985's Best Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most critics consider this film to be the best of 1985 and obviously so. It's akin to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, CASABLANCA, and Spielberg's own SHINDLER'S LIST. They are films that transcend years, rise above awards, and have a role in movie history that most Oscar winning films would gladly trade their statues for. Simply put, it's one of the best films ever, regardless of lists that try to categorize films and select accordingly. Even so, it is commonly spoken that no other blunder in Oscar history has even come close to the shut out that this film received (OUT OF AFRICA won that year to prove the point). There were a lot of reasons for this, but ironically none have to do with the work itself (Hollywood Jews hating Blacks, Blacks hating Hollywood Jews, old Hollywood hating the then relatively young and overly successful Spielberg, established actors and their agents hating unestablished actors, etc...) For those that believe that it's points of humanity are not as focused as in the book, well then, read the book again, apparently Alice Walker didn't get through to you the first time. The only group to judge the film fairly were the directors who's Guild awarded Spielberg it's top prize that year. When Ron Howard was still new and cutting edge to the theatrical director role (yet with more Hollywood experience than most other directors), he was asked his opinion outside the Guild awards banquet on Spielberg not receiving an Oscar nomination despite THE COLOR PURPLE's 11 other nominations. He was outspoken and remarked 'of course it was wrong' and said the directors that night were sicken by the continuation of Hollywood politics and aimed to correct at least a portion of the Academy's blunder. This film is five stars out of five. That is not to say it is without it's faults, but like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, it's postive moments go so far beyond what we consider perfection in a film, they more than obscure it's faults. Whoopi Goldberg's performance is possibly the finest of any theatrical debut. It still touches people today, sometimes uncomfortably, however, those with heart and a love for humanity will be rewarded with a beautiful film that will bring tears of joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under-appreciated gem from Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These days Spielberg's "The Color Purple" is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning zilch. What's even more alarming is that Spielberg himself wasn't even nominated for Best Director. Needless to say, the film-makers deserved more acclaim than they were accorded.The story concerns the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband. The film spans several years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. It's told from a decidedly female perspective but you needn't fear that it's a saccharine 'chick flick'.The story is an interesting one, livened with humour at times although the central character's struggles are paramount. Some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the film's end but I didn't mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyes.The film received three Oscar nominations for acting: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think that Goldberg and Winfrey were certainly deserving and Danny Glover was unaccountably stiffed.As already mentioned, Spielberg didn't receive a Best Director nomination for his efforts. Such an omission beggars belief, since Spielberg's direction here is top-notch. I'm not especially crazy about Quincy Jones's score but it's not below average by any means.In the end, the story is a satisfying one, well-told by a master film-maker working from Pulitzer Prize-winning material. Give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as I am about how it could be so poorly treated on Oscar night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different Spielberg film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! THE FOLLOWING REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS! READ ON AT YOUR OWN RISK!The first half hour of The Color Purple is extremely flimsy, plot-wise. There is only one interesting situation in that time, when Mister (Danny Glover) attempts to rape Nettie The plot picks up at last right before Whoopi Goldberg takes over as Celie, who has until now been played by a rather un-likable, amateurish actress. Here is the scene that kicks this huge improvement off: as young Celie prepares to shave Mister, he tells her he will kill her if she cuts him. Suddenly, she becomes terrified, and extremely uncomfortable close-ups of the razor going across Mister's neck are employed to their maximum potential.From then on, the plot constantly skyrockets further, except for one bit. After escaping from a fight in the local "juke-joint", Celie and a character named Shug have a woman-to-woman moment. Now, I'm not a big fan of such "girly" (as I like to call them) scenes. All of a sudden, to my alarm, Shug began to kiss Celie, and a few shots suggest just what goes on off-screen. I was rather alarmed. This movie's plot had plenty of promise by now: was it going to degenerate into a miserable lesbian romance film, when I was most interested in Celie's relationship with her abusive husband, Mister? Luckily, it did not linger on this for long. Spielberg admitted in an interview he regretted toning down the lesbian romance from the original novel, but I think this was a good choice: after wasting enough time, we get back to what we're really interested in, and that's the central conflict between Celie and Mister.(By the way, the author of the novel, Alice Walker, initially was displeased at the adaptation. After an enthusiastic audience reaction at premiere, however, she changed her mind and loved it. Curious, don't you think?)Whoever knew that Whoopi Goldberg, whom I've known mainly for her comedy roles, is such a great serious actress? This marks her film debut, and certainly remains among the finest debuts in film history. I'm not a fan of Oprah Winfrey, either, but here, she does quite a fantastic job as Sofia, a rather hefty woman full of confidence. (The two characters are powerfully contrasted?Celie overcomes her abusive husband and the way the world has treated her; Sofia is arrested for an altercation with the Mayor, and after brutal beatings in jail, she emerges with her spirit completely crushed, ending up as a maid to the woman whose job offer led to the arrest in the first place.) Danny Glover proves to be a great villain in this film.However, for all its charms, The Color Purple is a deeply flawed film. After refusing Mister's sexual advances, Nettie is thrown off his land. She and Celie, however, hold onto each other, refusing to let go. Very touching at first, but the scene dragged on and on and on, and I finally got really bored of the whole "You-can't-separate-us" moment. Here is perhaps the reason I disliked the first half-hour of the film: the black people are portrayed in a far-from flattering way. The women are treated as commodities (when asking Celie's father permission to marry Nettie, Mister's request is denied, but he is offered Celie instead. He admits he hasn't noticed how she looks like, and so, Celie parades herself in front of him. They get married.). They are also brutally abused for minor things. But after that initial half-hour, we begin to see into these male characters and their motivations: Mister has a father he's afraid to say "No" to; he wants to please him desperately, etc. But here is the film's ultimate flaw: the women are all portrayed as free-spirited, overcoming all the difficulties the world throws at them eventually. But the men are shown as pushovers, weaklings, or to put it bluntly, losers. And another thing: I refuse to believe that black characters who read Oliver Twist would use phrases such as "I is". It just doesn't work.As for the music? dear LORD. Quincy Jones' music is awful. When Celie reads her sister's letters, it should be HER moment. But Jones' music just ruins the entire effect of the scene. (The one exception is the spirited, lively gospel song near the end of the film.)But Steven Spielberg proves more than ever his directing capabilities. His masterful intercutting makes the boring task of reading letters into a true cinematic experience. Celie sneaks a letter into her Missal and reads it during the church service. The congregation fades away?except for Celie, who remains, quietly reading. Cut to the front of the church, which is suddenly ploughed through by a bulldozer, which is exactly what was going on in the letter, set in Africa. It's that kind of cutting that makes the movie so much more exciting. This technique culminates in one of the later scenes, as Celie is about to cut Mister's throat while shaving him. Spielberg cuts from her preparing to kill him to Shug running to stop her to an African sacrificial ritual. The resulting tension is overwhelming. And of course, what other director but Spielberg could make a mailbox into a character with mere camera movement?Overall, The Color Purple is very entertaining. It was quite publicly snubbed at the '86 Oscars, grabbing 11 nominations, and winning zero. I give it a thumbs up?good? Yes. But far from a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done Mr. Spielberg!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg, proving he's one of the few modern filmmakers who has the visual fluency to be capable of making a great silent film, took a melodramatic, D.W. Griffith-inspired approach to filming Alice Walker's novel. His tactics made the film controversial, but also a popular hit. You can argue with the appropriateness of Spielberg's decision, but his astonishing facility with images is undeniable--from the exhilarating and eye-popping opening shots of children playing in paradisaical purple fields to the way he conveys the brutality of a rape by showing hanging leather belts banging against the head of the shaking bed. In a way it's a shame that Whoopi Goldberg, a stage monologist who made her screen debut in this movie, went on to become so famous, because it was, in part, her unfamiliarity that made her understated performance as Celie so effective. (This may be the first and last time that the adjective understated can be applied to Goldberg.) Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and actress (supporting players Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery were also nominated), it was quite a scandal--and a crushing blow to Spielberg--when it won none.</fullReview>

In only my second viewing of this movie,I was once again in awe of how wonderful the acting is and how well the story is told through both words and very real emotion.Goldberg and Winfrey had never,ever,been in a movie before,so Spielberg casting them in these very important roles was a great gamble on his part. Then again he had a bit of help from Quincy Jones. In only her first role Golberg triumphs beyond anyone expectations,be they little or great. Winfrey almost steals the show with her incredible performance as well.Another big surprise is Danny Glover's portrayal of an abusive,daddy's boy,who,like the men of his time,treats women like property. He takes Golberg for a wife,reluctantly because he wanted her much more attractive sister. The father of the girls wouldn't have it because he was physically &amp; sexually abusing them himself.I don't feel the movie is too "sunshiney" as some critic long ago called it nor do I feel it's too slick. Spielberg &amp; co. put all the right touches into making this book into a wonderful movie. The only thing that would have been the icing on the cake would have been a best picture Oscar. Even 1 Oscar for Golberg would have sufficed.Instead,the academy chose Out Of Africa,a great snub! Go figure! (END)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg is, ironically, the most unfairly underrated man in Hollywood. There are so many directors that are content to make blatantly unoriginal works but Spielberg is the most original and ethical crowd-pleaser in America. And yet he is considered one of the men who ruined cinema. People complain that his Jaws was so successful that it encouraged producers to make hackwork movies that will undoubtedly make millions (bringing Hollywood cinema to where it is today). First of all, George Lucas's Star Wars is more responsible for this. Secondly, who are we to blame Spielberg for the deeds of the producers/filmmakers who were (superficially) influenced by him? What annoys me even more than this is that so few people realize that his films keep getting better as his career goes on (with the exception of Schindler's List, Amistad, the Jurassic Park movies, and Saving Private Ryan). Jaws is probably his least impressive extremely impressive film he has made. The Color Purple, for example, which was made in the 80s, is one of his best films to date. It is so dripping with complexity and detail; it differs from Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan in the sense that, when you watch it, you don't think, 'Oh this is a movie about the life of an African American family in the early twentieth century.' 'Themes' and 'topics' fade away and the film just becomes?life. It is about people, not historical figures. Danny Glover plays Albert, a nasty man who marries Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). He is furiously disappointed with the fact that he did not get to marry Netti (Akosua Busia), Celie's sister. As a result, he beats Celie and, as a result of that, Celie becomes painfully quiet and unable to smile without putting her hand in front of her mouth. The relationship between Celie and Albert is hard-hitting, melancholic, and funny. Neither character is treated cartoonishly and both actors play their characters with fairness and delicacy. This is not a work of easy melodrama. It makes you think about subjects such as femininity, the black population's quest for independence at the beginning of the new century, and the eruption of violence in a relationship without ever cheating or faltering a single step.</fullReview>

Spielberg guides the viewer through the crowded script quickly and with ease, and the introductions to the characters are jazzy and direct; but, whereas the director is terrifically at home with his cast, he doesn't seem to know how to stage this story. It's mounted like "Gone With the Wind", with a sweeping grandeur that treats the material with cartoonish reverence. Results are both moving and sticky, with finely-wrought sequences quickly followed by banal whimsy and heartache. Whoopi Goldberg is terrific in the lead, and some of the dialogue has a haunting, evocative feel, but we're never aware of this as anything but a movie, staged and mechanically set-up to wring tears. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale Of Two Sisters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider this film to be the best that acclaimed director Steven Spielberg has ever made. I rank this film higher than his others: Empire of the Sun 1987, Jaws 1975, The Indiana Jones trilogy: Raiders Of The Lost Ark 1981, Indiana Jones And Temple Of Doom 1984, Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade 1989, Duel 1971, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind 1977,Catch Me If You Can(based on the true story of Frank Abagnale), Amistad 1997 and lastly, Jurassic Park 1993.The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name by Alice Walker. It introduced actresses Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey who would later achieve much success in the movie industry.Plot: Taking place in the Southern United States between Winter 1909 and Autumn 1937, the movie tells the life of a poor African American woman named Celie Harris (Whoopi Goldberg) whose abuse begins when she is young. By the time she is fourteen, she has already had two children by her father Alphonso "James" Harris (Leonard Jackson) and is pregnant with another. He takes them away from her at childbirth and forces the young Celie (Desreta Jackson) to marry a wealthy young local widower Albert Johnson, known to her only as "Mister" (Danny Glover), who treats her like a slave. Albert makes her clean up his disorderly household and take care of his unruly children. Albert beats and rapes her often, intimidating Celie into submission and near silence. Celie's sister Nettie (Akosua Busia) comes to live with them, and there is a brief period of happiness as the sisters spend time together and Nettie begins to teach Celie how to read. This is short-lived; after Nettie refuses Albert's predatory affections once too often, he kicks her out. Before being run off by Albert, Nettie promises to write to Celie saying, "Nothing but death can keep me from it!".Verdict: I was very much impressed with Spielberg's style of direction in keeping with the settings of that period of time. Oprah Winfrey immediately captivated me with her sincere and mature acting. Actor Danny Glover is a big favorite of mine and he gives a thoroughly professional performance as Albert Johnson, a man who treats women as mere sex objects. Other notable actors are Willard E. Pugh(RoboCop 2 1990), Rae Dawn Chong(Commando 1985), Margaret Avery and veteran actor Laurence Fishburne(Just Cause 1995).</fullReview>

Back to the Film the direction is unforgettable and so pristine it reminded me of the old films of the 30s and 40s it really touched me the film has a strong directional style it effortlessly moves from one time period to the other with ease The film is presented over a 35 40 year period or time frame if you will and the first few scenes are so beautiful because they capture all emotions in a split second Happiness, Joy and wonder when Celie and Nettie are playing together and doing their signature hand clapping motion which is their way of connecting with each other they know they are together because they have connected with their hand clapping motion and song that they sing every time they are on screen together they love each other and are very close you can feel that! Celie at the tender age of 14 is pregnant 14 forced to have a baby by her own father yes her own father and one of the most brutal sequences of any motion picture is when her newborn is taken away from her by her own father I knew I was in for an unforgettable movie experience after those opening scenes because I cried my eyes out I lost all happiness and joy and cried and I cried all the way through in the right places of course and when the end comes you have earned it it just does not happen straight away this a long film but boy is it it worth your 2 hours and a half but you have to watch it alone no one else you need to gather yourself at the end of the film and sit through the credits just so you can process what you have just experienced and to think this landmark Masterpiece was nominated for 11 Oscars and won none is a travesty a real tragedy it is awful that this film was not Best Picture and was beaten by Out of Africa out of blooming Africa it is a real travesty the biggest mistake the Oscars ever made The Color Purple is the Best Picture of 1985 and here's why, the direction the performances the emotional connection you have to the characters and the uplifting ending! One Last note I want to thank Steven Spielberg for giving us this film so we all can share this film with the world and connect with it as much as I did and always will for all time! And no John Williams score can you all imagine what he would have composed for this masterpiece instead we get Quincy Jones why I have no flipping idea! I will always love this film and after the credits finished I cried for hours so I urge all people to see this heartbreaking and thoughtful film as it should be loved and it will always be loved for all coming time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The trials and tribulations throughout the horrific life of Celie Johnson, a black woman in 1920's America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming in 1985, this was Steven Spielberg's first attempt at melodrama; he had directed Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial 3 and 4 years previously. This inaugural bid for Spielberg as a dramatic director feels a bit clumsy at times, and at times he struggles to portray harrowing oppression suffered by Celie Johnson, the film's protagonist. This may be the result of the film's PG-13 rating, as the harsh themes of domestic violence and incest are at times brushed over too lightly. Despite these issues, Steven Spielberg's dramatic debut is shot tremendously and full of brilliant performances. Danny Glover, while subdued by the film's hesitation to portray violence, is convincing as the abusive husband of Celie. Whoopi Goldberg is fantastic as Celie Johnson, and was undoubtedly robbed of an Oscar in 1986. Margaret Avery is also great as the inspiration to Celie and performs a few great songs, at least one of which also should have won an Oscar. But the real standout performance is from Oprah Winfrey as the empowering Sofia, giving by far the most moving performance in the film. The original music and musical collaboration in the film is superb, adding a lot of heart to the film. If you are a fan of Steven Spielberg, and want to see his origins in drama, this movie will not disappoint. It is a great film for black and female empowerment, but is not as brutal as films like Schindler's List, making it a great introductory drama to Spielberg's decorated career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in the theater when it first came out and remember thinking it was a powerful and well done film. I found it in a video story the other day and screened it for the first time in 30 years. Now I see why it was so powerful. It is, in my opinion Mr. Spielberg's best work. I've never been a fan of his films - although he is a great director - I never liked how he manages to take a good movie and make a ten year old the star. This film, however was a masterpiece. All the actors in this film deliver stellar performances. And most of the major players went on to great careers. The cinematography , sets, everything is super well done. Great film which I have now added to my library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple a film that is based on the 1982 novel of the same name by Alice Walker is nothing short of a masterpiece. The movie is one of the only character studies I have ever seen that Spielberg has made,in fact is is the study of a young black woman named Celie Johnson (played by Whoopi Goldberg in a groundbreaking film debut.) who gets tortured, abused, and loved at the same time by friends as well as family relatives. the abusive husband in this movie is played by Danny Glover who wants to marry Celie's sister but ends up marrying Celie instead, the saddest scene in this movie is when Celie's sister gets taken away from her because of the Glover character molesting her and throwing rocks at her for no apparent reason, while watching most of the movie people hate Glover's character but by the end of the film I learned that he wasn't much of a bad person after all. The movie also has a great supporting cast which consists of Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, Margaret Avery who is one of Celie's best friends and many more unknowns. This movie goes along with some of Spielberg's best films such as Schindler's List (1993), E.T. (1982), Jaws (1975), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Lincoln (2012), Minority Report (2002) as well as Catch Me If You Can (2002), and Munich (2005).I just can't say anything else about this movie is that I just love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg) grows up in the south during the early 20th century. By the time she's 14 years old, she's already given birth twice by her abusive father. She is married off to "Mister" Albert Johnson (Danny Glover) who abuses her and uses her more like a slave to take care of his bratty kids. Her younger sister Nettie (Akosua Busia) comes to stay but she rejects Mister once too many times. He kicks her out. Then the outspoken Sofia (Oprah Winfrey) who marries Albert's son Harpo (Willard E. Pugh) comes into Celie's life. Mister's lover Shug Avery (Margaret Avery) stays with them and befriends Celie. It also turns out that Nettie has been living with missionaries in Africa and sending letters to Celie but Mister has been keeping them from her.I feel worn out by the overwhelming oppression that befalls Celie. Steven Spielberg does it with a light touch that keeps it from being dark and sullen. Nevertheless I feel for Celie and suffer along side her. It's a big melodramatic farce period piece. I won't go as far as saying that this is one big stereotype. It does lack a certain realism. It feels like a folk tale. It says something about women empowerment. For that good intention and the expert production, it's a movie worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg's Personal Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I have seen nearly all of Steven Spielberg's movies, but The Color Purple stands out as his own personal masterpiece. This film hits closer to home and it speaks an emotional, historical truth about a race who has been rejected in America from the birth of the nation to very recently. This movie is about how the black ladies want to be a part of society, not outcasts. There are provocative scenes in here proving just how racist people were in the early 20th century as evident by Mrs. Millie and the townsfolk. The story and direction are amazing. This film is also beautifully shot and this is a majestic masterpiece to behold.Spielberg's film is tells the story of a black woman named Celie from her teenage years to nearly thirty years later. The film talks about how she suffered abuse all her life from her father to her abusive husband, Albert. But she finds the strength to overcome her abuse when she meets two strong-willed women she finds comfort with.The acting is marvelous. Whoopi Goldberg, in her first film role, is excellent as the shy, weak-willed Celie. I've always thought as Danny Glover as one of the main good guys in Lethal Weapon, but now that may be overshadowed in his villainous, abusive role as Albert. Margaret Avery as Shug does an excellent job as Celie's role model. Likewise for Oprah Winfrey.Overall, The Color Purple is an incredible story about how this one woman overcomes the struggles of poverty, sexism, and racism to lead a good life and become closer to God. Her character is strongly defined as the movie progresses and her personality makes a unique change. There is a shed or two to be shed at times. The film may be just a tad long and some of the story could have been fleshened out, but this is definitely a personalized masterpiece. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pain for Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pain for Love This movie is all about the main character Celie (Whoopi Goldberg) who was raped and abused by her father (Leonard Jackson). Around the age fifteen, her father forces her to marry a man just as abusive as he is to her. Celie is rather content about moving in with her new husband, Mister (Danny Glover), because she can remove her sister, Nettie (Akosua Busia), from her father's house. However, after Nettie lives in Mister's household for a short time with refusing his sexual needs, Mister kicks Nettie out. Celie's life becomes uneasy, as the only person that ever loved her is snatched from her. Nevertheless, her life makes a complete turnaround when Mister makes Celie take care of his ill mistress, Shug (Margret Avery), until she is well again.Celie suffers frequent abuse from the male figures in her life and she reacts by shutting down emotionally and being obedient to their needs. Many women in this movie are suffering from many types of abuse. The African-American male figures in The Color Purple, throw their masculinity around very often. They rape, and abuse black women, their wives, to make the women feel inferior. However, some try to overcome the abuse that is given to them; they try to show they are strong, black women that will stand for no man to put their hands on them. So Celie tries to find the strength and the willpower to overcome the abuse and find herself again. The movie The Color Purple, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a very appealing film to watch. It shows how so much pain is put into one person, Celie, over so many years that basically, that's all she knows and feels as though its normal. Then someone, Shug, comes in her life and teaches her love and the concept of the color purple, how you're suppose to enjoy life and not always be in pain. One viewer states that Celie "has such a horrible life, she's not stopping to smell the roses, and she's just surviving." Eventually, Celie does learn to live, and to love life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Color Purple is a Film/Novel based on a Young African American woman living in the South</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Color Purple is a novel written by Alice Walker and a film directed by Steven Spielberg based on a young African American woman living in the south during the 1900's named Celie Johnson. Both the novel in the film are told from first-person point of view of Celie herself. The first time we are introduced to Celie in both the novel and the film she is 14 years old and pregnant for the second time with her fathers child. We then stay with Celie for the next 30 years of her life, after having her children taken away from her and is forced into a marriage with a man named Albert who isn't interested in Celie at all but is instead interested in Celie's younger sister Nettie. Celie does all she can to protect her sister from Albert but knows that it won't last for long and so her and Nettie prepare for the worst. Albert makes an attempt to have sex with Nettie in which Nettie resists and fights back, Albert then kicks Nettie off his land and keeps Celie. As time pasts Celie looks forward to letters that her sister Nettie promised to write, just to know that she's alive and well but for some odd reason she hasn't received any. As time goes on Shug Avery, a juke-joint singer whom Albert has an attraction to comes along and unexpectedly grows a connection with Celie. Shug and Celie then discover that Nettie, Celie's sister has been writing letters to Celie ever since she left but Albert, also known as Mr._ has been keeping them from Celie. This is where the film and the novel have their differences, in my opinion the novel gives a deeper insight when it talks about Nettie's experience in Africa as opposed to Celie's experience in America.

		<fullReview>"The Color Purple" by Alice Walker is of a woman named Ceelie who endures a horrible life and experiences adulthood very early.The man she knew to be her biological father, raped and abused her giving her two babies that he took from her and sold to another family. As a child her mother died and all she had was God and her loving, younger sister Nettie who was much prettier and smarter than she was. Ceelie and Nettie were two peas in a pod and more closer than a two sisters could ever be. They were separated, Ceelie was forced into marriage at the age of 14 and haven't seen or spoken to her sister in over 30 years!! The book is more detailed than the movie which is why I preferred reading the book. The book is also told from the first-person point of view through the form of letters. The letters started out being addressed to God but when everything took a turn for the worse, Ceelie gave up starting her letters with " Dear God ". Her letters were now " Dear Nettie", Albert, or better known as "Mr.__ " hid the letters that Nettie wrote to Ceelie over the years. He abused Ceelie, never showed her love and allowed her to believe that the only person that ever mattered to her forgot about her.Meanwhile, the movie failed to capture all the descriptive imagery as told in the book. For example, Ceelie finds a new love within a woman. This woman slowly built Ceelie's self- esteem and made her a stronger woman, Shug Avery was her hero. The book deeply and descriptively portrayed Ceelie's and Shug's love and intimacy in ways the movie skipped out on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Color Purple, is a first-person point of view novel written by Alice Walker. The story in this novel is told from the perspective of one of the main characters, Celie Johnson. In the book, Celie tells us about her life and the challenges she's facing through a series of letters. Celie's letters are addressed to mostly to God in the beginning of the novel and as the journey goes on Celie starts to send some to her sister Nettie whom she was forced to separate from by her husband, Mr_.Then towards the end of the novel, letters are now being written by Nettie to Celie, this is a huge change in the novel because we (the audience) are being told what's going on from a different character in a whole new place. Nettie was forced to separate from Celie when they were younger then moved to Africa,Nettie is in Africa with Celie's children Olivia and Adam and through the letters that she writes to Celie she keeps Celie informed on whats going on in Africa.But in the book unlike the movie, Nettie's letters to Celie are told with much more content and information. In the book unlike the film, Alice Walker goes into more depth and uses imagery in ways that will have us picture what Nettie is explaining to Celie about certain things that's going on in Africa, which is why in my opinion the novel is much better than the film because in the novel we are given much more information and nothing is being held back or cut out.Period 7- Miranda D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Period 5 Ana P. According to the novel, The color purple is mostly about how a young girl, how as she grows up, she start to change. The way us the reader notices is by the way she stood up to people she couldn't before. Before the main character named Celie, started writing letters to "God" but as time passed, there came to a point where she hasn't got no news from her younger sister Nettie, but then when Celie found out that her husband (Mr._) had hide the letters that came from her younger sister Nettie.. that gave her the strength she needed to standup for the people she couldn't before that includes Mr._, the tone of Celie throughout the novel is at first she was shy to even speak to someone but then as it goes towards the end of the novel, her tone is less shy and with more attitude. In the other hand, the movie focuses on transition and doesn't show parts of the scenes that it is very important in the novel. In my opinion I prefer the book better than the movie because it explains better than the movie in a way that in the movie it cuts out scenes that lead you to better understanding.</fullReview>

The are some important parts in the book that isn't shown in the movie. To me the book is better because I get more details and about what each character is going through.

		<fullReview>Briani V -- 5th period -- Clarke The Color Purple is the story of Celie, who starts as the narrator at the age of 14 through letters to God, and progresses through the story as a young women who continues to write the letters. Honestly, I gave the film a 6 out of 10 because if you read the book, you would probably consider the film to be a downgrade and a snoozer, although it is a beautiful story. If we were rating the book, I would give it a 10. A major difference between the film and the novel, are the parts where Nettie discusses her time in Africa. In the film, Nettie's experience in Africa is shown very briefly although in the actual novel, her experience is written in numerous letters between Celie and herself. I believe that is a crucial part of the Color Purple because the differences between Africa and America are very important to the different areas of woman-ism, sexism and racism that was occurring during that time period. On the other side, the story of Celie being abused by a man who she thought was her father and going through the same abuse from her husband Mr.____ , also known as Albert, and then meeting Shug who inspires her in more ways than one to stand up for herself, is an amazing storyline. I strongly suggest reading the book first, and then watching the movie, to compare and contrast the mistakes the director did by taking parts out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Color Purple is one of the best Flicks of that year, and the present. It significantly reminds those who lived during that time what life was like when there was no JUSTICE FOR ALL. It gives facts, and it opens a can of worms to the reality of what black men like "Mister." had done and was past down from generation to generation. At least today we do have laws instituted to protect the woman from such horrible and terrible abuse. I am a jazz singer, and Ms. Celie's Blues sung by such a great actress who played that part wonderfully. The song itself does not get enough attention and recognition as it should. I only hear it online or from the movie when I decide to play it. I like to hear more of Ms. Celie's Blues and have it played on various radio stations. Maybe the song will keep our people reminded of how we were treated during that time, and to teach our men not to revisit this type of behavior towards the black women ever again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Inspirational Tale of Beating the Odds and Sisterhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Color Purple is set at the turn of the 20th century and focuses on the relationship between two sisters facing extreme adversity. The acting in The Color Purple is what I believe makes this film stand out from other films of similar topics. Celie has meekness drilled into her, and Whoopi Goldberg portrays this concisely by constantly sheltering herself, her feelings, and most importantly her smile. Sofia, the character Oprah Winfrey plays, also is one of my personal favorite characters with her witty remarks, spiritedness, and capturing life throughout the movie. Both of these actors were able to effortlessly convey complex emotion ranging from oppression to freedom, and to despair to optimism. The lives that these women lead in the early 1900's are truly eye opening. They face prejudice and lack of control in their own lives that very few deal with today. The cast of The Color Purple is a very diverse one indeed, and has a wonderful array of talented actors to offer. I also believe that the choice to cast Oprah Winfrey as Sofia was very wise, as today she has become one of the most influential black women in the world. The film score is another element to this movie that I feel was very powerful. Quincy Jones did a remarkable job of strengthening the most powerful moments in the film, as well as beautifully complimenting the course of events throughout the story. I believe that most films are practically useless without music to back the action and this film is a perfect portrayal of that principal. All in all, the story that is portrayed in this film is truly moving and quite honestly somewhat disturbing at times, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a heartfelt drama focused on overcoming adversity that wasn't though possible to overcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite Whoopi Goldberg being a famous comedienne, she started her career off in this dramatic Spielberg film that everyone forgets about. It got 11 Oscar nominations and didn't win any of them. Now I know this is no guarantee of quality (witness Gravity's success this year) but that is a serious case of bad luck. Thankfully, the film is good enough to be worthy of it's somewhat lofty pedigree.It's all about the tragic life of a young black girl, born in the Deep South during the early 20th century. From the time she was a child, she was physically and sexually assaulted by her abusive father, and had two children courtesy of him (Both of which are taken away). Later, she is forced into marriage with a man who treats her like a domestic slave. Her only friends are her sister (Who she loses contact with soon after her wedding) and a traveling female singer with whom she has a somewhat um, intimate relationship with, for the period anyway...This is for the most part a rather depressing piece, as it relates the tale of the heroine through 30 miserable years. There are occasion chinks of light, but they're quickly snuffed out by her brute of a husband and the ever present racism back then. Only towards the end, do things start to look up. The auditions must have gone well, since every actor chosen gets under the skin of their character and never strikes a false note. Spielberg manages to involve us in the fates of all concerned, and when they experience tragedy or ecstasy, we feel it too. It's a fine film. Not sure what the title means though, despite it being explained in the movie itself... 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love. Not just romantic love, love, any love is a gift given to everyone at birth. Love for going for a walk, love for athletics, love for spaghetti, love for your family and friends, love for horror movies. We all have different levels at which we love, but it's all there in our hearts somewhere. Our lives are shaped by how tight we allow love to grip onto our lives, what power the grip has over our wellbeing if love is denied, and how we move on with our lives using the leftover love. To love is what I believe to be the purpose for existing on this blue and green planet, and love is the nucleus to The Color Purple.The thing that makes The Color Purple the potent film it is, is the concept of love, not just for your partner in life, sometimes the people who come in and out of your life, but most importantly yourself. You have to love yourself for any of the time you spend here to mean a damn. The Color Purple also is about the people who occupy our lives. Each person in our life means something unique to everyone. Some people are here to break your life, others meet you to heal the scars and get you where you need to be. The Color Purple is about everyone, it's about ourselves. There's so much communication and understanding between the film and the viewer, that you feel connected to this film as if by an umbilical cord.The Color Purple may look on the page as if its bitten off more than what could fit in its hypothetical mouth in terms of political issues and bonds in life, but it carries each issue with poise. The most obvious explored topic is race and the tribulations of being an African American at the beginning of the millennium. Not only just a woman, but an abused African woman. Better yet, a bisexual, physically abused African woman. Wait, a diffident, bisexual, physically abused, African woman. To top it off: a diffident, bisexual, physically abused, African woman that bore two children from her own father. The Color Purple studies these issues with a firm, fully developed, emotional handle. The film also soars in its relationships within the family.Steven Spielberg may be famous for the adventure genre and the creativity that lies in this blockbuster hits, but The Color Purple proves of his knowledge of human beings and our complex feelings. In a story about love, Spielberg's supplied the film with a sensitive mood and a heartwarming touch, with so much sentimental spirit, you would assume a woman, reflecting more on her inner life, would've directed the picture. There are some scenes of high intensity and violence that are really well cooked. Spielberg involves the audience so much in the story, that each of those "high intensity" scenes become 3-dimensional, making us believe we are the characters in those situations that could result in anger and sadness.When I think of the look a picture, I forget that there were some beautifully captured films before the 2000s because of the technology that has been invented to make movies nicer to look at. The Color Purple is one of those examples where the photography is everlastingly beautiful to just sit and stare at. To add to that, each camera angel, shot, and cut has a symbolic meaning to the characters. It's a fulfilling level of narrative, telling the story within the story through the camera-work. Not only does the story unfold within the characters and the action of the movie from the expertly written novel, but the cinematography adds another layer to the tale. A trademark of The Color Purple (besides the exploding color of violet all over the film) is the silhouette shadow visionary shots.The acting ensemble takes the heavily progressed characters and works hard to become one memorable cast. It's hard to believe Danny Glover's fiery work was ignored here by the press and audiences, however one could easily have been distracted by the women's grinding efforts. We all know Whoopi Goldberg for a good laugh from her work in Ghost, Sister Act, and hosting The View, but The Color Purple holds the truth of her range. It is her movie. Celie is like a can of soda being shaken by Danny Glover's character for years and the moment Celie finally snaps is like opening that can of soda and watching it rupture, which may be Goldberg's finest scene in the film. Her work stands taller than any other work of 1985. Oprah is just as tough and strong in her role as she is years after the release of this film in real life. Margaret Avery full of warmth and charity in her remembered character.The Color Purple is a treasure that kept me engaged through it's lengthy running time. It's a film that derives its powerful narrative from strength and love, filled with performances that have stood the test of time, a director filling the screen with what's in his heart, and cinematography that is intellectually and visually stimulating. It's a adaptation that just a glorious, burning time at the movies.Rating: 10/10Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way Too Safe and Cute for Its Own Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Color Purple (1985) ** (out of 4) Alice Walker's novel about a mistreated black woman (Whoopi Goldberg) takes us through her life from the years of 1909 to 1947. Along the way we see the abusive relationship with her husband (Danny Glover) as well as with a woman (Oprah Winfrey) who starts building a little courage in her. THE COLOR PURPLE is hailed by many to be a complete masterpiece but to me I found it way too pretty for its own good. I'm going to place 100% of the blame on director Steven Spielberg because I think he simply made this film way too pretty with way too many melodramatic moments and moments where he just seems to be reaching for the sky. When I say he's reaching for the sky, I'm basically saying that he wants every single scene to be some sort of major, emotional pay-off and it just doesn't work because it makes the material seem over-dramatic and fake. There really wasn't a single moment in this film where I had an emotional connection to because Spielberg wanted every single scene to be something epic. Usually these big moments happen at the end of the film or there might be two or three scattered throughout the running time. With this film trying to have one every minute, whenever something big does happen it's power is just drained from everything else that has been going on. I also think the film runs on way too long as there are so many sequences that could have been cut and they wouldn't have hurt the main story. What keeps the film moving are the terrific performances with Goldberg and Winfrey really standing out with their wonderful work. Glover is also very effective in his bit, although I'd say he was underwritten throughout the picture as just the villain. The cinematography here as well as the costume designs are major pluses but in the end THE COLOR PURPLE is just too safe for its own good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg for the first time showing different new colors as a director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I love Spielberg, I never have been too fond of his more dramatic movie attempts. The drama in his movies often feels very melodramatic. This movie was his first real, straight-forward, dramatic endeavor and though I also have some real problems with this movie, people seem to forget and fail to see that as far as the genre goes, this still truly is one excellent movie. People look at this movie and see that it's not up to Spielberg's usual high standards of entertainment and film-making but that doesn't mean at all that this movie is an horrible one.There is simply no denying it that this is a skillfully made movie. It has all of the right settings and actors in it, as well as a compelling dramatic story, that focuses mainly on an African American woman, living and trying to survive life in the early 1900's America. She has to face lots of ordeals, such as the forced split-up of her and her sister that she was incredibly close with, taking beatings and rape. It's not necessarily a movie about racism, though it still plays some part in the story but it's more one that focuses on African American society, in rural areas, in the early 1900's and on its women and their position in particular. It follows its characters for some decades. Some things change for them, while others keep remaining the same. It's a good character driven drama with a compelling story, that ensures that the movie is always going and good to watch, even though the movie is being a bit of a long sit.It really is a movie that foremost works out thanks to its characters and actors that are portraying them. Amazingly enough two of its key characters are being played by dbutantes; Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey but what a fine debut it was! Both are truly excellent and its hard to recognize them in this movie, not necessarily because they look different and younger but more because of their performances, that is unlike anything they have ever done since. I truly wish Whoopi Goldberg would had continued playing more roles like this, instead of choosing a more comical career. How different her career must have been but she wanted to stay loyal to her comical background instead, which is of course her right to do. But with all this talking about Winfrey and Goldberg, people tend to forget how great Danny Glover is being in this movie as well. But this is also only because the movie is being a sort of ode to African American woman and their strength and also tells the story from their perspective.It all combined ensures that "The Color Purple" has something that a good drama requires; some good powerful emotions and drama. It's a touching movie that perhaps goes a bit over-the-top at times but overall as a whole still works out as some powerful and memorable.Can't say I'm too fond about its last 30 minutes though. The movie tries to desperately to wrap everything up needly. Everything ends well for the 'good' guys and gals and the 'bad' ones end up badly. It feels a bit forced, as if Spielberg was too afraid to that his movie would end on a downer and would leave its audience depressed. This is actually something quite a lot of Spielberg movies suffer from; they desperately try to end on a positive and uplifting note. Even "Schindler's List" somewhat does!It's far from my favorite Spielberg movie and it's also far from the best thing he has ever done but this movie still remains one fine, effective, powerful 'colored' drama, that by the way still really is missing a John Williams musical score.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarkable Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's supremacy is once again proved with his 1985 classic 'The Color Purple'. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name by Alice Walker, comes out A Remarkable Film in all respects. The legendary filmmaker takes a difficult subject in hand, dealing with poverty, racism, and sexism. And he doesn't go wrong! 'The Color Purple' tells the story of a poor African American girl named Celie and shows the problems African American women faced during the early 1900s.Let me inform you, 'The Color Purple' is not an easy film to watch. It's a dark film, dealing with domestic-violence and color-discrimination. It's not a gory film, but it has it's share of shortcomings, that can not be erased out.Steven Spielberg's direction is brilliant. He handles the subject with no insecurities. Menno Meyjes's Screenplay is grim and completely justificational. Allen Daviau's Cinematogrpahy is of top-grade. Michael Kahn's Editing is good.In the acting department, Oprah Winfrey is outstanding in a challenging role. She completely gives her herself to the character. Whoopi Goldberg is superb. She proves her range yet again! Danny Glover does not deliver. And what's with the accent? Margaret Avery, in a role that has layers, is wonderful. Akosua Busia is first-rate. Desreta Jackson who plays the child portions of Whoopi, is marvelous.On the whole, 'The Color Purple' is a great show. Without any doubts, Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That was a disastrous start for any girl. Celie was raped by her damned stepfather when she was still a child. Although she had two babies, they were sent to the church. Her husband Albert treated her as a home maid. More heart-breaking was her sister Nettie was forced to leave her. As a helpless child, Celie could do nothing but resigned herself to fate. Luckily she got the help from Shug. She became self-confident and independent. In the end she left Albert and started her new life. More happier was Nettie came back to meet her with Celie's two children.There were many touching moments in the movie. One of them was Shug sang excitingly the gospel song and reconciled with her father. Their hug was such a touching moment.Whoopi Goldberg convincingly played the sympathizing Celie. Steven Spielberg directed many blockbusters. Maybe he is the most successful commercial director in Hollywood. My favorites are Schindler's list, The color purple, The terminal, Saving private Ryan.A touching work. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always considered Steven Spielberg as one of the best of today's Hollywood directors, even though the man has made some movies that didn't appeal to me that much as well. But than again, is there any director who has made nothing but excellent movies? I can't think of one, but if you do, please let me know. But let's talk about this "The Color Purple" now. I first saw it on DVD when I was looking for the movies "Trois Couleurs Rouge / Blanc / Bleu" and this one stood right behind them. I didn't know much about it, but after reading the text on the box, I was intrigued. I didn't buy it, but I decided to put it on my To See-list and now that it was finally shown on television, I immediately taped and watched it.The movie tells the story of Celie, a 14 year old black girl who lives in the early 1900's with her abusive father and her younger sister. She is pregnant for the second time from her own father and when immediately after giving birth, a man comes to ask for the hand of Nettie, her better looking sister, her father tells the man that he can't have the youngest, but that he wouldn't mind if he took Celie with him, saying that she is damaged goods, but still able to work hard. She goes with the man and nothing really changes in her life. The man is as abusive as her father and only thinks about another woman: Shug Avery. But when Shug finally arrives, a lot is about to change and it doesn't take long before Celie finally dares to stand up against everybody who has done her wrong in the past, finally taking her life in her own hands and doing everything to become happy...A movie that takes about two and a half hours to completely explain its story is something that you don't get too often and I'm sure that many people don't like it a bit. They want some easy entertainment that takes only 90 minutes to tell what it has to say and that's something that they certainly will not get in this movie. And yet it is worth waiting for the last second of the movie to come. At first, I didn't like this movie all that much either, not yet knowing that it would take that long, but when the credits were rolling over the screen, I knew it for sure: This too is one of the better Spielberg movies.Thanks to the interesting performances by Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, Oprah Winfrey,... this movie is more than just worth a watch. Especially Whoopi Goldberg surprised me in this one. Normally I'm not a great fan of her work, but in this movie she really showed a lot of talent. Also special was Danny Glover's performance. The man is best known for his role as Roger Murtaugh in the Lethal Weapon movies and I must say that its nice to see him play that role, but it's also nice to see him play in a completely different kind of movie, in another kind of leading role. I saw him in "Bat*21" before and liked him in that movie, but in this film he was even a lot better, in his role as the abusive father. This time there was absolutely no humor around his performance or character, making it possible for the man to show that he's able to do a lot more with his talents than what most people know of him.Overall this is a very good drama that will probably not appeal to some people, just because of its length. Personally I didn't have any problem with that, because I'm already used to watch longer movies, but I'm afraid that several people will stop watching it after one hour and a half. And that's too bad, because you have to finish it in order to fully understand and appreciate it. I liked what I saw and give it a rating in between 7.5/10 and 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this film was directed by Steven Spielberg, STEVEN SPIELBERG of all people. Then again, Spielberg also gave us "Schindler's List" so I guess we should cut him some slack. Well crafted, very touching film adaptation of the book by Alice Walker about abused, battered Celie, well played by Whoopi Goldberg in an uncharacteristically dramatic performance. Danny Glover is "Mr." (aka: Albert), one of the few menacing roles I've actually seen of him, because to me, he'll always be Roger from the Lethal Weapon films.Occasionally marred by over the top humor and what not, but still a very well done film with fine performances all around. Those who loved the book may hate it though, which comes up with lots of film adaptations, not just Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings.</fullReview>

The moments of levity were over-the-top and many of the emotional moments went straight for the throat.Also, I felt it should have ended when she left him. It would have felt more natural. A second film showing her struggle and triumphant return would have been more appropriate than the rushed ending. I want to see what happened to Celie to turn her into the confident returning heroine.Despite these flaws, the movie triumphs due to the great characters and fine acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've read any of my other comments you know I'm a filmmaker. There's a saying that if you get to make three authentically great films in your lifetime, you've made it to film nirvana. Steven has achieved that with ET, Shindler's List, and The Color Purple. At the time of its release, there was a huge outcry from the left wing elements of the African American Community that it negatively depicted a black man. Well, how many white men have been negatively depicted. Bad people come in all colors. Jerkdom is an equal opportunity employer. Danny Glover was superb as the man you love to hate. Whoopi Goldberg gives a career defining performance. Oprah Winfrey shows she could have been a superstar actress instead of a billionaire talk show host. Now, if you think actors work in a vacuum you know nothing about film, television or video. It takes a great director and an excellent actor to deliver a fantastic performance. Anybody out there that thinks Mr. Spielberg isn't great, is simply ignorant of the demands of directing. Opinions are like rear ends, everybody has one. Informed opinions, ah, that's something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I must confess I have never read this film's literary source by Alice Walker, I still found the resulting adaptation to be a supremely powerful and impressive tale directed by none other than Steven Spielberg. Upon viewing this film, I was shocked - SHOCKED - to realize that when it received the (I believe) 11 Oscar nominations for 1985, there was no Best Director nomination for Spielberg himself! The utter nerve!But I digress...as the film itself is a harrowing piece of work, wonderfully told in its span of four decades early in the 20th century; "The Color Purple" chronicles the life of a young African-American woman (Whoopi Goldberg), and her struggle to survive and cope with the obstacles around her. In an Oscar-nominated acting debut, Goldberg is especially (and surprisingly) effective in her amazing turn as the main character. In addition to that, supporting performances by the likes of Danny Glover, Oprah Winfrey and others are of first-rate quality. The rural backdrop, complete with old-fashioned attitudes towards race and gender, provides for some isolated moments of quiet poignancy. This is a horribly underrated classic, and I feel it deserves all the acclaim it got (and still gets) for its excellent portrayals of hardship and love.A beautiful, beautiful film. Very moving, and highly recommended.</fullReview>

Spielberg, in typical Spielberg fashion, overdoes things at some points; and you have to question if certain things would really happen that way in real life. It seemed like he was just looking for more ways to make the audience cry. Looking at it now that I'm older, I can't help but question Spielberg's involvement in this film.....could he have been truly sensitive and geniune to the plight of Blacks, being that he's white? It does seem kinda odd....but considering the subject matter he made one hell of a movie. *** out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Color Purple is one of the greatest stories ever told. The novel was spectacular, but Alice Walker's Pulitsar Prize winning book was transformed into a masterpiece my Steven Spieldburg. It is one of the most heartwarming and gripping tales you will ever see.It is really too complicated of story to actually tell in less than 1000 words, so I will give a chopped version. It is the the story of Celie, a young black woman who is forced to marry a hateful man. This man is only known to her as Mr. He throws out Celie's sister, Nettie; the one and only thing she loves. When Celie grows up into a beaten woman, something happenes: Mr's. old girlfriend comes to stay with them. She turns Celie's life around and brings a new strength that she never thought she had. There is much more to the story than that, but as I said, it is very complicated.The tears of joy and pain are well deserved in The Color Purple. It is emotionally charged. but also funny. It is the story of two special woman, claiming a life of their own. They swear that nothing will ever drag them down as long as they can hold on to eachother. Whoopie Goldburg is fantastic. Along with her supporting cast!The Color Purple should be at the top of your viewing list. A flat out masterpiece! 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Color Purple" is by far the least showy of Steven Spieberg's movies. After big-budget blockbusters such as E.T., Close Encounters and Raiders Of The Lost Ark, I think he was trying to prove that he has depth by making this. The film certainly isn't typical of his style, but it is powerful and gripping nevertheless. Morality movies like this are hard to put across on screen without seeming awkward, but we are drawn into the world of the central character and sympathise for her. "The Color Purple" is most famous for not winning a single Oscar giving that it was nominated for 10. Thats a shame because the film is at the highest on every level. Brilliant performances all across the board from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Margaret Averi and Danny Glover.While melodramas like this are an acquired taste "The Color Purple" is a solid example of it's type. My IMDb rating: 7.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I tend to agree that the movie is a bit contrived, some typical Speilberg, the performances are truly remarkable. There is not a weak performance in this film. I can not recall ever being in a movie theater where audience members actually broke down in SOBS...crying yes, many times...but people actually broke down and wept. I admit, I cried...ALOT! When Celie and Nettie are first separated by Mistah (Nettie cries out, "Why?!"), when Shug goes to the mailbox and retrieves the letter, again when she presents the letter to Celie. And of course...the ending. Truly beautiful. Marked with controversy from the beginning, many black groups protested that the movie portrayed black men in a negative light. Tina Turner was Speilberg's first choice for the role of Shug Avery, but she turned down the role stating that the role hit too close to her own life and felt it too painful to recreate. Interesting. Although we all know of the multiple nominations and no wins...but I do truly believe that there were some, that really should have won. Cinematography, Art Direction, and Score. The score was beautiful and incredibly moving. Put that score up against the winner, Out of Africa, and you I bet you would remember Purple over Africa. The acting nominees were up against some stiff competition that year, but they at least were deserving of the noms. With its flaws, the movie still is one of my favorite top 5 of all time. I agree with some of the posts...dont rent it...buy it.</fullReview>

Having also read the novel, i feel that Spielberg captures the essence of the story well, weaving in the African segments which he could have easily glossed over or even omitted entirely. The acting is superb, and i cannot think of one person who's acting spoils the film or who is not believable in the character that they play. The scene where Celie finally reads the letters that her estranged sister Nettie has sent and which have been hidden by 'Mr', never fails to have me sobbing like an idiot! And the end of the film makes your heart want to burst out of your chest with happiness for Celie, for Nettie, for the redemption of the whole human race! The musical score is fantastic. A brilliant, emotional, uplifting and inspiring movie. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No matter how low things get, it's not to late to start living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time Steven Spielberg made A Color Purple, he had already proven he was a master at great entertainments with Raiders of the Lost Ark, had already proven his talent for horror with Jaws, and had already proven his ability to capture and hold the imagination like no other filmmaker ever had. He had yet to prove to film snobs everywhere he could excel at making so-called "real" films, too. A Color Purple did that. The movie tells the life story of Celie, played by Whoopi Goldberg with a performance that was nominated for Academy Award and should have won. Celie is a poor girl in the South during the early 1900s. The story starts with her as a teenager and follows her troubled life through to middle age. She's passed from an abusive father to an abusive husband and is oppressed from all sides. There's two missing children somewhere, taken from her at birth, and a close sister that her husband refuses to allow her to contact. One of her only friends, played by Oprah Winfrey in another Oscar-calibre performance, is crushed in spirit by a segregated society of double standards. But as brutal as this story is, it's one of hope. No matter how low things get, it's not to late to start living.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you had read the novel by Alice Walker, there is no way you could enjoy the movie. The novel is everything that the movie is not - smart, insightful, intelligent and memorable. The movie is Hollywood Gone Amok - Spielberg may as well have "E.T" do a cameo. He was still a little too infantile to tackle such material head on. He didn't grow up as a filmmaker, in my mind, until "Schlindler's List".What we have here is a lot of unrealism (Celie serves Shug breakfast on matching China? A poor black family has matching China?), a lot of stereotypes (men=Devils; women=Saints) and some horrible make-up when the characters age. Best scene for me is Shug's reunion with her Dad who is a Preacher. Its overdone and needlessly dramatic, but it gets me every single time I watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family and I have seen this movie so much, we have at least half of the dialogue memorized. To me, the true test of a film is whether you are swept away in it, and completely oblivious to the concept of time. I have lost many hours to this movie...I cry in the same spots, laugh in the same spots, and always find something new to examine. Stephen Spielberg is at his masterful best - my favorite sequence occurs when Shug reads the letter from Nettie, and the scenes from the South are dissolved into the scenes from Africa. This is Whoopi Goldberg's best performance, as well as Oprah Winfrey. If you can get through it without connecting to any of the characters, you have a stone in your chest. Buy this movie, rent it - do whatever you have to do, but watch it. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gorgeous, triumphant picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far my favorite Spielberg movie. He pulled off the transition from shark-at-large scarefests and Reese's Pieces loving extraterrestrials beautifully. A faithful adaption of Alica Walker's diary-like novel, The Color Purple follows the life of a woman in the deep South through some thirty-five years or so of hardship, abuse and tremendous change, both within and without of herself. Impregnated twice by her cruel, incestuous father, then robbed of the two children she bore, 14 year old Celie's one consolation in life is the love of her sister Nettie. When a local widower (Danny Glover) comes to the house asking for Nettie's hand in marriage, the girls' father casually tosses him Celie (a brilliant, brief performance by Desreta Jackson), and she becomes trapped in a loveless union which offers nothing more than verbal and physical abuse fueled by her husband's resentment that he did not get the woman he had his eyes on, but rather her homely sister. The cruelest form of expression of his hatred for Celie is not the beatings, however. "Mister" ultimately prooves to Celie that he hates her by chasing Nettie out of her life, and by allowing Celie (whose role is assumed by Whoopi Goldberg) to think that Nettie is dead, thus killing the last shred of hope Celie had that anyone loves her. What "Mister" didn't bank on though, is the friendship that forms between Celie and his favorite girlfriend, a juke-joint singer named Shug Avery (Margaret Avery). Celie and Shug may not have a thing in common physically, but spiritually, they are sisters, and Celie is loved once again. Goldberg shines as Celie. Glover made me hate him, so he did a terrific job too. Avery was passionate and compassionate as Shug. The ending will have you sobbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful work by Spielberg with a top notch cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from a marvelous book by Alice Walker, Spielberg has assembled an incredible cast of actors that create a harrowing, yet quite beautiful, film. I am not sure how he does it but he manages to make a film using the most vibrant colours and charismatic actors. Whoopi Goldberg is quite superb as Celie - she has never been better in a movie and it seems a shame that she has not found a film since that inspires such an incredible performance. The only flaw in this film is Spielberg's one lapse into sentimentality - the scene where Shug returns to the church and leads the congregation out to the bar. This happy clappy scene is cringe-making and quite out of place in an otherwise perfect film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm poor, black, I might even be ugly, but dear God, I'm here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Celie's reponse to the venomous enumeration from Albert, Danny Glover as the man who took almost thirty years off her life.And Celie is Whoopi Goldberg, in her first major role: a virtuoso performance where she bravely dilutes herself in the soul of a woman supposed to be dull and ugly, but only waiting for the right moment to bloom. And the moment came with the ultimate triumph when she finally found the courage to stand against Albert. She doesn't deny all the physical attributions, she's poor, she's black, she may even be ugly, but God, she lives. And after having witnessed two hours of a true hell of a life, we can only share the happiness that suddenly inhabits her heart.The reason I started with this scene is to remind how emotionally effective "The Color Purple" is. It might not surprise from a movie directed by Steven Spielberg, both admired and loathed for his capacity to exude great emotions on screen. And there is so much to be criticized, the contrast between the realistic drama and the whole postcard-like setting or some feminist undertones ? but the story transcends all these flaws, elevated by the performances of Whoopi Goldberg, Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey, all women seriously roughed up by life, and overcoming the racist and misogynistic adversity with what was at their hands. Indeed, "The Color Purple" provides a thought-provoking approach of the South, where another form of racism was prevailing. In the social ladder, a White had more rights than a Black man, but within the Black community, a man had to respect his father as his son would respect him, but women were powerless. But not equally powerless. Margaret Avery plays Shug, a sexy cabaret singer who could command men with her body. It's ironic that Albert, the bullying husband turns into a puppy with Shug Avery. And if a woman couldn't control people with sex appeal, physical and moral strength worked too. This is Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sofia, the wife of Albert's son, Harpo. She grew up in a family of men, and learned to state her presence the hard way.Both Shug and Sofia embody the fight of Black women, at the expenses of their dignity. Shug's own father, a pastor, disowned her, for she was the local slut, in return, she lost every faith in men and life, but at the end, she finally realized that there was some place in her heart for pure love, by befriending Celie. On the other side, Sofia had the most tragic character's arc, when she refuses to be the maid of the town's mayor through an unforgettable 'hell no', retorted by a severe pistol-punch on the eye, an 8-year sentence in jail, and maybe the worst punishment: finally working in the very job that got her in jail. The energy, the inner strength, the colorful attitude that made her character so irresistible in the beginning, had been totally drained out: she looked prematurely older, and only at the end, in the very scene I described, her dead spirit finally resurrects.Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey, both Oscar-nominated, are only supporting characters; yet they add a lot to Celie's own journey. Celie is a Black woman who not only was labeled as ugly, but also didn't even have the privilege of ugly women by remaining single. We meet her when she's fourteen and pregnant. She gives birth to two children and is quickly married to Albert who initially wanted Nettie, her much prettier sister. The father refused to give Nettie's hand for some reasons we guess to be personal, so Albert, who needed a woman to clean the house and take care of the "young ones" resigned to take Celie. Yet his eye is still interested on Nettie, and after an attempt to take advantage of her, he forbids her to visit her sister, a punishment worse than any slapping, beating or insult. What remains in Celie is the memory of her sister and the capability to read inherited from her teachings. And unlike Sofia with Harpo, Celie could never have the 'upper hand' on Albert, and unlike Shug, she didn't have the sex appeal. She was as low in the social ladder as any Black woman could be at the time, poor and ugly, yet the movie is about her realization that she deserves better. The most pivotal and emotional scene is when Shug teases her so she stops covering her smile, and then, with a magic that only cinema can apply, she smiles and bursts out laughing to the mirror. The 'mirror' scene is even more significant because it's not just Celie who starts appreciating herself, but also Shug who's inspired by Celie's genuine attraction to her. The following kiss is probably a more sugar-coated version of what the Alice Walker's novel featured, but the essential is that both women found reasons to be proud of them.Another miracle happens in the dinner scene, when Celie lets all his anger finally go on Albert, Sofia starts laughing and recovers from the wounds of the past. Celie has her 'hell, no' moment but with enough intelligence not to pull a knife on Albert's throat, which would have been as disastrous as Sofia's punch on the mayor. There is a lot of learning in "The Color Purple" and even Albert finds a way to redeem himself. After all, if there is one thing learned in the film, it's that it's never too late to change for the better, and no flaw, nor physical, sexual or racial can prevent a person to seek her own happiness. We all have an inner strength that could help us to overcome any adversity, "The Color Purple" is an invitation to find ours, through the triumph of three women, that we joyfully share with them, at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, after a couple of average films with ET and Close Encounters, Steven Spielberg gives us something that to me marks this as one of his greatest achievements. Here, we see a story about real people facing real problems in the real world and their determination to overcome them. The story moves along gracefully as we see Celie, portrayed lovingly by Whoopie Goldberg, struggle with an abusive husband, surrounded by people that don't love her, and the lost relationship with her sister. At times it is rather hard to watch some of the scenes as the subject material is rather heavy and dark for the first hour, but it is well worth it in the end. To me, Spielberg is at his best when dealing with reality instead of fantasy. That's why I put this film above his alien movies. It may not be as popular or won as many awards, but it triumphs as a gripping human drama that we can all relate to in some way or another.</fullReview>

The black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters -- or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their "husbands". It was painful to watch, but everyone redeemed himself in the end, and the acting was phenomenal! I couldn't believe the character Oprah played at the age of 35! And I adore Whoopi to start with - she was amazing. I'm so glad I was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and Showtime was running The Color Purple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' Oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members.11 nominations and not a single title: such was the Academy's disdain for one of their greatest directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for Schindler's List, which is, arguably, not as good (and I'm half-Polish).Don't get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I'm not knocking 'Out of Africa' (which won in '85) either; but it was, to my mind, a class behind this one: an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and I'm not a big cryer.Maybe it was the music (superb), or the cinematography (sumptuous), but more likely simply the acting: Whoopi, who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne; Danny Glover, who I'd never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah.The rest is history; but, at the time: who knew?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first Steven Spielburg movie i truly fell in love with. Everything about it stylistically was on point. The clothes, the hair, the location, the props, the language (or lack thereof), everything lends to a true authentic picture of black life from about 1910 until the late 1930s. Whoopi did a wonderful job as "Celie", as did the young lady who played the younger version of the character (the one who took the brunt of the abuse). Glover was perfectly cast as "Mister". With one or two exceptions, Oprah hasn't been as fine of an actress since she was "Sophia" (though, when you're the richest woman in the Milky Way, who needs to be consistent?! You GO girl!) Margaret Avery was the spirit and breath of "Shug" and Tina Turner was right to turn it down; she would've been awful, I think. Rae Dawn Chong, Larry Fishburne and the rest of the lesser characters gave the movie the appropriate fullness and depth needed to truly capture the spirit of the book. My one problem? I wish they would've added the last scene of the book as the last scene of the movie! Come on, Stevie, baby! You could've given us those extra two or three minutes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking a break from his escapist run in the early '80s, Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker's "The Color Purple", about about the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Watching Goldberg play Celie, it's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like "Sister Act". This is the sort of movie that could easily be - no, make that SHOULD BE - part of the curriculum in Black Studies and Women's Studies. There's one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job that's ever been on screen (you'll know it when you see it). I can't believe that this didn't win a single Oscar; it may be Spielberg's second best movie behind "Schindler's List" (maybe even tied with it).

The story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old clich by now, but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple.It also showed a different side to the African-American experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. I find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend.Also the acting performances are superb - especially Oprah who I now have a new found respect for.Well worth watching - but keep some tissue handy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the epitome of the Southern pre-World War I to post World War II climate and attitudes. While following the plight of a young Black woman,forced to marry at a young age, it addresses issues such as gender biases, racial stigmas, religion and even those matters which some may still consider taboo in today's society. Poignant and dramatic this movie is well worth its weight in gold. I am so fond of this movie that I wrote a 15 page term paper on it and the various topics explored for a sociology course. I have not read the book,although I plan to someday but it's my understanding that the book is as good, if not better, than the film version. Samotta Wiggins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg's powerful portrayal of abuse and racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The South has had a tainted history, and it dates back at the pre-Civil War era when many African Americans fell victim to slavery and unsettling maltreatment. Even after slavery was abolished, the tension between whites and blacks still lingered and to extent, still lingers today. For a film dealing with a crucial subject like racism, an inspiring script and a director with wit and smarts is a must. Steven Spielberg gives a profound treatment, thought somewhat flawed, treatment on his riveting drama based on the acclaimed novel by Alice Walker. Though it doesn't scale the tower of Spielberg's other works, especially with this being his first effort on a serious topic; it's efforts to capture the heart and adornment of the viewers prove to be successful. Set in a rural town of southern Mississippi during the 1930s when Africam Americans were bare of civil rights, the film follows Celie Johnson (played by Whoopi Goldberg), a young African Americna teenager growing up in poverty with her abusive father Albert (played by Danny Glover) who's impregnated her with a child, only to give it up for adoption. She finds some light in her tormented life with her sister Nettie (played by Akosua Busia) who lives with her for a short time, only to be exiled by Albert. For the next few decades, we follow Celiw as she struggles to discover her true identity while coping with relationships with her father's former lover Shug Avery (played by Margaret Avery) and her sister-in-law Sofia (played by Oprah Winfrey). When approached with the project, Steven Spielberg was initially skeptical about tackling this film due to his marginal knowledge of life in the Deep South. Ultimately, he changed his mind and what he brought to the screen to his brutally powerful drama granted by a performance by Whoopi Goldberg that only be described as profound, and even this feels like an understatement. She's astounding in her portrayal of the lead character, bringing her character from Alice Walker's novel to life, and the story progresses you can't help but experience concern for her character and the tyranny she endures from her father played by Danny Glover who succeeds his commitment to his cruel-hearted role. The film journeys through her life as she deals with racism, domestic abuse, incest, and a questionable relationship with her father's former lover. Spielberg handles these themes maturely and realistically, even when the film feels emotionally manipulative. These elements rarely feel forced. The depiction of the Southern culture in terms of their jazz music, spiritual lifestyle, and of course the racially charged society. The screenplay doesn't come without its flaws. While the story moves along safe standards, it tends to get a little clumsily in some places. In some sequences, the story either temporarily loses focus or feel weak, the best example lies in one scene of Celie discovering her homosexuality. Ultimately, the film overcomes its flaws through Steven Spielberg's intelligence and smart direction. The film may go on longer than necessary, clocking at 153 minutes; but overall there is plenty of more good to experience than cons. The Color Purple is both a riveting and inspiring work of art by Steven Spielberg, and boasts incredible performances by such a talented cast. Though not one of Spielberg's most memorable works, it still shows the universally acclaimed director as the brilliant mind he is. Many could debate whether or not he's handle this subject matter of racism here as maturely as he handles topics dealing with war in this other works. Nonetheless, the film strives a powerful edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A black Southern woman (Whoopi Goldberg) struggles to find her identity after suffering years of abuse from her father and others over forty years.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film four stars, calling it "the year's best film." He also praised Whoopi Goldberg, calling her role "one of the most amazing debut performances in movie history" and predicting she would win the Academy Award for Best Actress. (She was nominated but did not win.) Now, with all due respect to Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover... this film just did not appeal to me. Not that anyone was bad, but I just never really got into it. I suspect this has something to do with Spielberg, and his need to be overly sentimental. Something about this film seemed like it was cynically designed to trigger emotions rather than achieve them organically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this made some changes from Alice Walker's novel that made some audience members and critics furious, this is still one of the best films to come out of the 1980's. As the revival of the hit Broadway musical version trods the boards of New York once again, a return visit to it is necessary as is the need for me to see this beautiful film once again.The cruelty of most of the make characters keeps the tragic prone Celie away from her beloved sister Nettie and her two illegitimate children, fathered through rape and cruelly taken away from her at birth. Celie, allegedly ugly, and Nettie, a sweet but strong beauty, are separated twice-first by their abusive father, and later by Mister, the demanding husband Celie is forced to marry simply to be his slave. Watching the shy, insecure Whoopie Goldberg suffer the way she does is often heartbreaking, and hers was one of the strongest film debuts in Hollywood history.In spite of her circumstances, Goldberg's Celie adds a sly smile to her persona, devoted to husband Danny Glover in spite of his cruelty. She may hate him, but she gets to know him inside out, even aiding him as he prepares to meet his sexy mistress, Margaret Avery. Whoopie gets a boisterous step daughter in law in portly Oprah Winfrey (another film debut) who along with Avery becomes Goldberg's guardian angel when they see Celie's true inner beauty. In spite of her relationship with Glover, Avery's Shug comes to understand the importance of sisterhood, creating a beautiful bond between these complicated women. Not all of the men are as nasty as Celie and Nettie's papa. Even Glover's Mister has his soft side, and as his cruelties catch up to him which he must atone for, he makes a choice of retribution that certainly saves his soul. Glover may be an s.o.b., but there are layers hidden beneath his brutality. Willard Pugh is the most likable, but he is a bit of a buffoon. His Harpo is no match for Winfrey's sometimes obnoxious Sophia, and often their relationship doesn't seem real. It also makes no sense that Celie, a victim herself, would shyly advise Harpo to beat Sophia. Winfrey comes to life in her confrontation with Goldberg, and her performance is heartbreaking when she is beaten up for saying "Hell no!" to flibbertigibbet white matron Dana Ivey who wants Oprah as her maid. Stage veteran Ivey shows several different angles to this do-gooder who may have sweet intentions, but causes more harm than good. Adolph Caesar is appropriately obnoxious as Glover's father (showing the audience some of the reasons that Glover turned out the way he did), while Rae Dawn Chong is bubble headed, but ultimately showing strength, as Squeak who finds out that "Fine by me" ain't so fine for her. The colors of the country are enhanced by Quincy Jones' excellent musical score. Two songs are thrown in, but neither were in the musical. Director Steven Spielberg was snubbed for an Oscar nomination in one of the biggest scandals in Academy Award history. There's no denying that professional jealousy was partly behind it. How a film which details triumph over tragedy could be completely overlooked for even one award remains a mystery to this day. The triumphs of the finale will have you in tears. Make sure you have a full box of Kleenex out. Regardless of how many times you've seen this, the tears are absolutely going to flow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a great portrayal of Alice Walker's the Color Purple. I remember upon studying the novel at A level, being shocked at the level of violence that women like Celie had to endure. I was very glad that the film didn't water this down. To have done so would be a grave insult to the women worldwide who had to suffer this treatment.Whoopi Goldberg made her film debut in the Color Purple and she was great in her role as the grown-up Celie. I've always liked how she can bring a naturalness and realism to her acting. The Color Purple is no exception. Read my full review for more: http://goo.gl/ykObxL</fullReview>

I am not good at reviews. I just know this is my all time favorite movie. I love how the cuts in between her shaving Mister and Suge Avery running all to the beat of the African music.

I just couldn't understand why Celie didn't run away from him in the beginning?! The poor thing suffered enough especially not having contact with her sister because of him!This film honestly makes you feel so angry, no one deserves to be treated like crap. I honestly wish the women on this stood up for their rights, surely there was at least activism regarding domestic abuse around that time?! There should've been if it wasn't mentioned, it's disgusting and shameful for victims to be left out!I couldn't understand why this film didn't get the 11 Oscars, it needed to be deserved something for awareness.

		<shortDescription>The Color Purple (1985)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an incredible Steven Spielburg did with his first attempt at a "serious" movie. The Color Purple takes place in the south during the early 1900s to the late 1930s.The Color Purple film is about an underprivileged African-American woman named Celie Harris, played by Whoopi Goldberg. She endures abuse from her father at a young age and continues into her adulthood by her horrible husband she calls Mister, played by Danny Glover. Mister takes Celie home to his three kids and right away Mister starts physically and sexually abusing her. The filming and editing techniques were really good in this film. Spielburg used a lot of track-in shots. This type of shot is when the camera physically moves in on the subject, typically going from a medium close-up to a tighter close-up to draw attention to an important moment in a character's story. The movement is smooth, the background is blurred, and it makes the audience feel the emotions of what is happening. An example of a track-in shot is when Mister takes Celie home for the first time and forces her to have sexual intercourse with him. The track-in shot zooms in on her face to show her expression. The film's most touching and heartbreaking moment is when Celie and her sister Nettie are separated. Mister banned Nettie from his land because she would not sleep with him. Spielburg did a great job with scenes that made the audience feel the emotions that the character was feeling. The film's cinematographer, Allen Daviau, did a great job capturing the emotions between Celie and Nettie. His main focus was on each individual character. He paid attention to each character's talents and potential in the story line, self-actualization. The meaning of this film shows great strength in the belief of God. Even though Celie has physically and emotionally been through a nightmare, her strength in God keeps her moving forward. The film also shows how strong her love for her sister and her children are. The meaning of the title symbolizes when Shug Avery says that she believes that it angers God if a person walks by the color of purple in a field without stopping to notice and admire it. In this statement, Shug summarizes her religious philosophy; to her, God is not some distant deity living on high, but a genderless, race-less being that wants people to appreciate and enjoy life. It is also significant that she chose the color of purple, for it is the color of royalty; and yet a really deep purple seems almost to be black. My take exactly is that the field of purple represents freedom and Celie, Nettie, Adam, and Olivia being together at the end. When I saw the movie, I believe that the main focus was on Celie and how she tells her experiences. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is going through a hard time. Watching this movie will open and inspire anyone's mind to understand that things will get better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Struggles vs. Accomplishments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin, I really enjoyed reading and watching "The Color Purple". It was interesting to read a book base on a person real life struggles and accomplishments. According to Alice Walker, this book was used to support to a women who makes a journey from religious to spiritual. Throughout both the book and movie, Celie faced a lot of challenges, internally and externally. The story is told in first person in the form of a letter. Celie addresses the letters to god and then later to her sister Nettie who is a missionary in Africa.I prefer to watch the movie rather then to read the book because I get an eye view of what is happening and a since of emotion that you don't get as much from the book itself. Although the book gives you details that are not shown in the movies itself, it does not capture the character feelings fully. When watching the movies i am more focused on the character as a whole rather then when reading the book you are focused on multiple people at one time. But overall i would recommend both the book and the movie because they give to different outlooks, one from paper point of view and one from a visual point of view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Great Oscar Snub</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things the magnificent film THE COLOR PURPLE will go down in history for is that the Academy, while giving the film ELEVEN Oscar nominations in every category from both Lead Actress and Supporting Actress to screenplay to score to cinematography and even Best Picture, but failed to give a nod to director Steven Spielberg despite the fact that this film was his masterpiece up to that time. And the snub was compounded when the film did not win a single award on Oscar night.And all this, while interesting enough, is rather a pity, because while prizes are nice, what matters is the film. And this was indeed Spielberg's finest work up to that time.Menno Meyes's screenplay is a masterful adaptation of Alice Walker's epistolary novel. Perhaps the most striking thing about it is that Meyes kept the epistolary form as a way of driving the plot forward. Most of the letters are read in voice over by Desreta Jackson and later Whoopi Goldberg as Celie, and Akosua Busia as Celie's beloved sister Nettie, the only person in the world who loves her and from whom she is cruelly separated by Albert Johnson, a man she is forced to marry by her father. Celie's father is himself a cruel man who raped Celie repeatedly and fathered two children by her before she was fourteen years old. Her father took the babies away and Celie never saw them againThe sweeping narrative covers Celie's life over the course of some thirty years and encompasses all the people in it. Trapped in an arranged marriage with a man who loves another woman, Celie realizes early on that she has been married off as nothing more than a domestic servant with benefits (for the husband). She seeks solace in religion, having no other outlet for her feelings.Then one day the woman her husband loves shows up at her door: one Shug Avery (Margaret Avery), a singer with a reputation for loose morals (somewhat justified) whose father is pastor of a nearby church and from whom she is estranged. Shug's first words to Celie have gone down in film history: "You sho' is ugly!" But that changes soon. When Shug arrives she is not well, and Celie cares for her. A bond soon develops between the two women that eventually becomes a love affair. Spielberg came under some criticism for his handling of the Lesbian affair; it is much more explicit in the book, but while he soft-pedals it in the movie, it's clearly there.Meanwhile Sofia (Oprah Winfrey in a performance that has made me wish she had done more acting), Mister's daughter-in-law, runs afoul of the town mayor and is sentenced to a prison term followed by involuntary servitude as maid to the Mayor's wife, a shrill and unpleasant creature who plays at Lady Bountiful where the "coloreds" are concerned but whose own true colors come to the surface all too soon.I've lost count of how many times I've seen this movie. I've loved it since the very first time and it never seems to get old. Spielberg would, of course, top this one with his masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST eight years later (and finally get the Oscar recognition that he had been denied for so many years), but for those eight years this was his unqualified best film, a great adaptation of a great novel that not only did justice to the source material but provided entertainment value as well. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Color Purple is a richly-textured, powerful film set in America's rural south. Whoopi Goldberg makes a triumphant screen debut as the radiant, indomitable Celie, the story's central character. Her impressive portrayal is complimented by a distinguished cast that includes Danny Glover, Oprah Winfrey, Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar, Rae Dawn Chong and Akosua Busia.It was directed by Steven Spielberg.The film spans the years 1909 to 1949, relating the life of Celie, a Southern black woman virtually sold into a life of servitude to her brutal husband, sharecropper Albert. She pours out her innermost thoughts in letter form to her sister Nettie but Albert has been hiding the letters Nettie writes back, allowing Celie to assume that Nettie is dead. Finally, Celie finds a champion in the don't-take-no-guff Sofia, the wife of Glover's son from a previous marriage. Alas, Sofia is brought back to reality when she is beaten into submission by angry whites. Later, Celie is able to forge a strong friendship with Albert's mistress Shug. Emboldened by this, Celie begins rifling through her husband's belongings and finds Nettie's letters. Able at last to stand up to her husband, Celie leaves him to search for a new life on her own.Spielberg, proving he's one of the few modern filmmakers who has the visual fluency to be capable of making a great silent film, took a melodramatic approach to filming. His tactics made the it controversial, but also a popular hit. You can argue with the appropriateness of his decision, but his astonishing facility with images is undeniable.It is a great, warm, hard, unforgiving, triumphant movie, and there is not a scene that does not shine with the love of the people who made it.Truly,a sentimental tale that reveals great emotional truths in American history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully written classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Color Purple is a beautifully interwoven story about the trials one woman faced growing up in the early 1900's, during a time where women and especially women of color were frowned upon. Celie, who is the character played by Whoopi Goldberg, was given the hard road from the time she was old enough to know better. At the age of fourteen she had encountered things most women would never have to face. Yet throughout all the challenges she grew strong and learned to love herself. She eventually got others to love and respect her too. I feel this is the ultimate theme of this movie.This movies theme is subjective in nature and centers around the life of Celie as she embarks on a journey to find her place in the world she has been a victim of. The focus of the movie is centered on Celie's character and the challenges she has to overcome. This movie shows the complex nature between the various relationships of the characters involved. It allowed us to get a close up view of the growth of friendship between Celie and Shug Avery, who was played by Margaret Avery. There also was a bond that grew between Sophia, who was played by Oprah Winfrey and the other women.The theme of this movie is universal in the light of the occurrences. The challenges faced by Celie are not uncommon in society, and unfortunately these challenges are the reality of many young women today. Celie was molested by her father and bore two children that she didn't get to keep. She was given in marriage to a low life man named Mister (Albert). Mister abused Celie in every way possible. These are just a few of the traumatizing effects of growing up in Celie's world, which are directly related to the theme. The use of symbols in the movie helped to build appreciation for their value. The color purple was one symbol. It was important because it bared the title of the movie and it had implications of beauty, change and awareness of self. The use of the sun in this movie is also a symbol of happiness. The director Steven Spielberg also used a similar thematic element in Citizen Kane. He did this by focusing the theme on the main character in each of the films. There was also the use of motifs within the film. A big one was the letters from her sister Nettie which Celie didn't receive until the climax of the film. The receipt of the letters is what allowed Celie to recognize she was worthy of love and that someone loved her. The theme of The Color Purple resonates from its beginning to its end. It showcases a range of emotions and the plot is fully seen through the various cinematic effects. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and root for Celie's success. Although the movie was written over two decades ago, its theme still fits the society we live in now. The Color Purple is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed for years to come. I love this film, and encourage everyone to view it at least once in a lifetime. It is well worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sister, remember your name"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In cinema, the 1980s are remembered for their action-filled blockbusters, gross-out comedies and weepy romances, but the most awards and critical praise of the decade went to mature, moving and inspirational dramas. Now we were past the age of censorship in the classic era and the stylistic excess of the 60s and 70s, and now more than ever great stories were being done justice on the big screen. And yet, the decade was still conflicted enough for things to be done wrong. The Color Purple is adapted from Alice Walker's beautiful 1982 novel, but was directed by prolific maker of blockbusters Steven Spielberg. The result is an unfortunate clash.This was the first time Spielberg had done an adult drama, but he had proved himself to be no stranger to deep and emotional touches, especially in E.T. However, for The Color Purple he comes across as overwhelmingly na?ve, splurging on shots that simply call attention to themselves, continually casting shadows or flashing close-ups before us. All this is to the detriment of story and character. Take for example the scene in which Sofia is arrested. The moment she hits the mayor is done tantalisingly with a close-up of her hand, followed by a long shot, with the actual deed obscured by a passing car. All very clever, but this isn't the time for the director to be clever, it's a moment for the actress to shine, yet Oprah Winfrey's performance is sold short by the arty camera-work. The staging in this scene is horribly corny too, with all the white folks standing in a circle wagging their fingers, like some pantomime act. As for the various attempts at humour, these largely fall into the slapstick category, such as Harpo repeatedly falling through the roof or people scrabbling to get away from Miss Millie's driving, and they are simply undignified and inappropriate for this picture.And it's a real shame, because the acting in The Color Purple is of the highest calibre, and we ought to be able to see it with greater clarity. Whoopi Goldberg has a demanding task because Celie is a woman of so few words. However Goldberg is able to convey so much with a gesture, a glance, or an enigmatic half-smile. It's clear she understands the character, constantly feeling Celie's thoughts, and yet retaining enough mystery in her performance to keep it interesting. Margaret Avery has wonderful passion, her presence filling the screen. Although Oprah Winfrey may be a little exaggerated sometimes in her movements, her expression and vocal delivery are commanding and heartfelt. Danny Glover is great too, making his character menacing and abhorrent without descending into caricature.Indeed, there's a lot of professionalism gone into this movie. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, with sharp foregrounds against misty backdrops. The musical score by Quincy Jones (and others) is a little overwrought at times but has some lovely melodies to it, and the song "Sister" is a lovely slice of laid-back jazz. And Spielberg has his good ideas too, making endearing little shots like the snowman in the background when Sofia is reunited with her family. And above all things the powerful words of Alice Walker shine through, telling us a truth that has a universal and timeless meaning. This motion picture version of The Color Purple has a lot wrong in its execution, and yet there is enough to its raw material to leave us with something of value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, every now and then there comes a movie so profound and touching in nature that it makes one wonder why other, less-significant movies are even made. The Color Purple is one of these profound movies: deep, and spiritual. The Color Purple is why movies are made: to tell an amazing story. This movie was made a year before I was born, so I only now have the pleasure of seeing this movie. I first saw it a couple years ago and since have been profoundly impacted by this movie. Not only are there great lessons throughout the movie, about women overcoming unjust circumstances, but it is a great lesson in Karma. That ending is just about the most powerful I have seen, with the exception of some scenes in the Lord of The Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring. I have a sister and I don't know how I would go on knowing I wouldn't see her for so long, or whether I would ever see her at all. The Color Purple shows the power of family, the power of friends, the power of laughter, the power of being freed from a restricted life. It is, in short, about the powers in life. Though it is a long movie (it seemed about three or so hours), it is time well-spent, and you won't regret it.My advice for going into this movie is, well, be ready to cry. Keep an open mind, though, and let yourself feel the full force of the movie. I have never cried more for any movie, so guys, if you plan on watching it with your girlfriend, don't expect to be able to sit through it without some waterworks. It's okay, though. Real men can cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie is such a moving, amazing piece of work. i saw it at the theater when it came out, but i was only 13 &amp; didn't really quite "get it"... i saw it again when i was 20 (on video of course &amp; i now own it) &amp; was just blown away. Steven Spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end. i have read the book as well, but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life. the casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you cheer... it brings out every emotion imaginable. it is one of his finest pieces of work &amp; should not be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Piece of Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Color Purple is an awesome book, movie, but best of all - Musical Play. I was blessed to attend the play on Saturday, November 12, 2005 and it exceeded my expectations. Not only could the cast sing very well, their acting was flawless. I must commend Oprah for having producing the play, for having the Angel net work as recipients, and for everything that she does - a truly gift from God she is.I enjoyed the twist to the play with Mista (Albert) actually asking Ms. Celie to marry him! What was even better - she told him No.I can't say enough about the book, I have read the book several times and have written an Essay paper on the Color Purple.The movie was so very touching - The play, the book, the movie are all quite entertaining. I continue to find myself crying throughout different scenes of the Color Purple. Somehow, it has that effect on many people.Hats off for an excellent piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Color Purple again recently on DVD and even though I've seen in several times before it still touches me like no other movie! Whoopie Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey in their big screen debuts, Danny Glover, Margaret Avery and the rest of the cast are simply brilliant! It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and as the trailer said back in '85, you will never forget this movie! How very true. The beautiful shots and amazing acting makes it magical.If there is anyone who has not seen this movie then they are missing out on one of Spielbergs best movies to date. Why this movie wasn't awarded one single Oscar despite it's 10 nominations is beyond me! Whoopie got a Golden Globe for her role and Spielberg won Best Director by the Directors Guild of America. And they all get 10 out of 10 by me.</fullReview>

Surely no movie can be a book - nor be better than a book - just like a painting can never be as wonderful as a flower.It has been said before and I will say it again, this is Speilberg's finest hour and Alice Walker's greatest tribute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best and underrated films I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Color Purple has never been truly appreciated and I have no problem figuring out why. It deals with issues most people have a hard time facing. That is precisely why Spielberg is one of my favorites, because of the level of integrity in his work. The situations that he brought to the service in this film, ugly as some of them were, are reminiscent of that time period. We don't like to see our ancestors in such a hideous depiction because it's like holding up a mirror to humanity and saying, "Take a good look at who you really are". I like films that disturb our senses and strip away arrogance and false pride. I like films that say "It wasn't always great to be an American, but whatever we went through, we're still here. We're not dead yet." Whether Spielberg gives that voice to difference sexes, races or species, I think it is a message that needs to be heard again and again, because that it where our sense of pride can come from. Not from a false idea of who we were.Beyond the moral issues of this film, the cinematography was wonderful. The luscious landscapes of purple flowers and verdant feels was enough to take my breath away. The performances were just as wonderful. Whoopi Goldberg's film debut proved her ability as a future top-notch actress. Danny Glover, who gave his usual intense and mind-bending performance, also stole the show as well as actresses Avery Brooks, Oprah Winfrey and Rae Dawn Chong. Overall, nice performances by everyone and a great screenplay adaption of Alice Walker's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A never better Spielberg.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best movie ever made, a tapestry of sorrow, pain, emotion, survival and joy, was a movie experience like no other when I saw it at 16 in 1986. I had never seen a movie so captivating and involving, that basically grabbed me and shred me to pieces and then had me rejoicing and running what felt like shocks of electricity thru me (my eyes are watering just remembering the moment). Steven Spielberg has faired better critically and comercially with his classics "Jaws", "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan", but this is the masterpiece that put him at ground zero when dealing with true dramatic prose and the courage and triumph of the human spirit. A true classic in all means of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My All Time Top Ten! I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everytime I see this film it does something for my soul. It is not as good as the book, but what film ever is. This film was really a breakthrough for so much of this cast. It really got jipped at the Oscars in 1985 in my honest opinion.Whoopi Goldberg's first major role in a fair world would have won her the Oscar. Also, that same year, both Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey were both nominated for best supporting actress. Granted one of them should have claimed that award but since both were nominated it almost ruined the chance for either of them.Margaret Avery as Shug Avery was the gem in this movie in my honest opinion. Her character is versatile and I really wish she had come on stronger as an actress after her success in this film. Whoopi Goldberg as the main character Celie was Whoopi's most powerful performance ever. This film also helped rocket Danny Glover's career. As the abusive Albert, I could never see another person fitting the role better.What can one say about the character of Ms. Sofia??? Oprah Winfrey is a woman of sheer flexibility and anyone who ever saw her performance in this film knows why. Her character was definitely the most flamboyant of the film and the most "showy" as far as skills are concerned.I really wish the characters were more developed like in the book but with only a few hour movie it was almost impossible. Maybe Spielberg could have captured the entirety of the novel better with two movies allowing time for characters like Squeak (played by Rae Dawn Chong) to be developed fully. Otherwise, this is one of my favorites of all time and has always been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of all 11 Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much to love about The Color Purple, one knows barely where to begin. The film tells the story essentially of 3 women, Celie, Shug and Sophia and how they grow and change as their lives progress. Celie quietly accepts her lowly lot in life, Sophia is burdened by hers and Shug is just desperately trying to find out who she is.Brilliantly acted and gorgeous to watch, The Color Purple will stir emotions and shed tears in the hardest of hearts. It draws you into a world in only a way great films do (like the way The Godfather brings you on the inside) and lets you get to know characters.It's 0-for-11 Oscar performance and rejection of Speilberg for even a nomination is still to this day, and always will be, Oscar's greatest scandal. For me, this still taints the entire process. It deserved of at least the awards for actress, supporting actress (Margaret Avery, not Oprah) and cinematography. But that is point that has been beaten to death for nearly 15 years.This is a story of faith and redemption, rather than despair and defeat. It is a long, powerful, meritorious film - get an extra large bowl of popcorn and a fresh box of kleenex and take 150 minutes of your life for this movie. It was easily the best film of 1985 and is one of the best ever made.**** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has always been among my favorite American directors of all time. He creates for the screen what he would like to see and, in turn, feel, not what he thinks the audience would like to see. He does not second guess the American public (like most Hollywood producers and directors)and is almost always on target, "1941" and "Always" being, perhaps, the only two exceptions from his outstanding body of work. Back in 1985 however, the above comments not withstanding, I was unsure of his chances of pulling off "The Color Purple" for the sole reason that he never attempted a film quite so serious before. My reservations were completely unfounded. The strong emotionality of this film, of the characters, can barely be contained within the frames. The pacing, editing, visuals (which is a Spielberg strong point), style, all combine to place a lump in the throat and a smile on the viewers face at various moments while telling the sad and happy story of Celie, an abused, neglected, and used turn of the century rural Georgia woman and those around her. This is a manipulative film, but to tell the story with the greatest effect, the manipulation is a necessary element. All the characters are written with extreme depth, and we care personally about their troubles, hardships, hopes, dreams, aspirations and cry tears of joy when they attain happiness in any measure. The screenplay is half of this result, the other half being the flawless performances by all involved, from Whoopie Goldberg as Celie to Danny Glover as "Mister", Celie's emotionally and physically abusive husband, to Oprah Winfrey as a strong willed early twentieth century southern black who refuses to change her ways even when the white town folk bring almost overwhelming pressure to bear on her. There are subplots and relationships with more minor characters too numerous to mention here that are as interesting as the main story. In 1985, there were many people asking if a white urban male film director was right choice to tell the story of of an abused black woman in the deep rural south. Spielberg reached into his heart and found the right path, demonstrating at heart, we all have the same feelings.</fullReview>

He gets the finest performance ever out of Goldberg and Glover, but it's Winfrey who steals the picture. She immerses herself into her role and never slows down for anything. Her timing is perfect. Her emotion is real. It's one of the many great treasures within the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, without a doubt, is one of Spielberg's very best films. It is a sad but achingly beautiful study of complex characters weaving a complex tale across the vivid landscape of humanity, in whatever colour. For me, this has many 'stars'. Danny Glover, so well known for his comedy pairing with Mel Gibson, portrays an evil abuser who is ultimately saved by his conscience. Oprah Winfrey as the poor women whose inner demons tear her soul apart is utterly convincing, and why she consigned herself to the queen of the talk shows is a criminal waste. But for me, the star is obviously Whoopi Goldberg. She portrays her character with real depth and understanding. Her small triumphs, so often eclipsed by her tragedies, shine through like a blinding beacon of hope. This is a classic film, complex, tragic, sometimes funny. It is Spielberg's masterpiece, and he has crafted it as surely as an old master crafts a portrait or a composer writes a piece that leaves us emotionally drained, but ultimately fulfilled.I would happily give this 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Spielburg's most inspirational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I get to far into this review I need to give a few details from the novel, which was titled the same as the film. The novel tells a story from a number of diary entres about a young girl named Celie, who is constantly abused and neglected, who lived in the 1920's and 1930's. Written by Alice Walker in 1982, it has become her most recognized work.The film follows the growing up of a woman that lived in the Southern United States, the girl's name is Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). Celie, 14 at the time that the film starts, has already had two children by her father, yes you read it right, and has already been subjected to the cruelty of her father. Celie's father forces Celie to marry a man that she calls "Mister", his real name is Albert (Danny Glover). Albert, who had his eyes on Celie's younger more, attractive sister named Nettie (Akosua Busia), treats Celie like a slave (making her clean the disorderly house, take care of the unruly children and so forth). He beats her often, making Celie go mute (for fear of being beaten for talking) and causing her to go into complete submission.Now Celie's sister comes to live with them and wouldn't you know it, Albery tries to rape her. She kicks him away too many times and he kicks her out. A few years later, Celie is a grown woman and has spent a good number of days crying in fear of her abusive husband. Albert is now spending time with his mistress, a jazz singer named Shug "Sugar" Avery (Margaret Avery). At first Celie and Shug don't get along, then they start having a friendly relationship that begins to drive Albert crazy.Shug hasn't been living the life of leisure, in her mind that is. Her father, the reverend, has completely removed her from his life because he regards her as a slut. In another part of town, one of Albert's sons is having trouble with his wife Sophie (Oprah Winfrey). Sophie has also lived a hard life were the men try to make her feel inferior. She is strong-spirited and doesn't like to be hit. Harpo (Willard Pugh), the son of Albert, gets advice from Albert and hits Sophie. She leaves him, but her freedom is short lived, she hits the mayor and spends some time in jail. After eight years, she is commissioned to be the Mayor's wife's maid for twelve long years.To make a long review look shorter, Shug helps Celie find the long lost letters from her sister, she had thought her sister dead, and she succeeds in convincing Celie to leave Albert. After a few years Celie is reunited with her sister and her two children that had been raised in Africa.Beautifully portrayed and enhanced, the film shows what happened during the 1920's and 1930's. It gives an example to how women, mostly black women, lived during the time that women's right's weren't yet realized. I gave this a perfect ten our of ten, one of my family's personal favorites.</fullReview>

It's pretty sad to see that movies as great as "The Color Purple" don't come along too often 'cause I think all of us are in desperate need of first-class motion picture entertainment in these hard times.Movies like this are more than just movies; they're pieces of art that need to be appreciated more.The idea that it was nominated for 11 Oscars (even Best Picture of the Year) and didn't get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can be sometimes. Spielberg wasn't even nominated for Best Director! It should have swept the Oscars that year.The film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some people.If only movies were still this good....</fullReview>

I could barely sit through a single viewing of "Out of Africa". But Kharma always wins out.

Its an amazing book - but true to Alice Walker's style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters - so I am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out. The cinematography was amazing - the African scenes live much to be desired - the African part in the book is supposed to be set in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - BUT oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of Africa outside of the Safaris - so yes there had to be a complimentary Zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none West Africa ---- and most of all why get the people to speak Swahili --- who in West Africa speaks Swahili?? I just had to get that out of the way.......But as a story - amazing, film-making - out of this world - CLASSIC yes!!I own it and I watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start with let me say I am male and 17. now that thats out of the way i'll tell you my brief story.Me and a mate (male and 18) were at the video store getting ready for a Speilberg night. we had "JP", "Close incounters of the third kind" and then we went in search of the 3rd film. My buddy came up to me with the color purple, which he had not seen. I said no, he said yes, i said no... well you get the idea. The reason i didn't want to rent it was because i knew if i watched it i would turn into a blubbering mess. To cut a long story short (too late*) We rented the color purple and like i knew i would, i was crying like a 5 year old with a skinned knee...How ever not that my "oh so butch" mate could make fun cause he was cry more than I was.That story was to show how this movie is so wonderful it can make 2 big strong boys cry. Whoopi is stunning as the sympathetic Celie. And the way i judge the way a person playes a bad guy, is if i want to reach into the screen and punch them in the face, and man did i want to sock Mr.,MINOR SPOILER We were crying out of happiness for Celie, not out of sadness. Also am I the only one that get realy choked up when Celie throws the chocolates to the girl from the back of the train? END SPOILER10/10And no I have not read the book. But like always, I would assume it to be better.*Line from the movie "Clue"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious and Irritating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't mind a film which uses tragedy to pull at heart strings, but it has to be intelligent and tasteful. The Color Purple is no such film. Spielberg lays the tragedy on with a thickness which makes it seem ludicrous. It seems the vast majority of the film does little more than try to insist upon its viewers that this woman's life is sad and unfair using methods which are so exaggerated and transparent that it distracts the viewer from getting lost in the story and simply keeps reminding them that they're watching a film which is trying far too hard to make them feel something.Some examples of this over-reaching can be seen in Whoopi Golberg's portrayal of Celia; the ridiculous state Celia first finds her new home in; the way Celia and Shug read in turn; and the irritating mood music played on cue each time Spielberg tries to saturate us in whatever emotion he's trying to evoke in us. The concept of subtlety has been completely lost on Spielberg in this film.The film does have its saving graces however. Apart from Goldberg's overdone portrayal of Celia, the acting is good, particularly from Oprah. The story itself (which I have not read) would quite probably be very emotional and interesting if it hadn't been told with such awkwardness. Margaret Avery's singing was divine, truly the only thing in the film that made me authentically feel something other than the urge to stop watching. For these things I give the film a 4. Had Spielberg not corrupted it so badly it quite possibly might even be worth the 7.6 stars it currently sits at on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg is not the right person to tell this worthy story about female friendships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Characters in Spielberg movies can operate in the middle of the moral spectrum, can exhibit nuance, and can hold true to their immutable natures while still going on a journey of change?see, for example, Chief Brody in "Jaws"?but it is more common for them to be characterized in extremes, as most of them are in "The Color Purple." Shining heroes and devilish villains are not out of place in, say, Indiana Jones movies, which trade in concepts of good and evil in a world where magic is real and the stakes include the destruction of the world, but in Spielberg's historical films his black and white view of life can feel stifling, arbitrary, and preachy. In "The Color Purple" and in "Schindler's List" no less than in "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the story unfolds through a series of good and evil actions committed by characters who are either right or wrong, respectively. To be fair, Oskar Schindler is a flawed hero in the latter movie, and in this film Celie Harris Johnson (Whoopie Goldberg) has one line that suggests complication. This moment occurs early in the movie, when she suggests, perhaps for lack of any other example of male behavior, that a man beat his wife in order to make her more docile. But for the most part, Celie and the other characters in "The Color Purple" have at most two settings, and when they alternate between them it is with a rapidity that is more in service of plot and message than of truth. Spielberg is not obliged to make truthful movies, of course, but in his historical movies he seems to want to have it both ways: he seems to want to say something honest and meaningful, but through characters who are too idealized and abstractified to connect with.Here, the film opens with an idyllic pastoral scene: young girls playing in a field of flowers. When they step out of the head-high stalks, we see that one of the girls, Celie, is pregnant. Clearly, something is amiss. The next two scenes reveal Celie's painful childbirth, the cruel theft of the infant by her father, and the statement that her father is also the father of her child. The moral lines are very stark, the villain and victim very clear. If only real life had the perfect clarity that it has in Spielberg's versions of it.At times, of course, it does. There have been, and still are, women like Celie (Whoopie Goldberg), abused and despised and trapped by their deranged fathers or husbands. There have been, and still are, women like Sofia (Oprah Winfrey), unjustly imprisoned or mistreated by their employers because of the color of their skin. But do people bear their circumstances with the saintly, childlike, often bemused patience of Celie, or alternate between Sofia's polar extremes of unbridled confidence and utterly defeated resignation? Some perhaps do, but for most people, life is lived in the middle. There are monsters in the world, like Danny Glover's tyrannical Albert, but do monsters like that ever change in time for a Spielberg-sanctioned happy ending? These characters are simple when they should be rich, and mercurial when they should be static.That said, if Spielberg's prime objective is to convey a strong, positive message through raw, uplifting emotion, he succeeds. Many have focused on the film's famous march to a church, a big musical number that feels good and creates a neat resolution for a juke joint singer named Shug (Margaret Avery). Yet this is actually a side plot, and not strictly necessary to the core ideas about strong female relationships. In fact, it works against those ideas: Shug is the film's most complicated and interesting on-screen character (an equally intriguing storyline set in Africa exists only on the margins), but in the church she is railroaded into what audiences in 1985 found a crowd-pleasing conformity that, to me, just feels like conformity. The idea that really drives "The Color Purple," and that remains as daring and intense and uncompromising and subversive now as it was then, is that bonds between women have the ability to weather the destructive power that certain men employ to maintain their position of privilege in society. Celie's different but equally strong connections with Sofia, Shug, and a sister who remade herself in Africa are mutually empowering and healing, and the worthiness of this message makes the film worth seeing and talking about in spite of its many missteps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Color this disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read Alice Walker's novel in 1984 as part of an American literature course. Walker's work is raw, gritty, heartbreaking and powerful, written in the first person by Celie without an ounce of self-pity. I have read it several times, and it has never failed to move me.The following year, THE COLOR PURPLE came to the screen. A group of us from the English department went to see it. We were horrified by Spielberg's Disneyfied treatment of a work we all cherished. Between Spielberg and Menno Meyjes (who wrote the execrable screenplay), the original point of Walker's story was completely lost. What a waste! The film could have been magnificent in more competent hands, but its terrific casting, location, cinematography, and acting were all wasted on this saccharine and often incredibly dull, loose adaptation.My suggestion: Read the book before you watch the film. You'll be surprised by the difference in nearly every aspect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Color Purple (1985)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not too shabby. Goldberg is surprisingly pretty good, and I liked Avery, but Winfrey is weak and Glover plays the bad guy much better in TO SLEEP WITH ANGER. The film is blatantly manipulative and sentimental, wallowing in misery for about an hour and a half, then finding convenient little magical/redemptive arcs for everyone, punctuated with the usual Spielberg sap and schmaltzy score. And while I don't doubt his good intentions, I felt a little uneasy about the portrayal of African-Americans, which comes dangerously close to caricature at times. But I must say I was relatively engaged throughout, and invested in Celia's struggles. Schmaltz and sap can sometimes be effective, and I confess to getting a little choked up at times. A bit too much Hollywood polish on a tale that I'm sure is much darker in its original form, but not a bad watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Movie With Some Faults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I want to commemorate Steven Spielberg for making a very picturesque backdrop to such a tragic movie; it imbues a sense that everything can be better in the circumstances as they are. However, I actually initially thought it was going to be about the slave trade, but that is a minor trifle in my train of thought as what I got was actually better.The movie opens with a beautiful orchid setting up the movie, showing you the innocence of two girls frolicking around the field (it's a rather moving moment but you know it's not going to be quite that similar throughout). Then she gives birth in 1909 to a baby, who she is deprived of from her Father, as the movie chronicles her struggle at education and how this all unfolds. The movie deviates slightly from the book, with Spielberg's need for audience warmth I suppose, but he does do very well with the plotting. Even with the scenes intercutting with the reading of those letters from her sister Nettie...Danny Glover plays Albert, a character raised simply to be harmful, callous and overbearing to his wife in the most domineering of fashions possible. He would sort of a generic in that antagonistic sense; but as a character he plays it very well (he was out of Lethal Weapon, which made it feel weird to see him in this movie). He's a farmer and he adjures his servant wife (Goldberg's character, Celie) to do things for him, shave him also. However, through these experiences she learns the panache and forthrightness to speak up for herself.My only problems with it would be that I thought the way it established Goldberg as a comedic figure was sort of out of character; when she loses the urge to smile, we lose the urge to smile, as if it's infectious. When she didn't go with her sister, I sort of wondered why not... I guess her mind was running through a totally haphazardly sense of reasoning, but still it does hit you emotionally. The real thing this movie does rely on sometimes emotion and also the conquer through this oppression; oppression is really problematic and throughout you really are in a state of oppression, wanting to be liberated just like Goldberg (In the sense you identify with her).I was recommended to see this movie, so I finally bought it and I must say I definitely recommend it as well; the relationships are not complex, but they're deep and profound. The evolution of Celie's character get you really grounded in involvement throughout. Also Oprey Winfrey as Sophie is a great character to use as the analogy for Celie; however, she's not a really necessary character, but she is a character that can get through to Celie. ... I can say that I will one day watch this movie over again. It does leave you with a mellow feeling, and a real sense of freedom in such tumultuous times. It however will not leave you with the same emotions as his subsequent "Schindler's List" film does, and in fact, Spielberg's trademark barely feels pervasive in the movie... still he utilizes fluid and swimmingly posed shots that are set to really make you look galore at a wonderful experience; it is not a true story, so there will be no qualms for anybody with any proclamation that this is so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's first adventure on serious films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Color Purple" was a new challenge for Steven Spielberg because it was his first movie about serious subjects. In fact, this film deals with strong subjects such as racism, poverty and sex discrimination. We can say that this motion picture has a strong anti-racist message.Despite being dramatic and touching, I don't see "The Color Purple" as a great movie. I personally think that the first half is much better than the second half. The first half is more sentimental, emotional and touching, while the second half is too boring.However, the best things about this movie are the beautiful sceneries and Whoopi Goldberg's performance (definitely one of her best, despite being one of her earliest roles)."The Color Purple" is one of the few movies entirely with black people. After all, it is about black people and it shows us very well how they were so badly treated in those times (this movie takes place between 1909 and 1947).While not one of Steven Spielberg's best achievements, it isn't however one of his worst films.However, after this Steven Spielberg made plenty of more serious movies, such as "Empire of the Sun", "Schindler's List" and others.</fullReview>

You can FEEL it in this film ? EVERYONE was there because they knew they were doing something of importance. Taken from the Pulitzer prize-winning novel, and keeping its epic, ironic twists of Karma sensibility, we live and breathe the pains, degradation, and joys of very difficult lives. Towards the end, the film takes on less of a literary, and more of a theatrical nature ? which I question ? but this is a small point compared to the film craft, acting, and heart of very emotional story. Full of lessons in life, I watch it in awe ?

		<shortDescription>The other Color Purple.... of the 21st century.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>________________________________________It is interesting that Oprah's debut was "The Color Purple" and that her announcement that her show will be ending, is adorned by this film "Precious". A young woman (girl, actually) is brutally abused and deprived. Her humbled courage and patience is tested over and over again. There is her vengeful and sadistic mother who masturbates her level of comfort through the shambles of her horrible pitiful life. There is also her robot like, seemingly indifferent cardboard kind of a grandmother and the cruel senseless garbage quality of her environment. All of it cannot crash down on her to squash her spirit. And, if all of that was not enough, she is handed an almost certain death sentence which infects the viewer with sadness, guilt and ....yes optimism. A miracle! The film presents almost nothing cinematographically new. It has the "cookie cutter" "cold cuts" of miserable/deprived/crude/ungrateful bunch of inner city kids and a kind, loving, do-good teacher. Mind you, she is a lesbian, therefore goodness gracious etc. What else is new? "Precious", that's what. The heavy gold persona of this huge/little girl (her mother is of lead) makes all the difference. We do love her. We sympathize, empathize, resonate with her misery, defiance, resistance and applaud her resilience and the steadiness of her soul. I can't recommend this film - it makes you sad and upset, but I don't regret seeing it and, as I write it, I cry for yet another time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Spielberg's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg was at the top of his game when he directed this. This did launch the careers of Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and the future talk show queen Oprah Winfrey. Alice Walker wrote the book and did give the film her blessing. Treated like a star in this but not so famous is Margaret Avery who certainly acted like a queen. There are lesbian undertones between her and Goldberg.Spielberg's visual style is actually very similar to E.T. and the Indiana Jones movies. It goes from subtle to not so subtle and the protagonist Goldberg goes through an effective arc.She goes from a poor, defenseless, sweet girl to someone who has power once she discovers the letters her daughter's been writing to her has been hidden away from Glover. She even goes through another change when she sees her African children for the first time. She is believable even if the story at times is not believable.For instance, why would Glover keep those letters with his money box? He's quite the antagonist for Goldberg for most of this and picks up the wrong lessons from his father Adolph Cesare that partially explains his behavior. Still, blacks were treated like second class citizens and black men could only take it out of black women.But one that wouldn't have any of that is Oprah Winfrey who whoops her mate Harpo. But she becomes a sad victim of her blackness after getting jailed for hitting back a white man. Hard to say what her movie career would have been like because she truly became a force onto herself on her own TV show. In a small role one finds Lawrence Fishburn, who will become a major star in his own right.Was the happy ending a dream? Avery reunites with her preacher husband with a lot of song and dance. Glover arranges for Goldberg's kids to come without them knowing more than a few words of English. But it made the viewer feel good and for me, that's good enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Academy Awards' Biggest Snub!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No motion picture featuring an all-black cast has ever won an Oscar for best picture. "The Color Purple" should have been the first. The fact that this all-time classic was nominated for 11 Oscars without a single win is an atrocity. I doubt if any other movie has ever been so artificially praised yet so deliberately slighted. This movie had everything, a first rate director in Steven Spielberg, arguably the best director of his time, if not all-time. It featured an all-star ensemble with the likes of Danny Glover, Whoopie Goldberg, Adolph Caesar, Oprah Winfrey, Margeret Avery, and Laurence Fishbourne, to name a few. Never mind that the script was adapted from the best selling novel by the distinguished Pulitzer prize winning author, Alice Walker. Every detail of it was orchestrated with precision. The legendary Quincy Jones' music, the cinematography, the makeup, the costume design, and other behind the scenes aspects were all stupendous. The story of how two sisters(Oscar worthy performances by both Goldberg and newcomer Akosia Buria), unwillingly separated as adolescents, finally reunite after years of trials and tribulations is the stuff legends are made of. The only way to describe this historical event is that it is spiritually uplifting, expertly crafted, a genuine and majestic tearjerker in the vein of earlier classics such as "Imitation of Life" and "Gone With the Wind". The Academy should have been ashamed to allow such a rewarding and masterful achievement to go uncrowned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just one name: Whoopi Goldberg!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Whoopi Goldberg! And when I discovered that "The color purple" was her first role in a movie, I said: "Gosh! She IS a legend!". This movie shows us how humanity can be cruel and merciless, but it show us too how kind we can be. Celie is a black, unlucky, sad, and ugly girl, who has a cruel and despicable father, who sexually arrests her twice (and take her children away). The only person on the world who loves Celie (and vice-versa) is her sister Nettie. But the cruel fate made Celie marries with Mister/Albert (Danny Glover) and her life turns into a sorrowful hell. She is separated from her sister (the most sad scene of the movie), and her happiness seems to end on that moment. I will not tell more about the story, because I don't want to spoil this perfect movie. I saw this film three times, and I cried a river THREE TIMES! Whoopi is Awesome! How can a human being act like her?? To me, she is one of the three legends alive (Meryl Streep and Susan Sarandon are the other two). She STOLE the scene!!! With a brilliant narrative and a fantastic cast, Classic is just one of the infinities adjectives that this film deserves. I have to say one thing. I've never cried with so much joy and satisfaction seeing a movie. "The color purple" is a legend, a classic and the BEST film that Whoopi Goldberg had ever done.

		<fullReview>The Color Purple has never been truly appreciated and I have no problem figuring out why. It deals with issues most people have a hard time facing. That is precisely why Spielberg is one of my favorites, because of the level of integrity in his work. The situations that he brought to the service in this film, ugly as some of them were, are reminiscent of that time period. We don't like to see our ancestors in such a hideous depiction because it's like holding up a mirror to humanity and saying, "Take a good look at who you really are". I like films that disturb our senses and strip away arrogance and false pride. I like films that say "It wasn't always great to be an American, but whatever we went through, we're still here. We're not dead yet." Whether Spielberg gives that voice to difference sexes, races or species, I think it is a message that needs to be heard again and again, because that it where our sense of pride can come from. Not from a false idea of who we were.Beyond the moral issues of this film, the cinematography was wonderful. The luscious landscapes of purple flowers and verdant feels was enough to take my breath away. The performances were just as wonderful. Whoopi Goldberg's film debut proved her ability as a future top-notch actress. Danny Glover, who gave his usual intense and mind-bending performance, also stole the show as well as actresses Avery Brooks, Oprah Winfrey and Rae Dawn Chong. Overall, nice performances by everyone and a great screenplay adaption of Alice Walker's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless Adaptation of the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Turning a book into a successful screenplay is an elusive art. Those wishing to do so would do well to study this movie, which turns a wonderful novel into an equally wonderful movie.The story concerns a black woman named Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). We follow Celie's life from the age of 14 to middle age, and it is a tough life. We start out with Celie's molestation at the hands of her stepfather, who she thinks is her real father. Her mother dies, and when her stepfather decides to remarry, Celie and her sister, Nettie (Akosia Busua), are no longer welcome in the house. Celie is old enough to be married off to Albert (Danny Glover), an abusive widower with equally abusive children. When Nettie rejects Albert's advances, he throws her out of his house, and keeps the sisters separate, even hiding Nettie's letters to Celie. But Celie manages to cope with the situation, creating order out of the chaos that Albert's house had become, helping his children and their neighbors, and earning such respect as a woman could earn in that community. She graciously welcomes Albert's mistress, singer Shug Avery (Margaret Avery), when he brings her to the house. Unexpectedly, the women become friends, and with Shug's help, Celie turns the tables on Albert, ultimately getting her life - and her sister - back.The acting is uniformly strong. Goldberg turns in a performance worthy of the critical acclaim it received. Glover plays Albert to perfection, even showing his vulnerability at the end of the film. Oprah Winfrey does an excellent job as the volatile Sofia. Avery's Shug is full of love and compassion. Rae Dawn Chong makes Squeak a multi-dimensional woman, whom you want to see succeed. The characters all become real, and we care about them and their concerns.Perhaps the greatest strength of the film is its taking a novel in epistolary form, and turning it into a running narrative. No small feat. The story is woven seamlessly, and is compelling as we follow it.An absolute classic of a movie, well worth repeated viewings.</fullReview>

What saves this film from being just depressing are a great script, tight editing, but most of all the outstanding performances of Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery. I can't resist inserting here that I think Whoopi Goldberg is STILL underrated, and that she belongs among the very greatest of the generation. Even here, in her first feature film role, she acts with the aplomb of a long-experienced star.

		<fullReview>The Color Purple is a movie that can literally change the way you see the world - at least that's what it did for me. There are some people that feel Steven Spielberg's adaptation did not do Alice Walker's novel any justice - but books and movies are never going to be able to convey the same things. This movie should be watched with anyone interested in equality, freedom, and human rights - but more importantly, it should be watched by those who have not yet learned these values.The Color Purple is, undoubtedly, the most powerful and, dare I say, best movie I have ever seen. My first viewing was when I was about eight years old - the story has haunted me ever since - I remember hiding my face in front of my parents, as I didn't want them to see me upset! The characters became part of my play-time - my brother and I would pretend to act out certain scenes - we'd usually play Sofia (Winfrey) - I guess her spirit was inspiring to us. Over the last 18 years, I have watched it numerous times - each time noticing something new. I recently read Alice Walker's novel, which made me see the movie differently once more. The Color Purple is also the only movie that has ever made me cry - I cried on my sixth viewing! I will always remember Sofia charging into Mister's house and setting her ground-rules, and I will always remember Christmas time when she is reunited with her family, only to be allowed to stay for a few minutes. I will never forget the moments when Celie and Nettie are separated, and when they finally meet again after so many years apart. The Color Purple is heartbreaking and wonderfully uplifting at the same time. Thank you to all the people who were involved in its creation.If you have not seen The Color Purple yet, please do - it really could change your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read The Color Purple in less than a three days. Without classes or work, I could have finished it in a day...yes, it was that good. I was very hesitant about watching the movie because I have been disappointed by many novel/comic -to-movie transitions but I got the DVD. Great performances. The casting was superbly done. The music tells the story itself, the cinematography is excellent and it just makes me sick that this movie did not win a single Oscar. Every actor gave his/her best and I must admit the movie excluded several details in the book but it was already long...making it longer would turn it into "Roots".Okay, so, this highly emotional and moving story centers around Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). Alice Walker presented The Color Purple as a combination of Celie's letters (diary format) and some narration from Celie, an abused African-American girl who is married to a man she does not have feelings for. she goes through life being treated as the scum of the earth by ignorant folks and even her own "persumed family. abused as a child and as an adult, separated from her sister, battling spiritual demons, Alice Walker slowly, but triumphantly, takes us through the dark hallways of Celie's life and delivers a resounding climax as Celie makes peace with herself, her enemies, her family and reunites with her sister and children. If the book was a page turner, the movie is comparable. Great work. Great direction, production, acting, casting, great everything (editing could've been better). I love it! How can you not love it? People may think it's depressing...read Toni Morrison's books and you know what "depressing" means. This is near perfection and worth your two hours. See it...please</fullReview>

If you don't shed a tear during the last scene, then you must have a problem going on in your eyelids or just can't show any human emotions. I was surprised to learn that this was directed by Steven Spielberg, mainly because I just know him from doing special effect thrillers. I also don't understand how this movie could have been nominated for 11 Oscars and not win one. Whoopi Goldberg was SO robbed in her nomination, she should have won. In this movie, she gives the performance of her career. Surprisingly, Oprah Winfrey is pretty amazing too, I didn't now that she could actually act. This movie has made me want to read the book which I'm gonna do. If you heard of this movie and haven't seen it, do your self a favor...watch it!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If you pass by The Color Purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it"This means(as I see it) that we can't afford to take for granted ;the simple beautiful truths of life. We can't pretend that time never changes things, situations and people. We need to release the spirits within, the voices of our soul and notice "the color purple".I won't spoil the pleasure for those who haven't seen this movie but I come away each time I see this movie with a deeper respect for the stoic enduring spirit of women, mothers,sisters, wives and daughters.It takes depth of personality/heart to truly move beyond suffering to a newer glory.Whoopi Goldberg is incandescent in her first starring role which remains her best till date. Nuff Respect to Steven Spielberg for telling a Black Woman's story through a White Man's Eyes and not denigrating it nor detracting from it.My All Time Classic 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been running on HBO lately. I have watched it almost everytime. It is as moving and as breathtaking as it was the very first time I saw it. I cannot to this day believe that it was shut out at the Oscars. I just looked at the list of nominated films for that year, and none of them hold up as well as this one. There are none on that list that I would want to watch again - except, for The Color Purple. The movie is perfect - from the opening strains of Quincy Jones' exquisite score, to the end credits, it is perfect. Even if any of the people involved in the film had never made another one, their places in cinematic history would be forever cemented at the very top. Although the film does not present every aspect of Alice Walker's incredible novel (most notably, Spielberg downplays the sexual relationship between Celie and Shug), it captures the heart and the soul of Celie's journey to becoming her own person. It is riveting. You don't want the film to end - what happens next? You come away from this film refilled, replenished. There are no 'filler' characters, and each actor's performance is monumental. You will come away from this film a changed person, and if you don't, God help you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw this movie. (1988) I was sitting in the fraternity house TV room alone one afternoon, absolutely weeping uncontrollably at times at this movie that made my happier and sadder than any movie had ever done. I wondered what would happen if one of the brothers had walked in and saw me!! That didn't happen, but to this day, if I want to go on an emotional roller coaster of a ride, I watch this movie before any other! This is an amazing interpretation of truly remarkable book. Ms. Goldberg gives so much in this role, if you have never seen it, watch it just to see how much talent she has! How much do I like the movie? My cats (sisters) are named Celie and Nettie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's first drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg wanted to win an Oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldn't win by directing special effects epics (he was nominated for three of them: "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial". So he decided to get very serious by directing "The Color Purple", a period film with no special effects. Spielberg's first serious drama is a remarkable movie. But the Academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't give Spielberg any respect. "The Color Purple" received 11 Oscar nominations including Best Picture, but Spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasn't nominated for Best Director. It got worse on Oscar night when this film didn't win a single Oscar. It got completely shut out. That wasn't right. "The Color Purple" should have won a couple of Oscars including one for Whoopi Goldberg's spectacular film debut as Celie, a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband (frightfully placed by Danny Glover), then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends. Oprah Winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as Sofia, one of those friends' of Celie. Since I'm from Chicago, I had already known Winfrey from her talk show (which at the time of this films' release hadn't gone nationwide). Like Goldberg, what a film debut! Margaret Avery is terrific as Shug Avery, another friend who also happens to be the mistress of Celie's rotten husband. All three actresses received well-deserved Oscar nominations for their work here (Goldberg for Best Actress; Winfrey and Avery for Best Supporting Actress). Set in the south during the first half of the 20th Century, "The Color Purple" is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end. It also made me laugh at times too. Why Academy voters were so hard on not nominating Spielberg for Best Director is a mystery that still puzzles me today. But Spielberg would eventully go on to win two Oscars years later for "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan", making him one of the best movie directors of all-time. But he should have gotten nominated for this movie. The job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like "E.T." to a serious drama like "The Color Purple" was remarkable.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the BEST FILMS EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Speilberg's adaptation of Alice Walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy. When first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men, while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women.This is the story of a young black woman named Celie, growing up in rural America after the turn of the century. She has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth. Her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister.Celie (played in later years by newcomer Whoopie Goldberg) is married off to an abusive husband (Danny Glover). The husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from Celie's life.The story is often heartbreaking as Celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children. Throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters, including Sophia, a tough as nails wife to her step son, and Shug, a loud and luscious saloon singer, who teaches her a thing or two about love.Speilberg's direction is all over this picture, which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances. I dare you to watch this film and not be moved! The film The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story. While it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the African story, both of which were so vivid in the book, the movie remains true to its themes, allowing the voice of Alice Walker to shine through.I couldn't begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film. Suffice it to say, however, this is one of the few films that I can watch again and again, and which has left an indelible mark on me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Color this 1985 film as excellent. Steven Spielberg's film was literally robbed of the Oscar for best picture. "Out of Africa" was the winner and was a far inferior film to this one.Our heroine, Whoopi Goldberg received a well-deserved best actress nomination for the ignorant girl Cele. She lost the Oscar to Geraldine Page, the perennial Oscar loser, who finally won for "The Trip to Bountiful." In a very close observation, Page was better but Goldberg gave her all in this meaningful picture.Black men certainly were depicted here as slave drivers, mean and rotten to the core regarding the lives of the women they came in contact with. Brutal is basically the word to be described that women such as Cele, Shug (Margaret Avery) and Oprah Winfrey, as Sofia, endured in this film. All received acting nominations and they were all outstanding.This is truly a gritty remembrance of the black experience. Redemption comes at the end of this superlative film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawlessly-made film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg's first dramatic film is no let-down. It's a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an African-American woman. It also proves that not all movies that have the African-American ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an African-American director.What I love about this movie is Spielberg's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book. Furthermore, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. And usually, he's just himself throughout most of his movies. But in this, he completely branches out and is someone else for once. But, the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She is excellent as Celie. You will never forget these characters once you've seen this movie.Now, I heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well, and all I can say is: I hope it's about as good as this one is, because this one is a film that shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miss Celie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year 1985 (my birth year) Steven Spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young African-American girl Celie (Debut role for Whoopi Goldberg) whose life is followed through rough times. The story begins from the year 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old. She has given birth two children for her father. Celie has a younger sister Nettie with whom she is inseparable. A widower lays his eyes on Nettie but their father gives Celie to him. It is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling. Women are inferior of men and especially being an African-American woman their rights are less than a zero. Celie's story is a true survival story."The Color Purple" is a master-piece and underestimated film of Spielberg. He should make more drama which "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" are good notion.The cast is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as Celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly nasty "Mister". I have never seen him in a such an evil role. The talk-show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed Sofia.Warning! Prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film. You can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood. Especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like I have with my sister.Big applauds to Mr. Spielberg!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love him or hate him, Steven Spielberg knows how to make a movie. This one in particular has to be his most amazing work (though the academy didn't think so...wrong there). I have to admit when I had heard Oprah had done this film and won a nomination for her role of Sofia, I honestly thought it was because she's Oprah and this big star, and like an idiot I thought that fact helped get her the nomination, little did I know that she was one of my more favorite characters in any movie I've seen, she was amazing. Her performance has to be one of the best performances by an actress I have ever, EVER SEEN; how she captured the vivacious and full of life Sofia, who's life behind bars and as a maid, broke her spirit and will to move on dazzled me. I've never been more impressed by any actress than I was about her. I began to forget she is the multi-billion dollar woman who is on our televisions everyday and believed she was this amazing woman Sofia. All I have to say is Fantastic JOB "O". Whoppi Goldberg blew me away, I love her comedy and her role in Ghost is one of my favorites, but her heart-breaking performance as shy, timid Celile has to be another one of the best performances I have ever seen. I just felt for this character so much, and just wanted to save her from her disgusting situation. Her timid smile and sweet personality captivated me and I fell in love with this character. She was and still is an amazing actress, but this film was one of her best. The rest of the cast of Danny Glover, Margaret Avery, and the rest of this amazing cast kept you in the story, thinking that this was a documentary with how realistic their acing was. It was the first movie I have to say gives you an almost true to life feeling of raw human emotion with its gorgeous cinematography, true to life characters and deep symbolic messages of hope and love. It was a shame and I think it completely wrong that this film was not given any Oscars or even a nomination in the Baftas because in my book this film is a masterpiece and should go down as one of the best films ever made. Mind you they say Citizen Cane is the best movie in the world and it did not win Best Picture, so I guess not all great films have to win an award to be a classic, but it still is a disappointing shame. I recommend this film to anyone, especially those who believe in hope and KARMA. Enjoy!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Performances Make the Film Worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Steven Spielberg has the very nasty habit of undertaking deep subjects and then trivializing them with a simpering sentimentality more appropriate to a second-rate Walt Disney film than the actual subject at hand. To make matters worse, with THE COLOR PURPLE he also dumbs-down Alice Walker's brilliantly story of a depression-era black lesbian's slow and painful spiritual journey toward self-knowledge, removing as much as he dare from the story lest it offend the middle-class audience at which this film is very clearly aimed.Fortunately, THE COLOR PURPLE is remarkably blessed in its cast. Whoopi Goldberg's performance is a revelation of unexpected artistic depth, touching, funny, tough, and entirely honesty. Ophra Winfrey and Margaret Avrey are equally fine in complex supporting roles, and Hollywood's failure to make successful use of these actresses following their appearance in this film says quite a lot about the down-side of corporate film making. The power of Goldberg, Winfrey, and Avery--as well as every one in the entire cast--is such that the performers largely transcend Spielberg's ham-heavy touch to make the film memorable.The art direction is merely so-so, and I'd be willing to bet that neither Spielberg nor any of his designers actually bothered to visit the rural deep south before designing the show; the resulting look of the film is very hit and miss where authenticity is concerned. On the other hand, the cinematography is exceptionally fine and deserves a great deal of credit for making the film as enjoyable as it is. The script, as noted, is essentially a very weak adaptation of the novel, touching on but inevitably ducking the issues which made the novel so interesting. The Quincy Jones score, however, is stunning and deserves every one of the accolades heaped upon it.Watch this movie for the deeply moving performances, cinematography, and score. Then go out and buy the book. And if you've neither read the book nor seen the film, for heaven's sake DON'T read the book until you've seen the film: seeing the movie won't spoil book, but reading the book will certainly make you even more acutely aware of the film's already obvious failings.Gary F.

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSOur story opens in Alabama in 1909, with sisters Celie and Nettie playing in the fields. Celie was pregnant and she was only 14 years of age! Who was the father? Her own father! As soon as Celie's babies, Adam and Olivia, were born her father took them away. One day, a man named Albert came to see their father hoping to get Nettie in marriage. Her father wouldn't allow it, although he said he could have Celie. Celie called Albert Mister. He began to abuse poor Celie and worker her like a dog. Albert had children, among them was a boy, Harpo. Nettie came to stay with Celie and taught her to read and write. Life was happy again until one afternoon where Albert tried to make his move on Nettie. She luckily escaped, but a furious Albert threw her off his land. Nettie and Celie had to sadly say goodbye to one another again.Years passed. Celie was grown up. So was Harpo, who brought his fiance, Sofia, to meet Albert who took an immediate dislike to her. They soon got married and soon got divorced. Pretty soon, Albert brought an old girlfriend of his, Shug Avery, to stay at the house. She took an immediate dislike to Celie. Albert tried to cook Shug breakfast but couldn't figure out how to work the stove. Shug threw the mean he tried to cook her against the wall. However, when Celie cooked, she kept it.Time went on. Harpo opened a jook joint in the woods. Celie kept hoping to get a letter from Nettie, but none ever seemed to come. One afternoon in town, the mayor and his wife, Miss Millie, met Sofia and her kids. Miss Millie asked if Sofia would like to come and be her maid. When Sofia gave her answer, the mayor came over and caused more trouble. Sofia belted him and was sent to jail.Eight years later, old and paralyzed, Sofia was released from jail and became Miss Millie's maid. Miss Millie had gotten a new car and Sofia would teach her to drive it. Miss Millie became a real terror in the streets! Shug Avery and Celie soon became good friends. And one Thanksgiving, Shug checked the mail and a letter from Nettie was in it! They searched Albert's room and unearthed his secret stash: a pile of money and a ton of letters all from Nettie! The letters stated that Nettie was in Africa working at a missionary. Celie's kids were there too! They would be coming back to America soon! Celie finally got the courage to stand up to Albert. She attempted to cut his throat when he ordered her to shave him. If it were me, I would've done it. But instead, Celie joined Shug on her trip to Tennessee. She came home for the funeral of her father.One afternoon, there was a surprise for Celie! Nettie had come home! With her were Adam and Olivia, all grown up! Who was responsible for getting them here? Albert. They lived happily ever after.A good film. Great performances! Whoopi Goldberg was good. Danny Glover was good. Oprah Winfrey was good. Everyone was good! That's really all there is to say. I recommend this film! Great drama! It also shows how unfairly African Americans were treated back then. So if you haven't already seen it, see it! It's by Steve Spielberg who brought us Jaws, E.T., Poltergeist, so you know it's gotta be good.-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as believed to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is often referred to as a classic. It does not deserve to be called a classic. The only reason why this film has the name of a classic is that people feel obliged to find it a classic. I cannot tell why this movie is so bad. Is it Steven Spielberg in his early days, or do the actors perform so poorly. This film just strains after effect. And that's it. Steven imagined a cinema full of crying people. That should have been what he wanted. This is only a good film for uncritical watchers. Movie addicts simply cannot like it.My first point of criticism contains the acting. This film is totally destitute of any form of nuance. When miss Millia starts the car, every civilian runs away. This film is not meant to be funny, don't try to mix it with humor either. When Albert brings Shug to her car heading for Chicago, Celie carries all the bags and suitcases. This is stereotyped. I cannot believe that the book by Alice Walker is as exaggerated as the film.I don't think you can make a film on Alice Walker's novel that is both funny and serious. Alice Walker meant this to be a serious, emotional story. The film should be serious too. The character of miss Sofia, funnily performed by Oprah Winfrey, is exaggerated. So much exaggerated that she is funny. Oprah should have performed less like a comedian. She is a strong woman, but she should not be a woman who makes the audience screaming with laughter.Another unclear scene is when Shug Avery and people in the church start to sing for God. This is totally in veracious. Why such an enthusiasm of all people at the same time? Why such a oneness? It is not made clear by Steven.I guess the only reason why this film has begotten any popularity is that it might strike people who are not into films that much. It cannot strike critical watchers unless those watchers are not critical enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story in which Ceile tells her life stories and her struggles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Color purple is story narrated by the main character(Celie). I gave this film a 5 out of 10 since i read the book. The book is more descriptive and offer more of a plot. In both the book and movie it shows Celie's struggle to achieve her goals. They showed the sexism, how women hood play a part in her success, and child abuse.Some important parts in the book aren't shown in the movie, in the book Alice Walker uses imagery which allowed me picture Nettie's explanation to Celie about things going on in Africa, which allows for deeper insight about Nettie's experience in Africa. Also Celie is abused by a man who she thought was her father and going through the same abuse from her husband Mr.____ , also known as Albert throughout the book and movie. One thing movie excluded was how Mr.___, tried to be reacquaint himself with Celie or how they thought Nettie died on the way back to America.Ramon Martinez-Period 7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Roots" are showing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sprawling, rambling Spielberg take on the American Negro experience in the early decades of the 20th Century, focusing, interestingly enough, almost entirely on the dynamics within the Negro community. As a result, the usually all-pervading outside influence of the white community is almost entirely absent. The film is beautifully shot with many imaginative tableaux imaginatively portrayed by the director and the pacing of the film is well-handled, even as the narrative is naturally episodic as it follows the course of the Whoopi Goldberg character's life. However it's impossible not to defend Spielberg against his old failing, sentimentality. Perhaps this is due to a striving to garner a more universal screen censor rating and thus wider distribution for the movie but certainly it seems that the incest, violence, lesbianism and rape scenes are watered down, unnecessarily in my view. This applies particularly in the depiction of Oprah Winfrey's character whose incarceration for speaking back to a white woman sees her go from a sassy mouthy individual to a damaged, passive maid, who even so, miraculously comes around in time for the uplifting conclusion of Goldberg's reunion with her detached family. To me this leaves too much to the imagination and over-stretches credulity and I could say the same also for the brutality rained down on her and her sister by firstly their abusive stepfather and even more so her "arranged" husband. There's also a plainly daft sub-evangelical meeting near the end at which everyone gets to clap hands, sing and generally get healed in front of the reverend father, almost offensive in its patronisation and stereotyping and with all the depth of a pop-video. Perhaps the scene was a sop to Quincy Jones, the film's musical director but even so it jars and is clearly misplaced. As for the acting, I found it only passable if often mannered and no one, for me, giving a particularly award-worthy performance. Comparisons with the slightly earlier hit TV mini-series "Roots" are obvious (there's even a duplication of the famous scene in the former where Whoopi Goldberg serves a drink to her cold father-in-law, replete with added spit). It's years since I avidly watched "Roots" and yet it has and will I'm sure stay longer in my memory than Spielberg's flawed would-be epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good moments and bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some very powerful moments in this movie, but they are overshadowed by the simplistic and cartoony moments. The acting is excellent and the tragic bits are quite tragic. I wish that the rest of the movie did those moments justice. Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover are excellent, even Oprah Winfrey does a reasonable job. I suppose that one of the reasons that this movie is so highly considered is that it was truly groundbreaking for much of white America. Given the context of the times the movie is very good , but intrinsically, just taken by itself, the movie is mediocre at best and quite stinky at worst. This movie won't stand the test of time. Centuries from now, when we are all a fairly homogenized people this movie will be laughable.</fullReview>

The reason I decided to watch this film was because of the comments by other people on this site.I'm so glad I did. Although I found some of the early parts of the film unpleasant because of the treatment of the young girls it was important to the story.An excellent film with both Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey showing what fine serious actors they can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Color Purple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Golden Globe nominated director Steven Spielberg, I remember watching about half of this film in college, but I didn't remember it well and never finished it, it was probably the first film I ever saw dominated by African American stars, so I watched it again. Basically, set in the Southern United States between the 1900's to mid-1930's, at seventeen years old Celie Harris (Desreta Jackson) has given birth to two children, after suffering abuse and rape from her father Pa Harris (Leonard Jackson), he has taken both of them away from her. Local farmer 'Mister' Albert Johnson (Danny Glover) wants to marry Celie's younger sister Nettie (Akosua Busia), but their father refuses to let her be wed, so he lets him have Celie. Mister neglects and abuses her as they live together, and he forces her to be his slave, cleaning the house, shaving him and making his meals, and then Nettie comes to live with the because of their father continuing to be incestuous. After failing to have his way with Nettie, Albert angrily forces her out and away, never to come back, leaving Celie distraught, but she promises to write to her until death, of course she never receives any. Years pass, Celie (introducing Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Whoopi Goldberg) is now a woman still forced to have a miserable life, but she keeps to cope with her routine, while her still sometimes abusive husband has a lover with jazz singer Shug Avery (Oscar nominated Margaret Avery). Celie and Shug do become friends though, and her confidence is lifted, they even begin an affair themselves, and she also finds a friendship with Sofia (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Oprah Winfrey) who is also beaten badly, but she fights against it. As the years have passed and no letters have come for her, Celie has believed that Nettie may be dead, but in fact she been living in Africa with missionaries, she and Shug find dozens of her letters hidden away. After almost slitting his throat, it is after a dinner, with a permanently disfigured Sofia attending, that Celie finally finds the strength to stand up to and leave Albert. She explains that she knows he kept the letters hidden from her, and she, Shug, Shug's husband Grady (Bennet Guillory) and Squeak (Commando's Rae Dawn Chong) - girlfriend of Albert's son Harpo (Willard E. Pugh), are coming with her. Finding a new peaceful life in Tennessee, and opening a new "one size fits all" clothes shop, Celie finds out that her father was not her biological father, but her stepfather, and she inherited the shop and a house from her real father. Albert meanwhile has let Celie's hateful words get to him, and he has realised he really was bad to her, guilt finally catches up with him, and unknown to his ex-wife, he pays his money to immigration to arrange a reunion with her sister. In the end Celie is tearful and overjoyed as she and Nettie are finally reunited, as well as Celie's two grown up children, son Adam (Peto Kinsaka) and daughter Olivia (Lelo Masamba), Albert smiles from a distance, and Shug smiles at him for doing the right thing, Celie and Nettie play their childhood hand clapping game as the sun sets. Also starring Dana Ivey as Miss Millie, Laurence Fishburne as Swain, John Patton Jr. as Preacher and Carl Anderson as Reverend Samuel. In her first screen performance Goldberg is superb as the leading character living through the years of abuse, standing up to it, and of course finding hope in the company of others, Glover is great as the nasty husband who beats and mistreats her, Avery does very well with her singing and being sympathetic, Winfrey - before her chat show began - is terrific as the also beaten wife who can defend herself, and the other cast members do well too. Spielberg is a good choice as director, because it was apparently a difficult novel to make into a mainstream film, but it is done without becoming too glossy, it is done with great dignity and aplomb, a most impressive period drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup, Best Music for Quincy Jones and many more, Best Song for "Miss Celie's Blues (Sister)", Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, and it was number 51 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot summary and "literary" criticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Color Purple, Steven Spielberg's 1985 movie of the same name is a tender depiction of an African-American woman's journey to selfhood in the midst of male and white oppression in the South of the 1930's. Whoopi Goldberg, in her first film role, plays the cowering Celie who has been sexually and emotionally abused by men as long as she can remember. After giving birth to two of her father's own children, she is married off to the violent and egoistic Albert (Danny Glover) who, when he is not beating or raping her, barely acknowledges her. Despite her animal-like status, Celie's relationships with women, first with her sister, and later with Shug Avery, Albert's glamorous singer mistress, progressively allow her to emerge as a fully expressed person. During the film's creation, Spielberg and Dutch screenwriter Menno Meypes' were wary of the characters degenerating into black stereotypes. Their precaution bears fruit in the acting which portrays the Walker's characters in all their unique depth. Even the brutally abusive Albert is no one-dimensional wife beater, and his character emerges as well-rounded as that of Celie's by the end. Despite its exceptional acting, Spielberg's first attempt at heavy dramatic material comes short of the literature it's based on. In Walker's book, Celie's unswervingly frank and seemingly monotone narration lend her suffering and joy poignancy. The film, lacking the instrument of narration, and not recreating it through framing, depicts her experiences in a kind of mish-mash that makes them lose some of their significance. The director's static composition and cutting, at times, alienates the viewer from the story. Often, it is only through Goldberg's brilliant portrayal do we come to an understanding of the meaning of events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg surprises me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Color Purple is one of Spielberg's best films. How amazing to see this movie from the same director of Return of the Jedi and Indiana Jones. He proves that he can actually make movies that matter, though he could conceivably have done a better job representing Alice Walker's masterpiece. Still, one has to question whether any white male could have done a better job telling a black woman's story.The story is a harshly beautiful account of the inner strength and spirit of a woman. Celie leads a rough life of drudgery, undervalue, and abuse until her husband's lover, Shug, shows her the way to love and to God. The two women share a poignant romance in the novel that is downplayed in the film, yet still holds much meaning. Instead of the passion felt in the novel, the movie transforms the relationship into more of an intellectual and spiritual journey. The two women unite against their struggles, ask questions, and find the answers, learn to love, and learn to cope. Shug gently teaches Celie about life's truths, and shows her `the color purple,' tangible evidence of God. Most importantly, though Shug teaches Celie to love herself, transforming her from a downtrodden workhorse to a self-sufficient, self-supporting, strong woman.Though the film stays somewhat true to the themes of the book, it does downplay the feminist undertones somewhat. Spielberg perhaps makes Celie's husband into a more believable person, and I certainly felt sympathy for him and saw where he was coming from, but it was sympathy that shouldn't have been there. The movie provided the men with excuses to treat the women the way they did-excuses that were not given to them in the novel. Spielberg undermines the destructive role of the men in the film, and in so doing, fails to maintain the feminist mood. The focus changes more from gender, the main focus of the book, to color in the movie.Still, overall, Spielberg surprised me with a wonderful film. The cinematography was beautiful, and the acting was fabulous. Whoopi Goldberg performed better than I've ever seen her, Danny Glover was incredible, and Oprah Winfrey was superb. I was able to completely see from each character's perspective better than in the novel. I wish I had been able to see the movie in 1985, when my perception of the actors had not yet been so pronounced. Seeing it now, when each has led a distinguished career, I did find it a little bit more difficult to separate the actors from their characters. This was definitely a new picture of Goldberg for me, but she did an excellent job. In spite of my preconceptions, I loved the film.I would give this movie a nine out of ten. I definitely recommend this movie, but watch it with a box of tissues, and nothing but waterproof mascara. No one can come way unchanged from such a touching, moving, and beautiful portrayal of one woman's resiliency, courage, and hope. It's a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually like Spielberg- I believe that Saving Private Ryan is one of the best-made movies EVER. But The Color Purple was such a heavy-handed attempt at greatness that many intelligent people will find themselves hating it. The worst thing about watching it is the parade of bloopers, pretty much a slip of logic and likelihood every five minutes or so.So she meets her son for the first time in 20 years. He emotionally says with tears in his eyes "mabubwa zumbe" or something like that. So he's had a month in a boat crossing from Africa just preparing for this moment and he couldn't learn how to say "Hi Mom!"? You can just see a heavy hand behind such scenes- "Ah, having him say something in Swahili will be DRAMATIC!" So logic be damned...Her husband hides 20 years of letters from her sister in Africa? Sure he doesn't destroy them, he just keeps them hidden. And sure her sister isn't smart enough to send some of them to other people in the town with a note to take them to her sister- NO, she just keeps sending them to the same place for 20 years even though no one answered! Never crossed her mind to send them, say, care of the local church, postman, relative, friend, bank, or Western Union Office. No, it just wouldn't be dramatic enough if the sister were minimally intelligent rather than just mindlessly persistent. Ah, LOVE says the director...And of course she could not just be one of the poor and disadvantaged Blacks, she must have some shock noble past- a "real father" who happened to be rich. Hadn't we done with that particular devise in 18th Century fiction? Does it lend anything to the story to make it so? Don't see this one unless you are drunk on sentiment or some strong alcohol- either one will help to numb your perception of this mindless pile of bloopers.Styrofoamdeity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this what passes for quality drama in America???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never read the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, but if it's anything even remotely like this film, I'm damned if I know how it even got nominated, particularly seeing as it was published in 1982. Obviously Spielberg got the entire thing wrong: I thought SCHINDLER'S LIST was extraordinarily well done, but his first experiment outside "pure entertainment" could be said to be a failure. Absolutely nothing happens in the film for the first 100 minutes - rather, things DO happen but not so you'd know. It's always difficult to adapt a sprawling novel to a film with limited runtime, but, to me, Spielberg glosses over some very important issues near the beginning: he could have expanded these (such as the father's influence on the two girls), and left out some fairly trivial scenes through the middle and towards the end. Again, I'm not sure how the book finished, but to climax in such a contrived "happy ending" is almost demeaning to the audience, who should have been sitting there for well over two hours absolutely engrossed in the on-screen drama. Things like this simply don't happen - Whoopie Goldberg's husband, for instance, changes his personality overnight and arranges a reunion between her and her sister. Where did they get this stuff from?!! I felt, as I was watching it, that I could never really relate to the characters: they were presented, but not explored. Noting that Spielberg, for all his great qualities, is still a white man, one can understand this: he never had any real feel for the oppression of the characters. The film, in fact, became more of a comedy - again, I'm not sure how the book was written but I'm sure that even if it did contain humorous notes throughout, the sheer tragedy of the situation would have come through loud and clear. All in all, I was disappointed with this film: a great director handling a (reputedly) great story, and it fell in a heap, with only an emotive happy ending that was any good. Rating: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's long. Very, very long. And, depressing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm on the one hand, quite surprised at the amount of attention that this film received back in the day, when it first came out. It's a piece, that some may call powerful, however I found it depressing, sad and way too long, to hold anyone's attention. It continued to drag on and on, and just when you think the story can't get any worse (depressing wise), it does. Whoopie Goldburg, leads the cast of a few notable actors, in this period piece, set in the south from the 1920's, through the 1950's. A young girl who is raped and impregnated at the beginning of the film, by her father twice, is forced to give both babies up for adoption at only 13 years old. Her sister, and she live alone with their father after their mother dies, and within only a few months after her second child is born, her father gives her away in marriage to a man, at least twenty years her senior. She is treated with nothing but beatings, slander and worthlessness. And, after her sister is literally ripped away from her at fourteen, she is for the rest of the film, alone with no one who loves or cares for her. For approximately three decades we follow her through her struggle, and reality that she must face as her life, day to day, and it is painful at times to realize, that this is someone's life. Her only comfort in life, is her husband's mistress, who she falls for herself, in her own confusion of who she is and who really loves her in the world. Although it was an interesting story and certainly poignant, and touching, I don't know if two and a half hours of it, is good for the mind. It really does bring you down, and is not uplifting in the least bit. The last two minutes of the film are certainly the best, and I enjoyed those two minutes the most of the whole film, however I don't know if I would recommend watching the whole movie just to get to those last two minutes.Whoopie Goldburg was excellent, and probably the best performance of her lifetime, and I can see why she was nominated, but not why she didn't receive the Oscar.Again, it's good, but not one that is up there on my "best list". But, if you wanna good cry by the end of the film, you might check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God Help Us All When Spielberg Feels Guilty About Something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well zip-a-dee-doo-dah, I kept expecting Uncle Remus to come bounding out of the bushes while watching Steven Spielberg's screen adaptation of the Alice Walker novel.In retrospect, Spielberg shouldn't have been let near this story with a ten-foot pole. His maudlin, well-intentioned approach to liberal message movies is completely at odds with Walker's spare, unsentimental storytelling. But, all in all, the results could have been much worse. Yes, Spielberg paints a painfully one-dimensional picture of poor blacks in the 1930s South. Yes, his way of exorcising his white guilt is to make the sole white character in the movie (played by Dana Ivey) a dithery twit, and his way of dealing with Walker's feminist elements is to make all of the male characters idiot buffoons. But the movie does have its good points, like a luminous performance from Whoopi Goldberg in the role of Celie, the ugly young woman who finds the beauty within herself, and an equally lovely performance from Margaret Avery, the sultry nightclub singer who helps Celie with her awakening. Oprah Winfrey huffs and puffs her way through a caricature of a performance as Sofia, the big black woman who goes around telling people what's what.Mr. Money Bags Spielberg ensures that the film has top-notch production values, and indeed it does look beautiful, and Quincy Jones provides a warm, pleasant score.Not the stunning film that could have been made from such good source material, but not a disaster either.Grade: B+</fullReview>
