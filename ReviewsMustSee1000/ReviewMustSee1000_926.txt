		<shortDescription>The Dark Knight Returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the Bat-films, Batman Returns is my favorite. This beautiful, dark, and funny film is one of Tim Burton's best work. Although it is much violent and darker, this is the Batman that creator Bob Kane envisioned many years ago. Michael Keaton reprises his role as the avenger of Gotham City. This time he's up against two deadly foes, Danny Devito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. With a great cast and film score by Danny Elfman, the movie takes us on an adventure as Batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take over Gotham City. Christopher Walken makes a great appearance as Max Shrek, a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve. But of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one that steals the show. With all of these components, you have a film that will blow you away. This is the reason why you go to the movies. It's got everything. It's really a shame that Tim Burton didn't get to direct the other sequels. If so I think the franchise would still be going strong today. Batman Returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film in the Bat-franchise, by far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a life-long mega Bat-fan, I thought that Batman Returns did the best job (of all four films) of portraying the Dark Knight. Sure, the 1989's Batman was great, but it was lopsided; it might as well have been called "Joker" considering the focus of the film. Batman Returns allowed us a better look at Batman/Bruce Wayne himself, who was little more than an imposing supporting cast member in the first film; I loved Jack Nicholson's over-the-top performance, but THIS fanboy wanted more of the Caped Crusader in the film. Batman Returns gave us that and more...we got Batman/Bruce character development, the AWESOME give-and-take between Batman and Catwoman (one of the strangest courtships in comics), and Burton even tossed us a little bit of fun, dark humor with Shreck and the Penguin. Everyone's performances maintained consistent characterizations that came across beautifully as both mad and tragic; Keaton was subtly psychotic, Pfeiffer was fatally seductive, Walken was deliciously megalomaniacal, and DeVito was unwaveringly grotesque. Everyone pulled off their characters with gusto and memorable appeal. Though not as dark and gritty as the first film, "Returns" captured the subtle madness that permeates Gotham City. When you compare "Returns" to the other Batman films, it is easy to see that it gives Batman's world the touch of underlying insanity (as only Burton can capture) that the first film lacked (where was the Joker's twisted sense of humor?) and the last two increasingly turned into the Three Stooges ("Chicks dig the car"!?!). Batman Returns excelled in that it was a dark, disturbingly insane portrait of Batman and Gotham City; a film that carefully balances on the fine line where and darkness and madness meet. For those movie lovers brave enough to try walking that line, I recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Darkest Knight of All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter/Xmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is wonderful. It's weird that Warner decided to release this as a summer film. It doesn't fit.But what's even weirder, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was aimed at families. An upper-class family throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio-phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent, a lonely secretary has a mental breakdown and dresses up in leather as a feline, and said grown-up mutant baby freak runs for political office. Not to mention the S&amp;M subtext that Tim Burton somehow managed to get away with. His eccentric visual style fits this film best, and is the height of his career, IMO.This and the Dark Knight are the only true live-action incarnations of the comic-book character. True, Batman Returns is not as grown-up and serious as the Dark Knight, but it's a helluva lot atmospheric, and I just prefer the oddball character development here than in TDK. I rate them both equally, but scoring points on different levels.Darker and more violent than the first movie, the sense of Gothic pathos reaches a new high. I was quite keen on Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (don't even get me started on George Clooney!), he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is great as Catwoman (much sexier and more 'realisticly' cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was so convincing as the Penguin that his scenes become disturbing to watch. Special mention must be made of Christopher Walken, who is brilliant as the spooky Max Shreck (if you think you recognise Chip Shrek it's none other than a very young Leatherface/Butterfinger).Danny Elfman's score is also even better than it was first time round. His powerful and engaging themes are way better than the dross that followed in the later Schumacher movies. This movie is the Batman phenomenon at its Zenith. Forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this. Christopher Nolan brought integrity back to the series, but before Schumacher destroyed it, Burton gave the original series integrity too.A great Xmas film, and my favorite Batman adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel worthy of an excellent movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, Batman Returns, is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original? With Batman Returns, it came pretty close! We have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as Batman and he's still awesome than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. As much as I love and is such an incredible actress Annette Benning, she couldn't have been Catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as The Penguin? He was just great and terrifying! Batman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, they are celebrating Christmas time with, Max Shrek played by a creepy Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, Selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the Penguin and the attempt to make him loved in Gotham. When she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats! But there is also another active villain, The Penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well?You'll have to see! Batman Returns is just as good as the original Batman, despite the first one remaining the true classic, this one still takes you for a ride. And come on, I mean we've got Michelle in leather! Her classic moment of just meeting Batman and The Penguin "Meow" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines, and sets! You'll have a blast! Trust me! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're the same.-Split, right down the centre. Don't you see? We're the same.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of us find art agreeable only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep inside us. That is, the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally relate to it. It was winter, here in Australia 1992 when I had seen Batman Returns at the cinemas and it blew me away. Both "me's". I was supposed to belong to an ideal, a standard, but at the same time I was living another life. Tim Burton was the first film maker to say its OK for a comic movie to be dark and to confess that darkness can happen to us all. After Tim Burton's Batman interpretations, many other dark comic book heroes and anti-heroes flooded the cinemas. Comic book folklore for decades had told of friendly, likable heroes with dashingly handsome smiles and magical superpowers who fly in the sky, and spun powerful webs from their wrists and wore red boots and had the strength of a locomotive. But what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents coldly executed in front of your very eyes? You snap. Somewhere in your psyche,your young tender psychological make up breaks apart. The only way such pain and hurt can be managed is to create an alternate persona.You make a promise. Your other self will be stronger, harness all the anger all the rage to use whatever means available to avenge the innocence of your parents onto that criminal, those criminals, any criminal. This is life seen through Bruce Wayne's eyes. Both pairs. The world he sees is dark, gloomy, and cold. Although he patrols the streets and people hear him cruise by, they don't rush out to get his autograph. He is their Saviour, not the winner of a personality contest. Batman Returns is about losers. Batman, for yet another Christmas, remains "the only lonely man beast in town". Bruce Wayne never gets to lawfully arrest the vile Max Shreck. The Penguin never gets to unleash his pain of being discarded by his parents onto the citizens of Gotham, and Selina Kyle is forever lost to being mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero doesn't get the girl- or cat.This movie delves into the desire in all of us to want so desperately to belong, to have a home, as expressed by Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot.The film brings out a need in all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by Selina Kyle , Oswald and of course Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another, we are told to be an ideal, to behave to a certain standard. That is until we finally snap. Only hope remains at the end of the movie as we see Catwoman rise towards the night sky. But come what may we all must wish good will towards all men and women. As for me , I cant say that I will reach a point where I will believe my problem with duality will be reconciled. But thats OK. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not only the best of the Batman films ,it is truly a stand out exceptionally fine masterpiece of storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre. I really don't. Dark -yes, bizarre - no. It i s sad and with lots of emotions, specially with the Pinguin's story. They say it has elements of S&amp;M but I really don't find anything of that sort except for Catwoman's whip.This movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) isn't just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and Pinguin... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by Danny DeVito). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he carries his costume well.You can totally see that it is a Tim Burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely ambitious, greatly directed superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton the man behind the original Batman film and Beetlejuice, brings the world the sequel to Batman, that exceeds the original in more ways than one. Firstly Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batmans enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads within the story and penguin works in the same way that the joker worked in the original. The sets are stunning and immaculate. Gotham city has so many dark alleyways that you could never know what's happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which at times seems to lapse and then not recover for while. Tim Burtons direction bring superhero films into a new realm. Beats all the superman films and the other Batman films by a mile. Though in terms of realisation the new Batman begins has a bite where this one lacks, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.*First review written by me at 16. Re-written at 21*Tim Burton has an interesting history in film, between the surreal Pee Wee's Big Adventure and mis-interpreted Alice in Wonderland, Tim Burton's career has gone from an artistic darkly comic director, to unimaginative copy-cat of his own work. I still stand by my original review in that this film is very cleverly directed, beautifully shot, with stunning towering set pieces, but a script that goes from cheesy melodrama, to cheap and nasty humour. Though with some terribly written scenes there are some, incredible ones. Mainly those concerning antagonists Catwoman and Penguin. One scene in particular concerning the two concocting a frivolous ploy to destroy batman is one that springs to mind. The acting is first class, Danny DeVito is deliciously theatrical and sinister, Michelle Pfeiffer relentlessly sexy and smooth. Since my original review Dark Knight was released. Unfortunately for Burton I retract my youthful statement of his originality over Nolan. Dark Knight surpasses Batman Returns and almost eclipses its existence, but this instalment still has great merit and will stand out as one of the greatest superhero films, not to mention cementing Batman as the greatest superhero franchise ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still my favorite Batman movie but wait... let me tell you why!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've enjoyed this movie ever since I was a kid and I still do. I also liked Batman forever back then but the real difference is that THIS movie didn't date when I grew up. I did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like: 'Hhmm... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did they get those tomatoes from?' Then I thought: 'who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway!'The original Tim Burton Batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and I didn't like all the actors. This movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast, a more Gothic style and no involvement of Prince. Nowadays, many fans of the Christopher Nolan movies dislike Burton claiming that the Nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics. I don't think this is entirely true: -There has never been an adaptation of the original concept of Batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -Batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's (and a bit with Batman &amp; Robin). A director is free to choose what kind of Batman he's going to portray as long if it's good.My opinion: Batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. Burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea.I just recently watched the Nolan movies and I love those ones as well (especially The Dark Knight). There's simply something about this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so, he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of Batman. That's a bit too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of Batman. The Burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere.My conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the Nolan with the Burton movies. They're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. My respect is for both directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer force of style largely transcends the flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to be able to give this film a 10. I've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action Batman films to date (and maybe it still will be--I have yet to watch the Schumacher films again). I'm also starting to become concerned about whether I'm somehow subconsciously being contrarian. You see, I always liked the Schumacher films. As far as I can remember, they were either 9s or 10s to me. But the conventional wisdom is that the two Tim Burton directed films are far superior. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time around--I ended up giving it a 7--and apologize as I might, I just couldn't help feel that Batman Returns just has too many small direction, plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10.But Burton _almost_ trumps the problems with sheer force of style, and even though there are a lot of small flaws, Batman Returns is still a great film, especially if you're a Burton fan, as Batman Returns has just as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as it does with anything else in the Batman universe.The film begins strongly, with the Cobblepots having a baby. We see their dismay--people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later, they have the baby in a small cage. Finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the Gotham City River. The baby ends up becoming Batman villain The Penguin (Danny DeVito).Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the film's "evil capitalist", comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He is planning on duping Gotham City in various ways, and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the timid Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is rescued by cats, becoming Catwoman.While all of this is going on, The Penguin, who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous, begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy, despite having less than benevolent, ulterior motives.Before re-watching Burton's Batman films this time, I didn't remember just how little the films are about Batman (Michael Keaton). It's almost as if Burton didn't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the villains, especially The Penguin. Batman doesn't appear very often, especially in the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often, we're watching him watching The Penguin.Although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw, I can't say that I do, even if I'd like to know more about Batman and follow his story more. The villains' stories are interesting, too, and as an "origin story" for two major Batman villains, Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of plot.However, there are some character problems that I do count as a flaw. The Penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding, but even though they're frequently on screen, we never get to learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) available, with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just doesn't have the space to use them.For that matter, he hardly has space to explore Catwoman. The film plays as if Catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as The Penguin, but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long. So the bulk of the Catwoman scenes had to be excised. Of course, all of this barely leaves any room for Batman. Burton has Batman turn very dark in the public's eye in this film, and unusually, he never bothers to resolve this. As far as we know, at the end, Gothamites still think that Batman is a murdering lunatic. That's an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next.As for the script, although there are minor problems including some non-sequiturs and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters, it's clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. A lot of the dialogue is pun-oriented, but often this is fairly subtle and/or complex (of course, sometimes it is very blatant or transparent, too). It helps to look at Batman Returns as a more "poetic" film, as I believe was the intention. This also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions--plenty of odd character actions, including from minor characters, are done in service of a general mood or style, and that style works very well."Dark" is the easiest way to sum up Batman Returns in a word, and whether that's a positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I love dark. So for me, Burton's style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script. In many ways, Batman Returns is like an insane, campy horror film, with beautifully eerie production design. Like Batman, Burton is still making many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there's still a slight Star Wars reference), he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) (including that "Max Schreck" was the name of the actor who played the Dracula-like character there), Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal, dark edge to it) and zombie films--made most explicit in The Penguin's final scene.In terms of visuals and general atmosphere--and that includes the general "feel" of the story, the characters and so on--this couldn't be a stronger 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very rarely do movie sequels ever match the grandeur of the originals. BATMAN RETURNS however, does so with gusto. The sequel to 1989's BATMAN, BATMAN RETURNS neither milks the success of the first movie nor totally disregards it; it's a wonderful sequel and a spectacular movie in its own right. There's something for everyone in this movie - humor, high drama, plenty of action, and lots of cool things to look at. Of course, viewers have to get around Tim Burton's morbid and sometimes offensive sense of humor, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem in this era of SOUTH PARK and THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. While the movie has many great moments, it also has its flaws. The plot seems rushed, stitched together. Danny DeVito tries his best as the Penguin but doesn't quite pull it off. Christopher Walken appears as a secondary bad guy, but his performance is lackluster compared to the others. And many of the action sequences, though breathtaking, seemed forced and are occasionally absurd. All that aside, there's all kinds of surprises in this movie - smart humor and dialogue, characters you can't help but love, lots of satire (Homer's Iliad, CITIZEN KANE, and the American political scene are all lampooned), and many memorable scenes that only serve as a testament to Burton's colorful imagination. I hope to get this movie on DVD, where I can enjoy it on my big screen TV in all its glory. Not exactly the best Batman film ever, but still a fascinating movie to watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of all the Batmans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel proves that Tim Burton was for all intents and purposes THE best choice to ever direct a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman taking on three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (the slinky Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the superb Christopher Walken).Perhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. The cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is DeVito as the multi-layered Penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances.I do not hesitate to say that "Batman Returns" is my favorite of all the Batmans released (sorry, Dark Knight fans). If you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action, then please check out this badly underrated film. If nothing else, it's at least the best film Tim Burton has ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest of the Batman Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been said that Batman Begins in the first Batman movie to "get it right" but I think that's a horrible overstatement, for I think the new Batman film, although greater that Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, pales compared to Tim Burton's classics, with this one being the best of the five. The darkness is beautiful, as is the music and scenery, creating a Gotham City cloaked in mystery, unlike Batman Begins, where Gotham City is a normal-looking city. The villains are terrific in this movie. You literally can't take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman. I applaud Tim Burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak, rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old Batman TV show. In Batman Begins we have the scarecrow, whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman. The film doesn't need to focus only on Batman, because we already know his story, and it is the villains who we are exploring and trying to figure out, and they are the ones who create the plot, with the penguin running for mayor and seeking revenge for his parents' desertion by killing the first born sons of Gotham, a task he fails. Danny Devito gives the finest performance ever by a superhero villain in any film, surpassing even Nicholson's joker. The closing scene where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful. It's a tragedy that Tim Burton wasn't allowed to complete his trilogy, since Warner Bros., interesting in marketing appeal, wanted to "lighten" the Batman movies up. And they got their wish...unfortunately. Tim Burton planned on directing the third film, using the Riddler as the villain, with no Two-Face and Robin to mess it up, and I'm sure Michael Keaton would've signed on. So this is the last great Batman Film. Batman Begins is dark, but boring, tedious, ordinary, filled with lackluster villains, and a playboy Bruce Wayne. A decent Batman film, but the best Batman film ever? Never. Batman Returns holds that crown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smitten with a Whip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what is 'Batman Returns', anyway?It was marketed as an action film, and many people who've seen it seem to think that they've watched an action film - but really, there isn't that much action, and Tim Burton barely seems interested in it.People often align it with the 'grittier' superhero comics of the late eighties, but honestly, if you've read 'The Dark Knight Returns', that seems just a little absurd; Burton's excessive imaginings have more in common with the day-glo sixties TV series (the Penguin drives around in a giant plastic duck, for goodness' sake).Burton's style is often described as Gothic, and that's a little closer to what we see on screen; the Penguin - deformed, malign, with a tangled history and a subterranean lair - is a Gothic menace dressed up in more respectable Dickensian clothes - Udolfo masquerading as Uriah Heep. But what of Catwoman? She may be raised from the dead, but that PVC catsuit is decidedly Twentieth Century, and her alter ego Selina Kyle's world is all boardrooms and apartments - reminiscent of a 1930s romantic comedy.And then it clicks. The smart but downtrodden secretary romanced by a lonely millionaire? The ensuing complications caused by deception and disguise? 'Batman Returns' is, quite clearly, a romantic comedy in the old Hollywood style, filtered through Burton's S&amp;M dungeon sensibilities. It has more in common with 'The Hudsucker Proxy' (including expressionist sets) than it does with other superhero films. Like many a romantic comedy, it centres around the make-over of the heroine; not from ugly duckling to swan, but from doormat to dominatrix. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her (often remarkable) career; she's iconically sexy as Catwoman (poor Halle Berry never had a prayer), playful and vindictive, memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body. In retrospect, though, it's her scenes as Selina that impress; almost every one of them is a little comic gem, particularly the glimpse we get of her lonely home life. It's a delicately balanced tragicomic performance, and it's in these scenes that the film really sparks to life. Nothing moves me quite like Selina and Bruce Wayne dancing under the mistletoe to Siouxsie and the Banshees, a gun held between them, simultaneously empowered and trapped by their alter egos, doomed to conflict. Forget the easy sentimentality of 'Big Fish' or the gossamer emotions of 'Edward Scissorhands' - this is the most heartfelt scene in all of Burton's films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, insanity, self-loathing and not a little wit, all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors - particularly Pfeiffer. Elsewhere, Danny de Vito almost matches her, finding the wounded dignity buried beneath those truly repellent long-johns. The upper-crust villain of the comics is revealed to be nothing more than a sham; Burton's Penguin is a feral creature subjected to his own, Eliza Doolittle-style make-over (almost literally an 'ugly duckling'). It's Burton's most radical - and funniest - reinvention. Christopher Walken's Max Schreck completes a perfect triptych of villains, sliding between casual charm and blank-eyed psychosis with unnerving ease (and is it just me, or does his company's logo bring to mind Mickey Mouse? Perhaps we should ask former Disney animator Burton).Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' - a real action film - has been much praised as the first film to do justice to Batman; I admire Nolan's film, but it would be a pity if it were allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of My Favourite Batman Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen "The Dark Knight Rises", I have to say that "Batman Returns" is superior in several ways: - Anne Hathaway's catwoman (or whatever she was supposed to be in TDKR), simply cannot compare to Michelle Pfeiffer's. The former is just one-dimensional, lame and unconvincing.- "Batman Returns" manages to capture the essence of Gotham City -- the atmosphere is magnificently portrayed (dreary, dark, depressing), which is more than I can say for TDKR, which tries very hard, but fails.- I did kind of enjoy Bane in TDKR, but his character was severely under-developed and there was not much of a story behind the whole residing-in-the-sewers-for-years stuff. The Penguin in "Batman Returns" is well explained, the story revolves around the sewers, and a lot of the action takes places there.- The costumes / the makeup alone are reason enough to see "Batman Returns" -- amazingly good! In TDKR, there's ABSOLUTELY nothing -- everyone (including Batman) look like they're wearing cheaply-made, lame Halloween costumes from one of those 1$ stores.- The lead characters are well-developed and colourful -- even the supporting/minor characters. In TDKR, they are one-dimensional, bland, mostly unlikeable, and you just don't care for them much.I liked Christian Bale's Batman a bit better than Keaton's, though. The worst one, without a doubt, was Clooney's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the question I kept asking myself after I finished watching this film. I know I'll be stepping on many peoples' toes by writing this review. I know a lot of people loved this film when it was released in '92, and I know a lot of people still love the film to this day. However, I'd like to ask all those people to keep an open mind, and to try to see this from my perspective. I never liked this movie! Not even after I first saw it. I wanna put all of you in my shoes: Your eight years old, Batman comes out, you go see it, and afterwords, you're blown away by its sheer greatness. Shortly after, a sequel is announced, and you're ecstatic! You can't wait for it, you expect it to be all that the previous film was and more, then, a few years pass, the film comes out, you see it, and its a complete dud! That's exactly how I felt when I saw Batman Returns. Batman Returns didn't even feel like it was in the same series as Batman! Where as Batman was exciting and fun, Batman Returns was dreary and depressing. None of the villains were charismatic, or fun to watch like Nicholson's Joker, they were all one dimensional and had no motivations! Keaton still plays Batman fairly well, but nothing at all is done with his Bruce Wayne persona. Which in and of itself, presents a huge problem when a semi love interest is interjected into the film. As with Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale, Michelle Pfeiffer does a decent job with what she's given, but that's the problem with her character. You don't know what kind of person Selina Kyle really is, and we have no idea what her agenda is as Catwoman. Why does she want Penguin to frame Batman? We don't know and we never find out. The Biggest problem of the film however, is Danny Devito as The Penguin. Aside from the fact that he rides around in a motorized rubber duck, and that the image of his army of rocket pack penguins is the most unintentionally hilarious thing I've ever seen, The Penguin has to be one of the most poorly done comic book villains ever! The problem is, that The Penguin is done in such an inconsistent way. One minute Tim Burton wants us all to feel sorry for him, and then the next, he wants us all to detest him as the evil villain. As for my experience with the film: It didn't leave me in a good mood or hungry for more, as the first film did. It left me feeling dreary, sick, and empty. For me, going from Batman to Batman Returns felt like chasing Champagne with sewer water. The first drink was great, but the second just left a bad taste in my mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's Batman Returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people say Batman Returns is better than the first Batman movie by Tim Burton because it's darker with eerie music, cinematography and set design and more violent with more explosions and action sequences. Now I wouldn't say it's better than the original because the original had Batman's arch-nemesis, the Joker. But Batman Returns is definitely a very good sequel.One of the things I love about this sequel is that it has not just one, but three villains: Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and even a character who wasn't even in the comics, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). And all three of them do fantastic. And of course, Michael Keaton is amazing as Batman.I think this movie has a better and more mature plot because it has more to do with crime and conspiracy and the characters (particularly the villains) work very well together. Like the Penguin blackmails corrupt, business tycoon Max Shreck into helping him become part of Gotham City. And later the two of them become partners in crime when Penguin goes up for election for mayor of Gotham so Shreck can continue his schemes. Then later Penguin and Catwoman work together to bring down Batman. And Penguin wants to get revenge on his parents for abandoning him as a baby by kidnapping all the first-born sons in Gotham and killing them.Yet Batman manages to foil Max Shreck and Penguin's plans to take over Gotham, or worse, destroy Gotham. While also confronting his emotions for Selina Kyle/Catwoman, which makes this movie more sensitive.If only Warner Bros. hadn't got rid of Tim Burton, we probably wouldn't have the infamous Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin by Joel Schumacher. Oh well, at least we still have Christopher Nolan to thank for restoring the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark and Misunderstood Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who in Hollywood is more misunderstood than Tim Burton? Well, no one. The Batman films over the years have been plagued by one and only one thing...no, not Joel Schumacher...they are called Studio Heads. But enough of that. The fact is, this movie was not advertised, nor made to be a fan friendly or even kid friendly movie. After the success of "Batman", a sequel was inevitable. In order to lure Burton back into directing, the "Powers that Be" told Burton that it could be an "all Burton film". This is very rare for a director to get in these money grabbing days. With all the politics and misunderstandings of the finished product aside, the film "Batman Returns" provides a dark, intense, and very exciting interpretation of "Batman" on screen. "Returns" shows us three characters, which all have dual identities. One is a creature of the night, stopping ruthless and petty criminals in every alley way and rooftop, and is also a tortured billionaire industrialist with the guilt of is parents death haunting him. There is also a purrr-fect enemy, draped in skin tight vinyl and carries a whip, with vengeance on the mind, and was once a push over secretary who was obviously pushed over one too many times. Finally there is the Penguin, a freakish and vile figure who was abandoned by his parents and now wishes for the respect that has avoided him all his life, and as Oswald Cobblepot, he gains the respect of the city in order to become its mayor. With these three characters, all you can get is an epic Tim Burton masterpiece, and that is what it became.After discovering their first born as a freakishly deformed monster, the Cobblepots decide to rid themselves of this black sheep. Almost thirty years later, the lost Cobblepot son has become the Penguin man in the sewer, who has become just as much a myth in Gotham City as the legend of Big Foot. After the Tree lighting ceremony in Gotham only weeks before Christmas, all hell breaks loose. Within one night, the evil industrialist Max Schrek (Christopher Walken) is kidnapped by the Penguin (Danny DeVito), and blackmailed into helping him re-emerge into Gotham society to finally earn the respect that he so thirsts after. Following this, Shreck drops his nobody assistant, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), out of his department store window after she discovers his Power Plant operation is just a scheme to suck what's left of power out of the city. Little does Shreck know, this nobody assistant survived, and is going to turn the tables on him ten fold as Catwoman, donning the skin tight vinyl black outfit and cracking a dangerously long whip. As Shreck helps the Penguin become Gotham's new golden boy, Oswald Cobblepot, he also uses Oswald to challenge the Mayor (Michael Murphy) into a recall election. If this happens, Shrek's Power Plant is secured. Now it is up to Batman (Michael Keaton) to stop these three super-villains from carrying out there plans. It is just a question now to whether Bruce will be able to balance his love for Selina and his duty as Batman to bring her, Oswald, and Shreck to justice.The movie's performances, special effects, costumes, amazing sets, and of course make-up design make this movie great. Michael Keaton returns (Forgive the pun) as the dark knight. Keaton gave us a dark complexity to the tortured soul of Bruce Wayne in Batman 1, and he carries that into this film, but in a much different way. His complexity in this film has more to do with his lack of a real life. In the first time we see him in the movie, he is sitting down in his study, doing absolutely nothing, until the Bat signal shines through his home, in which he then, through his eyes and body movement, comes to life. Through his attraction to Selina, he is naturally hoping for he and his equal to possibly have more of a "happy ending" to their story. Michelle Pfeiffer is actually, in my opinion, more unrecognizable than Danny DeVito. I say this only because in the beginning, we are introduced to this bumbling and oblivious secretary, and then she becomes a determined, sexy, and very aggressive creature of the night. Pfeiffer's brilliance in her dual roles, her body language, her change in voice, and overall sex appeal make this Catwoman probably the best ever seen projected from the comic book legend. The scene where Bruce and Selina are the only ones not wearing costumes at the costume ball, with the haunting song "Face to Face" echoing in the background, is truly brilliant. Now for Danny DeVito. This is probably my absolute favorite Danny DeVito performance. While his make-up says enough, its DeVito chewing through the make-up, the scenery, and most of the other actors to get his portrayal of the tortured, deformed, vile, and ingenious villain that is the Penguin, off. In many ways, he can make you feel sorry for him, and in other ways, he can make you loathe and detest his very existence. A true comic-book/movie villain through and through. Finally for the great Christopher Walken. Walken was cast as a character that does not appear in the Batman comic-book universe. He is described as a rich, handsome, but diabolical businessman, who will suck the life out of anything he touches (much like a vampire, in which the actor Max Schreck in real life portrayed the vampire in the famous film "Nosferatu"). Shreck in many ways is the personification of Gotham City, as he says "I' am the light of this city. And I' am its mean, twisted soul." Walken, in a sense, is more horrific than the Penguin. Shreck on the outside is a wealthy and respectable man, while on the inside, is more a horrific beast than the Penguin could ever be. An amazing and operatic Tim Burton masterpiece all the way though.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel almost as impressive as its predecessor. An all time Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that was good about the original Batman is back in The second movie. This is a fantastic film with top notch performances, stage design,atmosphere,music,and character development. I adore this movie almost as much as the original. I thought that soundtrack from Danny Elfman was even better this time around that it was in the original. He has outdone himself. Its intense, frightening, bittersweet, tragic and out of this world! Its quite a magnificent feat to behold. Michael Keaton is brilliant as The Caped Crusader. He is a total Badass and doesn't seem to be afraid of anything. He is a quiet intellectual who can work his way out of problems that no one else could even dream of. He gets himself into trouble in this movie and we are reminded that Batman is still a human like the rest of his and is not invulnerable. The film's art direction is just as dark as it was in Batman but this time its much more Gothic and Halloween like. This film's tone shifts quite a lot. It is quite a mouthful but never becomes crowded or overbearing. There are moments when the film is very somber and bittersweet and their are moments when the film is bizarre and disturbing. All of these moments are handled brilliantly in the film and so are the characters. This was an incredible important film in Batman cinema history. It introduced the two villain per film formula that every Batman film proceeding this would Imitate. To say that Michelle Pfieffer played Catwoman would be almost rhetorical and perhaps the understatement of the century. She was The Freaking Catwoman! We meet Selina Kyle before she becomes cat-woman. This film does a masterful job of making audience understand the character and her pain and Isolation. Her transformation from Mousy Secretary to fierce feline is Brilliant, memorizing, and Unforgettable. The scene when Selina Kyle trashes her apartment is heartbreaking yet we also feel a catharsis and a sense of release with her. The scene is unnerving and hard to watch but it makes perfect sense for the character. When She becomes Catowmen she is sexy, and frankly quite scary. I absolutely loved Pfieffer's cat-woman. She keeps you on your toes the entire ride and it is a riot to watch her go at it with Batman or embark on random rampages. I thought Danny Devito gave a performance of a lifetime as The Penguin. His performance will most likely never be rivaled or surpassed. He was an animal. He scared the daylights out of me as a child when He bite that man's nose off. I loved every line of dialog that came out of his mouth. He was truly menacing and disappeared into the character. The makeup for The Penguin was freaking awesome. The character's story was classic and beautifully told in a way that I have never seen before. Its easily the best role that I have ever seen Danny Devito in. Christopher Walken was great as Max Schrek. A power hungry bully that wants to control all of Gotham's energy with a power-plant that will actually steal power from Gotham. This movie is a rare Gem that will delight and memorize audiences for years to come. Due to its impeccable writing, excellent characters and haunting atmosphere. It is an absolute Marvel of a film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good Batman movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, the tone of the movie makes it one that is good (albeit a bit dark) to watch around the holidays. This is the time of year for the second Batman film, although I don't think the holiday cheer is spread around to all. However, I felt cheerful, even though it is July, because this movie was just as good as the first one.Michael Keaton is back as Batman and although at first I wasn't sure what I felt about the guy. But honestly, he is quite charming, quite attractive and quite likable as Batman. He can woo on a dime, his subtle humour can be found with many funny lines, and his Batman is a quiet, not-talkative, brooding type of Batman. He does it really well.Also, no matter who plays Batman, he will always remain the hottest superhero to grace the screen.The other memorable roles include Michelle Pfeiffer, who played Catwoman as such a vixen, and although she was on the wrong side, you couldn't help but like not only her but her relationship with Bruce/Batman (and/or Keaton). Their chemistry was undeniable. It's unfortunate we don't see it play out (Since Catwoman is not in the next one). Danny Devito played an awesome although largely grotesque (did you see his outfit? yarg) Penguin, and the makeup used to turn him unrecognizable was very well done (seeing as there was no reliance on special effects and whatnot). Finally, Christopher Walken also played his role well seeing as it varied incredibly from his usual nutty roles in other films. Well done.A great film, whether watched at Christmastime or not!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is by far one of the worst super hero films ever, it's on par with Superman 4. Bruce Wayne just sits in his study waiting for the Bat Signal to call him (and what the heck is up with all those reflectors mounted on Wayne Manor? I guess the next time the house needs a roof repair the secrets out). Tim Burton has a way of making humanity look disgusting and he want way over the top in this stink fest. Here are some of the major issues. Batman punches through the floorboards of the almost indestructible Batmobile. He easily rips through his bullet proof outfit to, yet again, reveal his secret identity (and notice the lack of black eye makeup). I don't know what to say about the penguins other than WTF?!?! And a secretary who gets thrown out of a window, gets bitten by cats, and suddenly has the ability to perform acrobatics, is a great fighter, and is a master with a bull whip. This movie was supposed to come out at Christmas time, but in need of serious reediting in order to make it look like something beyond the level of a 3rd grader with a camcorder it was pushed to the following summer. They should have worked a little harder. This movie was not a Batman movie. It was Tim Burton fixing something that was never broken. Thank God Batman Begins came out to show the world how Batman should be done. Realistically and serious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Re watching Batman Returns, I realized just how weird this film is and how mixed my feelings are towards it. We all said at the time this was the dark one, the one that made them turn a corner and change things to be more 'kid friendly' in the following films. And we all know how well THAT turned out, don't we? I remember loving it as a kid (Why did my parents allow me to watch this film filled with sexual innuendos and violent death scenes?) But now, well, it's not a bad film, I refuse to dismiss something that so many people put a lot of effort into, and there are things I love about it. I have always said, and I still maintain that Michael Keaton is the best cinematic Bruce Wayne, but it's a shame that he's barely in the film, just like Burton's first Batman film, the villains are given far more screen time. The plan of the villain, sorry, the back-up plan of the villain is ridiculous. Penguins in the sewers? Really? Michelle Pfeiffer is the highlight of the film, without her I wouldn't like anything really. Danny DeVito gives a great performance, but if they were trying to make his character sympathetic, they failed miserably. He just comes across as a grotesque, one-note monster. Still my favorite of Burton's Batman films, but considering how much I don't like the first film, that's not saying much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Focus On The Villains Than Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a film directed by Tim Burton. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, it is a sequel to 1989's Batman. Michael Keaton reprises the title role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, Pat Hingle returns as Commissioner Gordon, and Michael Gough returns as Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth. The film introduces the characters of Max Shreck,portrayed by Christopher Walken, a megalomaniac business tycoon who teams up with the deformed and deranged Penguin,played by Danny DeVito, to take over Gotham City, as well as the character of Catwoman,played by Michelle Pfeiffer, a wronged secretary named Selina Kyle with mixed motives regarding the Dark Knight.In this film, the Caped Crusader is up against the Penguin, the hideously deformed scion of a wealthy Gotham City family. The Penguin plots with evil businessman Max Schreck to become mayor and then turn Gotham into a cathedral of crime. Upon overhearing these plans, Schreck's mousy secretary Selena Kyle is tossed from a high-rise window by her boss. Rescued by a covey of kittens, Selena transforms into the leather-clad Catwoman. In this guise, she teams with the Penguin and Schreck to divvy up their ill-gotten gains and help discredit Batman-but she also has her own scores to settle.This is less of a sequel than reworking of the first film's themes, with greater attention paid to the villains and more visually inventive set pieces, albeit contained in a less coherent work.Also,the villains' stories put Batman out of the picture and the focus of the movie.But nevertheless,this is an indirect reason why the movie worth watching. Also,the flawless casting of Danny DeVito as The Penguin and Christopher Walken as Max Schreck make the sequel better than the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unconventional and sublime dark opera but the villains outshine the hero!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panned by some, lauded over by other Tim Burton's take on Bob Kane's classic, costumed vigilante although commercially successful was always going to leave cinema audiences divided. While not adhering entirely to the moral sensibilities of the Dark Knight which began with 1989's mediocre "Batman" It's with some amount of conviction that I truly believe that with his 1992 follow up "Batman Returns" Burton was afforded more artistic Carte-Blanche. Both with the narrative and stylistic content of the picture. Already having vindicated his clout as an inventive and visually captivating force to be reckoned in the minds of others after "Edward Scissorhands" critical and commercial success. BR for me personally boasted a movie with a more solidly structured screenplay, a more aesthetically appealing Gotham City and decidedly more intriguing interplay between the primary characters. The sequel this times took it's cue from two rather than one antagonist from the comics rogue gallery being the apparent choices. The Penguin (Danny Devito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). 35 years before the main events of the film take place, a millionaire husband whose surname is Cobblepot awaits the birth of his first child. What should be a day of extreme joy for he and his wife turns to disappointed bitterness when instead of a regular, cutesy baby they are presented with what they perceive to be a deformed mutant. Cruelly abandoning their tragic offspring, whose name is Oswald in to a canal. The current takes him to the sewers where he is discovered by Penguins from a nearby Circus. Leap ahead to the present and Gotham City is being terrorised by a gang of grim, colourful crooks calling themselves the Red Triangle Gang. Led by Oswald who has grown in to a twisted, repugnant villain they act upon his orders, the purpose of which is to forward his own mysterious agenda. Meanwhile dowdy secretary Selina Kyle, employed by millionaire industrialist Max Schreck is bullied and put upon by her arrogant, overbearing boss. A man who mocks her in front of not only the Mayor of Gotham but fellow businessmen. Then one fateful night a chance discovery of illegal activities approved by Shreck to drain the city of it's electrical resources via his own power station. Pushed out several storeys up from his office by her murderous employer she is left for dead only to be granted nine lives and resurrected by stray cats who she was kind enough to feed. Filled with rage and a determination to avenge herself upon Shreck she becomes the costumed, vengeful anarchist Catwoman! Only one man stands in the way of each wronged criminals way and that is Gotham City's most dedicated defender, Millionaire Bruce Wayne aka. Batman (Michael Keaton)It would be inaccurate to label "Batman Returns" as a simple comic-book, action movie and while it's basic premise sprung forth from the pages of DC Comics it was more a dark, Gothic opera with complex characters where the basic principals of good and evil aren't so black and white! Yes, there are elaborate, fun action sequences but they took a back seat to the more predominantly rich and beguiling personalities on display. Danny Devito is outstanding as the figurative Penguin of the movie. A man not only repellent on the outside but within. A sleazy, corrupt yet pitiful figure who is nicely mirrored by the conniving Max Shrek played here with chilling coolness by Christopher Walken. An actor who has cornered the market in such roles. Also there is a lop-sided comparison of sorts between he and the movies prime protagonist. While Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter-ego has been raised lovingly and given the best upbringing his parents could afford and was a regular, healthy and content child before his progenitors tragic demise. Oswald was cast away by his parents and forced to to grow up as a side-show freak in a circus. But while Bruce has not the comfort of letting rage cloud him fully with his personal moral duty to his parents memory making his Gotham's maverick champion. He is a man cast-away in to practical loneliness with only his loyal butler Alfred to be of any companionship or counsel. But in Selina Kyle/Catwoman he finds hope and a dangerous adversary, a veritable contraction in terms and played with tenacious cunning and seductive ice-coolness by Michelle Pfieffer in one of her most penetrating, flawless performances to date! Rather than a villain she is more a tragic, feminist anti-hero of sorts. Cracking her whip for all those women that have wronged been wronged and with Max Shreck in her sights she strives to strike a blow in not her but also their name.Burton really casts his magic with the method in which he ingeniously interweaves the various strands of the stories together with only Catwoman and The Penguin being on screen fairly fairly briefly together. But this doesn't impact on the movie as a whole although lamentably Michael Keaton as fine as he is, is left to take more a back-seat to his co-stars more "interesting" rogues. Although there is a some focus on Wayne and insight to the man and his unconventional lifestyle it plays second fiddle to the "bad guys". Elaborate set-pieces which include Batman's first on-screen encounter with the Red Triangle Gang to a tense scene where his Batmobile is fitted with a device that allows the Penguin to take control of it. Sending it careering through the Streets of Gotham City with Batman at the wheel. It ultimately can't rescue it from becoming the villains movie. A solid effort and somewhat removed from the atypical big budget blockbusters, BR was and is in my mind a strong, crowd-pleasing popcorn movie. Although hardly achieving greatness and not a classic by any means it further went to solidify Burtons reputation in Hollywood. You'll either love it or hate it but you can't deny it's visual creativity and sumptuousness!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A The heart thumping sequel to the original. My personal favorite of the original series of films. Tim Burton returns to direct a truly great sequel, once more giving us a darkly lit and truly different world. Some hash it for the realism?f*ck you!! It's Batman, the super hero genre in general. Anyways, Danny Elfman reprises his role as the tour de force composer , delivering a score that sounds similar to his work on "Edward Scissorhands" and "Nightmare Before Christmas". I was thrilled to listen to it, bringing every moment in the film to its utmost sharpness.Michael Keaton returns (no pun intended) and once again plays the role perfectly. While Vicki Vale may be gone, Bruce gets to tangle with Michelle Pfeiffer. Her performance was insane, sexy and full of zest she constantly brung to the screen. Did Danny DeVito really measure up to Jack Nicholson? Hel yeah! This is truly how Bob Kane would have brought this character to life. DeVito captures the character quite well, both comically and with a sense of rage. Michael Gough is back as well, just another plus. Christopher Walken is our sleazy business man, extraordinarily well done. It's a visual style and a story line only Tim Burton could bring together so well. Keep in mind there are a lot of funny lines in this flick, but it never downplays the seriousness of it all. The mood of the film, along with a lot of the story is incredibly dark, malicious, and even somewhat disturbing. It's one of the aspects that really draw me to this film.A not so light hearted, well done sequel. The effects and fight scenes are as well done as the rest of the film and original. I had always wished Burton had done the other two sequels. I can only imagine how much greater they'd be, and the marks they could have left on film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this 'Batman' film such a memorable one is it's excellent plot and script. The actions scenes are amazing and very intense.Burce Wayne/Batman never been so well written and just keeps you coming back for more. The part of when Selina becomes; metamorphoses into Catwoman is a bit of a mystery to some people, but if you give it enough thought you'll understand why it looked the way it did. Ozwalt Cobblepott/Penguin is somewhat sympathetic in the beginning of the film when you see how rejected he was by his parents, but sadly is nothing but pure evil through out the film. Max Shreck is a tepid, deceptive, and manipulative fiend who you just wish you can punch the lights out of badly.Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman/Burce Wayne was flawless and spot on. Michelle Pheiffer's role as Selina Kyle/Catwoman was incredible, luscious, and compelling to watch. Danny Devito as Ozwalt Cobblepott/Penguin is of perfect perfection and VERY raw. Christpher Walken as Max Shreck is believable and reminds of former or current boss you might have who was just as tepid and self centred. The late Michael Gough's role as Alfred isn't flawed and is perfect as always.Overall, this film is one of the best films I've ever seen and deserves the 10 stars that it's given.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Truly Great Batman Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only three years after Batman, Tim Burton and Michael Keaton returned to provide the same entertainment on a level nearly as grand as the first.Joining the great Keaton are Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Christopher Walken, all three playing new additions to his rogues gallery. DeVito plays the grotesque Penguin, a rejected freak who rises from the sewers of Gotham City, and Michelle Pfeiffer plays Catwoman, deadly as she is lovely, seeking revenge on her boss Max Schreck, a corrupt businessman played by Walken.The great thing about the villains is how they all mirror Batman in certain ways, all adding up to a vibe similar to A Christmas Carol. The Penguin is like the Ghost of Christmas Past, an orphaned man that had extremely rich parents, just like Batman. Catwoman is like the Ghost of Christmas Present, like Batman she leads a double life, but goes to more major extremes. Max Schreck is the Ghost of Christmas Future, a corrupt and powerful businessman who takes out those who get in his way, the path Batman is heading down. Batman himself is not unlike Scrooge, sitting alone as Bruce Wayne in his gloomy mansion and waiting to become Batman again.Keaton and Pfeiffer have a lot of great chemistry, the two had previously dated in real life, and it's clear what a positive effect it had on their performances in the film. DeVito is great as the Penguin, slimy and evil, his physical appearance perfectly suits his personality. The character of Max Schreck is interesting, wearing a more metaphorical mask than Batman and Catwoman, and it's interesting to see a corrupt businessman have such a major impact on the more fantastical characters like Batman, Catwoman, and the Penguin.Danny Elfman's score of the film is as great as the first, if perhaps not more so. Bo Welch's designs aren't quite on the level of Anton Furst's, but still very impressive, the production design remains atmospheric and really sells what a dark and grimy place Gotham is. Daniel Waters' script is full of humor and clever darkness, no surprise from the man who wrote Heathers, this film has an endless number of great quotes.I do not feel any of the other Batman films have again risen to the grand level of Tim Burton's two films, and I doubt another one ever will. Lightning already struck twice, it's unlikely to strike a third time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film. Blows 'Batman' out of the water. 'Batman Returns' is up there with the greatest movies of all time. I couldn't care what anyone says about 'The Godfather' or 'Titanic'. No doubt they are great films but everyone should have a favorite movie (Personal choice, whatever is your ideal movie) and what you think is the best movie (The Shawshank Redemption,The Godfather etc). Stand By Me or something like that would be my favorite movie but Batman Returns is up there. Penguin was a really good character and so was Catwoman. All in all this movie is dark,thrilling and suspenseful. Some American thrillers I can really taste the cheese off of. (V For Vendetta for example)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original, but still a decent Batman flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Batman film, for me, is astounding. Not only the best Batman film, (I even think it tops Nolan's brilliant vision), I think its one of the best films ever made. So 'Returns had a lot to live up to. And I think with a few changes, a bit of tampering with the plot here and there, it really could have topped it. Firstly, the casting. Brilliant stuff. DeVito's Penguin is grotesque, evil, and quite scary, very menacing. Yet by the end of the film, you ignore all that, and genuinely feel sorry for him. I could imagine no other actor taking that role. It seems The Penguin was created solely for the purpose of DeVito to portray him. Not as good a villain as Nicholson's Joker, but definitely in my list of all time movie villains. Michelle Pheiffer's Catwoman too is purrrfect (sorry, couldn't resist), she takes the role and runs astray (again, sorry!). She is sexy, mysterious, and very alluring. The chemistry between her and Keaton is fantastic. Now, do i really need to talk about the greatness of Keaton as Batman? Well i'm not going to, see my review for Batman 1989, although we all know he is phenomenal. Same with Christopher Walken. Just hearing he's a villain in a Burton Batman film instantly provokes excitement.The plot. Its good, but not great. I find it hard buying the idea of Penguin running for mayor, but i suppose this is fiction after all. Its a Batman film. But i liked the idea of Catwoman and Penguin teaming up, albeit for a short while, and framing Batman. Also an evil corrupt businessman working with Penguin too was a great move. Although, I don't feel the story is as engaging or exciting as the previous film. Its just something about the first film. They really couldn't match it. And no Batman film really has since. Hell, any superhero film for that matter. Ahh screw it, no film really has! Now, the sets. Very, very, dark. Yet, very, very, excellent. Matches the tone of the film perfectly. My only regret is they didn't use Anton Furst's fantastic sets at Pinewood Studios. It was a brilliant piece of architecture, his Gotham City. Nonetheless, these sets are good, and like I said, are very well suited to the atmosphere and overall tone of the film. Overall, 'Returns is a good film. Not as good as the original, but a decent Batman flick. Shame Burton didn't do more. People complained at how dark this was compared to Batman 1989, but that film was dark. You would think they would expect it, I personally thought the darkness of both films is what Batman is all about. He's not a happy camper protecting a brightly neon lighted fantastic spectacle of a city. Nudge Nudge Schumacher...Good film. Great cast. Good music (however i preferred the first films score). And fantastic directing. You can tell in some scenes that the producers let Burton go crazy and do whatever he wanted. The first film is a Batman film, this one, is a Tim Burton film. Its very entertaining, and a good Batman film. And thats all that matters really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing creepy sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you thought there should have been more Tim Burton style in the first Batman, this has a ton of it. With an all star cast of Michel Keaton portraying batman again perfectly, Michelle Pfiffer as a superb cat woman (much better than the mediocer Halle Berry character), a great creepy performance by Danny Devito, and the great Christooher Walken playing the evil Max Shreck. The story is about two villains. One a seductive secretary dressed up as a cat, and a ghoulish mutant penguin who lives in the sewers of Gotham City. The penguins plan is to become the mayor of Gotham and start some evil plans. The citizens of Gotham feel sorry for the penguin and ignore that he could be dangerous, except for Batman. Catwoman is a weird villain. In fact you don't know if she is a hero or a villain. She blows up a mall but saves a woman from getting mugged. When cat woman and the penguin team up there plan is to frame batman and take over the city. As much as the first Batman is great, I think that this one is a bit better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a poem of a film. As Kit Ramsey would say: "It's a film, not a movie!". Michael Keaton has totally become one with the character of Bruce Wayne and DeVito and Pfeiffer justify their casting the second they appear on the screen. Nothing short of a miracle. And as much as Burton is my favorite director, Danny Elfman is the magician this time around. The score he created for Batman Returns is in my opinion the highlight of his career so far. The music is absolutely beautiful and supports the imagery dead on. I'm very much looking forward to Nolan's fifth Batman film, 'cause Batman Forever (****) was on the limit of being complete failure and the almost legendary Batman and Robin (*) WAS just that. Still, this one deserves a place in my top 10 best films list. A masterpiece.***** / *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different but unique vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my first cinematic experiences ever. My very first was the first Batman in 1989. So this one was my first most anticipated film. And it didn't fail me. Most D.C. fans are still complaining about the Tim Burton films, they are not loyal to the original comic books and stuff like that. I say who cares? Really, when you trying to adapt a book, a comic, anything to the big screen you should be allowed some freedom. In the end what matters the most is the movie. Is it good or bad. And this one is great. I loved Burton's Gotham City. This German expressionist's fantasy that comes to life in a unique way. And it's not just the buildings, the make up, the costumes, the cinematography everything seems to be one and the same with the architecture of the city. It's really great when you can see a director have a very specific vision for a character and a story, how he wants to portray him and builds everything around him. Tim Burton creates a whole world by himself and gives life to everything in this world. It's maybe a different vision that most of the fan had about the dark knight, but that's the beauty of it really. Batman returns perhaps have the best villains ever. Penguin played by Dany DeVito is amazing. His dark, grim, twisted he can give you the worst nightmare and the guy has a yellow duck for a car, and a happy umbrella always in his hand. And yet there are moments when you actually feel sorry for him. Michelle Pfeiffers Catwoman on the other hand is neither good or bad. She's sexy alright but so some much more, she's dangerous, she lovable and also a really messed up, next door girl. In an era when we didn't have many dynamic female characters on action or fantasy films, this one gives us one of the best ever. Finally Michael Keaton. Nobody believed in him back then, he was at the time a comedy actor, but he really nailed it as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Tim Burton gave us a dark, grim Gothic fairytale but still kept a light mood and a comic book feeling to it. He had a vision, he's vision about Batman and he share it with us. I'm happy that he did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was too dark for the average Batman fans and was not greeted by the critics very positively. I quite like it and think it was a great addition to the series. The sets and images are as dark as the story. Although there are some funny moments the depressing tone over powers them. Keaton pulls of another fantastic performance and his character is still kept a mystery which makes it that much better. But what makes this movie for me is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. Her character is so twisted, dark and dual that it is so unique from any other versions of this character I've seen. Her performance is just that great. It's dark and depressing and despite many critic opinions I think it's one of the better ever sequels made</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns released in June of 1992, was in my opinion the best Batman and Tim Burton movie of them all, the villains work, cat woman and penguin, and Micheal Keaton is the image of the classic Bruce Wayne, and of coarse The Batman. The creepy Tim Burton feel, a whole new meaning to the Batman franchise. And the movie is perfectly placed in the Christmas season. It is a shame they ruined the series with Batamn Forever and Batman and Robin, but this movie proceeds 1989's Batman and excels the Batman character to new heights and humor. Michelle Phifer and Danny Devito are great as the villains and also great as there alter egos Oswald Copplepot and Selena Kyle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Darkest of all the Knights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always said that this film was the best of the old Batman films, and the darkest. It's my favourite and I would even have to choose it over the first one as being the best in quality. Everything was perfect, the cast, the love interest of Bruce Wayne and Catwoman, and the script, not a moment where I could say, "Aww that line could have been taken out or rewritten". Tim Burton was a great director of the first two films, and the way this and the first was presented, it became real and gritty (If you don't look at the part where Michelle Pfeiffer has nine lives). I just want to finish with the fact that Danny DeVito as the Penguin was so brilliant that its was the Hamlet of the Batman Performances. Go out and get this one as soon as you can, its not a kid's Batman, its the real deal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember really liking BATMAN RETURNS when it came out in 1992, but now I think that this is the best of all the Batman movies (even over Christopher Nolan's terrific 2005 BATMAN BEGINS and definitely over the seriously over-hyped overrated 2008 THE DARK KNIGHT!). I originally remember thinking that the 1st BATMAN w/ Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love it). But I think that this movie really hits the nail on the head. The 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman, and Max Shreck) are all vivid and memorable. You really get to see what Batman/Bruce Wayne is all about in Keaton's terrific characterization. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even the up-and-coming Bale, who was exceptional in BB and could have stolen top honors from Keaton had his character not been destroyed by Nolan's hack film-making in TDK !. Danny DeVito as The Penguin is disturbing, scary, hilarious, and lethal. DeVito is great and doesn't need scenery-chewing to give great performance like Nicholson's Joker. The viewer can actually sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his plight to fit into normal society. I had never really been big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer until this film, but this is definitely my favorite performance of hers. Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle is goofy and odd at first, then when she is transformed into Catwoman, she is simultaneously sexy and scary, a total deadly sexpot! Also, I feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger from BATMAN; they form a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, well, as always, Christopher Walken!BATMAN RETURNS, more so than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. It is assured film-making from beginning to end. The way Burton introduces the Penguin's heartbreaking backstory grabs you from the very beginning. The first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings to any film: Danny Elfman's music sets an ominous foreboding tone that defines the rest of the film. It is a modification from the original BATMAN and a great one!Then flash forward 33 years to the present day Gotham and we are introduced to powerful businessman Shreck who wants to build new power plant in Gotham. During same scene we meet Shreck's meek, bullied, under-confident secretary Selina Kyle. And not long after all this is the film's exciting opening action sequence as Batman must battle The Penguin's Red Triangle Gang, a fun yet lethal group of outcasts and circus performers. Penguin sets plan in motion to attack the Gotham Christmas celebration, kidnap Shreck in the chaos, and force him to help re-introduce him to society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Shreck's criminal plans and so he "kills" her by shoving her out his high-rise office, then she is revived by cats. Sound convoluted? Yes, but Burton never claimed to be posing a realistic story. He has created a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can happen, a dark, noirish world comprised of mistreated, deformed outcasts who deep down only want acceptance and to fit in. Confident storytelling if you ask me!The action scenes are few and far in between, but they are all exciting, entertaining, and nail-biting. They aren't there just for show, the way some in BATMAN are. And they all make sense. The climactic scene with Penguin's "army" marching into the center of Gotham with Batman zoning in on Penguin's hideout and sidekick butler Alfred (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original!) assisting Batman is succinct, solid, heart-pounding fun!I also love the Christmastime, wintry setting, which adds to the super-dark, cold feel of Burton's Batman world. I also love the way Burton slowly introduces to us the Batman "toys" without shoving them down our throats. Each "toy" is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are compelled to accept them for their purpose. And although dark, RETURNS is still a funny film. DeVito's Penguin has many funny lines. So does Walken's Shreck. The Batman-Catwoman exchanges are extremely stimulating and humor-filled as well! A great ensemble! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a tightly woven tale of the dark forces at play in Tim Burton's fun, comic book world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I've seen this all the way through since it was in theaters when I was 13. I don't remember liking it much then, but I've long been thinking of re-watching it. It's developed a cult because of its excessive weirdness. It is that excessive weirdness that keeps it watchable. That, the awesome production design, Danny Elfman's score, and Christopher Walken. Without those elements, though, honestly, I don't know that this is all that much better than Batman &amp; Robin (I'm not about to re-watch that one, but I did pick up Batman Forever on Blu Ray very cheap along with this - probably both will be a waste of money). If nothing else, it certainly plants a lot of the seeds that would grow into the monstrosity that was B&amp;R. The script here is just awful, first and foremost. It's all just a mess, with all kinds of nutty crap thrown on the screen for little to no reason. It's terribly grotesque. Penguin isn't a rich man in a tuxedo, he's a mutant, and Catwoman is a zombie. It has a really dirty sexual streak. It gets really gross watching Danny DeVito perv all over everyone. It's chock full of terrible one-liners that sound awful even coming out of Michelle Pfeiffer. Batman is more or less forgotten for most of the film. Even when it's being aggressively weird, it's mostly boring. Walken really livens up the film whenever he appears - his murder of Selina Kyle is by far the highlight of the film. It's a shame he disappears for a long stretch in the second half. The first Burton Batman holds up pretty well. This one, not so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too dark, even for Gotham City</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie when I was a boy and I watched it again in these days because of the success of "The dark knight". I think Tim Burton has a great merit in some readings (the bat suit, the vehicle) of the batman character but he was too occupied with giving us his dark vision of the world and human relationships that he forgot the character itself and principle ones. Jim Gordon, always present in the comic book, is restricted as an appearance and the English humor of Alfred, like his very important role as MD, vanished. Yes, you can say that the penguin (Danny Devito) and catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) do their dirty job in egregious way but even the role of the villains is overtaken by the enforcedly dark atmosphere that you can breath everywhere. Not thinking about the physical capabilities of Michael Keaton, Bruce Waine is a lone wolf but he has a public figure of playboy and crazy rich boy. In this movie There isn't any difference between Bruce Wayne and Batwan, suit apart. However there are amazing visual effects, considering the age, and the photography is excellent. Five on ten stars. Giuliano Cicolini</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, best in the franchise after Dark Knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's Batman Returns is my second favourite Batman movie thus far. It's pretty underrated, stylishly cheeky and full of ornate, wonderfully oppressive, melancholic set design and drips with a Gothic sensability that only Burton included in his versions, and seems to be missing from the franchise these days. It's dark, comical and just a little bit campy, always a winning combination. Michael Keaton steps back into the batsuit for a second time, and he's even more somber and downbeat than in Burton's original 1989 film. Keaton is so talented, and one only needs to look at his zany work in Beetlejuice and compare it to the heft and restraint he shows as the caped crusader to see this. Here he's faced with a snowy, blackened and endlessly corrupt Gotham City, this time under siege from three wildly different villains. Danny Devito plays Oswald Cobblepot, a.k.a. The Penguin, in what is probably the most outlandish character in the otherwise grim film. He's a bad tempered, knobbly little gremlin, encased in sallow makeup and sporting disgusting, pasty little flippers. It's hard to tell it's even Devito at all until that little smart ass mouth opens up to hurl calculated obscenities at anyone and everyone. He aims to be mayor, and only in freaky deaky Gotham would a plan like that ever be taken seriously, from a sewer dwelling, animalistic mobster with an army of clowns following him. Christopher Walken plays evil, ghoulish Max Schreck, an amoral monster of a businessman with nefarious plans of his own, and a haircut that would make Andy Warhol run for cover. Last and most memorable is Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle, Schreck's awkward, meek secretary who eventually becomes Catwoman. And what a Catwoman she is. Forget Anne Hathaway, Julie Newmar take a number, and we won't even mention Halle Berry. No one played the pussy quite like Pfeiffer. She's got a shiny, skin tight outfit with the body to match, a sassy, sexy attitude, a whip smart mouth on her and just a hint of psychosis, making her my favourite film incarnation of the character. "Meow" she purrs sensually as an incendiary bomb detonates behind her. Damn. They all get wrapped up in various schemes and scams. Penguin wants ultimate power, which apparently involves kidnapping a bunch of infants. Schreck wants ruthless progress to tear Old Gotham up in worship of the almighty dollar, and Catwoman is content to slash and burn everyone's plans, until she gets a bit of a smolder in her eye for Batman, providing some electric sexual tension between the two of them that's a highlight of the film. Neither of them are sure whether they want to kiss or kill, fight or fcvck the other, and it's devilishly entertaining watching them hash out their hormones in naughty little action sequences and slow, slinky intimate scenes, involving both Bruce and Selina as well as their feral alter egos. Their chemistry revolves at the center of the piece, with all manner of circus sideshow madness happening around them. Pat Hingle and Michael Gough diligently put in work as Commissioner Gordon and Alfred Pennyworth, with Doug Jones, Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryarniarski and Paul Reubens rounding out the roster. Burton outdid himself with style on this one, his trademark eye for loving detail laboriously employed here to the point where it surpasses the artistry of a comic book and starts to look like some mad dream of Vincent Price. He dipped his toe in the water of the Batman universe with his first outing. Here he plunges headlong into it and fully commits to a style and tone that's distilled to a satisfactory point that he wasn't quite at with Batman 1989. A treasure in the franchise, and a wicked fun film at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Darker but Sadly not as Fun as its Predecessor,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's still enjoyable, but it certainly lacks the same level of fun and action that we saw in the first Batman. Tim Burton is certainly a dark and unique director, but he toned down his weird style for Batman, this time around, however, he dosen't and it's much darker and creepier than you would want a Batman movie to be, for example, a scene of a woman being pushed out a window falling to her near fatal death and the Penguin biting someone's nose off. He clearly had more power with how the movie was made this time around, but he simply went too far with conveying his own style which dosen't really suit the Batman universe. The highlight of the movie is certainly Michelle Pfeiffer, she is a fabulous actress and performs brilliantly as Catwoman, her scenes are the most memorable as well, particularly her dialogue with Batman. My biggest problem with this movie is the same one I had with the first Batman, but it's more extreme this time around, Batman dosen't have enough screen time and is underdeveloped, the villain has much more dialogue, which wasn't a huge issue the first time around as Jack Nicholson was terrific as the Joker, but I really wasn't fond of Danny DeVito as the Penguin. Villiains normally have a lot of reasons to be likable, but the Penguin was simply creepy and every time he was on screen I was uncomfortable, it was clear that Burton found this character fascinating, but giving him, as well as Catwoman, more dialogue and screen time than the title character is simply odd. It certainly has its flaws and fans of the Batman franchise will probably be disappointed, but Batman Returns is still a very enjoyable movie and I would recommend it as a good action if you ever see it on television. Batman (Michael Keaton) must put a stop to a corrupt mayor and a psychopathic man who calls himself the Penguin, from taking complete control of Gotham. Best Performance: Michelle Pfeiffer Worst Performance: Danny DeVito</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark Dark Knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's second Batman film has been largely regarded as the 'darkest' of all the Dark Knight's big screen outings. In fact, according to many, it was 'too dark' and, because of that, somehow less worthy than the other movies. Yes, the tone is pretty bleak, but, when you compare it to many of the films today (including Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy) I can't really see the problem.Where some people see 'darkness,' I simply see realism. Yes, people get killed in 'Batman Returns' (shock, horror ? even good people!). If that shocks and disturbs you so then you really should stick to watching Disney cartoons where everyone lives happily ever after.Besides, if you're contemplating watching Batman Returns then you've probably already seen Tim Burton's first Batman offering, i.e. 1989 smash hit with Jack Nicholson as The Joker. If you haven't, I'd start with that one first, as it sets the tone nicely for the sequel. Today's audiences may be more familiar with Heath Ledger's portrayal of the 'killer clown,' but, back in 1989, Jack Nicholson WAS the Joker. It was fair to say that he owned the role and whoever followed him in taking on the Dark Knight would have to be pretty damn evil to top him. Enter Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't care what Batman's modern day fans say... I still think Pfeiffer is a better 'Catwoman' than Anne Hathaway. Both of the new villains stepped up to the challenge and scared and slinked their way around the screen at all times.With two such great villains you could be mistaken for thinking that Batman himself might be a bit eclipsed (a common complaint about the first film). However, he too has upped his game (maybe Michael Keaton demanded more screen time and better lines after being so outshined by Jack Nicholson?). Either way, you'll be hard put to find anyone letting the side down.At nearly two hours, Batman Returns isn't a short film, but it seems to fly by. Maybe it's not a 'family friendly' movie and it certainly doesn't have the 'happy-go-lucky' feel of today's modern (Marvel?) superhero movies, but it is one of Burton's best 'twisted fairy tales' to date, so if you're in the mood for something nicely dark with a cracking Danny Elfman soundtrack, give this one a go and don't go thinking that Nolan's Batman was the ONLY Dark Knight out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first rented Batman Returns, I immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? Simple, throw in Danny DeVito.Batman Returns is an arguably more dark movie than Batman. There are more villains here, less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects, and more nerve-striking issues. However, the music is similar to the first if not darker. The scenery is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right down to the time of year. This movie follows the same comic-style format we came to love in the first Batman.Now for the performances. Michael Keaton thankfully returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, need MORE! Danny DeVito gave an award-winning performance as The Penguin, the most grueling, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie. You hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time. And it explains him down to the last detail too, making it all the more conflicting. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She actually got a good amount of back story as well. Christopher Walken didn't disappoint as Max Shreck, the greedy, judgmental, selfish CEO of the power company. Michael Gough also thankfully returns as the lovable Alfred, and he was just as good here as well. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, although I feel he was really never in the spotlight.With lots of great twists and sub-plots, Batman Returns is sure to please any fan of the original.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, this film has no story. It's obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production -- sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set.That said, the film is kinda brilliant. Pfeiffer is amazing -- and I mean amazing, as Catwoman; she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good/bad tendencies. Walken is Walken -- but even more nasty than usual. Devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to Penguin, but he is good and memorable. Keaton is underrated as Batman. And the music and style are pure cinema thrill. True, the 3rd act doesn't work. But the final 2 scenes are knockouts, and it's clear Pfeiffer and Keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this film's kinky darkness. That's too bad, because Pfieffer and Keaton had classic chemistry, and had they acted in a third installment, Joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy Batman for an entire generation of movie fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about Tim Burton.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best Batman movie of the 90's no doubt about it. This movie takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmares.Although the villains are somewhat cheesy, they fit perfect for the movie's tone of colorful but nightmarish cinematography. The performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really delivers expectations. Don't get fooled by the cheesy outfits, this is a movie in the pure style of Burton. That can't be described; Burton is a sui generis director that took the Batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting about it's comic style past. Recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all, if it deals with super heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of all the batman films. Flawed like all but never fails to deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>what can i say, this film is amazing. it has its flaws like every film does for example wobbly headstones in a graveyard, a clearly visible slide board during the penguins death scene, Max Shreck losing his heavy coat in a split second between shots during the image consultancy scene, batman losing his black eye makeup all of a sudden between shots so he can reveal Bruce Wayne to Catwoman, dialogue being recorded but is played back and spoken differently than when it was spoken in the first place and lastly Catwoman all of a sudden knows how to use a bull whip without any training whatsoever. these flaws are minor compared to some you would see in for example batman forever where the riddler can obviously be seen waiting for his cue or val Kilmer's hair changing between shots.what makes this film so deserving of an 8/10 is the great acting because the performances are absolutely amazing. Michael Keaton reprises his role as Batman and has a lot more to do in this film. He looks more comfortable in the role the second time around and is on par with the villains performances. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the conversion of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non threatening character from the comics or TV show because now the character has more depth and has a far more interesting story that generates from the basic need of family and to feel accepted and wanted. this gives us an evil character who we feel sympathy for because he was rejected for being what he is which is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. she is sleet and sexy and she is also a villain we can feel sorry for because of the way she is victimised. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting a character even though he is not even in the batman universe.the soundtrack is far better than the first and Danny Elfman gets more of a chance to show off his musical talents this time around. The sets are amazing. They are detailed, eye catching, sinister, Gothic , unique, dark and so many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look. the costumes and make up are great and obviously a lot of work went into making them and all the work pays off because the Batsuit is better, the cat suit is amazing to look at and the penguin make up and effects are so convincing.The animatronic penguins look really realistic and are played to good effect. The script is really good and the Storyline in my opinion is a plausible one. overall, because of all these factors this film deserves an 8/10 and stands as my favourite of all the batman films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton versus Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton is in essence an expressionist film-maker, disinterested in dimensions of character and obsessed with Gothic scope, opting for style over substance incessantly throughout his career. However, with his style being so poignantly endearing, I, like many moviegoers, forgive all the countless flaws that can be found in many of his movies and become engrossed in what are essentially, one hundred million dollar art films.It's almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotionally involving spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise, especially when that franchises target audience are half-witted 15 year old boys. Batman Returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor, ensuring box office draw and cheap (in actual fact, very expensive) thrills, being entertaining without ever truly involving its audience. Had this been the result, then Tim Burton would have surely been required to direct a third installment. Instead, Burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase, 'out there'.From the melancholy opening in which a high society couple throw a prison-like bassinette containing their newly born deformed baby into a river, it is clear that Batman Returns, ain't no picnic at Buckingham Palace. Cut to thirty three years later, during a political speech made by bad guy business tycoon Max Shreck (sinisterly portrayed by Christopher Walken), the Red Triangle Circus Gang attack Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returning to the role) makes his first appearance sporting a new logo, eventually saving the day. Shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and black-mailed into endorsing the political return of the baby, now a fully grown Penguin man (Danny DeVito in hideously perfect make-up), whose motives for return are suspicious only to Batman.Meanwhile, Shreck attempts to off his nosey and awkward assistant Selina Kyle (played perfectly by Michelle Pfeiffer who quite frankly deserved more recognition for her performance) who transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic Catwoman, out for revenge and harbours, for some unexplained reason, a deadly vendetta against the Dark Knight.Batman Returns is bleak. The production design is breathtaking, delivering a cold haunting Gotham City with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. Danny Elfman's score supports the film brilliantly, ranging from invigorating to tragic. The tone and direction of the whole film itself is intensely brooding, shot like a sad nightmare, Burton's direction overshadows what is in fairness a diabolical screenplay with an almost totally irrelevant plot and yet at the same time perfect for Burton's visual style of film-making. And whilst Burton's action sequences struggle for exhilaration, the real excitement lies in the directional choices displaying the fall of each of its main characters, the Penguins demise, the Catwoman's mental state and Bruce Wayne's lonely destiny.Warner Brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed. After all, they wanted a Batman sequel, not a weird, somewhat ghastly horror movie, in which a deformed psychopathic orphan attempts to kidnap and drown a batch of babies, all-the-while vomiting what can only be described as green mucus. The production company wanted an audience friendly feature, something for the McDonald's clan to promote their happy meals with, not a movie of dire irredeemable characters, including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats awakening her from unconsciousness by chewing on her bloodied ice cold fingers.It's easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of Batman Returns. The film never felt like a Batman blockbuster. It is questionable if Burton really knew who Batman actually was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film fitting in with his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and misinterpreted, lonely characters who rarely conform with societies standards and expectations. This is why Burton failed to create a great Batman film. He did however; create a nostalgic and stunning, ballsy piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favourite of mine.This may not be a great Batman movie. But it is a great Tim Burton film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many grotesques in the kitchen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's follow-up to his own 1989 hit "Batman" has Michael Keaton returning as reclusive millionaire Bruce Wayne who doubles as crime-fighter Batman; here, Gotham City is in the middle of a political shakedown, as former circus freak/now celebrity extraordinaire Oswald Cobblepot (a.k.a. The Penguin) has teamed with business tycoon Max Shreck into persuading the residents that he should be the next mayor (apparently no one has noticed the Penguin's henchmen terrorizing all the small businesses on Gotham's mean streets). Meanwhile, Shreck's secretary has learned too much and is pushed from a high window--her life is saved by mystical alley cats and she emerges with a new identity, Catwoman, but with no discernible agenda of her own. This overstuffed live-action comic book adventure features lots of dumb-funny double entendres and the overused plot-device of having the number one crime-fighter look like a dupe at the hands of the villains (they even manage to rewire the Batmobile so that it mows down pedestrians!). However, the picture has drive and imagination to spare, and for about an hour it's a fun ride. Still, Burton's wintry atmosphere and bleak vision of the City as Hell becomes wearing, and by the finale nearly all the juice has leaked from this vehicle. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched Batman Begins for a second time two nights ago and coming to the conclusion that I'd overrated it, I thought I'd bring out Tim Burton's much debated Batman Returns. Although Batman 89 remains my favourite over the entire franchise (old and new) I'd never really appreciated just how facile the second instalment was.I'd always liked Returns as a child simply because it was a Batman film. I'd never understood or appreciated the intelligence and artistic style of how it was put together. The entire film is resembles a sad poem. The characters always craved something more than they had but were always cursed never to find retribution.Tim Burton has received plenty of criticism via the use of hindsight for never having explored the true character of Bruce Wayne. I think, perhaps, that is something that works in his favour. Burton's Wayne is an enigma, someone we just can't understand and at all and Michael Keaton pulls this off splendidly. We can see in Keaton's face that there is always a deep rooted pain in every menial action he makes. It is an absolute pity that Burton wasn't allowed to do a 3rd Batman film because that could have made something really special. I'd hazard a guess and say that it would have been a film primarily about Batman, and his battle with his inner demons and origin, thus making the perfect trilogy. Needless to say Warner Brothers felt the need to mess with something that was working.The Catwoman is a divine character. It is typical Tim Burton in the scene where she is pushed from the window and her origin is put into place. Unlike Selina Kyle, Catwoman is sexually heightened, confident and mysterious. She is everything Selina wants to be. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is wonderful. It is no wonder that we believe Batman to have fallen for her, she almost mirrors him as a character and he says so at the final confrontation "We're the same. Split, right down the centre." Danny DeVito also pulls of an Oscar winning performance as the disgusting and rejected Penguin. Underneath his ambitious self, he is merely a horny teenager wanting to experience a little bit of human life. That is why his story is so compelling and we are almost moved to see him die. If you compare this with Schumacher's Two Face then it makes for a much more interesting villain. Max Shreck was perhaps the face of true evil in this film and he eventually gets his comeuppance. I do enjoy the fact that Batman sees right through Shreck but does nothing. Had any other director had this film then I am sure they would have opted for a confrontation once Bruce had discovered the truth.The movie, altogether I think, is an intelligent dark comedy. As someone has previously mentioned in these reviews it really isn't what you would expect of a Batman film. If you want a version that stays faithful the original idea and is so suave then Begins is the answer. If you are after something a little discrepant then look no further than Tim Burton's versions. For the love of God stay away from the last two catastrophe's. Me, well I appreciate both Begins and Burton's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, bad plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the success of 1989's 'Batman', Tim Burton and Michael Keaton released a second movie in the franchise: Batman Returns. Gotham City retains the Gothic look of the first film, only this time the city is in the midst of an icy winter punctuated by the arrival of two new villains on the scene: Catwoman and the Penguin.As a kid I loved this movie and the original Tim Burton 'Batman' movie, however after re-watching it over a decade later it doesn't quite hold up as well as I wished it would have. Part of this reason is the fact that Batman seems almost external to this plot which revolves around Penguin (Danny DeVito), Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Gotham businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Batman (Michael Keaton) seems to only step in momentarily to throw a few punches before exiting back to Wayne Manor.All four lead actors, especially Danny DeVito, deliver great performances in this movie, but it is a real shame that the scriptwriters chose to not continue the analysis into the Bruce Wayne/Batman psyche. Instead, we are left with a fairly routine 'bad guy trying to overthrow the city' story; the Penguin character was well developed, but the action scenes in the movie are nothing memorable. Another complaint is the lack of resolution that is given to the Penguin's attempts to turn Gotham city against Batman. Surely the mislead public would be angry at Batman for the crimes that they believe him to have committed, however the Bat-signal at the end of the film gives the impression that this is not the case.On the positive side though, the movie has a great feel to it; from the visual appearance of the winter Gotham, through to Danny Elfman's musical score. You can't help but feel some of the special effects - computer and real-life - are a little outdated 13 years down the track though.Overall, this childhood favourite of mine is worth a look and a film that I will revisit in the future, but upon reflection should have been better. I'm glad that the newly released 'Batman Begins' dives head first into the exploration of the Bruce Wayne/Batman characters that this film avoids.2.5 stars / 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Welcome back to Gotham City, home of crime and home of the avenger of crime, the legendary Batman (Michael Keaton) a.k.a. millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. While most of the crime emanates from muggers and thieves lurking in backstreet alleys and other grimy places, it's higher up the chain as well. Enter corrupt corporate boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), casually putting on a smile for the good people of Gotham whilst secretly running his own dirty little schemes, who's about to make an unexpected new ally. Abandoned by his rich, snobby parents from birth, tossed into the sewer and left to form into a hideously deformed man, The Penguin (Danny DeVito) has grand plans to endear himself to the people of Gotham, run for mayor and secretly fulfill his own hidden agenda to avenge his lot in life on the innocent people. And finally, Selina Kyle (Michelle Phyiffer) a dowdy, nerdy secretary for Shreck who becomes Catwoman, feline avenger of the night and the Penguin's sidekick. It's time for Batman to work his magic and save the city once again...Following the ultra-successful first Batman movie three years prior, a sequel was as inevitable as night following day. And in 1992, it arrived with Batman Returns, and with the same director, Tim Burton and with the same guy behind the mask, Michael Keaton. Given how much I enjoyed the first one, all of this should spell success. And, unlike in later years, where sequels with the same directors and such would start to suck, this was an earlier one that actually fulfilled.If you think of it all in this sense, you could look on it as a re-run of the first in a lot of respects, certainly the same formula, the same dark presentation and even the same running time! But it is, of course, a movie on it's own, with it's own qualities and high-points. It's not one of those 'sequel that's nowhere near as good as the original' types.So, where do we begin? Well, from the beginning. Opening to the sweeping, stirring soundtrack with the same clever camera angles that stylized the original. This is looking raring and set to be another distinctly comic book movie all the way. And it certainly gets stirred up in the eccentricity of it all as events roll on. Secondly, the performances. De Vito works his own unique brand of magic in the role of The Penguin, but he is ultimately side-shadowed by Walken, who manages a quietly menacing, delightfully devilish turn as the evil Shreck. Alledgedly, a vast number of publicity posters were stolen from Warner Brothers marketing department featuring Phyiffer in her Catwoman suit but (call me weird!) I only found her slightly more appealing than Halle Berry in Catwoman at a push. And then finally, there's the script. A delightfully hammy concoction of all the wildest comic book style extroversion you can imagine, combined with Burton's own unique style.Who cares if a bit too much time is focused on the villains and not on the development of Batman himself? Who cares if some of the action does look a bit rubbery (or maybe things have just moved on a bit too much for me?) Who cares if the ending, with the penguins with rocket-packs on their backs is eccentrically extroverted and even laugh-inducingly ridiculous in one sense? This is the ultimate comic book movie, and the last final, fleeting glimpse of Batman in his true, dark sense before the series deteriorated into the vacuous, colourful, chav-vy gloop it did. So three cheers for this, my favourite Batman movie. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All round its perfect, one of the best. You can't fault it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any Batman fan will know just how great the films are, they've been a major success. Batman Returns however is by far the best film in the series. A combination of excellent directing, brilliant acting and settings makes this worthy of watching on a night in.Tim Burton, who directed this movie, has specifically made sure that this film gives a realistic atmosphere and he's done a great job. Danny Devito (Penguin man) is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby, and grown up to become a hideous and ugly...thing! Michelle Pfiffer plays the sleek and very seducing 'Catwoman' after cats had given her there genes from being bitten. The result in both the character changes is excellent and both Catwoman and Penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film. The mysterious Catwoman is great fun to watch - her classic sayings and a funny part in which skips with her whip in a jewelry shop adds such fun to the film. Danny Devito also does well, his ability to impersonate some strange creature was vital, and he adds a great atmosphere to the film that takes us back to the dull sewers where he lives.You can't forget Batman though. Micheal Keaton once again pulls of a comfortable performance, and shows us a different side to Batman. His affection is let loose when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the film, and his meetings with her when she's a normal person, Selina Kyle, result in him being seduced badly in his own home. There's a clever part after this when they leave, and the film is full of great scenes. Its worth noting that Bruce Wayne's Bat mobile is not used as much as in the other Batman films, as close combat and story telling scenes make up this film.The winter setting is created perfectly in Gotham City with most of the scenes being set at night, and with the town being filled with snow. Therefore, if you watch this film during the summer like I have, it doesn't feel the same. Best watch it during the winter.Overall, its an amazing movie. All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the cast, they've done an incredible job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****Excellent***Good**Fair*PoorGrowing up there weren't the kind of films kids have these days. These days kids can enjoy the Marvel films, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Pixar pictures. When I was an adolescent we just had the Disney movies, Benji, and loads of animal films. So a film like Batman Returns was something special. A film that had imagination and adventure.Batman Returns is not as good as the original and the plot is questionable. However, director Tim Burton manages to bring the Batman mythology back to life. While not always faithful to the comics but always inspired. Here Michael Keaton returns as the Dark Knight, this time facing the grotesque Penguin and his feline accomplice Catwoman. Both roles played wonderfully by Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer.After Batman getting revenge in the original by murdering the killer of his parents (the Joker) screenwriters Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters further develop the character of Bruce Wayne by making him question his role as Batman. After falling in love with Selina Kyle (Catwoman) Bruce Wayne doesn't know if he wants to continue as Batman or retire and spend the rest of his live with Selina. The screenwriters and Tim Burton use a lot of religious symbolism in this film by comparing Batman to Jesus. Here like in the last temptation of Christ Selina Kyle is a vision of what life could be but what Wayne doesn't know is that to Selina he is also a vision. In addition the whole first-born child thing is a bit Jewish.The great tragedy of Batman Returns is Anton Furst's death. In the original he not only created a great Gotham City but a great world as well. Bo Welch took over in this film and he was a good replacement. The other great tragedy is Michael Keaton not being nominated for an Oscar. I think Keaton is one of the most underrated actors of our generation. His performance in this film was incredible. The prove of that is the scene where he is searching for the corpse of Selina and you see the face of Bruce Wayne searching for hope. Then the Penguin appears from the water and when Keaton turns to face him, although he is not wear his mask we see the face of Batman. RATING: 4 STARS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undeniably weaker entry in the second installment of this series of films. The production values are still high, yet the execution came off weak. This is unfortunate, as BATMAN RETURNS had everything going for a worthwhile sequel. You had the stars...righto! You had Tim Burton...righto! You had the great supporting cast, musical score and those effects...righto! You had the screenplay...UH-OH....The story really did come off as one long homily about not looking down on people that we perceive as different. I can relate and think that is fine, but not for the length of the movie. Besides, I'm not ready to start thinking that all six billion of us on the planet need to be told such lessons in such a heavy handed nature. The character development came off as trying to fit too much, in one setting. The Penguin's character, in trying to be scary, degenerated into camp and became an object of humor. To see Devito's character traipsing about the underground sewers of Gotham, in those colossal, filthy undies bemoaning the fact that folks find him less than desirable, came off as somewhat ludicrous. Also, a question popped into my head while viewing this. If he spent all his time in the sewer, how did he eat? I mean the guy is tremendously obese. Who fed him? Ed Norton from "The Honeymooners"? Also, I heard a rumor that penguins can be found in cold climates, like Antarctica, and generally not in our sewers. I realize this is supposed to be fantasy, yet let's not make simpletons out of the audience, please.The only saving grace in the whole shebang is Pfeiffer's Catwoman character. She basically stole the show, and is by far the most interesting character. Michael Keaton is solid, but like Danny Devito, are anchored down by the limited, innocuous scope of the script. A small smudge off the neighbor's hibachi could have saved Warner Brothers a lot of loot, and the audience a lot of pain. This movie is by no means a dud, it merely means that with the right factors going, BATMAN RETURNS had the potential for a great film, instead of a so-so one. Recommended only for diehard fans, others should be wary of this weak fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Tim Burton's Grotesque, Gothic, Gruesome Sequel to the Overwhelmingly Successful Batman (1989) is a Movie that is Darkly Colorful and Sublimely Sardonic. It can, at times, be Captivating as well as Cringe-Inducing.If Burton Dialed the Penguin just a Notch above 10, and He did, it is the Film's Only Detraction from this Bizarre Bat-Fest. Everyone in the Movie is a Side-Show Attraction (except Alfred). The Penguin says to Batman..."You're just jealous because I'm a real Freak and You have to wear a mask".In Fact this Movie was so Disturbing that McDonald's Dropped the Happy Meal Toy Tie-In after Complaints from Outraged "Goody-Goodies". The Distributors of Mystery Meat and Fake Food had a lot of Nerve but the Studio seemed to Capitulate as can be Witnessed by the Next Two Batman Movies that were more Friendly to the Franchise of Fast Food.This is a Witty Movie with a Very Sexy Kitty, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, who Steals the Show from Batman, still with some Wonderful Toys, and The Penguin, although Danny Devito is Unforgettable and Delivers such a Disgusting, Demented, Character that He too is Memorable.Overall, the Movie may be a Bit Better than Batman, as this Followup is Richer, Funnier, and Crackles with a Bombardment of Bold, Burlesque, and Bawdy Behaviour. It is Alive with the Stench of the Near Dead and Dying, the Misfitted and the Maladjusted. Adding to the Sour Flavor of this Macabre Movie is a Danny Elfman Score that may be His Best.</fullReview>

DeVito effectively plays the pathos of this man, who can't decide if he wants to re-enter society or not, but a dramatic turn-of-events pushes him over the edge...Filled with fantastic action, set design, and music score, this production is another triumph, one of the few sequels to match the original, even though some feel it is too dark, the subject matter suits this.A great pity that star Michael Keaton and director Tim Burton stopped here, and didn't get the chance to do a trilogy, since the new team drove this series off the rails...A shame that.</fullReview>

The imagination this chap displays is so off the chart, he was only ever going to be a brilliant director, or a permanent asylum patient. Fortunately, it hasn't just got one mildly compelling character in The Joker like numero uno, but three riveting ones in The Penguin, Catwoman and even Max Shreck, played by the ever-reliable Christopher Walken. Batman still feels like a bit-part player in his own movie, but with so much going on, who cares? Every minute something wild and wacky happens, but if you think the film lacks heart... Wait until you see the ending. The fates of two of the cast are movingly poignant, but lay to rest the argument that Burton is just a visual director. Then again, if you'd seen Edward Scissorhands, you'd know that already...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton is one of the most talented directors ever and this movie is a piece of art. It says things on many different levels, I will tell you what I read from it:Penguin is a character as disgusting on the inside as he is on the outside (he is evil but we feel for him because of his tragic past and maybe think he is not the one to blame or that he might have good in him (don't judge book by its covers). We are actually manipulated like the people of Gotham that bought into his sad story from the newspapers. Here is the statement about what power the media and appearances have over us. The truth of the matter is, penguin has no morality in him as he is truly selfish and wants only to satisfy his own needs. Those are revenge, power, lust, etc. while violating the rights of others, so the definition of what we call evil. Some would say these are animal like tendencies and animals are generally more oriented towards themselves rather than being altruistic. Penguin at the end actually denounces his humanity and claims he wants to be an animal (a penguin).But at the end before he dies, we feel sorry for him because he is suffering. He was a human being after all and we feel compassion for another human being. Not because he was good, but because he was - human just like us. And we understand him, his lust for power or just lust or revenge are emotions understandable to us humans and we can relate to that and so we feel sorry for a fellow human. And the actual penguins at the end...maybe there is more to animals than we humans give them credit for? Maybe they feel and know things we only think humans could feel or know?So the Penguin character represents more than one thing like: appearances are misguiding, humans and animals are not so different, and all that leads to us questioning our knowledge about this world of ours in general which leads us to admit how great mysteries of life are unknown to us.I also feel this movie establishes "good" and "evil" as actual forces of universe where Penquin abides by the laws of evil and Batman by the laws of good and so they clash in an inevitable battle. Because one Tim Burton's freak (Edward the Scissorhands) was good, but the other freak (Penguin)was evil. So being a freak has no actual say on whether you are good or evil, it is who you are inside that counts.I wouldn't do this movie justice without mentioning the title character, the Catwoman or Shreck or saying something about the music or the way Tim Burton tells the story visually by showing it in short scenes or frames where the music score follows perfectly - but now I did mention it. I feel this movie is a true work of art among Batman movies and among movies in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns It is my opinion that the first Batman of the Batman series was only half the movie that Batman Returns is. In the first Batman by Tim Burton we had only Batman and The Joker both played wonderfully by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.In Batman Returns we have what I feel is the most perfectly cast Batman movie (yes even better then Dark Knight). Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the role never going to far over top with the character of Batman, which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains that he's up against. First you have Danny DeVito who is delightfully insane as the Penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat-Woman, who I dare to say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the Batman movies. I feel this way about Pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the Cat-Woman she starts off as the rather pathetic mousy Selena Kyle and then truly dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then I suppose back to a hero in the end. Also in this amazing cast you have the evil businessman Max Schreck played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken. While in a supporting role there's something about this role that I love and maybe it's the look of Schreck in the film that makes his performance all the better then it already is.Story wise I have to say that Batman Returns has so much more going on this time around as opposed to the first Batman. Part of the reason I loved this story so much is the fact that Burton dared to go in a much more darker and twisted direction as opposed to Nicholson's over the top antics. You have the story on the Penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of Gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her struggle to decide just who she really is and what she should do with her new persona. When it comes to Batman I feel that in this one he's more the ring leader that holds the two stories together but of course kicking ass at the same time.Cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it. Gotham City never looked as good as it does on Blu-Ray and HD so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of Batman Returns.So all in I truly feel that of all the Batman movies Batman Returns believe it or not tops the Dark Knight for me because while I enjoyed that movie for Heath Ledger's amazing performance as the Joker I felt that the movie was lacking something. Batman Returns lacks nothing, so if you want to see an amazing film with what I feel is a perfect cast then this is the Batman to light the Bat signal for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I believe the word you're looking for is 'Aaahh'!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before "The Dark Knight" changed everyone's perception of what a Batman movie (or sequel, for that matter) should be, there was Tim Burton's "Batman Returns," reaching sixteen years back to 1992. With perhaps the best cast of any of the original four Batman films (we're talking the Burton/Schumacher fare) and improved confidence by it's director, "Returns" is a rare occasion of a sequel one-upping it's predecessor. Sure, audiences failed to embrace it at the time in the way that they ate up 1989's "Batman," but time has revealed this one to be the better film.As Burton states in the commentary track for the film, "Batman Returns" is less a sequel than it is another chapter in the Batman saga. And visually, the film reflects that. To match it's decidedly darker tone, Burton gives a much grimmer, much more realistic look for Gotham City than the comic-book look he gave the first. He immerses his characters in gritty darkness, whether it's The Penguin lurking in the murky sewers, or Bruce Wayne sitting alone in a darkened Wayne Manor waiting for the Bat-signal. Everything about the movie is much more adult, more mature and meaner than before, which played a big part of it's initial backlash. Afterall, it's hard to sell Happy Meals and action figures when a certain character in the film bites noses, feasts on raw fish and barfs black sludge. Therefore, it must be said that it takes a more adult audience to appreciate this film, and it's not something for children to be watching -- although I surely got my fill of this movie at the tender age of eight years old.The story, about about a deformed baby outcast from society by his own parents, who takes refuge in the sewers only to re-emerge as iconic villain/urban-legend, The Penguin is almost as depressing as the story of the meek bachelorette Selina Kyle who, after being pushed over-the-edge by her boss, is re-incarnated as the sexed-up, merciless Catwoman. Truth be told, "Batman Returns" feels more like a movie about the two villains than it does it's title character, as Batman (with Michael Keaton reprising his role) takes a back-seat role. Danny DeVito is natural as The Penguin, and not just in body-shape. This is a rare case of an actor disappearing into his role, and DeVito has hardly had a more interesting part since. Michelle Pfeiffer, on the other side of the coin, seems to be having fun with her character, and watching her in Catwoman makes one think that maybe she was more deserving of her own spin-off film, instead of the 2004 abomination that is "Catwoman." Christopher Walken has a role as b-villain Max Shreck, and really, what can be said about the guy? He's great in everything he does, and his portrayal of the heartless megalomaniac that drives the motivation of each respective villain is spot on.Overall, "Batman Returns" is a much more complicated film than the first. Those looking for a typical comic-book or superhero movie may find themselves disappointed in what they find here. However, like another, more popular Batman sequel in recent memory, it's a film that proves that Batman can be taken to extreme lengths and out of the context of his original format. It may feel more like a Tim Burton film than your average Batman flick, but it's also one of the best pieces of celluloid to feature the character. It's a movie that has gradually found it's audience over time, and surely, it's better than the two films that follow. This is, in my opinion, the only film prior to 2005 that gets the spirit of The Caped Crusader right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best BatmanMovie EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an enormous comic book geek, and I've aways had a fascination for the darker comic book characters like Spawn, The Spectre, Deadman, and Batman. My favorite visual manifestations of the dark knight always lean towards the dark and exaggerated work of Kelley Jones, Sam Keth, Norm Breyfogle, or Ted McKeever. Tim Burton's Batman films (espescially this one) are the closest of the 6 Batman movies to capture this aspect. Unlike The Dark Knight(in which Heath Leger doesn't steal the show, he IS the show), the best performance in the whole film is Micheal Keaton's incredible Batman/Bruce Wayne. He really nails it as the caped crusader. From the subtle humor of Bruce Wayne to the dark brooding as Batman.But the supporting cast is excellent. Danny DeVito is absolutely brilliant as the Penguin. The film's portrayal isn't exactly true to the comics, but the Penguin is usually pretty lame with a bad origin and the Burton update is much more fascinating than to ridiculous comics version. As for Catwoman, sexy has a new name. Michelle is spellbinding as the Catwoman and I positively love that costume.When I draw Catwoman, she's always in a costume similar to the one in this film. The shiny leather and stitches are way cooler than the purple spandex in the comics. Also note the Batmobile, by far the best Batmobile ever. I love how much style Burton brings to the movie. The villains(DeVito,Pfeiffer,and Walken) all have a silent movie quality to them which is great. The Gotham City in the film is way more stylish and original than the other films.Danny Elfman's score is incredible and the costumes are some of the best I've ever seen. If you're a Tim Burton fan, see it. It really is one of his best. If your Batman fan, see it. As I've already said it's the best Batman yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one didn't appeal to me like the first one did. I didn't like some of the elements in it like how they handled The Penguin's plan, although very good. I also thought that Michelle Pfeiffer was kind of annoying in this. She didn't do a good job as Catwoman. I will say that Michael Keaton was good, as usual. And Tim Burton's directing is pretty good.But in the end, the one thing that falls is the writing. It was very insipid and not well thought out. It pains me to write this because I was expecting a good movie, but I got kind of a mediocre film. Furthermore, I didn't like how they reimagined Gotham City. It was way too Tim Burton, and didn't feel like Batman. I still have respect for you Tim Burton regardless of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's better than the first in many ways. A visual masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Definitely the best of the original BATMAN movies.The first BATMAN, although not entirely a perfect film, manages to capture the real atmosphere and dark-comic tradition, much missed in the campy 1960's TV series with Adam West. BATMAN RETURNS continues that tradition, being even more darker than the first. The film was heavily criticized for this, but I hardly see the reason why. It comes to show how creative this film is. It's better than the first film in many ways. A visual masterpiece, no doubt about it, and one of the better comic-book adaptations out there, perhaps since SUPERMAN in 1978.Director Tim Burton, who also directed the first film, gives twice as much creativity to this sequel. Coping, as well, to a more bizarre and oftentimes deeper plot. The film opens with a mean-spirited one, showing a wealthy couple throwing their deformed child to the sewer on a Christmas night, while we follow the cradle floating down the deep sewer and found by a group of penguins who take refuge there. This scene will definitely scare the kids a bit. More will they get scared when they actually meet The Penguin (Danny DeVito). The terrific (or is that terrifying) make-up by Stan Winston is sure to give nightmares.Besides The Penguin, we also have Catwoman (played voluptuously by Michelle Pfieffer), whose origin is yet another scene I wouldn't recommend you let the kids too see. Pfieffer, indeed, is a terrific femme fatale. Christopher Walken provides a convincing, yet not much used, villain as Max Schrek, Gotham's biggest tycoon who plans to create a power plant, which has a drawback that would drain the city's power.The film, while the first had writers Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren, has a new writer, Daniel Waters. Waters gives the film a more deeper story, which highlights, this time, more on the villains. Whereas the first film focused on Bruce Wayne's reflection on the death of his parents, this time, it focused on The Penguin, yearning to find his parents, and find out why they hated him badly. Rarely has there been a film that, as well, focuses on the back story of the bad guys. Even more less on superhero movies, but BATMAN RETURNS gives us that unique quality.But the great story isn't the only great thing about the film, we also get Burton's great direction. He gives the film both it's deep, dark tradition, as well as his dose of the bizarre and the weird. Danny Elfman's music is terrific, a cross between a superhero film and a dark gloomy film. Stefan Szapsky's photography works as well. It gives the film the film noir-ish atmosphere.At the ending of the first BATMAN, I had a good time, but got the feeling that I could have gotten more. But as the credits rolled in BATMAN RETURNS, it had me gutless and panting, because I got more than I expected, for a sequel.In the end, BATMAN RETURNS does its job, and does it well. It's not a film that I would recommend young kids too see, even if it's a film that usually appeals to them. But anyone above the age of any kid will enjoy this dark and impressive comic book movie. Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton Elevates It Over Its Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tim Burton's wonderfully whimsical style helps elevate this memorable sequel over many of its flaws. Michael Keaton returns as the Caped Crusader, this time called upon to halt a criminal alliance between The Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). The former is a grotesquely deformed sewer inhabiter with newfound political swing; the latter a sexy woman in black leather out for vengeance and aimless destruction. As different as they are, they do have something in common: a desire to rid Gotham City of Batman once and for all.The biggest beef one might have with BATMAN RETURNS is its excessive darkness and grim feel. People who watched the original BATMAN expecting a lighthearted superhero crusade were doubly surprised this time around. There is also a notable lack of the title character, who seemingly makes too few appearances throughout the 126-minute running span. But this is all mostly forgivable. The action scenes are highly entertaining without being over-the-top (Burton really should do more action... he's so good at it). Our black-rubber-wrapped antagonist has much more of a presence than he did last time. The film is so well-scripted, with interesting subplots of the Penguin's political power and Batman being framed, that the hero's limited screen time doesn't diminish the film.There are other things to like. The Penguin's circus gang make for some interesting fodder (though his deadly penguins armed with rockets were a little much). As usual, Burton delivers a striking backdrop, as Gotham City, seen here around the snowy holiday season, is breathtaking. The performances are solid, with Keaton able to carry the movie in the absence of Jack Nicholson's Joker. DeVito proved a perfect choice for the diminutive Penguin as he creates a complete maniac who can still draw much of our sympathy. Not to be outdone is Pfeiffer, who is superb as the hapless Selina Kyle and her tempting yet diabolical alter ego. And the element of romance, known to drag down many good-vs.-evil adventures, is a complement here given who is involved (Bruce Wayne aka Batman and Kyle aka Catwoman, but you already knew that).It's not entirely fair to compare BATMAN RETURNS with its predecessor because they are in reality two very different films. This one wins out in many areas, yet comes up short of the original in others. No matter what you think of this sequel, you won't be bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Darkest Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be clear from the start: I don't see "Batman Returns" as a Batman movie at all. I see it as a pure artistic expression on its own, a very personal projection from one of the most gifted directors in Hollywood.We're all fed the optimistic line that "we all have the power to be happy," but the world around us is still consumed in agonizing suffering. The best we can do is ignore such suffering, and try to think that the optimistic view does apply, even when in reality it only applies to some of us.This movie shatters such idea. The world is not a perfect place, and not even one where everybody can make do and learn to live with what they are given. The three main characters here are deeply wounded people, who cannot integrate to society and be happy like everybody else _even if they tried_.Batman is split because of the traumatic death of his parents. He enjoys the privileges of a rich man, has respectability through his Bruce Wayne mask, and somehow such respectability translates into a respectable pursuit: punishing evil, taking the side of good, becoming part of what makes society good, even if he has to remain hidden.In the case of Catwoman the trauma is deeper. She, as a secretary who is not given any respect for her idea and as someone who comes from a small town into the big city, is a marginal. Unlike Bruce Wayne, she has no fortune, her life is not at the center of "normalcy," and she finds herself abandoned--by her boyfriend, by her family, by the executives. In one very poignant scene, she is left to clean the table after the all-male executives leave.The imagery of abandonment continues (the calls from her mother reflect a difficult relationship, with little affection and much control; her boyfriend doesn't even have the spine to tell her directly he is leaving on his own). Abandonment plus marginality equal failure. Catwoman, even in her mousy avatar at the start of the movie, is a raging volcano. She makes that much clear in the final scene: she has gone beyond the level of rage that allows a person to try to adapt to normal society ("I just couldn't live with myself, so don't pretend this is a happy ending!"), and what is left for her is to be more radical than Batman: she will fight against the evil doers, but she won't take sides with the nice-and-proper. That makes her special and, in some ways, greater than Batman. She doesn't try to pass revenge as justice, no: she acknowledges it is revenge, and does not repent.The Penguin is by far the most disturbing character and the reason why many people hated this movie. What happens when you're born in such a way that there is no chance whatsoever to be "normal"? Unlike Catwoman or Batman, for the Penguin there is not the choice of pretending to be like other people--he is, evidently, too different."You're just jealous because I'm a genuine freak and you have to wear a mask," that marks the Penguin's reality. What could an intelligent (the Penguin's level of speech is amazingly elevated for someone who grew up in the sewers and as a freak in a circus, and attests to his intelligence) person for whom all possibilities of social integration are denied do? For the Penguin, society is the enemy. In truth, he has little (or no) choice.As Batman is the vigilante and Catwoman the avenger, the Penguin is the terrorist. He symbolizes the plight of those people who, for a reason or another (physical differences, religion, race, politics, language) are deemed "absolute marginals" in many parts of the world. And, as the terrorist doesn't blow himself or herself up for nothing, but because from his/her point of view there is nothing left but to kill and die, because for them life is hell and the hurt is so great the only way to pay it back somehow is by his/her own destruction and the destruction of those inflicting the pain, the Penguin has deep motives and, in spite of his hideousness and evil intentions, it is very difficult not to feel sad for him.That is a feeling most people would rather not have. We're much more comfortable thinking in terms of good and bad, so that we can put ourselves cleanly in the camp of goodness. Yet, here we have a deformed man who orders to kidnap children to kill them ("No! It's a lot!") and who plans to blow up a whole city, yet we cannot fail to somehow understand his motivations and feel sad at his death.That feeling makes us, who live comfortably in our little worlds isolated from the brutality of the lives of most people in this planet, feel bad. But that is Burton's master blow, too. Because in that moment when we understand a little, when we feel a little sorry for such an individual, we almost grasp what is behind so much of the pain and suffering in the world. Because the world is not black-and-white, it's much less comfortable than that.The imagery of abandonment is much more present with the Penguin: from the moment when he's dumped in the river to the last moment when all his circus minions leave. Catwoman rejects normalcy by rejecting the possibility of a life with Batman; the Penguin embraces marginality ("I am NOT a human being, I am an animal!") to the last, expected conclusion.In fact, this movie is a psychosocial study on marginality and abandonment, and the violence they generate. This is a subversive movie, because it makes us think beyond the terms of bad vs. good, and makes us realize how, in the grand scheme of things, we cannot judge others unless we have lived in their shoes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true Dark Knight returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is more Gothic and somber than its predecessor, and I like it a lot. Also, the scenery is more darker, and the entire environment is saddening along with the soul-chilling music composed by the so-talented Danny Elfman.However, I didn't like the idea to make the Penguin a monster, unlike to the comic books, where he's human. Even if he looks like a monster, he shows well that he possesses a human dignity, and I felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents. But still, he was a dangerous villain in fact, and he needed to be stopped.Michael Keaton made a "tour de force" with his return as the Dark Knight, and this time he's powerful as in the original Batman. It's not difficult to understand why he's called Batman in public sometimes...Also, Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and well-fitted in her role, and she gave a faithfully performance as the female villain/crimefighter dressed as a cat. Really, the actors did all a masterful work with Batman Returns, which made it a successful movie.If you liked Batman, watch its awesome sequel, cause it's very worthy for all the Dark Knight's hard-core lovers.Steve Baillargeon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Batman Returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns premiered 3 years after the first Batman, bringing back the Burton-Keaton team. The villains, although the spotlight is on both The Penguin and Catwoman, included a character created just for the sequel - Max Shreck, played by Christopher Walken, a corrupt mall chain owner bent on owning all of Gotham's electrical power.While the narrative managed to bring all 3 villains into the fold nicely, I felt that things could have been better if the focus was still kept on the main Bat villains. Since the villains again are the spotlight, I'll cover them first.Tim Burton's prints were everywhere in the creation of this version of the Penguin - a freak of nature, condemned to living in the sewers of Gotham while planning for his grand comeback to the real world, aided by Max Shreck. Again, the costume and makeup were until heavy wraps, and it was reported that Danny DeVito kept in character most of the time, hoping to beat his friend Jack Nicholson on the impact that this character could have on audiences. The Penguin's origin is one filled with, and ended in, tragedy. I remembered when this film came out, parents were up in arms against one of the scenes showing the Penguin spewing bile.Catwoman was changed too, as Frank Miller's Year One Selina Kyle was a hooker, which won't go down well with kids in audiences. Although some plot elements were not plausible, like Selina falling from a great height and brought to life by cats, the delivery was stylish, and Michelle Pfieffer oozed sensuality, vulnerability, yet tough as cookies, spunky attitude to Selina / Catwoman. The transformation scene with her making her own slinky costume and guzzling lots of milk was my favourite, and who could forget that kitty lick on the rooftop? Hot! (Not to mention that the costume was coming off and splitting along its seams as the movie progressed...) Credit to Burton though, while re-creating the villains origin, he kept iconic elements for each character intact, like the Top Hat, eye-glass, cigarette (on a holder), and gimmicky umbrellas for the Penguin, and Catwoman's whip and claws, although the narrative did not provide logical explanations on how she's trained on it (since she's a mousy secretary). Who cares though.Batman had a new costume with a proper logo. The look was sleeker, with chameleon-like abs. No qualms here though, as we know Batman has different costumes for separate occasions in the comics. Michael Keaton actually looked comfortable in the role. But still, the Batman killed. And that's a big no-no.With regards to the exploration of Bruce Wayne's love life, and falling for the villainess, this is my favourite amongst the 4 movies. Batman Returns had a strongest love story compared to the rest. The affections Bruce had for Selina even made him contemplate the notion (horrors!) of revealing his identity, and thoughts about giving up the mantle of the bat, just to be with her. (Ok, I know, in Batman Forever, he contemplated that too... more on that later) The theme of Duality took centerstage, as we saw all characters leading double lives, having to put on facades in the public, concealing their deepest darkest secrets and desires. The struggle with duality brought on a whole new meaning to the love lives of Bruce and Selina as well, and their revelation to each other on the dancefloor to the tune of Siouxee and the Banshees' Face to Face, and their reaction thereafter, was one of my favourite scenes in the movie.We began to see a glimmer of a strong partnership between Batman and Gordon in the film's beginning, but again, this was not exploited further. Given the plot, Gotham's Finest turned on the Batman, and it was fun to see him escape from the law.More toys were introduced (we still don't see where Batman gets his wonderful toys), and we saw the usage of the Bat-Glider (the stiffening of his cape), the good IL Batmobile being transformed into the Bat-missile, as well as the Bat-skiboat. The Penguin even had a mini-batmobile built, as well as a huge yellow Duck truck.Danny Elfman continued to score the movie, and brought in dark and separate themes for both The Penguin and Catwoman. The theme for Batman remained the same, though tweaked to highlight the movie's Christmassy setting. Only "Face to Face" made it into the soundtrack. No Prince or other artistes putting in music for this one.As a direct continuation from the first movie, we saw the use of the Bat-Signal. My gripe? Heck, Bruce Wayne is at home at night? He's the Batman, and on any night, he should be out there kicking the underworld's rear. He's proactive, obsessive, and obviously shouldn't have the Bat-Sginals mirrored in the rooftops of Wayne Manor.Batman Returns ended on a sad note, though with a flicker of hope that the Catwoman was still somewhere, somehow. Immediately after this movie, with Michelle Pfieffer's success in her role, word was out that a Catwoman spin-off might be in the works. Alas, what materialized was the disastrous Halle Berry effort.Many deemed this movie too dark, but in my opinion, this is one of the better Bat movies in terms of delivery, plot, and character motivation. It's unfortunate though, that this did not turn in expected returns at the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns - The definitive Psycho-Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Batman Returns that I recently posted on the board for the film: It's easily the best Batman movie and one of the best things Burton's made, as well as clearly being focused on Batman whether you like the way it does this or not. It has a very interesting structure, and I love the way the main theme of masks is cleverly woven from the first frame onward through the characters and all plot points (the public facade and the reality underneath). It's a very thematically padded and interesting film, as well as being a great modern era ode to German Expressionist film-making in its ability to communicate ideas visually.As far as saying it's Burton and not Batman, that's utter rubbish. It's Burton's take on Batman, and that's no more or less valid than anybody else's as there is no definitive version of the character but only personal interpretation. If this was not the case, we would not have all these varying versions throughout the history of the character. I think Burton noted this himself when talking about adapting the material -- that comic book continuity was unsound and was constantly reinventing itself as far as the character. That seems to bother many purists (who, oddly, miss the point that the character has no single version to point to), but the freedom allowed Burton on this project is what makes it so special -- basically an artist given free reign, which I think should be applauded.Like it or hate it, it's a rare commercial blockbuster that is clearly and deeply personal, and that seems to really rankle many -- i.e. it's not a typical, safe comic book movie as far as template but is instead something more artistic and bizarre therefore it's *beep* I truly think the film gets a bad rep just for being a Batman movie in various circles even though it's a superior work by Mr. Burton.It's a great movie in my view and a great interpretation of Batman that in its runtime examines the character and makes definitive statements about him within its narrative outline, specifically in its final confrontations when considered with the rest of the film (both Batman/Penguin and Batman/Catwoman have personal duels at the end which give us payoff in regards to the psychology of the titular character). And as far as there not being enough Batman, he's in the film a lot after the first thirty five minutes or so which are clearly dedicated to building up the other characters with this being important to the structuring of the film inherently and to the examination of the Batman/Wayne character under that structure. After the first half hour, it's very Bats heavy in its content and intent.I think depression, though not delved into, was a part of it, if not the psychosis, as shown through their choice of origins for the character and the impetus for his nightly work. Obviously it was not delved into much at all beyond cause and effect, but it's easy to read that into it even within that surface context. As far as definitive interpretation? There is none, even when just considering Kane/Finger's era, which about says it all.For my tastes, I like the depressed, psychotic Batman Burton gave us and think it's a logical idea. Not definitive, but certainly as valid as any other. And Burton certainly did play up the original grim vigilante theme, right down to the killing, that Kane/Finger started with themselves -- on a purely aesthetic basis such as that (and considering the rather blank nature of the character in regards to psychology at this point, mood, overall action and look are about the only important things to translate from those earliest of stories which I think Burton did rather masterfully), it was more based on Batman's early beginnings than most other stuff when looking at its overall noir presentation as far as both mood and character.The Kane/Finger Batman, in simplest terms, was a lone vigilante that was soon revealed to be driven by the death of his parents --all of this can be said for Burton's Batman as well, with the main difference being that he was most interested in the psychology behind the actions of the main character (including the killing that is notably present in the two versions) rather than just the actions themselves as far as point a to point b narrative resolution.I think it's largely forgotten in many comic story lines that the underlying basis for Batman's nightly jaunts is psychological imbalance -- both as far as the depression and the heavily weird/illogical/psycho way he chooses to deal with that, by dressing up as a bat of all things. If you portray this on film and want it to be taken seriously at all, I think the point has to be made that this is not a psychologically healthy character at all, otherwise you get camp. If you don't deal with the central idea being a character that acts out in the manner he does because of lacking mental health in much the same way as the villains he encounters -- it's obvious, but sometimes forgotten, that the basis of so many of these characters stems from their psychological traumas, and that Batman's the same when you contrast underlying motivations.If Spider-Man's a soap, then Batman's a psycho-drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than the First One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always thought that "Batman Returns" was better than the first "Batman" movie. It may be because there are two villains this time, but I think that there's more to it than just that. They do still have Michael Keaton, who happens to be the best Batman compared to Val Kilmer and George Clooney. I thought that this was perfectly cast. Danny DeVito is great at portraying a dark side of the penguin character. The reason I love Tim Burton for directing these movies is he is showing a dark side of the Batman series, and of the villains. Michelle Pfeiffer is great at playing two roles as a stressed business woman and a feline-fanatic villain. The story of this movie was definitely well written. I almost forgot to mention Christopher Walken. Even though he isn't exactly considered to be a villain in this movie, he does a good job at acting as a somewhat psychotic businessman.Altogether, this has great actors, a great story, and Tim Burton tried something new for this movie, and made it great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the series--Way better than the 1989 film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it better? Because it's true to the dark vision of the comic. Because the imagery is inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one. The first one had too much of Jack Nicholson's shtick, too much Prince music, and an awkward "romance." Here, instead of one villain, there are three. No Robert Wuhl, and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the #1 attraction of this film. Her transformation is what drives the running theme, teetering on the edge of sanity and insanity, good and evil. She becomes truly fearsome. The costumes and makeup are excellent. Danny DeVito's Penguin is inspired and anguished, not just a nut. His circus gang posse is the one element of comic relief (besides that giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character I'd have toned down, Walken is pretty hammy as the ruthless businessman. Danny Elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual, and the Siouxie and the Banshees song ("Face to Face") is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films, a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack. The least campy of the films, it is macabre, doesn't pander, and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride. Bravo Tim Burton and cast!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about Batman Returns is that, when you watch it, you manage to forget how much Joel Schumacher has destroyed the franchise. Batman Returns takes these famous characters and explores them deeply and disturbingly. What Burton started in Batman, he continues in this wildly stylistic sequel.Though in terms of writing and acting, the greatest success is celebrated by the villains. In Catwoman, we see Michelle Pfeiffer transform from a twitchy, nervous, and undertrod secretary into a dark, confident psychopath. Pfeiffer's performance in Returns is one of the most unsung in the history of film. We see her degenerate from scene to scene, slowly losing control, until the breaking point at the climax.Then there's the Penguin, bent on revenge against all the silver spooners who thrived where his parents abandoned him. His interaction with society can be easily compared to that of Edward Scissorhands. When they first recieve him, the city is thrilled at the novelty of his otherness, but they turn on him in an instant. The only difference is that the Penguin deserves it. In the end, he's abandoned once again, by the city, by his co-conspirators, and finally, by his avian minions themselves.Batman Returns takes what could have easily just been another pop culture action film and turns it into a twisted reflection on some very disturbed characters. Gotham City, under the direction of Burton, remains dark and gothic, unstained by the neon and blacklights that Schumacher would later invade it with.Returns is, and probably will always be, the last Batman movie to stay true to what Batman was truly about, a dark man, in a dark city, trying to find the light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This time around, Tim Burton messed up. With Michael Keaton returning to the title role of Batman, and adding Michele Pfieffer as the Cat Woman and Danny DeVito as the Penguin, you would think that this coupled with the hype from the first movie would be enough to propel this movie into the stratosphere. Well, in my opinion, you will find yourself being disappointed. While Michele Pfieffer is as sexy as could be in a sleek, tight, all leather black suit, Danny DeVito strikes out as the least scary villain Penguin. This movie is a big disappointment to the Batman saga, and should be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opinion of The Movie Changed Over the Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first Saw this film, I wasn't as big on it as I was on the first one. This feeling went on for many years and it is reflected in an earlier review I wrote on the film back in 2002. Now, after having seen Batman Returns within the last 4 to 6 years, I have had a changed of mind on this film and consider it my favorite of the four Batman films made from 89-97. It has a feel that I connected with more recently than I did during my earlier viewings. The villains walk a blurred line between evil and pathetic and sometimes this line blurs where they are interchangeable. Sure the film has its flaws, but still I think it is well made and a little underrated. That is a sadness that hovers over the characters like a overseeing shadow. I wish they had bought back Michelle Pfeiffer's Cat Woman for another film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>20 years on and still the better Batman movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yikes, cant believe this film has reached its 20th anniversary! I was only 5 when this hit theaters but I do remember watching this many times on videotape. Anyway, I'm here to give the new revised review of this amazing film. Looking back at the batman movies, this one comes off as rather unique. Its not your atypical comic book movie in that it doesn't just have loads of action with one fight scene after another. not that it doesn't have its fair share of exciting action scenes, but its more about the characters and how they relate to each other, almost like little character studies. there's a reason why the tagline for the movie is "the bat, the cat, the penguin". the movie is all about these 3 characters. One thing that strikes me is the emotional level this film achieves. Its quite amazing what Burton did with the characters, particularly the 2 villains. In the comic books, they are very 2-dimensional characters. Catwoman is just a hot chick who likes to steal things, and Penguin is just a little roly poly guy who wears a tux. If there were ever 2 characters that were in dire need of a face lift, its these 2. Tim Burton gives them both a rather incredible amount of depth and pathos. Penguin is a deformed guy who years after being dumped in the sewer, seeks revenge not only against Gotham city, but more specifically, its children. Talk about a disturbed individual. Catwoman on the other hand was a quiet put upon woman treated badly by her employer, who eventually tries to kill her. This makes her go into a fit of rage, a sequence in which Selina totally lets loose in her apartment, which is quite a powerful scene and which also shows why I love Michelle pfeiffer. Very, very talented actress. Its in this moment she becomes cat woman. Sure beats the hell out of the comics version. Then there is Batman, once again dark and brooding Michael Keaton, born to play this part, who has seemingly no life beyond waiting for that big bat in the sky to call him to duty. During the course of the movie, all these characters go in and out of each others lives, betray each other, love each other, fight each other. The 3 leads are superb together, and the casting for this movie is PERFECT. I mean cmon, who else could possibly play the Penguin? Seriously? But besides the action scenes and the amazing visuals that Burton does so well, there is something about this movie, a kind of sad feeling, especially during the climax. These aren't just your typical run of the mill comic book villains and heroes. These are deeply hurt, deeply scarred people who inhabit this dark wonderland of Gotham city. The penguin acts and behaves like your usual crazy super villain, but at the same time you realize, why is he targeting little kids as his aim of his revenge? Because he himself was thrown into the sewer as a small child and now wants to reenact this on the children of Gotham. Hes hurting. Catwoman and Batman are both messed up which makes them perfect for each other, but they can never truly be together because of the very things that draw them together. The ballroom scene between Selina and Bruce is one of the best scenes in the movie. What can I say, Tim Burton is a master of visuals, a true genius of dark filmmaking. Such is his talent of creating an amazing and creepy atmosphere. He is, as far as I'm concerned, the only guy fit to direct a batman movie. He just gets it. The nerds and basment dwellers who judge a movie simply on how accurate it is to the source material are just narrow minded haters, especially since its popular right now to hate on the older films in order to "prop up" the newer movies. the comics by the way, are not the Bible. characters and origins are constantly changing and being re-envisioned by different artists writers. one minute penguin is a tux wearing, snooty, intelligent human being, the next hes a monstrous, bulbous, disgusting slob with claws/"flippers" and long greasy hair. nothing remains the same for too long in the comics, so when it comes to comic books, nothing in set in concrete. its more up to personal taste, and i believe that burton took the source material and simply added to its greatness. he took the characters and made them so much more compelling then they ever were in the comic books. isn't that what the films are supposed to do?Its really quite sad to see people and the weird crazy internet culture having this massive hard-on for Christopher Nolan's boring, bourgeois bland take on the character. heath ledger did not deserve the Oscar, and was the worst version of joker I've ever seen. Out of all 6 batman films made, none of them I believe have the same kind of raw emotion of this particular batman film. I also like the film also because it deals with outcasts, of which I feel very much an outcast in many ways so I can relate to it. Heck even here on IMDb I am an outcast, as I hate movies that most people seem to love and I love movies people seem to hate! I hate the new Batman's. I think they are dull lifeless garbage. Does that make me Mr. popular or what? But I stick to my thoughts and wont bend just to make some stupid shmoe happy. So there's always this tension with people because my tastes are different. Lets face facts here, most modern versions of thing's suck, and that includes the new batmans. the original 3 are the best, simple as that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than the first Burton Batman outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three years after Batman Tim Burton was back with the caped crusader and what a difference a holiday makes. Batman Returns is very different from the first outing. Firstly it oozes Burton, the musical score that plays from the very outset is very reminiscent of other Burton films, it has that element of fantasy and whimsy to it.The style of the film is different. Gotham City is no longer dark and ominous, but more lighter, there's more colour and the sets and back drops seem to work better and look more realistic. That adds a much more enjoyable element to the film and makes it more watchable. But there is more to like in this film. The villains are fantastic in this. Danny DeVito is brilliant as the creepy deformed Penguin, his performance is so good, combining a dark character with hints of DeVito's comic side. Michael Keaton returns in this sequel and he's good, but again he has little to do really. Christopher Walken also does a good job, but he is less Walken in this and that seems a shame. However the stand out here is Michelle Pfeiffer. Playing the hard working secretary who is reborn as Catwoman, she is brilliant. The contrast between the Selina and Catwoman is perfect, with her Catwoman being sexy, sly and full of wonderful lines; the scene where she says 'Meow' before the building blows up, may be the best delivered singular word line in movie history! There are wonderful fight scenes between her and Batman that touch on the campness that can be found in the TV series and Batman gets to play with some more toys and vehicles. The Penguin's mob and the theme of Freaks and circus's also work well and also show the Burton mind at work.It's amazing how different the two films are and how much better and more enjoyable this one is despite the same director and movie studio being involved. The next two Batman films in this outing had different directors and actors playing Batman and were very much disliked. It would have been interesting to see what had happened had Burton stayed, of course he didn't, but at least we still can enjoy this.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Equally good and almost superior to Burton's 1989 original. And it's also dark and gloomy in it's own way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1992's "Batman Returns" was Tim Burton's second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one. Gotham City again is a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out from every street corner. It was also clever to see how Burton used politics as a subplot that tied in well and neat with the business corruption of businessman Max Shreck(Christopher Walken)and the plan to make the "Penguin"(Danny DeVito) mayor of Gotham! Anyway Keaton again returns as "Batman"/Bruce Wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world yet he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in Selina Kyle only Ms. Kyle has a dark secret of her own one that's very slinky and she's just a downright vamp as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous "Catwoman"(Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan forms between both villains to destroy Gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat. Really this film even though violent and somewhat gross with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish as you never find a dull moment and thumbs up to Tim again for his exploring of the characters as dark and conflicted it just made the film even more interesting. The performance from Michelle Pfeiffer was the best ever as no one could have played "The Catwoman" any better and Devito was perfect as the "Penguin" his body frame fit the character just perfect his performance even though ghoulish was fun to watch. "Batman Returns" is an entertaining thrill ride that you can't take your eyes off of as a viewer you will enjoy it many times it's that thrilling and explosive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike other follow-ups of the saga this one is artistically and atmospherically superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I extremely like about "Batman" (1989) bounces back again in "Batman Returns": schizophrenic characters (in "Batman" there were at least two super-schizophrenics - I shouldn't name them, should I? - but here there are distinctive three of them), enchanting atmosphere (the sets are beautiful, "gothically" menacing, and simply outstanding), cool acting (when I say "cool acting" I mean my absolute inability to poke finger at the characters with disrespect and contempt; quite the other way round: I do respect all the characters here, while they are never goofy, stupid, or over-sentimental), great action scenes (fighting against the hordes of clowns, great acrobatic stunts - I am especially happy with that scene where clowns are jumping onto the Xmas tree and bring havoc to the streets of Gotham, effective explosions, insane killing sprees, etc.), sharp black humour which reminds me of "Hamlet" (remember the trio wild chemistry?), fine music (it is far from being some monotonous junk or over-imposed opera pieces) and tons of other minor "Easter eggs".By the way, I had a chance to watch "Batman Begins" one day - is it supposed to be good? No way, it is clumsy. They ruined the whole concept one more time. Why do people go for those "zero copies"? Wasn't "Batman and Robin" enough? I respect Mr Tim Burton for quitting the "Batman" project after this film. He's done more than enough for making the figure of on-screen Batman legendary. And when you think about comics as the source for the movie, you get the idea: this film is a damn impressive achievement.10 out of 10 - it is as good as the original. Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catwoman. Meow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this film a 10 rating if only for Michelle Pfeiffer's wondrous portrayal of catwoman. As a child growing up, catwoman was an icon for me and Pfeiffer's portrayal was remarkable. Even now, as i am older, the performance still holds up as one of my favorite performances of all time. She didn't just portray one character to perfection but played three. It's remarkable that she can meld all three sides of Selina Kyle together so perfectly. That being said, I enjoyed the film thoroughly. It was much more Gothic and surreal than any other Batman film. I think some scenes may be a little "frightening" for younger kids though, such as the scene where Penguin bites the reporter's nose or when catwoman falls into the greenhouse and starts to scream. I thought Danny Devito did a good job, and Keaton did what the role called for. I especially enjoyed Christopher Walken's Max Shreck. Well I love anything that man does, he's just a howling good time. But back to catwoman. She was just gorgeous, crazed, sexy and stunning. Her whip-cracking, her black eye shadow and pale skin, and her vinyl suit are a perfect combo. Her lunacy makes her all the more sexy. Too bad Halle Berry completely ruined catwoman in the self-titled flop. We'll all remember Michelle as the goddess in the black suit. Meow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior comic book masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a rush of comic book films lately that have garnered high praise, but what everyone seems to be forgetting is that, over a decade ago, Tim Burton made a film that is easily on par with the best comic book adaptations being made today; maybe even better. The film is, of course, Batman Returns; which can only be described as an all out comic book masterpiece. Quite frankly, everything that could be good about this film; is great. Tim Burton has succeeded on a number of levels to bring us the ultimate comic book movie - the characters, the plot, the atmosphere - everything in this film is right on cue. What really annoyed me about the first Batman film was that Burton didn't seem to know where he wanted the focus. It seemed as if he wanted it to be more on The Joker, but then he threw in some character building for Batman; and the final result was very messy. This has been sorted out for this film, and although it has once again left Batman in the shadows; Burton has given us two great villains to have fun with, and the fact that the focus is more on them only makes the film better.The plot mainly follows a young child that was dumped into the sewers at birth. This child would grow up to become 'The Penguin', and he chooses to rise from the sewers at around the same time that businessman Max Schrek has decided to throw his secretary, Selina Kyle out of the window; who then becomes her alter ego, Catwoman. The Penguin and Max Schrek then team up so that the former can get his revenge on Gotham City, and, of course, the caped crusader is on hand to dispatch the baddies. The plot isn't all that deep or intelligent, but it serves it's purpose and allows Tim Burton to do what he really wanted to do with the movie; create a very dark Gothic look for Gotham City! Batman's home town looks absolutely fabulous throughout this film, and the winter setting blends magnificently with Burton's Gothic architecture to create a world that excellently compliment's it's hero's dark personality, while creating a great aesthetic playground for Burton to weave his tale within.It's not just the atmosphere that makes this film what it is - a plethora of great performances have been added into the mix, with each performer giving great energy and enthusiasm to their roles. Michael Keaton returns to his role as the caped crusader, and pretty much does what he did in the last film. He's never really given a chance to impress, as his three villainous counterparts constantly upstage him. Danny DeVito is supremely grotesque in his role as The Penguin, and makes sure that he holds the focus in every scene he's in. This sort of role suits an actor like DeVito excellently, and this is the best I've ever seen him. On the flip side to The Penguin, we have Catwoman; who is played by the very sexy Michele Pfifer. She looks great in her black leather suit, and her demented portrayal as the tortured villain works brilliantly. Rounding off the cast is the magnificent Christopher Walken. Walken has an uncanny ability of making a huge impression in everything he's in, and his dark and downbeat portrayal as a shrewd businessman is just great.On the whole, I highly recommend this film to everyone. While the substance isn't always there, Burton has given this sequel enough style and enough entertainment value to more than adequately mask that fact and if you're a fan of cinema; I see no reason to dislike this film.</fullReview>

They say it has elements of S&amp;M but I really don't find anything of that sort except for Catwoman's whip.This movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) isn't just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and Pinguin... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by Danny DeVito). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he carries his costume well.You can totally see that it is a Tim Burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo: my favourite Batman movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his sequel to the hit movie Batman (1989), Tim Burton is given more creative control over his project and it really shows. Batman Returns explores common themes of Burton's, and it rivals Edward Scissorhands as being his best work. It makes changes to the Batman legend but not as severe as has been alleged.Visually this movie is masterful. The movie is surreal: it's like a nightmare vision. But there's actually usually overlooked substance in addition to style. The central theme of this movie is being a freak or an outcast. The Penguin at one point struggles with Batman, accusing him of being jealous because Penguin is odd physically as well as mentally. Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle also sit on a couch and talk about being strange, with Selina making a true but odd statement that sickos are committed. In this movie, two freaks find each other and discover they can feel a connection with another person. The movie goes on to argue that when you find out that you're a creep, you can go either way- you can fight for what's right or give into anger, hatred and a drive for revenge.Being pushed around can make you a monster: it happened to Penguin who was dropped into a sewer and to Catwoman who was thrown out a window. But giving into darkness will destroy you- the Penguin at the end pushes the button to set off his missiles, and this destroys his whole world. Meanwhile, Catwoman misses out on her happy ending. The only character in the movie who appears to be truly evil is the businessman Max Shreck, who manipulates and abuses- and when you do that, one day you may just face the consequences. Shreck gets fried.The movie is packed with quotable dialogue: "Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask." "How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?" One of my favourite quips is from a security guard who says he doesn't know whether to open fire or fall in love. There's much twisted humour to enjoy.The music, too, helps make this movie great. This includes the tragic music that plays at the ending, and sexy, mysterious music for Catwoman. A song that plays at the dance and over the end credits also fits Catwoman, being dark and sexy.I know Batman fans were disappointed in that the caped crusader kills a couple goons; the character is today expected to have a no-killing rule, although he didn't in the first Batman comics. Still, note Batman doesn't kill except when in combat- when you have captured an enemy (Shreck at the end), killing becomes unnecessary and dangerous, a mere act of revenge. Also said fans may not like the Penguin being a freak in the sewer- but he *is* still a crime boss who works in secret while trying to join higher society (in this case by running for mayor); he still retains his love of birds and umbrellas.This is with apologies to Christopher Nolan, but Batman Returns remains my favourite Batman movie. I don't hate Nolan for not being Burton- on the contrary, I enjoyed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and thought they surpassed Batman '89. But Batman Returns is an entirely different creature- it captures the anguish and glories of the modern freak. It's a tragedy masked as a superhero movie, unique and beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always thought the Batman Returns was a great sequel to Batman. The story was an interesting one and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave great performances. Plus lets face it, Tim Burton was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than Joel Screwmacher ever did.Plot: Oswald Cobblepot also know as The Penguin(played By Danny Devito) is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed. He uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of Gotham with the help of his goons(Red Triangle Gang) and a very shady tycoon Max Shreck(played by Christopher Walken). Max Shreck later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle(Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by Max Shreck and is revived by cats. Later on she develops cat-like qualities and seeks to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. Her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained.Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic. It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. Tim Burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing. Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have made a better Violator for the movie Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever could. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason why I like Batman Returns is that its fun. Its not only creative but its also fun. Something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton decided to do no more. You don't believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thank god that Christopher Nolan breathed life back into the series with Batman Begins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; Bad Of 'Batman Returns'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a long time, this was my favorite of the Batman films. It had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the always-interesting Christopher Walken. However, after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and, frankly, I now prefer the last Batman: Batman Begins, with Christian Bale.THE GOOD - Nonetheless, this is still the most intriguing of the five latter-day Batman films. The stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals, as this is a great example. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Of the villains, I preferred Catwomen, finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed. Violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other Batman stories but one is never bored watching this. As he did in the first film, Michael Keaton does a fine job playing Batman/Bruce Wayne.THE BAD - For a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read, I still think these first two Batman movies, both done by Burton, were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate. Although, unlike the first movie, there was no usage of the Lord's name in vain in here, there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks. That would have been okay if they hadn't marketed this film for kids as well as adults. Danny DeVito's "Penguin" is downright gross in spots. "Grotesque" I can handle, but who wants "gross." Few guys, meanwhile, complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer playing Catwoman. Generall too much darkness and some cheap shots on Christian- bashing also made me re-consider my previously-high rating of this film.OVERALL - Fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the Batman series, but too-dark an edge, too gross and too much anti-religious bias all finally turned me off after a half-dozen looks at this film. Sorry, but I prefer a kinder-gentler Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most will disagree, but I was glad to see the series lighten up after this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gotham City is a majestic presence in this movie. It looks lavish enough for its budget to have fed the entire population of Upper Volta for a year.I kind of like it, mostly because it featured two of my costars, Michael Keaton in the superb art-house hit, "Squeeze," and Pat Hingle, who was my supporting player in the memorable, umm, whatever it was. It will come when it will come.Keaton is laid back, even a bit sluggish, as Bruce Wayne. Danny DeVito as the Penguin is not at all sluggish. He waddles around in a fat suit and wears enough makeup to disguise his human identity. Michelle Pfeiffer makes a sleek Cat Woman in a black plastic outfit. Christopher Walken in a gray wig stands out as a corrupt mayor. Christopher Walken always stands out.But what's it all about? It's all full of fireworks but it's not the Fourth of July, just a run of the mill Tuesday or something. Is it supposed to be sufficiently entertaining just to look at movie stars in costumes running around in expensive sets? I only ask because there's not much more to the film than that. And if that's your pleasure, you'll certainly find it here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark fantasy Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to "Batman" (1989) is just as dark and gritty and has a greater premise: once again Batman (Michael Keaton) is called for to defend Gotham, but this time: His main enemy, Penguin (Danny DeVito) is not simply a homicidal maniac, but also character who apparently desires to be accepted into society, while secretly leading a group of outcast villains, the Red Triangle Circus,and with a plan for revenge on the city in mind; Into play then comes a very special woman with whom he will fall in love with as well as try to stop, Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), and a corrupt and powerful and ruthless businessman, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who is tied to both other villains.Returning from the first movie aside from Keaton are Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon.The characters all have a Burton-like twist to them and are still not very far away from other versions, looking closely.The main four actors (Keaton, DeVito, Pffeifer and Walken)'performances lead up to a great climax and the characters' destinies will have the film end on a bittersweet note for our hero.All this with a dark Christmas atmosphere, fantasy visuals and familiar soundtrack, and a cold beauty queen in Cristi Conaway's Ice Princess, too.Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it. But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michelle Pfeiffer steals the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always loved this version of Batman, only because of his counterpart, Catwoman. Michelle Pfeiffer steals the show with her stunning and sexy portrayal of the femme fatale, Catwoman. She is the best thing, after the amazing performance of the creepy and slimy Penguin, about this movie, and I don't think any other Catwoman can do her any justice. I first saw this movie when I was very young - perhaps 4 or 5 years old? I remember at the time all the visuals and special effects looked stunning. Now, granted, this movie is from 1992 so obviously, the visuals of more recent Batman movies shouldn't be compared. However, watching this in 2015, with some hindsight and seeing the Dark Knight trilogy and the more recent angsty/deep portrayals of Batman's character, this movie lost its magic for me. It's beautiful if you look at it in terms of classic Tim Burton, but in terms of an action film, it isn't quite up to par with more recent interpretations. Michael Keaton's Batman simply doesn't cut it anymore.But Penguin and Catwoman hands down are the signature performances of this movie and I challenge Hollywood to one-up either Michelle Pfeiffer or Danny de Vito in their portrayals here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns is dark, violent and a worthy sequel to the 1989 Batman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a 1992 American superhero film, directed and produced by Tim Burton, based upon the Batman character appearing in comics published by DC Comics. It is the second installment of Warner Bros.' initial Batman film series, with Michael Keaton reprising the title role of Bruce Wayne/Batman. One of the darker films ever made. Batman Returns is dark, violent and a worthy sequel to the 1989 Batman. Danny DeVito gave a brilliant performance as The Penguin.The only two good things in this movie are return of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Danny DeVito as The Penguin. I thought classic original Batman (1989) was way better film than this. Batman Returns is my fourth favorite Batman film in the franchise. The film has a many problems in here I didn't like and it annoys me, but there are other things I did like and love in the second installment.Things I don't like in this film: Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle/ Catwoman she was extremely violent woman. I still couldn't believe how could an grown aged woman act like a child, trying to be an animal and than she just rip off a harmless pet rubber animals stuff them in a sinker , destroying a doll house, spraying a t-shirt and than acting that she is the queen in this movie? She wasn't written and portrayed by the comic books like was Anne Hathaway in The Dark Knight Rises. Selina Kyle was never a secretary like she was in Shreck Company, she wasn't a vigilante, violent or angry woman. She was a cat burglar and a thief. She didn't went around cutting people like she did in this film, she only did what was necessary to do for survival. That is the main problem in this film. I still prefer and Think Kim Basinger is much better better actress than Michelle Pfeifer is and I still love Vicky Vale much better than Selina Kyle. Sorry Bat fans. I wish there wouldn't be Max Shreck in this film because he look's like a selfish lunatic person. Those are the main problems I don't like in this film, that is why I prefer The Dark Knight and Batman (1989) over this film.Things I do like in this film:The Action sequences are outstanding and awesome and Fight sequences are fantastic. The first fight between Batman and Catwoman is awesome. The film is very dark which I love that in the film. Michael Keaton reprise his role back as Bruce Wayne/Batman. It is my childhood film and I will always watch it. It was a big hit in 1992 when the film come out, there were different times then, than they are today. The story centers around Christmas Eve. The Penguin, releases several bats that fly frantically around the girl's (Ice Princess) head, causing her to lose her balance and fall, but giving the impression that Batman, visible to the crowd below, had pushed her. She lands on the tree switch, lighting it up and unleashing a flurry of bats that the Penguin had hidden within the branches. Batman attempts to flee. I love that Batman flees in this film around Bats flying the crowd. It shows his symbol stands for Bat which he is a Batman. He also try to save that girl when she was kidnapped but couldn't. The Penquin and Catwoman becomes alley and they set up Batman to be a criminal. I love how The Penguin had placed a control device under the car that let he himself steer it from an arcade-style car hidden in a trailer. Batman, helpless, is trapped behind the wheel of the Batmobile as it veers through the streets, knocking over city property and frightening citizens. Batman manages to remove the control device before anyone is killed, and returns home. That is the best awesome scene I have seen. Batskiboat using in this film that batman drives on the sewer was FANTASTIC! Beside Batmobil there was other vehicle used in this film. Batman saving all the children from Penquin was also awesome. Batman was a real hero in this film. There was no Robin in here. Which I am happy about it. Batman does not need any sidekick to help him out. I hate Robin, don't get me wrong I don't like that character and I never did. Michael Keaton Is excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman his acting performance to me in both Burton films is better than Christian Bale is. Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne was a clearly uncomfortable man, a mumbling solitary eccentric, ill at ease in his own skin and with other people. In the Batsuit, though, he becomes the beast he really is, an imposing personification of vengeance and fear, despite his slighter frame. There's something far more sympathetic about Keaton's Bruce Wayne. Maybe it's because he was never recorded throwing a wobbler on set. Tim Burton did a great job directing and producing the second Batman film. I love the costume designer by Bo Welch for Catwoman, Batman and Penquin. J. P. Morgan's wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's costume design. I think those three actors Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeifer did a great character chemistry and good acting performance. CGI was also not bad for the bats I real love it. I love this film not as much as I love The Dark Knight and Batman but I still love it. The rating I give to this film is 8/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film.9/10 Grade: A- Studio: Warner Bros. Pictures, DC Comics Starring: Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny DeVito, Christopher Walken Director: Tim Burton Producers: Tim Burton, Denise Di Novi Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 6 Mins.

The Sequel manages to be as good as Batman but not better the cast does a great job and Tim Burton returns for one last time as the Director. Returns also has a great soundtrack like the first film had and the action is pretty amazing as it was in the first film fans of the Batman will love this film it's full of really good action scenes and it has a great direction. It's really sad that Tim Burton never made another Batman film it would be as great as the first two films. My Final Verdict in this amazing movie is a 9.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never bring a cat in front of a bat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thirty three years later Batman is still the same age and Alfred Pennyworth has not caught one single wrinkle more. They are beyond time. That's of course the very first axiom of a comic strip, hence of any comic strip super hero (look at Tintin for one). They do not age. Around them though people are getting old of course, but since very few are the same from one film to the next it does not matter. And of course Batman's paramour of the first film has disappeared from the picture, or should I say pictures?Then the plot has to be really renewed indeed. Tim Burton has decided to make it a lot more complex and complicated. Instead of one good one, Batman, and one bad one, here the Penguin, he gets two more, both on the evil side, though one is slightly insecure as for her profile between good and evil. Catwoman is a funny addition here because she is a super hero who is supposed to enhance Batman more than achieve anything. She is a simple secretary that her boss decides one day to kill by pushing her through a window. But she survives. There are miracles like that in life. And she becomes Catwoman out of her total insanity. Her only objective is to be a nuisance but on any side available though at the last minute she rejects Batman because it might be too confusing since Batman proposes to get into a love affair but under his real identity of Bruce Wayne. True enough a cat and a bat together in the same bed does not sound serious.The second addition, and frankly only evil, is the industrialist Shreck who wants to build a power station that would produce a lot more than necessary. But the real problem his secretary, the future Catwoman, discovered is that the factory will be an environmental and ecological catastrophe (3that will be my legacy" says Mr. Shreck, showing how vain industrialists can and may be.). The film is very skimpy on this problem and Bruce Wayne, at the end, only tells him to stop speaking because anyway he is going to prison as soon as the film is finished.The main character against Batman is the Penguin, a melodramatic orphan (self orphaned probably), a pathetic story teller, a miserable violent and criminal ambitious nincompoop, a lackluster entertainer who is just the addition of poop to nin, nothing, though it means "not of sound mind" in Latin. He lives with a whole flock of penguins in an Arctic kingdom of some sort in the sewers and he is surrounded by a band of social cases who are jugglers, acrobats, whizz kids, and plain clowns and criminals who are just there to entertain the crowd before shooting them down like useless dogs. Though it is a clich to say that a social case or a serial killer is the result of the bad education given to a child by his parents, it is done effectively to make us believe that the poor chap has become a criminal by choice vastly teleguided by what society made him suffer, bear and endure, in this case because he has a certain physical malformation that becomes his total fixation. His orientation and fixation then is a bird that does not fly and eats salmon. I guess that would easily be considered by some as the eleventh gender orientation, because as for gender he is nothing but a bird of no feather at all.The action is packed, the violence is brutal, which is expected, and the end is sadly unromantic, which is saluted by the audience as a good thing because if a cat meets a bat I do not know what kind of a chat they could have under their hats, and one cannot pat the other but scratch and when the other sat on the first one she felt like a rebellious mat. And imagine a rat in that couple. The two would be fighting to have a good bite into it. An entertaining film with some obnoxious situations for obnoxious people, like the mayor of Gotham, or Mr. Shreck. You should get some kicks out of these human animal hybrids.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bat. The Cat. The Penguin. This tagline perfectly summed up Batman Returns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the blockbusting success of Batman (1989), Michael Keaton returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Tim Burton returns to the director's chair in Batman Returns. This time there are two villains, The Penguin and Catwoman, that Batman must face off against. The film is noticeably darker compared to the first movie, and some parts were violent. Looking back now, its no wonder many parents were complaining that Batman Returns had scared and upset many young kids. Despite the fact Batman Returns was a box office success in 1992, it was a shame that Warner Bros asked Tim Burton to step aside from future directorial duties with the Batman franchise and in return Joel Schumacher took the family-friendly route with Batman Forever (1995) and Batman and Robin (1997) which did the franchise more harm that good. Michael Keaton also declined to return as Batman when Tim Burton did not return, with Val Kilmer and George Clooney respectively donning the Batman suit.Michael Keaton returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne who as Batman must take on The Penguin and Catwoman who both have sinister motives to cause chaos in Gotham City. Also, Bruce Wayne must contend with shady businessman Max Shreck who has sinister motives to build a power plant to drain Gotham City of its energy as well as pushing The Penguin for Mayor. Besides Christian Bale, I have always liked Michael Keaton as Batman. He brings a very darkly comic side to his role as well as maintaining a heroic and dramatic edge.Danny De Vito is totally unrecognisable in one of his best roles as The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot, who lives in the sewers after he is dumped into a river as a baby by his high society parents 33 years ago after the discover to their horror that he is deformed. Oswald Cobblepot is raised in the sewers by a flock of penguins thus he later adopts his alter ego as The Penguin. The Penguin hatches a plan to unleash chaos onto Gotham City with the Red Triangle Gang made up of circus members, but not before kidnapping Max Shreck and blackmailing him into helping him become an accepted citizen in Gotham City as well as Max Shreck pushing him as a mayoral candidate in order to win over the support and appeal of the citizens of Gotham City.Michelle Pfeiffer is the mousy secretary Selina Kyle who Max Shreck and other corporate bosses treat her with contempt. Selina Kyle uncovers Max Shreck's sinister motives for his power plant and is pushed out of a window, believed to be killed. Selina Kyle is revived by a flock of cats and later violently lashes out, destroying her apartment and transforming her new life and personality by donning a new costume, adopting her new alter ego as Catwoman. Selina Kyle's personality also has transformed from meek and mild to deranged and sexually charged.Christopher Walken is the shady businessman Max Shreck who is seen as Gotham City's larger than life savior yet has sinister greedy motives to drain Gotham City of its power supply through his new power plant which will also see him rake in a lot of profit. Christopher Walken also bring an occasionally dark, deadpan and subtle humorous side to Max Shreck.Tim Burton is a quality director and he continues to bring his dark, brooding vision to the Batman franchise with this welcome sequel to the 1989 blockbuster. The story is excellent, art direction and make up top notch. The standout is The Penguin's make up, transforming Danny De Vito into an unrecognisable villain. The main cast which includes Michael Keaton, Danny De Vito, Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken were top notch.Besides The Dark Knight trilogy, Batman Returns did have a reputation for being violent and dark for children, however The Dark Knight trilogy did not seem to receive any criticisms, with audiences accepting that it would not be suitable for young children. As a 8 year old, I was shocked that Batman Returns received a M 15+ rating in Australia, however upon seeing it on home video, I wasn't bothered by its dark tone at all. After Batman Returns, the Batman franchise became family-friendly which may have seen the decline of the Batman franchise. To the relief of many Batman fans such as myself, Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale resurrected the Batman franchise with Batman Begins (2005).Batman Returns is still a pleasure to watch, although nothing can surpass the first Batman movie. Though it may be dark for a Batman movie, I still enjoy watching Batman Returns.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great cast, but the direction and story telling leave much to be desired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Batman Returns, for me, is a movie of sharp contrast. Some aspects of the film I love, while others I think are just plain bad. Before I get into the negatives and positives, let me just say that I still enjoy Batman Returns quite a bit, and I think for the first hour and fifteen minutes, it was a worthy successor to the original Batman movie in 1989. So, the negatives. Tim Burton's directing here is not good. I understand he likes doing weird stuff, and that was prevalent in the original Batman movie more or less. This one... goes a little too crazy. I like the dark and ominous tone this movie sets up, but unfortunately at times it just throws that out the window to have a scene that's just like... what? At one point in the movie Penguin puts a little control device on the Batmobile that allows him to control it, instead of Batman. Penguin controls it by driving a recreation of the bat-mobile, that looks like it's a kid's ride at a carnival. And throughout the scene Penguin has a TV screen that he uses to taunt Batman with, while making some truly horrible jokes. Yeah, it gets that crazy. And another thing, does anyone else notice just how many stretches there are where a central character disappears completely. Batman's in maybe thirty to forty minutes of the movie (okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but c'mon! It's called Batman Returns, not Batman shows up in a few scenes here and there). Catwoman disappears for a good twenty minutes towards the end of the film, and then just shows up at the end without any explanation. It's just...bizarre. Too many scenes that seem as though they're supposed to be taken seriously just come off as laughable, such as Penguin shooting his rebellious henchman who just stands there stupidly, or the police officers who open fire on the Penguin on sight, y'know, the former mayoral candidate. Then there's the cast, and this is where the movie really shines. Christopher Walken is delightfully over the top as Max Shreck, and is a joy to watch throughout the film, as he tosses lots of great dialogue around. 'Next time I'll push her out a higher window!' he remarks, after discovering Selena Kyle is still alive. Michael Keaton is still a great, if underused Batman, and then there's Michelle Pfeiffer of course, who is just a great Catwoman. Her and Keaton had some great chemistry together in this movie, and the scenes between them were easily the best things in the movie. Michael Gough is great as the dignified Alfred, and he and Keaton share some good scenes. And then... there's Danny Devito as the Penguin, who I just... I don't know why, but I just did not like him. He was kind of funny for a while, and even managed to be fairly sympathetic, but later on he just got too goofy, and he really doesn't do all that much, despite being featured so strongly. He was basically just a figure head for Shreck. Later on he hatches his own schemes, but the fact that he straps rockets to the backs of hundreds of penguins and sends them out controlled by radio waves to destroy Gotham doesn't help his case much. There are some good action scenes though, such as the fights between Batman and Catwoman, not to mention the numerous times the circus gang shows up and Batman has to fight them, such as the acrobats who he gets into some pretty fun martial arts duels with. On a side note, Batman killing people is something that kind of irks me, and I kind of like. Change is good, and I like that there's some difference to this than the Nolan movies in regards to themes, but seeing Batman killing people is just...weird. In the end, I really liked the first chunk of this movie, and absolutely loved Keaton, Pfeiffer, and Walken in their roles, but I really didn't like the end, the directing, or Devito. However, it was still entertaining, so I would recommend watching this movie if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this film isn't meant to be 100% serious, it's a Tim Burton film, it's "weird". Some things are just there because they're artistic, abstract, dark, weird. The world isn't supposed to make sense. You have to free yourself from thinking "that would never happen, that looks stupid" etc, to enjoy a Burton film, and look for the underlying emotion, artistic appreciation, humour, symbolism etc instead.The thing I enjoyed most about this film is the soundtrack, I think it's great, and the music I enjoyed most is the strings sounding so cat like, miaowing, for cat woman.. if you didn't notice it watch the film again, the strings really emulate a miaowing sound. The soundtrack to this and the first Burton/Elfman Batman film are great, to any student of music I'd recommend them because they do some interesting things such giving the hero dark music, the villain happy waltz music which even though its non diegetic music which seemingly no other character in the film is aware of, he dances around happily to (symbollising his insanity maybe), then we have Batman Returns with the great strings emulating cat sounds, great scenes like Selina going a bit mad (I actually find that scene quite emotional and the music great too!). They are great films, you can get a lot out of them, but I guess you have to have an artistic mind as well and know what you're looking for maybe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Batman film at the time of its release was thought of as a bit of a disappointment. Sure it did quite well at the box office, but really did not compare to the first one. The reviews were lukewarm at best, quite incendiary at their worst. I believe it had multiple razzie nominations and I do believe Danny DeVito actually won for worst performance. However, over the years for reasons unknown to me it has gained a following, now it is often said to be the best of the original four films. At one point it had a 6.2 score on IMDb, but now sports a 7.0. What changed? I have no clue as to me it is not the disappointment it was then, but I still thought the first film was better. Burton went darker with this one, at the same time in areas he went lighter. This one is a sequel, yet other than a throw away line about Viki Vale and a few of the same actors this film almost feels like a totally different film in some regards. Still, it is my second favorite film of the original four films, though it is a set of sequels that change up the formula so often that you hardly can tell they are connected when you compare Batman and Robin to the first film.The story has a strange circus gang on the attack, things get a bit out of hand and Commissioner Gordon calls on Batman. Did not take him all that long to become over reliant on the Bat now did it? Well during the chaos a strange person dubbed the Penguin makes his way out of sewer, part of his plan that is not really a Penguin plan of the comics. Meanwhile, Selina Kyle is having boss troubles to the point of being pushed out of windows and resurrected as Catwoman! The boss, Max Shreck, decides to use the Penguin for his own needs and makes a bold push to make this strange man into the mayor. Catwoman and the Penguin soon team up as the Bat keeps interfering with each and plan a caper to frame the Dark Knight.There is a lot going on in this film, and that is a bit of a problem. Penguin's and Catwoman's team up seems rushed, there are parts of the film that seem important that are never discussed again and the best villain is not even one of the two super villains, but rather Christopher Walken's Max Schreck character. Still, Burton has a way of making the very bulky bat suit not look like something that is going to restrict someone's movement to the point it is nonfunctional. The next two films it looks like the heroes can barely move! The suit on display in this film is also the best looking one of the original four ditching the molded muscles of the previous film and the strange tail on the bat insignia. The bat mobile still looks awesome, it doesn't for the next two movies and Catwoman's costume is hot...though I prefer the Lee Merriweather look in the 60's version as Michelle is too pale for my tastes.As for the villains, neither is really a lot like their comic book counterpart. However, Burton should not be restricted by a comic book nor any other director. Seriously, do people really want every comic book movie to start at issue 1? Granted, both get a very strange treatment as Catwoman gains her power from random cats, I would prefer she be just a cat burglar and Penguin's origin shown at the beginning would be great, if the villain was Killer Croc. He is also a bit to disgusting looking. I just do not see people rallying behind him as people are shallow and while they may not burn him at the stake, they are not going to fall in love with him as they do in this film. Michael Keaton is still good as Batman, I prefer Bale a bit over Keaton, but Keaton is miles ahead of the other two guys. I just think Bale did Bruce better while Keaton was actually better as Batman. With them it is close, not so much for Kilmer and Clooney.So I still do not see why people act as if this film is the best in the series including the Nolan films, however, I respect their opinion. One even gave me a list and while I did not agree it allowed me to understand a bit why they felt it was superior. To me, it was an okay film and a disappointing sequel. I just thought areas of it were to strange, some too lighthearted and it just did not continue the first film well enough (Billy Dee Williams...where are you?). It still had a lot of fun moments and it had a lot more Batman in it than the first film and probably the next two. Add a awesome action scene to the end and I would give it an 8, but the anticlimactic ending we got is one of the main reasons I did not like this film as much as the first and only give it a score of six. I still remember the disappointment I felt as a kid as the ending played out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At times silly, at times Gothic, at times dark and gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can see a lot of Tim Burton in this film, for better and for worse. His trademark Gothic style is heavily presented in the design of Gotham City and its various occupants, most of which are either tormented and dark heroes or complete monsters trying to pass as normal citizens. Unfortunately Burton's flair for over the top character is also present, which at times makes it hard to take this film seriously. The Penguin (Danny DeVito) is probably the biggest offender in this regard. Some of his scenes are downright terrifying, with him wobbling around and acting more like a wild beast than a man. But then he wobbles some more, this time clad in nothing but his dirty pyjamas, and the illusion of terror shatters almost instantly. The same applies to his dialogue. It's an odd mix of silliness and threat that either works brilliantly or utterly fails, there's very little middle ground with this character.This same ambivalence is present in almost all of the characters, with the exception of Batman (Michael Keaton), although he has his own flaws as well, the biggest being that he's not really the focus of the film. This film is more about the Penguin and the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Batman is just there to move the plot along, which makes him rather uninteresting, which is a cardinal offence in my books, as this is a Batman film after all.All that being said, the plot of this film isn't that bad. Batman: The Animated Series once did an episode about the Penguin trying to join the normal, civilized society, trying to combat his inner weirdness and the prejudice of the common folk, who fear his odd appearance and animalistic themes. That episode really worked in my opinion and why not, as it is a very good idea for this particular character. The Penguin, like so many other Batman villains, is all about duality - in his case about the battle between his noble heritage and his savage upbringing, which makes for a great tragedy. And while the movie doesn't explore these themes as well as it perhaps could have, it touches upon many of them and at least makes the effort to try.Still, I just can't get past all those silly scenes where the previous Gothic mood completely shatters and the whole process starts all over again with the next scene. If you're a fan of Burton or Batman, you should give this one a try as it is a rather touching film and good one in its own way, but if you can't deal with sudden mood changes and a certain level of random silliness, this movie really isn't for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>batman returns: broken down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By broken down I mean simplified, anyway this was an interesting film when I watched after so many years. When I first watched it, I was about 10 years old, I got it for Christmas on DVD along with the first, and next two films. I was very fond of the movie at the time, I liked the fell of it, the sort of 'Burtonish' feeling you get from most of his movies. Watching it now, I had some problems with the villains in this movie, one being that the penguin is a deformed freak, and Catwoman being some sort of mystical being. I know from the original comic that there origins are much different, but I'm not that big of a stickler so I let it go. The same could be said for the Friday the 13th remake, if you don't know that the villain was suppose to be someone else, and you just took them for who they are, the film feels better. There have been complaints about the film being too dark, or not dark at all. That is where the 'Burtonish' feeling comes in, like the nightmare before Christmas, it has a creepy yet goofy feeling, and the same is for Batman returns.It was this film that made me start watching the other batman films, I could never find the time to watch the original 1989 version, but I watched the others and was disappointed. At of all of the batman films (except the Nolan films) this one is my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Sequel That's As Dark As The First!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken star in Tim Burton's 1992 action sequel. This begins in Gotham City, with a wealthy couple, The Copplepots dumping their deformed penguin-like infant, Oswald into a sewer. Years later, the man who has been hiding beneath Gotham, The Penguin (DeVito) kidnaps a shady politician, Max Schreck (Walken) who is running for Mayor and blackmails him. Pfeiffer (Scarface) plays Schreck's secretary, Selina Kyle who gets pushed out a window by Schreck for snooping around his office and becomes vengeful, Catwoman. She also gets involved with billionaire, Bruce Wayne (Keaton) whom she learns is Batman. Soon, Batman faces The Penguin who is determined to reclaim his birthright while trying to overrun Gotham and Catwoman who wants revenge on Schreck. Burton's "Pee-wee's Big Adventure" stars, Paul Reubens &amp; Diane Salinger briefly play Oswald's parents. This is a good sequel that's as dark as the first, Keaton, DeVito and Pfeiffer are great, Danny Elfman's score is excellent and Walken is a good bad guy as usual. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the body-snatcher of batman returns (cinematheque)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has the same director, the same actor, same batmobile, same butler, albeit the flavor is totally different. I can't name another sequel being so different of the original. But if you read the comics, the batman of 1939 isn't the same than the one of 1989 or more accurately, frank miller's "DK" is far away from his "DK2".Maybe the choice for Xmas period isn't very adapted to superheroes because here, the feel is a bit cold and doesn't help a rather boring script: Batman is again sidelined and a bit stiff glued in action. funnily, the two movies taken together, Bruce appears a bit like a pervert and not because he dresses like a bat at night. In fact, each time, all he is doing is seduce a woman, get her in his bed and feel compelled to reveal his secret identity. The villains gets an inflation (three instead of one) but Schreck and Penguin are irritating. That's left Catwoman who is truly the best thing here. Pfeiffer did an amazing job, getting totally in that crazy part. She reveals a wonderful ethic for her craft and a very sexy side of her personality.The sets and visual are beautiful and Danny's score matches and maybe is better than his previous one.Finally, my feelings is a bit mixed but this Catwoman and her haunting presence wins me over. Miaow !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Tim Burton Gives us a very Violent Batman sequel With Batman Returns.After the success of Batman in 1989 Tim Burton was signed on to do a sequel. He was given full range to make whatever he wanted. So he did what he usually does twisted and imaginary film style.The film is about Bruce Wayne played again by Micheal Keaton who is discovering that now that he has defeated the Joker he has grown in more popularity.This time the film has 3 villains.The first villain is Max Shreck played by Christopher Walken an evil billionaire tycoon who wants Gotham City and all the popularity and publicity for himself.The second villain is Selina Kyle played by Michelle Pfeiffer who is thrown out of a window by Max and becomes Catwomn By(and I am not kidding you)being chewed on by cats. She wants to destroy Batman and claim he is the villain in all of this.The third and final villain is Oswald Cobblepot played by Danny DeVito who was abandoned by his mother and father and raised by penguins. For the rest of the movie they call him The Penguin. He wants to become the mayor of Gotham city. And by the way The Penguin is not a person who wants to become evil just for the hell of it he is just a sad and confused misfit who wants to fit in with society and everyone around him.This film is way more violent than the first but still has a very interesting story talented cast and is very entertaining. Fun Fact Mcdonalds was all set to do a happy meal line for the movie but canceled it because the movie was to violent. I can;t disagree because I can't even believe this got slapped with a PG-13 rating. I still Recommend it though.*So I don't get in trouble with Plagerism some statements were taken courtesy of cinemassacre.com. Thanks a lot for the info.Rated PG-13 For Brooding, Dark Violence.2hrs 6min/126min.***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not better than the first. Missing The Joker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was still very young. I have no idea who Tim Burton was then. I was quite surprised to finally know he actually managed to direct films with no Johnny Depp in it.This is a good film with introduction to new villain like the Penguin (brillantly acted by Danny DeVito as he really irks and makes me just want to bash his head with his pointy umbrella), Batman's love interest- The Catwoman, who was also a villain at first but turns out to be good in the end.Somehow, no other Batman villain seems to match the evil genius and a sort of magnetic presence like The Joker, who can make any actor who plays him famous (Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger). Mention Batman and I immediately think of The Joker, with his famed purple suit and wild fuzzy green hair and that crazed smile. I actually love him more than the Batman. He is such a colorful and unpredictable character, the No.1 match to Batman's troubled and dark one.This film is good, but without the Joker the film seems incomplete and hollow. Something just makes me uncomfortable watching the film. The ending is not explosive and very stale. Everyone knows Batman always wins.I hate the Penguin, wish more can be said about the love between Batman and Catwoman. The film is only okay, mostly uninteresting, a bit below my expectation from a Tim Burton film. It is good enough for me with only one viewing. I like the first one more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Dear Penguin. The children regret they are unable to attend - Batman."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen off the evil Joker, the Caped Crusader now has to deal with with two other deadly foes to keep Gotham City safe. The crazy mutant like Penguin and the power crazy megalomaniac in waiting Max Shreck. But wait, just who is this women dressed up like a cat? Friend or Foe? Seems the Dark Knight has a lot on his hands this Christmas.In 1989 director Tim Burton rekindled the super hero genre for Warner Brothers with his take on Batman. Made for $35 million, recouping over that in its opening weekend, the film went on to make a Worldwide profit of over $375 million. The sequel of course was inevitable, as was the return of Burton, even if he dallied around trying to bluff that he would only return if a script was fresh and exciting. Sure enough, and with Burton getting the script he wanted from Daniel Waters, Batman Returns turned over a profit of over $185 million. Thus ensuring that further franchise instalments were to follow, even if, as it turned out, Burton didn't.Batman Returns is more breezy than its predecessor, not in humour terms, but in action. In fact for a genre so steeped in sense of humour, Returns is surprisingly devoid of comedy. A charge of both Burton &amp; Waters taking things a little too seriously is hard to argue against. But that's not to decry the good things that run abound in the film. Burton's trademark Gothics exist all told, and it has its darkness, both in themes and in actual visuals. All of course accompanied by a whirling Danny Elfman score. But what of the story itself? Well this perhaps would have been better served as being titled something along the lines of "The Penguin Cometh," for make no fish bones about it, this is the Penguin movie. Batman and Catwoman are in essence just playing henchman and henchwoman, with Max Shrek serving only as plot device that's saying the real villains of our world don't wear masks or costumes. A bold move by Burton to have the Penguin as the lead protagonist, one that financially paid off. But one that ultimately turned many away from revisits for its perceived un- family friendly being. Guilty as charged said Burton, it's his vision and he stands by it. Thus Batman Returns stands up as the most adult of the four Batman movies made in the modern wave from 1989 to 1997. Quite a feat when you consider the film is set during the bastion of all family holidays! Sadly what was to follow would be kiddie friendly fodder served up by Joel Schumacher-reaching a crushing and chronic nadir with Batman &amp; Robin.The cast are mostly excellent, Keaton does what he can in what is ultimately now a cog in a big wheel role. While Max Shreck gets to play Christopher Walken with relish and oratory menace (yes I did it on purpose). However, it's with Michell Pfeiffer's Catwoman &amp; Danny Devito's Penguin that the film reaches its acting heights. Pfeiffer plays it mousey for Selina Kyle and then leaps at the chance to vamp it up as the delicious Catwoman. With a sultry miaow here and a tippy tappy skip there, this Cat is all in one sexy and very dangerous, something poor Bats is going to have to contend with. But it's DeVito's show all the way. Charged with having to follow Jack Nicholson's film stealing turn from the first film, DeVito immerses himself in the role of the pathetic, deformed, yet dangerously criminal Penguin. It's a monstrous creation fit to grace any modern day horror movie, with DeVito's physicality proving a necessity for the mutant flippered one who was raised in the sewers. If only Danny had been given more opportunities like this to show his talent.There's many missteps in here too, though. Burton is no master of directing action, and some of the one liners shoe-horned in are poor and pointless. While the whole birth of Catwoman story arc just isn't explained in any way. In fact it's all a bit lazy in truth. Burton though, remains a film maker with his own visual flair, his layering of atmosphere as Gotham is on the brink of collapse is expertly crafted. He has stuff to say and he's going to have fun saying said stuff. Often frustrating he can be for sure, but always he carries a uniqueness into many of his films. Batman Returns is no different in that respect. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton Returns to Gotham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's second adventure in Gotham City is another impressive film, but it doesn't seem to carry the same weight as the original. I loved that he brought back Michael Keaton and Michael Gough, and the casting for the film's new villains were well-thought, but the film had a couple flaws that weakened the overall experience in my opinion. In the second adventure, it's Christmas-time in Gotham and the city has been plagued with sightings of a mysterious Pengiun-man from the sewers. The Penguin soon reveals himself to the citizens and, with support from local corrupt businessman Max Shreck, begins a bid for mayor of the city. Meanwhile, Shreck's meek secretary Selina Kyle adopts the persona of Catwoman when a near-death experience spurs her into action to change her life and bring down those who've made her miserable.Just as in the first film, the casting and production design are the greatest parts of the movie. Michael Keaton continues to prove he was a great choice for Bruce Wayne/Batman, though it seems we don't get nearly as much of him in the film this time around. With two villains to explore (three, if you include Shreck), Bruce loses a good deal of screen time to developing the new characters. This is my primary complaint with all comic-based films that attempt to include multiple villains: you spend so much time building up and introducing these new characters that it bogs down the story and it feels uneven. The primary focus of the film is the Penguin and his plot to become mayor (and an additional evil plan involving Gotham's children that he prepares for throughout the movie and watches it fall apart in less than a minute of screen time). Danny DeVito was absolutely perfect as the Penguin and he is what really makes this film enjoyable for me. Michelle Pfeiffer makes a hot Catwoman, but she ends up playing second fiddle to Penguin; still, she's given enough development in her scenes to make a tragic character who's torn between her two lifestyles. Corrupt CEO Max Shreck is played by Christopher Walken, and we all know that man can do no wrong.The film's weaknesses come in the form of the the execution of the story. While BATMAN managed to avoid it for the most part, BATMAN RETURNS jumps right in with a bit of camp I'd hoped we'd left in the past: themed henchmen. Right from the start, we're exposed to Penguin's thugs...the Red Triangle Circus gang. So, to match Penguin's circus sideshow vibe, we have henchmen ranging from the organ grinder with the monkey to the ringmaster. It reeked of the corniness of the 1960's series and put a damper on the noir feeling evoked by the first film. There are also plot holes that I can't help but nitpick each time I watch the movie, such as how Penguin and his crew got ahold of such detailed plans for the Batmobile for their plan to blackmail the hero. And, since I'm on the topic of camp, I found it hard to suspend my belief for the Penguin's final plan (his "army"). Seriously...did the franchise need to resort to something so corny so soon?Despite it's descent into the camp of the 60s that paved the way for the Schumacher sequels to take it too far, I don't hate this film. I love the characters enough to forgive some plot issues and, while it isn't as strong as the first, it's still a great Batman film. I would've been interested to see where Burton would've wanted to take the series from here but I'm glad he got out before the series too a turn for the worse (BATMAN AND ROBIN, anyone?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman is pitted against the demented, ravenous Penguin, a pitiful, orphaned psychopathic freak who once went on a baby-killing spree, and a "power" hungry capitalist villain Max Shreck. As the two criminals plot to gain domination over Gotham City, Batman must plot to stop them.As the film starts, you can tell the tone will be immensely darker than that of the first. Although darker doesn't necessarily mean better, in this case, it's true....only for a moment. I was never impressed by the first film. It struck me as entirely uninteresting and boring, for the most part. In this film, I was, more or less, interested at whats going on. The first hour was pretty good because there are some great things going on, especially with the new characters introduced.However, it started to go down again. After the hour mark, I found myself disinterested because everything starts getting repetitive all over again. Maybe the only Batman films I'll ever enjoy are Christopher Nolan's reboot and its sequel. This time, the film has mostly everything bigger, with more villains and more action. The action scenes still seem second-rate to me. However, like before, the production design is great. I like the look of Gotham and the costume designs for the three character, Batman, Penguin, and Catwoman, largely thanks to the great Stan Winston.Michael Keaton started to grow on me in this sequel. I found him being more comfortable in his role as the title character. Danny DeVito is almost flawless as the Penguin. You'll probably never see him like that ever again. Michelle Pfeiffer is just great as the sexy Catwoman. And Christopher Walken, well, he was just decent among those actors.Although much darker and interesting at first, the film slowly loses its steam halfway, sputtering to a convoluted mess near the end. I kid you not, there were so many things and threats going on in the end that it was ridiculous! Bigger is certainly not better in this film. Tim Burton, I know you can do better than this.</fullReview>

The relationship between these characters is odd and whimsical, but they really nailed it with the character development. Would you believe this is a Christmas film, but it was released in mid-July? This film is great, and in some parts, surpasses the first film. It's mush darker and moodier, but still a great action film to watch.

		<fullReview>Batman Returns is the sequel to the 1989 film Batman, and both of them star Michael Keaton and are both directed by Tim Burton. As I explain in the summary that The Dark Knight is very dark and violent, you have not seen a true violent Batman movie until you watch this one. The story for the movie is pretty confusing, and from what I remember, the movie takes place after Batman's encounter with The Joker, until the Penguin is terrorising Gotham city. There is also another villain who is with Penguin, and Batman's girlfriend dies and becomes Catwoman. This can get confusing to remember all the villains after watching the movie as there are three different ones, all with their own story. I don't want to spoil much of the movie, but I must tell you there are some violent parts, especially the beginning which you will know all about if you watch the film. McDonalds made some toys for the movie to release in happy meals, but it was so violent that children will want to go see it and it would cause a bad influence on them. The movie has you glued to your seat, trying not to go get a drink or go to the toilet, because some of the action scenes are the best in any super hero movie. The Penguin could only be played by Danny Devito as he does an excellent job as him. The movie could have got 9 stars but it was let down at the end where it just got way to silly for me and overall stupid. Some fans say that it is not the original story of the Penguin so they don't like it, but it doesn't even matter as the movie is so damn good! Not as good as Batman 1989 or The Dark Knight, but give it a watch and maybe you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Full marks to Daniel Waters who wrote the thing and Burton for translating it onto the screen. The story is coherent and has he same mix of fun, fantasy and pathos as the first although it's all rather familiar and damp now. Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman is the big draw of the film, a disturbing mix of well-contained sexual allure and pity. Danny Devito does the mad-n-bad Penguin (rather different to the wonderful Burgess Meredith from the TV series) reasonably. Michael Keaton is reprising though. He throws himself into the role physically but not psychologically. You get the impression that the Batman in pursuit of peace of mind was exhausted (if not resolved) in the fight with Nicholson's Joker. Still, the effects are up to scratch and Danny Elfman's score still has the grandstanding sub-Wagnerian impact of the first. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens when you give a director virtually every freedom possible when making a big blockbuster sequel? Well, if you are Warner Bros. and are working with Tim Burton, "Batman Returns" is what you get. Lots of things can be said for this movie. Naysayers could say it's too graphic, dark, depressing and flat-out mean. However, those who appreciate the dark-side of the Dark Knight should appreciate this entry in the franchise. Perhaps I was a little too young to be watching this movie in 1992, but yet, I was still intrigued. I could not look away, almost as if my favorite superhero was in a horror movie. Now, you should note that "Batman Returns" is not for everyone. If you thought Burton's original "Batman" was dark and scary, this one might put you over the edge. Little kids, in general, really should not be watching this, which is ironic considering all the action figures this movie spewed forth. In this movie, Bruce Wayne (with Michael Keaton reprising his role) is pitted against the sewer-dwelling Penguin (portrayed spot-on by Danny Devito), falls for Selina Kyle/Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and deals with a devious megalomaniac in Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). If Batman doesn't have trouble while he's at work, he at least has enough emotional troubles to deal with at home. "Batman Returns" is really quite a complex and dense movie. On one hand, it is a big summer blockbuster, and a sequel. On the other hand, it is a bit of a psychological thriller that really pokes into the Batman/Bruce Wayne psyche. Everything about this film evokes a certain mood -- from the Christmas-time setting, the grey skies and snow, too Penguin's gloomy lair and Selina Kyle's dumpy bachelorette-pad. It's almost too well made. "Batman Returns" surely isn't an everyday movie. Personally, I find I have to be in a certain mood to appreciate it. Which is simply why the movie didn't make the intended splash at the box office and why many critics panned it. Regardless, it is still a Batman movie, and in my opinion, still stays true to the character. If there's any fault, it's that it's too risky for it's own good. But still a deliciously evil 'Batman' flick that's always good for the holidays.</fullReview>

He only returned to the franchise because he was allowed to make the film he wanted and you get to see some of his directional traits.The basic plot of the film is a new criminal master-mind, The Penguin (Danny De Vito), is conquering the underworld of Gotham and starting a new rain of terror during Christmas. He captures a major industrialist Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and holds him to blackmail. Out of anger of being found out Shreck kills his secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). She however is brought back to life and she becomes Cat-woman. The three work together and form a plan to take over the city and destroy Batman. A part of the plan is for the Pengiun to 'save' the mayor's son and find out who he really is before running for mayor himself. At the same time Bruce Wayne is forming a relationship with Selina whilst at the same time fighting Catwoman as Batman.This film is darker in tone to Batman and has themes like child-abandonment and child-killing. There is some good casting, Danny De-Vito and Walken are good in there roles, but Pfeiffer was the best casting in the film. However, there are problems with the film, firstly, there is too much focus on the villains, and not enough on Batman. Bruce Wayne is not made out to be an interesting character compared to the Nolan films. Secondly I thought that even this film, whilst it is fairly dark, I still thought that was cartoonary like the penguins and henchmen. I'm also not a great fan of the Gothic style that was used, but considering it's Burton's film it what he does.Batman Returns is best until Nolan comes along. The problem with the executives at Warner Brothers was they though Batman was a family friendly character (he isn't) and did not like what Burton came up with. This was the reason why Joel Schumacher was brought in and made the bad Batman Forever and even worst Batman and Robin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of any of the super-dudes of the comic world but then, when I peep back in time, I realize that the Batman and I go back along way together. The first American motion picture which I remember watching at a theatre was Batman Returns, many many seasons ago. Michelle-CAT WOMAN-Pfeiffer, became the lady of a child's dreams and Danny's work made me realize that in cinema, short and screams works big time, yet, I didn't care a dime for the hero of Gotham city. I would not have bothered even if Penguin had finished off the Bat in early 90s. But the movie rocked..Keaton was good in the title role but Cat woman was just too good..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns (1992, Dir. Tim Burton) After successfully defeating the Joker, the Dark Knight, known as Batman helps to keep Gotham City a safe place. Beneath the city in the sewers, another villain emerges. Known as the Penguin (DeVito), he joins up with Max Shreck and targets the position of new mayor. Whilst Batman tries to uncover the truth behind the Penguin, the Catwoman (Pfeiffer) also emerges with her own agenda in mind, but not without mixed feelings.Tim Burton returns with another dark tale of the Dark Knight, this time pushing the boundaries of how dark he can get. Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito are incredible as the villains and all the enjoyable action is still remains. More work however could have been done in the relationship between the two villains.I'd offer you a coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time. ? Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) Good time, too. Everyone but the bandits will be slacking off till after New Year, anyway. ? Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one is much darker!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to the 1989 hit has come. This time, he takes on two villains: The Penguin(Danny DeVito) aka Oswald Cobblepot and the Catwoman(Michelle Pfieffer) aka Selina Kyle. These two would have made the perfect team. However, Catwoman has her own agenda, and The Penguin teams with a dirty businessman named Max Shreck(Christopher Walken). This man is worse than Carl Grissom who was killed by the Joker. The duo first scheme is to smear the Dark Knight. Second, is for the Mayor to be recalled. The plan worked, unfortunately the partnership of Penguin and Catwoman was short lived. And Batman had to reveal the Pengiun's true nature at a conference. And the cheers turn into jeers. The action was great with the Batmobile when it becomes the Batmissle. And the suit of Batman's is sharp. The movie was great, but the plot could have more depth to it. It was a bit hollow, and it was very much darker than the first one. Still a good movie though. 3 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the by far most compelling interpretation of the dark knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i was terribly disappointed by Burton's first batman movie. so i was very surprised by "batman returns", which just blew me away. what a great interpretation of a great superhero! "batman returns" has the atmosphere of a dark, Gothic fairytale, full with Burton's trademark grotesque and whimsy, and a dash of sexual kink. the set pieces, costumes and make up are gorgeous. but the darkness never becomes depressing, the movie is always fun to watch. for adults, anyway; for children, it might be a bit too dark and violent.Batman fights three villains, all of which are compelling characters. Danny DeVito and Christopher Walken give good performances as the psychotic Penguin and the ruthless businessman Max Shrek. but its Michelle Pfeiffer who steals the show with her amazing interpretation of the arguably greatest DC character ever, Catwoman."batman returns" has a couple of flaws, most notably Batman himself, played by Michael Keaton. he delivers a solid performance, but he has absolutely zero sex appeal or charisma. it doesn't help that he wears a dorky looking rubber costume that stands out in its ugliness amidst all the beautiful set-pieces and costumes. its a good thing then that the movie seems to focus more on the villains than the hero, since each one of them is far more interesting than the lead.other flaws include the story, which feels more like a series of events rather than a well constructed arc, or the rather mediocre action scenes. but these things barely register, since "batman returns" has more than enough momentum and charm to even get away with having a weak lead. this is the by far most compelling interpretation of the dark knight and the twisted world he lives in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Knight Returns in this sequel to the 1989 film, Batman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is the second film in the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher Batman franchise of the late 80s, early 90s.In Batman Returns it is Christmas time in Gotham City, the Batman (played once more by Michael Keaton) has become an established force defending the city. Then suddenly this new vile group of insane circus freaks come onto the scene and begin wreaking havoc, they are led by the deformed freak, the Penguin (Danny DeVito). At the same time a female cat burglar comes onto the scene pulling off many small time robberies, she ends up joining forces with the Penguin, this woman is known as Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Batman has to naturally battle these two foes to try and protect Gotham City, when in the meantime the Penguin runs for Mayor of Gotham City, with the help of corrupt business man Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). In the end, though, we learn that the Penguin has much more on his mind than just becoming Mayor, this results in Batman having to use all of his cutting edge technology and all of his wits to stop the demented Penguin and his gang.I think this comment should first focus on what is good about this film, rather than focusing on the negative. First, the Gotham City that has been made within this film is truly unique and is one of the best versions of Gotham ever captured on film. Second, the production values are very good, Tim Burton's directing is good, and the script is fairly well written; as well the acting is top notch, this film was very well casted. All of the other stuff, like cinematography, score, and such are all really good as well, but that stuff is really all that is good.The problems with Batman Returns are many. First and foremost the film focuses too much on Batman's villains rather than Batman himself, now this was a problem the first Batman had, but this time around, with an extra villain, Batman has even less screen time. Another major problem with this film is it took way too many departures from the comic books, there are many points in this film that I wonder if I am even watching a Batman film. As well, this is an action movie with very little action within it, and the little you do get is not engaging at all, you just want the action to end once you get to it.Overall this is just not that great of a movie, and is really only a Batman film by name only.Score: A decent 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good Batman movie. Tim Burton did a good job with both Batman and Batman Returns. Tim Burton's movies are the best of the Batman franchise. I like the action in this movie, the villains, and of course Batman. I'd like it if the ending wasn't as violent as it was. Even though I think the ending should have been less violent, I enjoyed the movie. This movie is my third favorite Batman movie. Batman Returns is a good movie for Batman fans. I think that the villain Catwoman is way better than Penguin. I'm sure glad that I own this movie. Batman Returns is a very impressive movie. I have watched this movie, and the other Batman movies (except Batman Begins), tons of times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Return to Batman Returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always disliked this movie when I was younger. After watching it tonight, though, I learned to enjoy it again. I guess I just missed the comic relief of Nicholson's Joker - the obvious gags. So I was surprised to find myself laughing a lot during this sequel. Lots of bat, cat, and bird puns - real groaners, but hey, it's still funny. Another thing that bothered me was how quickly Selina Kyle was able to become Catwoman - a bad ass in skintight pleather who knows enough kung fu to challenge Batman in fisticuffs. Didn't bother me so much this time for some reason. And Batman was just letting her win? The thing I realized was that it was written totally as a comic book. The first one, I feel, has its own sort of reality where people can still see their surroundings as ridiculous. It was a city of straight men surrounded by comic book clowns. In Batman Returns, everyone is in on the joke that is Gotham City. It feels less real, but more cohesive.In case you don't remember, this is the movie that made it hip to inject twice as many villains into an action sequel, allegedly to achieve twice the action. Both The Penguin and Catwoman are getting' up in Batman's grill this time around, and everyone's stories intertwine. What I still find unique about this movie is how much it feels like an episode in a series of stories. Basically no re-introduction is given to Batman - everyone watching this movie knows who he is and why, so the only reason we know Bruce Wayne is Batman is from a quick scene of him looking mopey in a dark room, getting interrupted by a giant Bat Signal - so the beginning of the picture is more about the origins of The Penguin and Catwoman. The Penguin is the son of a high society couple (first shot of the movie belongs to Paul Reubens as his dad!) who is born in a sort of egg shape with flippers instead of fingers. So his parents toss him into the frigid waters of an abandoned zoo. And Catwoman starts out as a shy secretary, is nearly killed by her boss (a great Chris Walken), then something snaps in her mind and she becomes the person she always wanted to be. Or maybe she's just a little nuts.Tim Burton directs with his usual (for the time) cartoony zeal, not hesitating to use special effects to paint his picture. Danny DeVito is very good as The Penguin and everyone else manages to not look like a jerk in a goofy costume, which is sometimes the highest possible praise for a movie like this. And Michael Keaton is always a pleasure to behold - one scene in a boardroom with Walken has him casually chuck some documents across the room for Walken's perusal. He does it totally off-the-cuff, proving that Bruce Wayne is not a typical stuck up "rich guy." Great moment, fleeting as it is. And in his corner, Walken catches those same documents perfectly, seemingly without blinking, proving he's totally capable of chewing up a guy like Bruce Wayne if he so desires. It's a good little scene. The whole movie was written with enough poppy dialogue and satire to transcend just a simple superhero action movie. There's all kinds of political and social overtones to the characters and situations. Under the huge Art Deco-Atlas-Shrugged-esquire statues throughout Gotham City, the flick plays like a morality tale of the common man vs. their corporate enslavers. Hell of a thing to do with the superhero genre. Good work, gang!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's best stab at Batman (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt in my mind that Batman Returns is better than Tim Burton's first stab at making a film about the dark knight. Batman Returns is sharper, tighter, darker and, most importantly, more entertaining than its predecessor. In every regard it trumps the previous film.One of things that surprises me about Batman Returns is that none of the villains is entirely evil. Of course it's nothing new to have the tragic villain, but often films are quite heavy-handed in their attempt to garner sympathy for their antagonists. But here the film's villains are almost overwhelming wicked. They're greedy, they're murderous and they're power hungry. But yet weirdly, each one has a touch of humanity. Shreck, the immoral businessman, the man who's probably the most wicked of them all, sacrifices himself so that his square-jawed son won't die. Of course, this is probably out a narcissistic desire to ensure that his seed doesn't disappear in the ether, but nonetheless he still performs a selfless act. Then there's The Penguin. He blackmails, he murders and he even plans to drown lots of children, but yet you feel he has a right to be angry. He's been betrayed and thrown away like he's a piece of trash by his parents ? no wonder he's messed up. And of course Catwoman has lots of shades of grey.And it's perhaps Catwoman who is the most interesting character. Here you have a woman who is a doormat. Every man in her life walks all over her. The reason for this seems to be her repressed sexuality ? her apartment is full of dollhouses, pink t-shirts with kittens on them and cuddly toys. She seems almost sexless. No wonder no one looks at her when she expresses herself in such an infantile way. But once Catwoman is born, all of those things are thrown away and destroyed. And the scene where she does this is one of the best in the film. It's filmed with complete rage ? she's violently discovering herself and her sexuality, and all the childlike accoutrements of the past are smashed into pieces. She's no longer going to be walked on.And for the rest of the film she schizophrenically alternates between good and evil. She helps a mugging victim but then berates her, she helps concoct a plot to frame Batman but then momentarily baulks when someone gets killed, and she wants to pursue a relationship with Bruce Wayne but can't accept the idea of a happy ending. She can't reconcile the two parts of her personality ? her sexual needs and her need to be happy and content.A character who is less conflicted about his sexuality is The Penguin. I love the way he's portrayed as an oversexed lech. In one scene he eagerly pins a button to a young woman's blouse, leering at her breasts and in another he leers at a campaign worker's bum, saying that he'd like to fill her void. It's wonderfully perverted. And then there's the way that Max Shreck convinces The Penguin to become Mayor. He promises him unlimited poontang. Everything else fails to fire The Penguin's imagination, but this changes his mind. And then there's the moment where he meets Catwoman. 'Just the pussy I've been looking for.' The film is incredibly oversexed.And it's telling that even though Bruce Wayne and Batman get comparatively little screen time, his scenes in this film are much more interesting than those in the first film. I mean, his relationship with Vicki Vale was uninteresting in the extreme, but there's actually something weirdly tragic about his relationship with Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Both know that they'll never be content. But although this all sounds pretty heavy, there's also some wonderful humour. There's a great little scene in Bruce Wayne's mansion when Selina asks that Alfred the butler think of a dirty limerick to tell Bruce ? she doesn't want Bruce to think that she's rejecting him. 'One has just sprung to mind,' is Alfred's response.But all of the humour in the film is gloriously black. One of my favourite lines occurs when Max Shreck is threatening Selina ? he's caught her going through his protected files. 'It's not like you can just kill me,' she says. 'Actually, it's a lot like that,' Shreck replies. And then he plays with her, by going to kiss her and then laughing before pushing her out of the window. The film has a black heart, and I personally think that's great.But as black as the film's heart is, there are also a couple of beautiful moments. I personally love The Penguin's death. He rises from the water like a monster and then with a glorious cue from Danny Elfman, he goes to kill Batman and accidentally picks a cute umbrella instead of a deadly one. He then collapses flat on his face and dies. And then if that isn't enough, a group of penguins emerge and tenderly lead him to a watery grave. No attempt is made to water the character down, to make him more likable, but you still can't help but feel for him, which is kind of an extraordinary feat for the filmmakers.The other moment I really love is when Batman is called at the start. The Bat sign shines bright through Bruce Wayne's mansion, casting light on his dark study. It's a very economical way of showing that this is all that gives his life meaning ? before the sign shines through his window he's motionless in the dark. So while people accuse Burton's Batman films of being shallow (I certainly think that's the case when it comes to the first one), it's a less valid criticism of the sequel. As well as the beautiful production design and cinematography, there's plenty to get your teeth into. You can't just expect it to be handed to you on a plate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this one better than the first. With Michael Keaton returning in the starring role, this one is a hit. Danny DeVito plays a mean, krusty ol Penguin. Christopher Walken, always a treat to see in movies, is in this as shrewd businessman Max Shreck. Lovely Michelle Phiffer plays the sexy feline Catwoman. All three, but not all together and in different pairings, get together to bring down the Dark Knight, but Batman perserveres, and ultimately wins out. I haven't seen "Batman Begins" yet, but I did see "Batman Forever" and "Batman and Robin". IMHO, "Batman and Robin" failed miserably, even with top box office draws George Clooney, playing the winged good guy, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing badguy Mr. Freeze. I also think "Batman Forever" was really good, with Jim Carrey playing the great dual role of Edward E. Nigma/The Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones was also great as Two Face. I still wish Michael Keaton would have reprised his role as the Caped Crusader in "Batman Forever", but Val Kilmer performed well in his place. I think this one, and "Batman Forever", are both tied as my favorite Batman movies. Like i said, i have yet to see Christian Bale, who put on the cowl for "Batman Begins", but it seems that lots of people think he plays the best Batman. If only Adam West were still young.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The much better Batman. The most delicious character in the superhero movies: Selina Kyle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This second Batman is much much better than the first one. It is plastically more accomplished, much better played, and maybe better written also.One thing is obvious:here Burton pushed the masquerade towards a vision.This is the Batman installment that has a vision,an inner principle;this is surprising. It has not atmosphere; but then no Burton movie has an atmosphere. The second Batman is much more suspenseful than the previous one. That one had Mrs. Basinger,it is true?but this one has Mrs. Pfeiffer?and this is even better. And these two fine ladies should not be compared, as they have entirely different roles in the two movies. But Mrs. Pfeiffer seems to be even more fun than Mrs. Basinger?and Mrs. Basinger is great fun and a good reason to watch a movie.The second installment looks good?it looks VERY good?and I am not a fan of Burton's visual style. There are several amazing things in this film?I leave you the pleasure of discovering them. This is a stylish film indeed?and, if not a vision, at least a spectacular masquerade. It does achieve several moments of truly fantastical texture?almost a twisted fairy-tale.It somehow reminded me also of some big '60s farces,such as Blake Edwards' The Great Race (1965) ,or Roman Polanski's Dance of the Vampires (1967).Yet,this one is made within the postmodern stance,so it is a spoof multiplied with itself.I am one of those who believe that Burton did not prove Keaton is such a good Batman character.A few days ago I was discussing the Batman '89's cast with a pal,and he found fault with Keaton casting as an ultra-cool enigmatic avenger and 'justiciary. But I didn't like any of the actors cast as superheroes in the '70s-'90s feature movies. They had Gibson and Gere and Willis and they came with ? Keaton.Batman II has a sense of wonder and of dream, it's good this thing was made. It is fanciful and well-paced.I don't like Walken in Burton's movies,but Mrs. Pfeiffer is outstanding?she brings a charm and a note of poetry that are one of the main qualities of this movie.She is so very good for such an action role ?. In fact,for me, Batman II is her movie. I would even suggest that Selina Kyle is one of her signature roles.The Penguin was a very well-written character, a very well suited one, and an enjoyable notion in the movie. He is more interesting, as a villain, then the Joker. And increasing the number of Batman's enemies, or pseudo-enemies, or quasi-enemies proved to be an inspired decision?it's more fun this way, and it makes the narration more compact.I consider that Burton 's best films are Ed Wood (1994), Mars Attacks! (1996) and Batman Returns (1992) (but I have seen only 6 of them?everything he made from Batman Returns (1992) till Planet of the Apes, plus, of course, Batman ,1989). So everything that follows is based only on my experience with these 6 movies.Burton's poetics is one of the unreality ?it is a deliberate attitude, of course, but it must be also a thing of temperament. Unreality?as in Godard ?-but in an entirely different way, and with different means and purposes. But unreality?as Godard pumped it. There are no 'evocating angles in their films-no seizing of a piece of the world. A Golan-Globus film from the '80s contains more atmosphere?of a street corner, etc., or of a pub, than all Burton's movies. Hence their quasi-academic look. The viewer's response depends on whether he enjoys this kind of postmodern take, or not. I do, sometimes. (By the way, I consider Godard, since I named him here,I consider Godard infinitely superior to Burton, it was not my intention to imply they are equals. )Burton's principle is a postmodern one, hence an epistemic one. Emptying the representation of any impetus towards imitation. Postmodernism is the epistemic response to realism?more of a crisis than of a response. Burton 's films are giant vacuum machines. I see he wants them to be this?he plans them to be this way.Camping up the camp is itself a very camp thing to do. Mocking the camp is still camp; or it is rather even campier. It is true that the camp-aware camp is odd. It betrays, yet it still does belong.So, camp comes to have an odd relation with itself. Spoofing a movie is no way of doing homage (the presupposition is that "we" can not enjoy those referenced movies as they are, and that we need some spoofing versions ?.)Burton pretends not only that the ingenuity is lost forever,but also that he is much smarter than those he says he quotes.You see that he is proud he's not Ray Harryhausen, Vincent Price,Edward D. Wood Jr, he would be ashamed to be one of them, for where are the humbleness, the ingenuity, the straightforward camp?The mere and humble enjoyment of the camp?Batman could of been a great chance?it needed the vision of a William Dieterle or Ludwig Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan (as a triplet ?).Burton's movies would not have made Price,Price. Spoofing is not continuing. Burton's movies are spoofs, parodies, masquerades, and they discredit the films they spoof.They seem to be made by a man who did not understand the movies he was spoofing. Even for his genre of masquerades, Burton has an unique inability of creating life.It has to be acknowledged that Burton shares with Soderbergh and the Coen brothers the top of the snobs' preferences.They are glad they were told what to think about these guys' movies,and so they can play the same repertory of clichs about post-modernism et Al. Burton, Soderbergh, the Coens live by discrediting genres. But that's not such a bad thing. Sometimes it is amusing and funny.</fullReview>

His height alone will be difficult to cast as the penguin in comics doesn't look to be so tall. apart from the height, his cunning voice and look add up a awesome look, Tim Burton also recreated this role. the penguin's nose which is much pointier than other versions of the penguin,and in this movie it shows the penguin's origin, from where he was born till he dies. kinda cant blame someone who rejected at birth because of his look and thrown into a sewer as seen.Devito has aged and wont likely ever do this in the new franchise although it would'nt be a bad choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After years, Batman (Michael Keaton) has defeated the joker. Batman has to face three different villains. The Penguin (Danny DeVito) is a warped and deformed madman, who tries to rule the city. The Seductively sensational Catwoman (Michelle Pheiffer), who has the same personality disorder as Batman. The corrupted Businessman (Oscar-Winner:Christopher Walken), who helps The Penguin raise Power in Gotham City.Directed by Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Sleepy Hallow) made an clever sequel with plenty of black comedy and visual style. This is a much more fascinating film than Burton's original Batman. This has an great moody score by Danny Elfman (The Frighteners, Nightbreed, The Nightmare Before Christmas). Although this was not as successful as the original Batman at the box office. It seems that Warner Bros executives didn't want Burton to directed the third Batman film.The two disc set has plenty of good features. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1). Disc one has an interesting running commentary track by the filmmaker. Disc two has an documentary, plenty of featurettes, music video and the original theatrical trailer. Still, this was one of the highest grossing films of 1992. Watch for Paul Reubens in a bit part, who's almost unrecognizable in the opening sequences. Screenplay by Daniel Waters (The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, Demolition Man, Heathers). From a Story by Waters and Sam Hamm (Monkeybone, Never Cry Wolf). (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has done a wonderful job in bringing another top notch Batman film. The film itself may be equal to the first. With Keaton as Batman returning, we get 2 new big villains, The Penguin and Catwoman! They are utilized brilliantly in this film. Batman Returns is a terrific movie! Michael Keaton does a better job in this film with Batman! I get more of a darker interpretation of him in this film and I like it better than the first. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Catwoman and she does a fantastic job! She creates a sick and fiendish catwoman who is a joy to watch on screen. An excellent portrayal of the character on her part. Christopher Walken plays Max Schreck, a business villain. His character is nothing truly special but Hey, its Christopher Walken. I still feel as if there is a lack of supporting cast outside the big three in this film.Danny DeVito plays the Penguin. Burton and the writers Daniel Waters/Sam Hamm take a different approach to the Penguin in this film. Rather than making him a simple mobster or ganglord like interpreted in the comics, Burton gives him the "insanity" characteristic that most Batman villains have. So now the Penguin can be similar to having the mental psyches of other villains like the Joker or Two-face. And best of all, he does it successfully. The character is terrific. The Penguin is portrayed as a troubled, angry, disgusting, and disturbed individual. And some of his characteristics are kept true. He still looks like an absurd villain and seems like a laughable villain. Yet the character gets a very serious approach taken to him and it is done very well. DeVito does a good job of playing that character created for him.The story is very good! I love the opening scene and the opening credits! Although the movie seems really rushed at first in order to get the balls rolling! The action sequences are great in this film. And the special effects are even better. This Gotham City is even darker than the first one and it just expands the viewers imagination even more. The interpretation of this Gotham City is truly Gothic! A nice adjustment is made to Danny Elfman's original theme that gives the music a newer feeling.Batman Returns is a good sequel to the first. Tim Burton did a great job handling these first two Batman movies. It urks me that he was taken away from the series because the industry thought his interpretations were to "dark" or "scary". That is what Batman is all about and Burton did a good job handling him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the original franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An improvement over the original, mainly because Burton let his distinctive style come out. The story's a bit better, but it's the Gothic look of the film that makes me like it more. And also because Catwoman is probably the best Batman villain portrayed thus far. The romance in this film is far more interesting than in any of the other Batman films - especially Begins - and it's mostly because Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific. Keaton is better than in the first one, and Danny DeVito is pretty good, but I thought Christopher Walken was wasted in a rather useless villain role. It's easily the weirdest of all the Batman films, and it's also the best of the 'original' franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In BATMAN RETURNS We See Why Michael Keaton Split!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, we have a case of taking some liberties with an established comic character. Where we understand the need to adapt certain material from one medium to another, we must protest when a writer/director monkeys a little too much.In BATMAN RETURNS,the second of the Batman Big Screen Box Office Bonanzas, we have what seems to be a formula.Following 1989's BATMAN, which featured the Origin, even the Christening* of The Joker. For the most part, the story was well handled.(Read my Review of the 1st Tim Burton BATMAN(1989) ).Starting with #2 Film, BATMAN RETURNS, we seem to have some doubts about sustaining a full 2+ hours with just one measly Arch Villain to do battle with. So, a sort of split time screenplay with 2 separate(but equal) sub-plots; almost like having 2 different movies.As to the Selina Kyle Catwoman episode, we can give it a reluctant o.k., or at least an "o". Mr. Burton took the Feminine Feline Angle, and ran with it. From a female enemy, who had been a Second Story Woman** and a Gotham City Socialite, to a Career Girl with an almost Lycanthropic*** relationship to her cats. Interesting, we haven't seen her return, yet.As to the Burton treatment of The Penguin, well that's another story. In looking back into Comics' History, we find that the Penguin made his First Appearance in the lead Batman Story, "One of the most Perfect Frame-ups!", Detective Comics #58, dated December, 1941. The story was penned by Bill Finger, long time Batman scripter and the writer responsible for so many of the Batman items , of which we all have come to be accustomed.In the story, Mr. Bruce Wayne and his Ward,Dick Grayson observe a very unusual looking, little man at an Art Gallery. They make the observation, "...Doesn't he look like a Penguin?" As the story progresses, we learn that the 'funny looking' little guy is up to no good. He is a criminal, of the caliber requiring the attention of The Dynamic Duo.At an early part of the story we hear the true name of The Penguin spoken. It's Mr. Boniface. That's his name, Mr. Boniface. (Remember this, it might be on the Test!) But just a name change alone is a bad enough transgression. But, the movies Origin and Characterization are hardly palatable.The Tim Burton remake the Penguin a Totasl Freak of Nature, not only abandoned by his Parents (played by Mr. and Mrs. Peewee Herman), but thrown into a sewer after a life in which his deformities were hidden from the world. Flipper Feet, Wing-like Arms, an Elongated and Beak-like Probosis, Beedy Eyes and Larry Fine-like Hair. Add that raspy, dry, gravely voice that Danny DiVito uses and you have a study in the Grotesque, a Classic example, no less.The Penguin of the Comics and of the Batman TV Series (1966-68)was odd, peculiar but not gross as Director Burton re-made him. I don't think he was such a Hommicidal Maniac, either.If the Penguin was any thing with his short stature, his waddling walk and his ever present Tuxedo and Top Hat, along with his wearing of a monocle, he was Eccentric.In looking around for just what was the inspiration for Batman cartoonist, Bob Kane and chief script writer Bill Finger in creating the Penguin, we have a theory. Just watch John Huston's THE MALTESE FALCON (1941), Starring Humohrey Bogart. Just take a look at the portrayal of Villain, Kasper Guttman by Sydney Greenstreet. His looks, his costuming (right down to gloves and spats),his slow waddling gait,the rolly-polly build all lead one to conclude that he was the inspiration for the Penguin. Certainly not this grotesque, twisted sewer dwelling monster.* In giving the gangster who would become The Joker the name of Jack Napier, Mr. Burton did us all a favor. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe he ever had any other name. THANX, Tim.** Burglar have been called Second Story Men for years, so in keeping with Political Correctness, we offer this Gender change.*** From Lycanthropy or belief in certain men's ability or curse of changing into Wolves.

		<shortDescription>Cyberpunk, meet German Expressionism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raise your hand if you've ever heard the term "German Expressionism." If your hand is still timidly at your side, but you've seen this movie, put it in the erect position.Tim Burton returns to the age of silent movies and the spooky mise-en-scene of the likes of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu (which starred the real, and naturally hideous, Max Schreck as the vampire) with his follow-up to the Academy Award winning Batman.German Expressionism is rather simple in theory, but takes a master to execute. Basically, it means that the scenery surrounding the story is not an accurate representation of what we would expect to see, but rather an extension of the attitudes and moods of the central characters. In this case, we get a abysmally dark and lifelike Gotham City. Burton intentionally mixed clashing architectural styles so that nothing seemed to make sense in his phantasmagorical world.Score composer Danny Elfman is also back and provides a soundtrack that feels more like an opera than simple movie music. He writes and edits his notes and dynamics so that they line up with everything, right down to the physical movement of the characters. For a crash-course in how to create a great film moment with music, pay special attention to the meltdown of Selina Kyle in her apartment.Just as with Jack Nicholson in the original film, the focus is again on the villain(s), not Batman himself. Some people, especially connoisseurs of the comic book series, seem to despise Burton's decision to do so. However, I find it captivating and mesmerizing when coupled with the almost-cyberpunk landscape in which the story unfolds. DeVito and Pfeiffer do well enough to carry this responsibility.However, this film does not ride on the coattails of its stars. Rather, Burton's imaginative genius and Elfman's haunting score create a world that I feel like I've visited in my dreams, though I know it exists only in the depths of a few creative minds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bat is back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Batman film series got off to a fantastic start with Tim Burton's moody and atmospheric 1989 classic. And then in 1992 he helmed this sequel, Batman Returns, which is in every regard just as good as its predecessor, if not better. Sadly, the series went seriously off course when Joel Schumacher inherited the directors chair, and churned out the dreadful Batman Forever and the astonishingly dire Batman &amp; Robin. It wasn't until Batman Begins that things finally got back on track.But in 1992, Batman was still going strong. And with Batman Returns, Tim Burton has really outdone himself. The first part was a tough act to follow, but Burton, great filmmaker that he is, crafted an even more ambitious sequel that weaves a multilayered screenplay of character arcs. A true masterpiece.Burton's vision of Gotham City is more extraordinary than it was last time. I don't even know where to begin to describe it. There is so much to see. Gotham City exists as an extension of the psychological states of the characters, and Burton's imagination has really been allowed to rove. Because the film has a Christmas setting, the snow serves to intensify the already impressive set-design. I love the breathtaking opening shot of Gotham City, wintry and frigid, with the skyscrapers barely visible in the background.Then there's Gotham Zoo. And what a sight it is! Giant crabs. Towering monuments. Batman Returns is worth watching just to drink in all of the astonishing sets Burton keeps throwing up at us.On to the story. BR is a much more ambitious film. There are quite a few story arcs the film juggles. Its a testament to the writers that they keep them all going as skilfully as they do. Batman (Michael Keaton) still defends Gotham City by night, but new dangers are about to make themselves known.First off is the Penguin (Danny DeVito), an aquatic bird-man dumped into the sewers at birth by his horrified parents. Now he plots revenge on the society that shunned him. Then there's Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), who becomes Catwoman after being pushed out a window by her power-hungry boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), nipped back to life by the alley cats of Gotham City. And Shreck has his own plans for Gotham, and proxy's the Penguin as the new mayor to fulfil his own ends.There may be a lot going on in this film, but I never found it difficult to follow the action. In fact I think superhero films work best when they craft screenplays that resonate on many different levels. Films like Superman, and the later likes of X2 and Spider-Man 2.All the cast deliver the goods. Michael Keaton again turns in a haunting portrait of a psychologically split man. But its really in the supporting players where the film opens up. Danny DeVito turns in a cracking performance. He brings a real animalistic edge to the part. Lecherous, leering, a yucky green bile drooling from his mouth and an astonishing makeup job make the Penguin a much more obscene creature than he ever was in the comics. DeVito's brash attitude coupled with his diminutive frame make him ideal for the role.And then there's Michelle Pfeiffer. Normally a very closed-off actress, she's a total revelation as Catwoman. Throwing herself into the part with gusto, she crackles with sexual energy, and smoulders in her scenes with Batman. The chemistry between the two of them is electric. Pfeiffer gives quite an astute and well judged performance. The way she acts out her split into psychosis is very well done. The scene where she defaces her pink, cutesy apartment is quite shocking and strangely liberating all at the same time.And although her feline powers are never properly explained, I liked the way her story arc is written. Her slowly building insanity is highlighted well. She's let down and betrayed by all the men in her life. First her boss, Max Shreck pushes her out a window when she catches on to his nefarious schemes. Then she forms an alliance with the Penguin, who turns on her when she won't give him what he wants.And finally, there's Batman/Bruce Wayne. She recognises a kindred spirit in Bruce, and the two of them are irresistibly drawn to each other. But then there's a wonderful scene at a masquerade ball. She and Bruce are the only ones not wearing masks. And they inadvertently reveal their identities to one another. This is the one man she even halfway trusts, and he is her enemy. Its a haunting and emotionally fragile moment that shatters Selina's sanity once and for all.And Tim Burton delivers on the action scenes too. The Batmobile is just as stunning as ever. Especially the scene where it transforms into a missile and squeezes through a narrow alley. And there's quite a wide variety of gadgets and gimmicks on hand. The Penguin's multi-purpose umbrellas, from flamethrowers to a child's mobile. A giant rubber duck that functions as a car and a boat. Giant circus trains. And Batman's impressive Bat-Ski. (Although I did miss the Batwing).There is so much to recommend about this film. Danny Elfman turns in another magnificent film score. Alternately moody and exhilarating. All the different plot strands are resolved quite nicely. The Penguin's death scene is surprisingly moving. And so is Selina's. Until the film throws a last minute spanner in the works that really packs a punch. The closing shot is a whopper of a shocker.So sad that Burton was dropped after this. If he had continued, he undoubtedly would have made an even better additional saga. It wasn't to be, and the series hit a rough patch. But bear in mind it regained strength. Tim Burton's Batman films are still the highlight of the series for me. They really are among the most wonderful comic-book film adaptations ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman returns, sort of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first sequel to "Batman," and Michael Keaton's last outing as the Caped Crusader thus far. With this film, the mood is as eerie as the original film, this time starring Danny DeVito as the Penquin and Michelle Pfieffer as the Catwoman. Here, a corrupted businessman named Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) helps the Penquin to become the mayor of Gotham City; Max also wants to build a power plant that would steal Gotham's electricity. In the mix is Selina Kyle, who ultimately turns into Catwoman. The results lead to a dramatic performance by the tragic, yet frightful Penquin, and the sexy and luring Catwoman. Michael Keaton returns as Batman, and delivered a somber, yet powerful performance, just as he did in the first film. Keaton is, I think, the best of the three actors to play Batman in the first 4 films. The story is great, with plenty of action and great on-screen comprehension between Batman and Catwoman. She is an anti-hero of some sort, crafty and cunning, yet confused and apologetic. Out of all Batman's villains, Catwoman remains my favorite. Also, I enjoyed the music score by Danny Elfman - catchy, eerie and haunting. Some downsides are that some of the actions are a little overkill, like the part where one of the Penquin's goons attack the plaza during the Christmas tree lighting ceremony-a little too intense for a holiday scene. And, I think the movie should have focused more on Batman, since he does have the title-role and it would have been great to have his origins and background elaborated more. Batman just appeared on cue and didn't have a really intriguing introduction. And, Penquin took too much screen time; too much emphasis were placed on him.But overall, a pretty good sequel. Plenty of action! Grade B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Twisted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I love Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker in the first Batman installment, I have to say that Batman Returns is my favored movie in the Batman franchise. It is so wonderfully dark and psychologically twisted, yet there is hope for redemption in the affection that Batman and Catwoman develop for one another. For me Michelle Pfeiffer'sC atwoman represents the ultimate (anti)herione: intelligent, devious, sexy, fragile, unresistable, and tough as a bag of nails. How could you resist her? Danny DeVito is still as scary and magnetic as the Penguin as when I first saw the movie back in 1992. Michael Keaton does a great job reprising his role as the brooding, yet human, Batman. And when the hell isn't Chistopher Walken a bad ass you wouldn't wanna mess with? The special effects and make-up designs are very impressive, and Burton's look for Gotham city - that kinda dark, Gothic, modern 1930s look - is still, in my mind, the only accurate representation of Batman's home.A must (re)see for all true Batman fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic movie...beyond a superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an epic from start to finish. This movie reminds me of an operatic score, its dramatic and triumphant. It takes the simplicity of the original and adds lairs and depths to the characters- to take it beyond a superhero movie of bad versus evil which works for and against it. It explores dark sides, dripping with sexuality and black humour. This is possibly Michelle Pfeiffers finest role bar possibly Dangerous Minds-she turns from do-good nervous secretary to a sexy mysterious and nasty'cat woman.' Danny DeVito was perfect as the penguin- he had terrific lines in the blackest humour. Michael Keaton i maintain is the finest 'Batman;' and what is possibly one of the only downfalls of this movie is that again batman takes a backstep to the development of these bad guys stories. Thats why its beyond the superhero movie maybe some Batman die-hards were hoping for, as we see little of batman outside of when he first tackles the circus gang, in a tremendous set piece, full of action and gadgetry we see mostly character development of his foes. That said the scenes with Keaton and his interaction and chemistry with Michelle Pfeiffer's character was nothing short of sizzling, Keaton will probably go down as one of the most-underrated actors of all time, and again was terrific in this movie. Who else sizzled? the fantastic Christopher Walken-as the corrupt business man working to make the Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Tim Burton creates a Gotham ice world, absolutely awe-inspiring, the army of penguins in the end armed, is so dark and twisted it can only come out of the mind of Burton. Oh and the bat-mobile and Batmans new improved utility belt plus the arrival of the Batsub at the end. Its just so darn cool!Beside the original in my opinion there is no need to watch 'begins' or the poor Schumacher sequels because the real genius lies with Burton and Keaton and the co-stars, and the amazingly dark world that is created. Returns has its flaws maybe to the extent it tries to be too huge scale and there is possibly too much going on, but Burton wanted to really put his fantastical might in to this movie and i think thats where it struggles to match the original due to the fact its more of a Burton fantasy spectacle than a pure Batman movie, this is still a twisted epic and a must see, however clear Burton doesn't trust the original Bob Kane Batman story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pengiun (Danny DeVito) and evil millionaire Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) team up to rule Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton) tries to stop them. He also has to deal with Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has ideas of her own.Dark and pretty sick sequel to the 1989 "Batman". For starters the villains are pretty silly. DeVito is in an obvious fat suit as the Penguin and his character is needlessly grotesque. Walken sleep walks through his role (as always). Pfeiffer REALLY tries (and looks great in that costume) but her character goes all over the place and acts real strange (even for a Tim Burton film). Keaton is miscast--but he IS good. The movie is filled with stupid one liners which come out of nowhere and seem totally out of place in this context. The tone of the movie keeps switching gears--from comedy, to action, to horror, to romance--erratically. Also Batman kills two people (!!!), little babies are kidnapped and/or put in danger, the sexual aggressiveness of Catwoman is REALLY strong (for a PG-13 movie), the Penguin bites somebody on the nose and people are casually killed left and right. The story also ceases to make sense at certain points and goes barreling out of control by the end. I mean--penguins with BOMBS on their backs invading Gotham City? Come on! Director Tim Burton seems only concerned about production design and special effects. They are impressive (especially Wayne Manor) but swallow the story and the actors. Also the constant dark tone and cruelness really wears one down after a while. I kept watching but the darkness of this one was really too strong--this deserved an R rating.This was a big hit but parents who saw it with their children were (understandably) outraged and bombarded Warner Bros. with letters and calls. Because of that Burton had no hand in "Batman Forever" (the next movie). I do think Batman movies should be dark but not at the expense of characters and plot lines. And did Burton really think it was wise to have so much violence in a film children were going to see? And Batman should not kill. I give this a 6 for production design alone. Don't let little kids see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Knight Strikes Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best representations of Batman the world of cinema has ever seen. Burton gives us an even darker version of Batman. There is the one thing being the fact that this film concentrates more on the villains whether than Batman, but considering the brilliance of this film I thought it all worked out very well.Why? Burton juggled the actual comics continuity of Catwoman and Penguin and made them characters of tradegies. As a Die Hard Batman fan, I thought this was an excellent move, at least as far as cinematics go. I think this because the villains have more of a connection personally to Batman cause as we all know, Batman is a character of tradegy himself, not to mention a someone of purest darkness. Catwoman and Penguin are placed into that very darkness he is but in different doses and they have different morals. As a viewer, it was a very smooth combination of characters.As Batman, Michael Keaton makes a grand return. The best Batman by far, Keaton's frightening, and sometimes even depressing facial expressions brought out who Batman is. You can tell of the personal conflict and struggle he copes within himself. That was the beauty of Keaton's performance. He doesn't have to even say anything, you can just tell its there. Michelle Pfeifer was hands down fabulous. A grade A performance as Catwoman, so seductive, and just about what everybody else said about her at the time of this films release. Not to mention the fact that she brought out the tortured soul within perfectly as well. Equal in Keaton's performance as the Bat, Pfeifer pulled off his feminine opposite and with such style. DeVito couldn't have been a better choice for Penguin. Cruel, Sadistic, Funny, and Sad he highlighted them all within the character, and I'm happy Burton went with him. If I'm not mistaken Dustin Hoffman was at one point considered for the role and I don't think that would have worked out good.The movie itself is visually stunning once again, the view of Gotham was perfect, at times I felt like I was actually in a comic book, cinematic art to a marvelous perfection (if that makes any sense). Not to mention Danny Elfman's staggering theme.A perfect Batman film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A coldly intimate film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton followed up 1989's 'Batman' with Edward Scissorhands (1990) and elements of the latter film are evident in 'Batman Returns', namely the wintery feel and characters unusually formed since birth (Edward and The Penguin respectively- by comparison the first Batman film shows that The Joker and Batman were created in adulthood). Even the pastel pink houses of Edward Scissorhands seem mirrored in the pink interior of Selina Kyle's (Michelle Pfeiffer's) apartment but with a difference-this is the suburbanite bubblegum pink of the mid 1980s, when Madonna was actually a 'True Blue' conservative (a Thatcherite 'Material Girl'. What first attracted her to the millionaire Bruce Wayne? Well, Catwoman doesn't actually know that Bruce is a millionaire. It's never hinted at but perhaps it's actually sweet Selina (so interested in company records) who has more money-minded intentions. As Catwoman, she has now moved on to Madonna's 'Erotica' phase of the early 90s.The Gotham City of Batman Returns feels, possibly unintentionally, like a small to medium sized city, as opposed to the towering skyscrapers and cathedral of the first film. The architecture of Batman Returns is reminiscent of modernist architecture from the 1930s and the austere lettering of the 'Shreck' building is like the graphic design from that time. Whereas the first film had the engaging Knox and various other side characters, Batman Returns is very much concentrated on the 3 villains. Commissioner Gordon and butler Alfred have just brief appearances. The assortment of circus-like goons (who are Batman's only real foes) give a carnival-like look to some of the film, slightly alike to Tim Burton's next film, The Nightmare Before Christmas. The best of Danny Elfman's score is re-used from the first film and the other songs do not form the centrepiece to scenes, unlike the way that Prince's did in the first film.Despite Jack Nicholson being widely though to have stolen all the scenes in the first Batman film (he should do if he was paid 50 million dollars), the warm, dry wit of Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne shone through and memorably stood up to the Joker in the scene in Vicky Vale's apartment where he demands of The Joker: 'Do you want to get nuts? Come on- let's get nuts!' In Batman Returns, so little time is given to the Bruce Wayne character that the Wayne/Kyle romance appears to be little more than a speed date. Even Batman doesn't have many memorable encounters with any of the villains. I can't remember him laying a hand on The Penguin or Max Shreck, instead opting to flirtatiously fight with Catwoman. (After Selina Kyle is found looking through company records and admits to Shreck that she knows of his plans to drain away rather, than provide power to, Gotham City pushes her through a window, causing her to hit her head and be bitten by various cats, after which she feels compelled to rebel against her mousy image and dress up in tight fitting black leather). However, no good reason is hinted at why Catwoman has taken a dislike to Batman other than perhaps envy. There are fewer memorable set pieces than the first film, where The Joker used a hand buzzer to kill a gang member, sunk a quill in to another's neck and gassed an entire art gallery (and later attempted to do the same to the main street in the city). Instead, The Penguin's tricks all come from his umbrella, apart from when he injures somebody by biting their nose. The giant rubber duck on wheels climbing steps in Ice World, before later crashing, was a surreal high-point though, almost a nod towards the supposedly camp 1960s series that was actually sometimes quite scarily surreal with its tilted camera angles. In the tradition of Frankenstein (and Edward Scissorhands), it seems that Burton wanted to give each of his 'monsters' a positive side. Shreck is shown as willing to sacrifice himself to save his beloved son Chip (a chip off the old block) and vice versa. The Penguin was brought up in a sewer and, therefore, we feel sorry for him for that. Arguably one of the most moving scenes out of either Batman film is when he is laid to rest by the penguins he lived with.Batman Returns can't top the set pieces, the witticisms or the scale of the first film (I'm sure it wasn't meant to) but anybody primarily looking for a quirky, coldly intimate film with great costumes and striking design will give this film the even higher score of 8 or even 9 out of 10 that it arguably deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Batman Returns" is very entertaining as a movie and is professionally made with some big talents both in front and behind the cameras. Still the movie goes a bit too far at times and becomes utterly ridicules, even for Tim Burton standards.I'm a big fan of Tim Burton's style so this movie certainly is not a disappointment to me. The movie has this typical and unique crazy look that distinct Tim Burton movies from others. There also are some typical, crazy like Tim Burton characters in this movie, such as the main villains (Penguin, Max Shreck) and especially the bizarre red triangle circus gang. The end result of all those odd and unique things combined, works surprising well and entertaining as a movie, that is watchable for all, so you don't really have to be a Tim Burton fan to fully enjoy this movie.The story is very simple and because of that it also gets quite ridicules at times, especially toward the ending with the Penguin when the movie loses most of its credibility. The whole duality between the Bruce Wayne and Batman character is highly underdeveloped in this movie and the character of Bruce Wayne is totally uninteresting in this movie, as is Alfred, who both had some good scene's together in "Batman".The new characters in this movie are a welcome addition to the Batman movie franchise. Christopher Walken and Danny DeVito are both wonderful as the new 'villains', whose characters are really deepened out good enough and are quite humane. But there, also at the same time, lies another small problem I had with this movie. The villains weren't stereotypical villainous enough. Christopher Walken just plays a 'normal' businessman and Penguin is more tragic than he is villainous. Oh, well guess I was just expecting another villainous Joker like character(s) in this movie. Also a welcome addition is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She is surprising good and believable in her role and she plays a memorable impressive character and not just only memorable because of the way she looks.The action is good and there are some good fight sequences. There also are some good new cool Batmobile tricks in this movie. I really want a Batmobile for Christmas now!The musical score from Danny Elfman is wonderfully present again in this movie which certainly adds to the mood and atmosphere of the movie in a positive way. The good action-editing is from specialist Chris Lebenzon.All to together its a wonderful and good looking action movie, that is very entertaining to watch, time after time without ever loosing any of its power or entertainment value. This is mainly thanks to the new characters that are in this movie and the lively directing from Tim Burton.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

It is not as good as "Batman", because Jack Nicholson's Joker is better than either the Penguin (Danny DeVito) or Catwoman (Michelle Pheiffer). Christopher Walken is very good as Catwoman's abusive boss, who is partially responsible for her transformation from meek office worker to villainess.Another reason "Batman Returns" is the last good movie of the original 4 is because Michael Keaton is so good in his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He captures the darkness in Batman's personality without being somber. Neither Val Kilmer, or especially George Clooney (I think Joel Schumacher is largely to blame) every really captured the spirit of Batman. Clooney is almost a parody of Batman.I try not to comment much on the plot of movies, because I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, but this movie is well worth watching, and while not a classic, it is a very good super-hero saga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was the night before Christmas in Gotham City...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a cold, snowy night one time in Gotham City, a rich couple gave birth to their first and (presumably) last child. The child is deformed and is assumed a safety risk. A few nights or weeks later, on a nightly stroll through the park, the couple has decided to toss the baby and its carriage over a bridge, where it is gently taken by the still waters into the sewer.It was on this same night in 1992, that director Tim Burton gave rise to the dynamic, multi-layered sequel to his 1989 blockbuster with "Batman Returns." It's darker, moodier, sexier and more vibrant than "Batman," and maybe even the Dark Knight's creator Bob Kane might be happy with Burton's vision. Or maybe not. It isn't better than its predecessor, but is at least on a certain level of creativity, if nothing else is ever as spectacular this time around.Burton's specialty is freaks, and they wear their hearts on all sleeves, if they wore sleeves. Burton has surrounded himself with freakish visual delights, circus outcasts and three figures struggling with "dual identities" this time in Gotham City as the Christmas holidays are rapidly approaching, and so the criminals are also out raising hell and who do the scared innocents call: Batman.The Penguin (Danny DeVito, perfectly hideous under a ton of Oscar-nominated Stan Winston prosthetics) is largely responsible for this new crime wave, as he aspires to rise to power in Gotham City's government, with the reluctant aid of corrupt business mogul Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), whose proposed power plant will drain the city of power once brought online. The Penguin's devious plot is shrouded in mystery from the masses, however, by his desire to find his identity and make peace with his now deceased parents, adopting the birth name "Oswald Cobblepot." More on this later.Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) is onto Cobblepot and Shreck's plans, but his DUAL IDENTITY as Batman will have to be put on hold when Shreck's mousy secretary... uh, executive assistant... uh, secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) adopts her DUAL IDENTITY as the S &amp; M-leather-bondage Catwoman after taking a swan dive out of a top-floor window, is resurrected by friendly felines, and becomes the object of Bruce's desires. Will they let their DUAL INDENTITIES as the Bat and the Cat get in the way of their passion, or will they live happily ever after?It could be stated "Batman Returns" is probably the sexiest and introspective (but does not reach the level of sophistication found in the first "Batman") of Burton's Gothic vehicles. Pfeiffer seems to be having the most fun as Catwoman - sexy, delicious, vicious - a role many felt was lacking with Halle Berry's continuation of the character 12 years later in the "Batman Returns" spin off, "Catwoman." Keaton is fulfilling once again as the Dark Knight, as his relationship this time with a romantic interest has a little more steam, much to the surprise of faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough).But as usual (and aside from Pfeiffer's sexy curvatures), Burton indulges in the visuals (which are beautiful, but so is Catwoman), but it could also be argued he leaves his players out in the cold in favor of the former. The romance between Bruce and Selina is almost non-existent by the time the credits roll, but Burton makes the effort to really explore the dark depths of his characters in the sequel and their struggles with alternate lives, giving reason to their troubling ways of causing mischief in Gotham City.Speaking of mischief, again, The Penguin's plans to run for mayor are overshadowed by his current two-fold operation of systematically murdering Gotham's first-born children, biblical-style, by drowning them in the sewers from where he has risen, and framing Batman for the kidnapping of the Ice Princess (Cristi Conaway).Action is plentiful, as the three main characters are given enough screen time to live out their roles. Danny Elfman's score is there this time too, in order to back its frequent scenes of action and mayhem. Director Burton may have outdone himself on this sequel, as it was his last chance at the Dark Knight, as was also Keaton's.It will be a darker, stormier night in Gotham City when Batman, The Penguin, and Catwoman decide to get together and have themselves a Christmas party.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a way darker version of Batman than the original. It is dark and nihilistic, but this necessarily isn't a bad thing. I actually like this version, since Batman is supposed to be the DARK Knight. There are two more memorable villains, Danny Devito as the Penguin, and especially Michelle Pfeiffer as the slinky and sexy Catwoman. Not only that, the special effects, production design (who wouldn't want the Batmobile!), and music score by Danny Elfman are top notch. But AGAIN, there is absolutely no character development for the hero of this film Batman, with the villains again both getting back stories as to why they become who they are. We will have to wait until the 5th installment of Batman (2005's Batman Begins) to finally learn why Bruce Wayne became Batman. Regardless, coming from auteur Tim Burton, Batman Returns is overall a spectacular film. Solid 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most misunderstood films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it came time to make a sequel to BATMAN, Tim Burton decided that he did not want to make a conventional sequel. Those are good too &amp; with the proper imagination driving it could work well. Instead of giving us the Bruce Wayne that is self assured, he gave us a more realistic take on the character. A recluse who uses the guise of Batman as therapy. He may or may not be as psychotic as those that he fights depending on who you ask. This characterization fascinated film students, regular movie goers and more open minded Batman fans. However it also angered the fans of the "real Batman". The ones who don't want to see an adaptation but a direct translation of the comic books because they don't really understand the differences between comics &amp; film. They don't quite get what may work best in one medium and what works best in the other. A lot of these same fans do admit that while they didn't like Wayne though they thought Batman was pretty well done.Burton was into creating something a bit more original so he kicked up the German expressionism influence that Bob Kane &amp; Bill Finger had in their very first "The Bat-Man" stories from 1939, when it came to creating Batman Returns. The film is a metaphorical representation of Bruce Wayne's psyche. Each character in this film represents a different aspect of Bruce Wayne's persona. It shows how all these aspects of Batman's mind cannot function as one. He is too disjointed because of the trauma he received the night his parents were killed. A lot of things in the film show us this. One example is when Batman blows up a guy then we see that at the same moment Catwoman blows up a department stores. They are one in the same, Catwoman represents the vigilante side of Bruce Wayne. Max Schreck &amp; The Penguin also represent flip-sides to the Batman coin. The tough millionaire business man &amp; the sad orphan longing for his parents love. There are also biblical references sprinkled throughout, many films students have pointed out that in certain ways The Penguin is a very evil &amp; disturbed version of the biblical character Moses.To me this is my favorite of the Batman films for that reason. I love the subtext of it and how there are so many ways to interpret it. That's what a great film is supposed to do. The fact that somebody even approached a superhero film as an homage to German expressionism because it added a certain depth to it &amp; showed the potential of what could be done with these characters that we all love. I also feel that the romance between Catwoman &amp; Batman is the best in any superhero film to date. For the record I've been reading Batman comics since I was 6 years old, I am now in my 20's it's not that I don't understand the character it's that I understand that in his 60 year history there have been too many interpretations for anybody to claim that there is a "definitive Batman". As a fan I am thankful for all 5 of the Batman films because they each showed how diverse the character could truly be just like the comics also have. They all have flaws and some of them are not that great but they all achieved what they set out to do. Be adaptations of in my opinion the greatest character in American fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's Yule Tide comic-book hero tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns feels like a Tim Burton film much more than the first Batman did. It is a bit more peculiar, and has a wilder imagination. It also has much more going on than the first, we're introduced to many new characters and quite an amusing plot linking all of them together. This is the first of what will hopefully be many of Burton's films with a Christmas context (if you're a fan of his I obviously don't need to tell you the next one). I really liked that as a setting, it made it stand out much more than any other comic-book film adaptation. It's cold, there's snow, everything should be happy and magical but instead things go bad. I was surprised at just how moving this movie actually was; it really does make you think about the characters, and it is much more operatic and tragic than the first.All the characters were very fascinating, as each of the three main characters (the bat, the cat, and the penguin) came to be under some unfortunate circumstances. They all have the potential to do good (luckily Batman does), and they all seem to be half-creature, half-human, almost struggling with their identities and purposes. The connecting character between these creatures is Max Shreck, played by the always- great Christopher Walken. While he's the only fully human character, he seems to be the most inhuman, he's an evil guy who conflicts with each of them at some point. You probably know the plot or have seen the movie already, so I won't bother explaining the multi-layered plot, but it really came together in a great, unexpected way. The first Batman ended in a way that justice was served, and Batman will continue to be a hero and find a way to cope with his own life, and everything will be okay. This one was such a tragic tale that really portrayed the darker side of being Batman.There were so many things I liked about this movie. The relationship between Selina Kyle/Catwoman and Bruce Wayne/Batman was especially interesting. What really made it so sad was that they were so alike but Selina just couldn't pull it together. Two of my favourite parts of the movie occur during the Christmas party scene. First of course, was when Bruce and Selina finally find out each other's identities. That was such an indescribably moving scene that worked so perfectly. The other part was when Bruce confronts Max Shreck. Shreck talks about how he is the real secret power that runs the city, and that "it doesn't matter who's mayor." Bruce replies, "it matters to me." What should have been this big, powerful speech scene turns out very brief, when Shreck, clearly indifferent to Bruce Wayne, says "YAWN," then walks away. Not only was it amusing but I thought it did make a lot of sense, that's the way that character is.Danny Devito and some extremely talented makeup artists (not to mention the way the filmmakers ingeniously reinvented him) do a great job in bringing the evil penguin character to life. Honestly, I never saw Devito here. I could sort of make him out, but he really just got into the character so deeply that I saw just the character. I was very impressed with him, it's unlike anything he's ever done, and he certainly did not deserve that Razzie nomination! Danny Elfman's score was particularly incredible as well, and it's a sin that he did not get an Oscar nod.Batman Returns is much edgier and darker in mood than its predecessor. I love both movies, but I think I prefer this one. There was just so much more to it. I love the atmosphere they both create, and no other superhero movies have anything like it to offer.My rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BATMAN RETURNS *** Tim Burton's finesses considerably more gruesome and darkness into this Batman tale. Michael Keaton is back as the title character, who must battle the wits of The Penguin and Catwoman amidst a deceptive plague Gotham City is faced with. Additional combat rounds come into play with Christopher Walken. Though Daniel Waters's screenplay provides little support to the film's setting and characters, the lead villains give noteworthy performances: Danny DeVito is dynamic, believable, and never a heartbeat shy of daunting; Michelle Pfeiffer is seductively stellar. Fans of Burton will be pleased, though it's hard to miss that there are too few appearances by the film's star. It's in comparison that you can decide if the result satisfies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome back to Tim Burton's freak-show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than its predecessor, this movie really belongs to its director.Just read the plot summary: a disfigured child turns into the revolting Penguin(Danny De Vito), who plans revenge on Gotham City with evil businessman Max Schreck(Christopher Walken).They'll have to face two problems: Batman(Michael Keaton),the city's vigilante who spends his nights tracking down and arresting criminals, and Selina Kyle(Michelle Pfeiffer), Schreck's ex-secretary, back from the dead as the fascinating yet deadly Catwoman.It contains all of Burton's favorite stuff:extreme outcasts feared by ordinary people, a dark and Gothic landscape covered with snow(Gotham City at Christmas is visually delighting) and references to old horror movies(Christopher Walken played the lead in a seminal horror flick, as did the actor his character is named after).As in the previous film, it's more about Batman's opponents than the Caped Crusader himself.It's got little to do with Bob Kane's characters and all to do with Burton's creepy, twisted imagination.It's a film noir with a weird romance and even weirder heroes and villains.Just don't get fooled by the foreboding climax: the two subsequent flicks have nothing in common with this one, except the titular guy, not to mention that they're really awful.Anyway, this is a perfect introduction, alongside Edward Scissorhands, to Burton's genius, in case you haven't seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another great movie by Tim Burton and a good sequel to his original Batman 1989. Again Burton does a fine job of portraying a dark Gothum City, even more so than in the first one, and chooses another batch of great actors to play the new villains.Danny DeVito did a fine job of playing the Penguin, as did Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, (boy she looked good in that suit, meow lol). I'v noticed that some reviewers on here don't see much point in having Christopher Walken's character, but i liked his performance and he was good alongside the Penguin. Also it was good to see the character of Alfred being extended and seeing him help Batman when Batman was going through the sewer towards the Penguin's hideout.All in all, another fine job by Burton and the cast makes for an enjoyable second Batman movie. It gets a vote of 8 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though this movie isn't AS good as the first movie, it's an extremely close second and quite fun. It is the last really good Batman movie (I haven't seen "Batman Begins" though). Once again, nicely done, Tim Burton.In his second (and *sniff* final) role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Michael Keaton does a really good job. Especially when it comes to embodying the role of Batman, something that not many of the other actors who play Batman/Bruce Wayne have been able to do.Danny De Vito does really well as The Penguin. Creepy, possessed, and everything else that comes with the package. The juices are flowing and he fits into the role as if it were a glove. The other main villain in the film, Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken) is a really good corrupt business man, a classic villain in any movie.And who can forget the luscious Michelle Pfeiffer in her role as the uber sexy Catwoman? Needless to say, Michelle was MADE for this role. She's both evilly innocent and a courageous villain in turns.This movie's really good and a must see for any Batman fan. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was far from conventional, this time Burton had more freedom to mold Batman into his own vision. He set up to explore the deepest and darkest themes found throughout its long and rich multimedia history all while managing to pay homage to its many diverse depictions and different eras. Burton delivered what is still to this point the most polarizing and controversial interpretation of Batman's history. An uneasy, deliciously dark and humorous, visually striking and sense assaulting experience disguised as a simple straight forward, and campy blockbuster further enhanced by its amazing score, depressive blue Christmas setting, influential production design, creative costume design, rich symbolism and tour de force performances (a career defining for Michelle Pfeiffer).Batman finds himself pitted against and emotionally challenged by 3 "villains":- A disturbing circus freak with a tragic past, Oswald Cobblepot known as the Penguin, who was abandoned by his wealthy and influential parents and who just like Bruce had his innocence taken from him at a premature age.He feels cheated of a promising life and represents Bruce's life gone wrong as he wishes to inflict pain and for people to suffer the same for what he went through. Unlike Bruce or Selina feels no remorse or conflict, there is no turning back for him. He is understandably pure angst and bitterness and in spite of being an eloquent and highly intelligent individual is mainly driven by his instincts, thirst for revenge, carnal and affection needs making him an easy prey for Max Schrecks' plot.- Selina Kyle aka Catwoman, a woman who by trying to better herself ventured out of her comfort zone only to inevitably become the very thing she sought not to, failing to stand out and succeed in a tough male run world where there is no room for a shy, inexperienced, naive girl even if willing, intelligent, thoughtful, honest, hard working and creative, a world where only the fittest survive and the unethical climb while the weak languish in the background. In conclusion everything society molded her to be and all she was entitled to aspire to. She is an innocent, girlish and immature woman predictably fond of the color pink, stuffed animals and cats who is harassed and humiliated at work. A subtle glimpse of her dormant and repressed side is shown at the beginning of the movie after her first encounter with "the Batman". Selina discovers her boss', a truly heartless but beloved businessman depicted by the twisted media as a working man of humble upbringing and an uninterested anthropologist Max Schreck, sinister and disguised attempt at blackmailing and taking the city hostage by holding a monopoly on energy which causes her to be disposed of mercilessly by Schreck who corners her and throws her out of a high story window of a skyscraper. She falls on her back on several inches of snow and is symbolically revived by cats and reborn as a self-confident "executive assistant" turned vigilante focused on destroying Schreks evil empire and stranglehold on the city. All the while still enjoying her once seemingly unreachable, new fulfilling and limitless self by indulging in what she thought would be a mere diversion. She is sidetracked by Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, she begins to question herself and be scared of what she has become after it appears she has met "the one" shattering her once firm and "cynic" perspective of life and fracturing her new found confidence, the delicate balance of her duality, her selfish empowerment and forcing her to consider giving up her crusade against injustice and live a normal life with Bruce, reluctantly confirming and accepting the goals of life as dictated by a two faced, hypocrite society which allows men like Max Schrek to come out on top and control the world at will. The dynamic relationship of Bruce and Selina is by far the best, most tragic, erotic romance to date in comic book genre movie. - Max Schreck who claims to represent the city itself, and who one day plans to live through his son who will make sure his legacy lives on. He will stop at nothing and no one to accomplish it until he gains full control of the city and the political and justice authorities are his puppets.Batman Returns is a deeper and genuine un-sugar-coated statement on marginalization, class and gender confrontation and alienation in a corrupt and hypocrite world. Despite superficial differences all that separates Batman and his foes are the side of the law they supposedly fight for which is not only blurry but undefined. All the Dark Knight rises only dared to superficially explore failing big time.During the ending credits the main character's themes breathtakingly morph into one another, coincidence?</fullReview>

Everyone knows the story: the Caped Crusader (Michael Keaton) battles the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), while Christopher Walken plays the corrupt Max Schreck.Maybe this movie has no real artistic value, but it's still pretty good.

		<fullReview>First of all, Michelle Pfeiffer was an excellent choice for Catwoman. She did a better job in the leather than in the "executive assistant" outfit, and she fit the role perfectly. Danny Davito did a good job as Penguin, but I think the character was a bit too disgusting for me. Okay, let's think about this: He lives in the sewers, he eats raw fish, and bits off people's noses! Ew! But, I digress.Again, I totally think that Michael Keaton still does a good job as Batman, and he does a better job at being Bruce Wayne this time. At least he's falling for a decent woman! Gosh! Thank God there is no more "Vicki Vale" *gag*! I hated Vicki Vale!!! She was so stupid and pathetic. At least Catwoman does something.I really didn't care much for the whole "Schrek helps Penguin become Mayor" storyline, but at least Batman was falling for a decent woman.So, what happened to Catwoman, anyways??? I think she should come back when they make a sequel to Batman &amp; Robin (which they definitely will, or otherwise I will do it for them), along with the Riddler and Mr. Freeze. But, again, I digress.Overall: It was a good sequel. And thank goodness there is no more Vicki Vale!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly my favorite Batman movie out of all five films. Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle was an excellent choice, as was Danny Devito as The Penguin. Tim Burton's dark and twisted cinematic atmosphere is strongly expressed, and Michael Keaton's role as the Dark Knight is even better than the first film. As usual, Tim Burton captivates his audience and causes people to want to enjoy his work repeatedly. I did feel sorry for The Penguin because of what his parents did to him when he was only an infant. It was cruel and inhumane. As for Michelle Pfeiffer's part as Catwoman, you still cheer her on even though she is an opposing force to Batman in the story. Her hidden identity and obvious beauty are both elements that help make that happen. The lack of daylight and Gothic architecture are also factors that help make this movie as good as it is. It helps create a mood and a sense of life for the film. In other words, Burton does it again!I believe that this movie can never be outdone by a future Batman movie, no matter how many times the attempt is made.10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best comic book film of all time! ***** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen a comic book film that portrays a world of pure Gothic darkness like this one does. This is one of Tim Burton's very best films. It's one of the earliest films I can remember absolutely dying to see as a kid. There was no choice, I HAD to see this as soon as it came out.Now, what's interesting is that when I was young I was never a huge fan of the original film. In fact, even though I had seen it years before on video, I didn't really remember a lot about it. It's not that way now, mind you, I have seen the original a bajillion times since then. It's also interesting to think back and be able to say I wasn't really a fan of Batman at all. I believe it's because I was never properly introduced to the character and knew little about the comics (I had never read any). But I can remember first seeing a trailer to 'Batman Returns' infront of a little film my mom had rented years ago called 'Curly Sue'. And as soon as I saw the brief scenes of the pengiun flying away with his crafty umbrella I became obsessed and hellbent on seeing the film.I remember sitting in the theater and the chills that went all over me as the main title unfolded and the Danny Elfman theme song blasted through the speakers. A memory that will forever remain.What can I say? The film is the absolute very best of it's kind. It's unashamedly dark the way it should be. It's not afraid of showing how villainous a villain can be. That's not to say that The Penguin doesn't have a human side to him. The whole reason he turned out to be the way he is is because of what his parents did to him. Poor fella. He happens to be my favorite villain of all time because of this film. And the Catwoman is without a doubt the sexiest villain to appear on the screen. Also, given a human side so that we may sympathize with her.Christopher Walken as Max Shrek. Wow, just when you didn't think a film couldn't get any better.And of course, The Batman! Michael Keaton, hands down is the best Batman of them all. It's really fascinating to see him deliver his bat-lines. And speaking of lines, the script is filled with some of the most memorable and often darkly humorous dialog I've ever heard.I'm also a big fan of the ending where all of the penguins are about to blow Gotham City to smithereens. The candy cane colored rocket backpacks are awesome! I could go on and on about the film, but I must bring this review to a close. Is there a true word to describe this film? Well, I dunno... I believe the word I'm looking for is... "AHHHHHHH!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Batman film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when I believed Tim Burton's Batman was the best of the series. But after several viewings of his sequel Batman Returns I changed my mind. Now I am not saying Batman (1989) was not a good film. In fact I think it was an excellent film. However, Batman Returns just feels superior In many ways. Michael Keaton played the dual role of Batman/Bruce Wayne to perfection, a much improved performance to the original Batman. Danny DeVito was awesome as the Penguin, probably more grotesque and sinister than his comic book incarnation. Then there's Michelle Pfeiffer as the sultry Catwoman, what more can you say? She completely embodied the character and took it to new limits.The technology in this film was much cooler and interesting. A new and improved Batmobile, the sleek Batmissile, and the all terrain Batskiboat were all used well in this movie. Batman's new gadgets ere also neat and a step up from the original.Overall this film has a crisper and more personal feel to it. The plot is darker and more personal, and all of the actors pull off there roles with great success. A must buy! ********* out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The caped crusader, or dark knight whatever you call him has returned to Gotham City. Michael Keaton is back as Batman in this sequel to the 1989 original with the same director Tim Burton (Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow). Unfortunately most of the best lines are stolen by the villains. Danny DeVito dominates the film as the evil Penguin who is trying to learn his past and change his future, while at the same time framing Batman. There is also the appearance of Michelle Pfeiffer as the curvaceous and mysterious Catwoman. Also plotting to take over the city with the help of the Penguin is the popular Christopher Walken. Also starring Pat Hingle as Comissioner Gordon, Michael Gough as Alfred and Vincent Schiavelli as Organ Grinder. An interesting sequel, not as much magic like the original and a bit darker, but still a very good classic. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up Artist and Best Special Effects. Batman was number 46 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, and he was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Keaton is the best batman ever! Even though there's more kissing in this one than the first, its still good! The penguin dude has great detail. Batman Returns isn't any worse than the first one, and probably better. Batman has really awesome gadgets and his costume is a bit cooler but is also a bit cheaper (to me). Keaton plays Wayne better than Kilmer or Clooney and his acting recreates the dark moments in the cartoons. Tim Burton has yet made another great film, and like the first, its streets are dark and mysterious. In this movie, Catwoman comes along who was formerly Ms. Kyle before she was thrown out of a 50 story window! But this movie is great and i'll give a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better of the sequels...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a cool movie. It takes the magic from the first one and keeps it rolling. Of course, it can't fully match the effectiveness of the first one in sheer exhilaration, but its does okay. We return to Gotham City where we discover two new foes on Batman's roster - A short rotund villain called the Penguin, with political aspirations, and Catwoman, a lithe, agile woman with her own agenda. This movie succeeds for several reasons. First, it's Tim Burton directing again, and he knew how to make a good Batman movie. Second, Micheal Keaton reprises his role as the billionaire/Dark Knight with the same energy and dedication. Third, Danny DeVito in the role that everyone will remember him for, since he fills those shoes quite perfectly. And fourth, Michelle Pfeiffer in skin-tight black leather. I think we've got the attention of the entire male demographic narrowed down exactly. A new addition to the cast is the indelible Christopher Walken. Here is a man who can take any role and make it his own. He's a remarkable actor, with a hidden charm that you can almost sense even in his villainous roles.Batman Returns is a worthy successor to the first installment, and quite honestly, the best of the sequels, both in spirit and loyalty to the characters. I definitely recommend you see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautiful in the strangest way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**MAJOR SPOILERS CONTAINED**This film is in my opinion the best comic book adap and a very good (often underrated) film, it captures not only the darkness of the comic but it is one of the most fun and at times beautiful films. The brilliant twirling zoom over the frozen amusement park into the penguins lair and the awesome design of gotham city (also used to amazing effect in the first one)are just some of the magnificent motifs that never cease to amaze me.The characters too are brilliant and Burton manages to create a very interesting villain, albeit a very misunderstood one, in the penguin and manages to almost make you cry at his death. Catwoman is brought to life amazingly by Michelle pfiefer delivering the great line "life's a bitch now so am I" and Keaton is still great as the caped crusader himself. And even though we always think of Catwoman and The Penguin as the 'bad guys' the only real villain is Christopher Walkens Max Shreck.And Although the action sequences aren't great this is still a great film and one of tim burtons best (although i've yet to see Ed Wood).I think this film is also great because it is so dark and managed to expand so well from the first film, it is just such a shame that all this work has been undone by the 3rd and 4th films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost As Good As The Original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very impressed with this film. There are not many movies that are almost as good as the original, but this one is. I had heard some bad things about it, that Burton overdid it this time, but I thought it was excellent and deserves more credit then it gets. The Joker is dead, but Batman is still protecting Gotham from punks and thieves. But now, he has a bigger problem on his hands. He now has TWO psychopath villains that he must deal with. CATWOMAN, and THE PENGUIN. The Penguin is a man, who was dumped in the sewer as a baby, because he was a freak. The Penguins raised him. I am having a little bit of trouble understanding Catwoman's deal, but trust me, she is one evil (and hot) chick. I love the way Tim Burton makes Gotham City look. It is so crazy, and it makes me want to live there. All the actor's performances were very impressive and realistic. I am going to cut this review short by saying that you need to go pick up this movie right now! Go get it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly grim and complex film disguised as a sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tim Burton's sequel to his original blockbuster is a surprisingly grim and complex film that is somewhat more satisfying than the original film that came before. Michel Keaton dons the cape for the last time in this movie and proves why he's still considered to be the best actor to ever play to play the cape crusader with a performance that really captures what the character was all about. Danny Devito does well as the freakiest Penguin and the true coup of excellence in this film is Michelle Puffer, who gives a excellent performance as Catwoman Burton gives Gotham a more grim feeling of dread this time around and a more festive way of creating mayhem for his characters. This was sadly the last collaboration between Burton and Keaton on the Batman films and sadly for the fans, the last good Batman film to be made. This film will hold up in the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a comic fan, I was not happy when I heard that the story for the Penguin and Catwoman was changed from that of the comics, but when I saw this brilliant movie, I could have cared less about the character's true origin. Tim Burton and Michelle Pfeiffer have absolutely captured the charm and grace of Selina Kyle. Danny DeVito also does a terrific job as the pitiful yet arrogant Oswald Cobblepot. The chemistry between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle is undeniable and unforgettable. Tim Burton's style was perfect for this film. The music, written by the genius Danny Elfman, completely captures the characters that people have read about for almost sixty years now. I was very pleased with this film, and it is now one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the one-sentence review of "Batman Returns" - any scene with Catwoman is great, and any scene with the Penguin is awful.There are exceptions, of course, but the quality of this film undeniably see-saws based on these characters. Whereas Catwoman is genuinely sympathetic - isn't it horrible, watching a nice woman get brutally murdered by a heartless tycoon? - the Penguin tries to evoke sympathy but is ultimately too grotesque to move me. Am I really supposed to care about a character who bites people's noses off, plans to murder children, and spits up loads of forest-green goo? It doesn't help that DeVito overplays the part terribly, burying any potential for subtlety by screaming out all his lines. Listen to how he mangles "they wouldn't put me on a pedestal, so now, I'm layin' them on a slab." That line could be pathetic and sad, or maybe scary, but the way DeVito plays it, it's merely loud.Thankfully, DeVito is the only acting dud here. Pfeiffer plays it just right, volleying between her vampish and cutesy personas with incredible skill. Walken is also great; he chews the scenery like a madman, but that's exactly the kind of acting that's called for in a movie where even the sets are outrageously over-the-top. And of course, Keaton is still good, although one can understand why he quit after this film, since he's given very little to do.On balance, "Returns" is the best of the series, because there are many genuinely emotional moments. But there's a distinctly grotesque quality to the movie that forces it slightly out of the mainstream, which is a shame - its relative commercial failure led to the series' descent into mindless popcorn drivel, starting with the next entry.</fullReview>

Michael Keaton recycles his previous performance to good extent and he's well matched with Michelle Pfeifer as Catwoman and Danny DeVito as the Penguin, but once again the plot can't seem to make up its mind on where its going and what it's trying to be.And why are the Penguin's thugs crazed clowns? Shouldn't they have been working for the Joker? Well, in any case, this dark romp of madness should leave action seekers happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly complex comic-book film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike Tim Burton's first film in the Batman franchise, "Batman Returns" is a completely satisfying romp through the perilous city of Gotham (which is so beautifully realized by the ingenious Bo Welch)and a quite moving study of loneliness. This is by far the best comic-book film made yet, and the only which successfully maintains a sense of fun and depth.Michael Keaton is a terrific Batman and Bruce Wayne, and is given more interesting quirks now than in the previous film. Danny Devito, quite possibly the most underrated actor in Hollywood, is brilliant as the literate, emotionally desolate Penguin(A.K.A. Oswald Cobblepot). Catwoman is played to perfection by Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her showiest roles, and Christopher Walken is hysterical as millionaire madman, Max Shreck. Burton uses his excesses to the film's advantage, such as clowns and a gloomy, domineering Gotham. The symbolism of the film isn't played in an obvious fashion, and asks the viewer to look more into the hearts of the characters than their surroundings. The first "Batman" suffered from a lack of complex characters, and its incredible art-direction took center stage (as well as an Oscar)."Batman Returns" is a deep psychological study of childhoods gone wrong, and the results are thought-provoking, cartoonishly wonderful, darkly hilarious, and mesmerisingly different</fullReview>

		<fullReview>batman returns is a really great batman movie. i never saw the batman with jack nicholson in it, but that's ok, because if you didnt see that this batman sums it up. michael keaton does a great job as the leading bat, and does manage to maintain a higher glow of male sexuality dripping all over in his batman suit. rumors were that the catwoman was to be played by someone else, but i dont remember the womans name. i saw her on vh1 because she and the director tim burton got into a quarrel about why she wasnt wanted for the role. i saw the woman on the show, and she couldnt have done what michelle did for the role. if the woman who played her in the 60's could have seen her acting, she would have been proud. great makeup on the penguin, (**SPOILER**) especially when he bites off a nose, that was really gross but added to the dramatic effect of the evil hero. the plot, of course, comes from a comic book, and does have some rather stupid points. but, batman was quirky, originally, with all the bat gadgets and stuff. i think all three of them combined in a huge way, making the movie a success. for all you batman fans out there, this is a must see for you. A fair word of warning, ladies, you wont be the same when you see michael running around town in the batman uniform. (A A-)</fullReview>

Shot in technicolour monochrome, the array of beautiful characters, sets, and the quirky script give us one of the few commercial blockbusters ever to be made with such a strong arthouse feel. Gothic fairytales don't come any better than this. Shame Tim Burton didn't continue to make Batman movies.

		<shortDescription>The Dark Knight at his darkest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a bare squeaker decision over its predecessor, this one gets my vote as the best of the Batman movies. This is the Batman mythos as it should always be: a dark, twisted world populated by deeply damaged people. Batman has never been a typical superhero, and this is no typical superhero movie.Yes, it has its share of action and mayhem, but the central pillar holding it all up is the interaction of profoundly disturbed people in bizarre outfits, and the question of what really makes Batman any different from the villains he thwarts.The Penguin, a villain I've never really cared for, is given a great new background here; a tragic, twisted, past worthy of the hero himself. DeVito comes off very well in the role I was convinced Burgess Meredith would own forever. The Catwoman has also been rethought with a strangely ambiguous origin and an unexpected feminist theme. I was originally convinced that Pfeiffer was wrong for this part; I should have learned to shut up after the Michael Keaton controversy.Special mention should go to Bo Welch's production design, which bounces back and forth between skewed circus-from-hell to Speer-like Aryan designs with out-of-control proportions. While very different from Anton Furst's designs of the first film, it complements the story perfectly. Another special mention goes to Danny Elfman's score, still one of his operatic and atmospheric best.From its stunning wordless opening sequence to its actionless melancholy ending, this is the thinking person's superhero film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Batman Returns in another good, but not as good, adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!It's Christmas time in Gotham City, with most of the public talking about a mysterious penguin-man lurking beneath the city streets in the sewers. Meanwhile, industrialist Max Shreck is trying to gain support from the mayor and Bruce Wayne for a new power plant that will secretly be sucking power from Gotham City. On top of all these events, Selina Kyle, Shreck's secretary, finds herself transformed into a new woman after he attacks her at the office.The second instalment in the Batman series continues Tim Burton's vision of an extremely dark and disturbing city, where criminals run rampant and are hunted down by the Batman. I have read some viewers comments that this film is much, much darker than the first film, but I tend to disagree with them. I think they are equally dark, with the only reason this one seems darker is that the hero and the villains all wear black or grey outfits, as opposed to bright purple suits.Michael Keaton returns as Batman in this film, which is can only be seen as a good thing. The difference between this film and the original Batman is that Keaton is now the leading man, with Nicholson out of the way and Danny DeVito, Christopher Walken and Michelle Pfieffer no where near reaching the greatness of the Joker. This does not mean that their performances are bad, nothing could be further from the truth. Pfieffer portrayed Catwoman very well, and Danny DeVito was excellent as the Penguin, although the changes the character went through compared to the old television series and the comics that I have read with him in it were quite substantial. Never the biggest reader of the comics, (so I may be wrong about this), I can remember the Penguin as being just a short man with a long nose that loved birds and walked a bit like a penguin, instead of some circus freak that was abandoned at birth by his parents.Still, I accept the change to his character, and the changes that were made to Catwoman, as it makes for a few surprises, and does give the film a more mature tone (let's admit it, with all respect to Burgess Meredith, another version of the 60's Penguin would have reduced this film to a much lower level). Plus, it creates a life of torment for the Penguin, who was thrown off a bridge when he was a baby and was forced to live with penguins at the Gotham City zoo, thus setting up a character that could definitely be believed to be warped into insanity. Catwoman's creation, that of a lonely, klutz of a secretary, brought back to life by a horde of cats in an alley, giving her 9 lives, is not as believable, and the character does suffer has a result, although it does have its advantages with the confrontation she has with the three main men in the film.The story in this film is good for about the first 3 quarters, with the Penguin running for Mayor of Gotham City, but once this falls through, the film falls through, ultimately ending in a page out of the television show (if they could have done it), with the Penguin's penguins all armed with missiles and preparing to launch against Gotham. The end? of Catwoman was perhaps the highlight of the final act of the film, although I must say that the character should have been brought back as a recurring character in the future films (but in saying that, I also think the future films should have been handled much, much more different).Batman Returns is nowhere near as good as Batman, but it is still good entertainment, if you are prepared to endure the movie falling apart at the end. Danny Elfman returns to provide another great score, and the action sequences are once again well done. Great performances by the 4 main characters and Michael Gough and Pat Hingle as Alfred and Commissioner Gordon make this a film that is worth watching, but I recommend it only to fans of the character or comic book films, or action movies in general, as the ending and some of the dialogue really detract from the experience. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the Penguin has entered the gubernatorial race in California, joining a field of over 100 candidates - when asked why he threw his hat into the ring, he said something about not wanting Mr. Freeze to win... Seriously, it's hard to believe that two recent news stories in America - a political recall and power problems - served as plot points in a Batman movie. But that's exactly what happened 11 years ago in "Batman Returns," the second of the Dark Knight's big-screen adventures.Many people forget that the REAL villain of this movie is not the Penguin or Catwoman, but business tycoon Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). He not only causes the creation of Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), but intends to build a power plant that would drain Gotham City of its energy supply. The film doesn't mention it, but this would probably cause rolling blackouts, similar to the outages that occurred in the Northeast and Canada on August 14, 2003. The Gray Davis-lookalike mayor (Michael Murphy) is staunchly opposed to the project, so Shreck orchestrates a recall, nominating the Penguin (Danny DeVito) as a mayoral candidate and using the Penguin's gang to create urban chaos. As if that weren't enough, Bruce Wayne, Alfred, Selina Kyle, Chip Shreck, Commissioner Gordon, the Organ Grinder, the Fat Clown, and the Ice Princess announce THEY'RE running for mayor of Gotham City. What a mess this recall is. :)Wanna bet this is where Arnie got the idea to be a political candidate? He and DeVito are buddies and Batman villain alumni. I can just see DeVito calling him up, reminding him of the recall in this movie. But I digress. Back to the movie: unfortunately, the screenplay doesn't do enough with Shreck's quest for power (both literal and figurative). Here's a plot hole: why did Shreck think the Penguin, as mayor, would let him build his power plant? After all, the Penguin extorted help from Shreck with knowledge of his corrupt businesses. So Shrek KNEW the Penguin was onto him. Moreover, there was never any connection established between the Penguin and the power plant. Ultimately, it doesn't matter, because this subplot is pushed aside in favor of more screen time for Catwoman, memorably played by Pfeiffer. In spite of the cluttered storyline, "Batman Returns" has good action scenes, clever dialogue, rich performances, and nifty production design. At the very least, it gets credit for depicting political and electrical power as strange bedfellows. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has lost his visionary skills. I am, of course, referring to his abysmal remake of Planet of the Apes. At one time in his life, he was capable of making audiences sympathize with even the most grotesque creations.Batman Returns is probably his darkest, ugliest, and most gothic film. While Batman had a sense of evil (with Nicholson pulling all the stops), Returns is more a sense of despair. There are a few comic moments thrown in, but they offset the balance and cause confusion as to what the movie is trying to be.Fortunately, the script is far superior to the original. Instead of guessing and making things up as they go, the screenwriters actually make a coherent story that doesn't collapse under itself like the first one. This ignores the graphic novel roots of the characters, but does create a less politically-correct view of Gotham and its inhabitants.SOME FOLLOWING SPOILERS Michael Keaton once again underplays his role. The problem is not helped by his absence from the first half-hour. Danny DeVito is interesting under all his makeup (kudos to Stan Winston), but his motivation was all wrong for his actions. Michelle Pfeiffer ekes whatever she can from her paper-thin character and winds up being the most sympathetic character. She is far superior to Kim Basinger in the original and almost ties with Nicholson as the best portrayed villain in the series. Christopher Walken is entirely wasted on an unneeded part. Had his role been eliminated altogether, the movie would have flowed better and some problems with the script could have been fixed in another way. Michael Gough is brilliant as always, but this time he seemed to have more depth rather than say "Mr. Wayne, [insert name here] called again."Danny Elfman's score is haunting, some segments reminding me of Elmer Bernstein's work on Ghostbusters. The conclusion has a somber note only Elfman can pull off mixed with a smidgen of John Williams. No wonder Burton always relies on him. While the editing is, yet again, incomplete, Burton's twist with the camera remains both engaging and stimulating. The film might just have a purpose in its twisted soul.Overall, an interesting, near-parodizing, view of the world of Gotham. I can't say I enjoyed it better than the first one, but it had more human elements to it. Probably the best sleeper movie of the Christmas season. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes kids, it can be fun to play in the dark!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the summer of 1992 for one reason and that reason was Batman Returns. Tim Burton had reached the pinnacle of direction and was just a year a way before he would reach it as a producer with Nightmare Before Christmas. This, more than the original Batman and Edward Scissorhands cemented the director's legacy in Hollywood as the "Gothic Director of Pop Culture". Looking back this is GREAT for lovers of TIM BURTON FILMS but BAD NEWS FOR LOVERS OF THE FIRST TWO BATMANS. You see with a combine effort many critics, so-called Batman fans who actually had not read a comic book in over 20 years, and neurotic parents joined forces to bury this film. There were claims of it being too dark, too morbid, and too vulgar. The last complaint really upset me because the movie's innuendos were no more potent than a 1960's James Bond film. Because of these complaints and the fact that the sequel was not the success that the original Batman had been, even though it still made over 160 million dollars domestically, Warner Brothers decided to go in a lighter direction with the following two sequels. Everything in this film works. It plays up on the theme of the original Batman film, that the so called "normal world" can be a scary freaky place and that in it your hero is more likely going to be some ordinary guy with problems, trying to save the day for his own personal and some times disturbing reasons. Nothing against the other super hero movies but that is what made the Batman movies cool and Tim Burton knew it. The look of this film is more a Burton and designer Bo Welch creation than a traditional comic book setting but the same can be said about Anton Furst's sets designs in the first Batman. Once again the film makers took the spirit of the comic book worlds of roof top battles and brought into a film-noir world that worked on the big screen. Now one complaint I can sympathize with NON-BURTON critics is with the Penguin. It seems that Burton and screenwriter Daniel Waters simply took the character's comic book name and disregarded everything else about him. Instead of the comic book creation, we get a villain that could have come out of any horror flick. I can understand the aggravation that some true to the bone Batman fans might have felt over the Penguin but it also forces me to ask those fans a question. How else would you make a villain such as the Penguin, who is fat and short, an entertaining match for Batman? The way Tim Burton approached the Penguin was the only way it could work outside of turning the villain into a mob boss and the first Batman had pretty much done the whole mob thing. As for Catwoman, if you had a problem with either Tim Burton's spin on the character or Michelle Pfeiffer's performance than you are just not a very good judge of movies. Catwoman was definitely a strength in Batman Returns. I would have loved if Tim Burton would have gotten to make the Catwoman movie. It was the director who first brought it up but Warner Brothers dragged their feet and it looks highly doubtful that Burton will be involved or if even the film will ever be made. I love Batman Returns. It's a great Tim Burton movie. Unfortunately it sparked an end to Burton's reign as Hollywood's golden director. A year later the over-rated Spielberg would recapture the title and Joel Schumacher would be named the director of the third Batman. The movies were never the same after that. Still all is not wrong with the world. The third Batman was decent but the fourth one was horrible, and Tim Burton would go onto make entertaining films such as Sleepy Hollow. But still I wish movies would get back that quirky, imaginative, and sometimes dark edge that has been largely missing in movies in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better of the Batman franchise...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is the better movie of the Batman franchise for one reason only - the casting of Michelle Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer, in my book, is the best actress I've seen and will no doubt continue to be my all time fave for many years. I'll go as crazy as the other reviewer who said she should have gotten an Oscar nom. She does everything right. From her lines to the way she portrays the character. Yeah, so what, Batman isn't your conventional Oscar type movie but hey, the first one was nominated so why didn't anything from this get a nod?If it were nomainated the only category Batman Returns deserved to get a nomination for was for Best Actress. Pfeiffer is sensational as Selina/Catwoman and I've yet to find any other role of hers as enjoyable and flamboyant as this (even though I must say I loved her much more in The Fabulous Baker Boys).The film itself, is okay. I only like it for the director and the female lead. I am just as big a fan of Burton as I am Pfeiffer. His movies, to me, have always been interesting and I love dark. He is one of a kind. But there is something that sells short in this movie and I can't quite pinpoint what it is. Let's excluded the amazing greatness that is Michelle Pfeiffer for a second and get a basic grip on the film itself: Penguin (Danny De Vito) is wanting to find out more about his human life and why his parents dumped him into the river when he was just a tot. He gets involved with business tycoon Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), an evil greedy man who has his heart set on owning everything in Gotham and together they devise a way for Penguin to become Mayor and for Shreck to make his power plant the most successful asset in Gotham. Unluckily for him, his dowdy secretary Selina Kyle (Pfeiffer) susses him out and he quickly disposes of her - pushing her out a VERY high window only to have her be revived by cats and create the personna of Catwoman. Then thrown in Batman (Michael Keaton) to save the day, get involved with both sides of Catwoman and that's that.Maybe the bit that sells short is the character of the Penguin. He is so grotesque and generally horrible. Shreck is just nasty nasty, the typical Walken villian. There isn't one decent villian in this except Catwoman (even though she's REALLY screwed up in the head after her 'death') and she is really on level terms with Jack Nicholson's Joker from the original.Many feel the original Batman to be the best. Maybe so. Maybe it's cos of Nicholson's presence and well, you can't beat originals! But I firmly believe this to be the better Batman film. Batman Forever I felt was mediocre (Jim Carrey was the film's only saving grace just like many of those who disliked Returns say Pfeiffer is this one's saviour), and Batman &amp; Robin was one dire peace of film with the only good part being Clooney making a much sexier Batman than Keaton. However, Keaton PLAYS the better Batman and always will do.All in all I think you should see this film just for Pfeiffer alone! That's what makes it so darned good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michelle Pfeiffer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, so I am smitten, hopelessly so, by Michelle Pfeiffer, many thousands are. She is so tremendously beautiful and mysterious and DEEP as Catwoman I canhardly think of words of praise high enough for her performance here. Thisactress is amazingly multi-faceted and you wouldn't think so. I had Julie London in mind as this character (from the old Batman tv show) and really couldn't see Ms Pfeiffer filling in those voluptuous spiked-heels with any great success, I was completely wrong. Not only does Pfeiffer bring oodles of depth and femaleallure to this role she brings a ship-load of comedic talent almost as brilliant as her unforgettable performance in 'Married to the Mob'. Because of Pfeiffer's mesmerizing early appearances as the nerdy Celina ittakes a bit of adjusting to Michael Keaton's return as the aponymous hero. I was afraid he wasn't going to live up to his success in the original 'Batman' but my fears were allayed quickly. Unlike the moribund dynamic between him and KimBasinger in the first movie he and Pfeiffer, if not erotically exciting, are certainly tuned-in and their comic-romantic scenes, when they aren't fighting one another in the streets, are excellent. Danny DeVito is every bit the equal of Jack Nicholson in the first movie, brilliant. He projects an honestly pathetic note into his character as well as delivering some very funny one-liners with a panache beyond the limited abilities of most "stars" of the silver screen. There is less comedy in the Penguin than with the Joker though and his death is surprisingly moving, even if the attendantpenguins in this scene are obviously children in costumes. But the costumesare superb and they are almost believeable. However, part of Tim Burton'smagic is that he doesn't hide the seams yet he manages to make the most far- fetched creatures seem real. He does this incredibly well in 'Mars Attacks!' The two 'Batman' movies are almost that good in the fantastic effects department. The make-up and costumes are stupendous, as they always are in Burtonmovies.I'm glad he didn't direct the subsequent sequels, which were duds, though they may not have been had he been in charge, who can say really. Tim Burton hasthe silver screen coursing in his veins and I always look forward to his latest.'Batman Returns' sits somewhere in the middle of Burton's output as far asexcellence goes. It isn't one of his great ones, like 'Ed Wood', 'Mars Attacks!', 'Beetlejuice' or 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure' but it, and 'Batman' are just behind those on that list.I give 'Batman Returns' 7+ stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best superhero movie ever made! It's like a PG-13 horror movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman is definitely the best superhero movie ever made. Michael Keaton beats Adam West, George Clooney and Val Kilmer by a mile as the Dark Knight. His performance isn't Oscar worthy or anything, but it was still good.The best performances are obviously given by the three villains though. Danny DeVito plays the Penguin with a sadness but still as evil as every other comic book villain. Christopher Walken's Max Schreck is calmly cool and sinister, but the one who steals the show is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. You really feel sorry for her, and I may sound crazy, but she deserved an Oscar Nomination for it.The action is great and tense, and the fight scenes are well-done (considering the heavy 'batsuit' Keaton had to wear). And, of course, Tim Burton's directoral touch makes this movie like his usual stuff: comedic horror.Great movie, 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's Lackluster Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, the sequel. It Is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules, but most sequels don't live up to the original and nowhere is this more evident than with Batman Returns. I love Tim Burton's films, in fact I'll argue until I am blue in the face that Pee Wee's Big Adventure is art and should not be dismissed due to Paul Reuben's lifestyle off screen. Unfortunately Burton did not direct Reuben's sequel, for it may have been excellent had he done so, but Burton did get the chance to go deeper with Batman Returns, which as I remember was HUGE back in the summer of '92. The problem is that Burton went darker, and for my buck, the first one was on the edge of being too dark. Batman Returns goes too deep into madness without the benefit of Jack Nicholson to take us along for the ride. Overall, I am more disappointed more as a Tim Burton fan, as it seems he felt he could just dim the lights a bit and we wouldn't notice he'd rather be making another film. He loves Batman I know, but he should have come back after doing some other films and reinvented Batman again, maybe the future holds just such a possibilty, I know I'd be up for it. and last but not least,Michelle Pfeifer is Smokin' Hot in this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Sequel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing first. Batman Returns is not as good as Batman, but it is still a fantastic film. The film is more in line with Tim Burton's sensibilities as a film director mainly because unlike the first film which had a lot of studio interference, Burton had a free hand here. Whereas the first Batman film had more of a film noir/urban thriller/horror approach, Batman Returns is more like a dark fairy tale, with Bruce Wayne's mansion more of a castle in this film, snow falling on to the streets of Gotham City and a villain who is definitely a monster. Along with way we have a romantic angle that is played in a more quirky manner than usual, with a humour that is more ironic and touching than the dark and black style in the first film.Of all the sequels to the perfect original, Batman Returns is the best as despite the more fairy tale leanings, it is still a stone throw away from the campness of the horrible Joel Schumacher films and unlike the next two movies, this film is perfectly cast. Keaton once again shows why he was perfect as Bruce Wayne, with a little more humour here than what he showed in the first film, with his chemistry with Michelle Pfeiffer perfect with a touch of bitter sweet about it, especially in the final five minutes in their final confrontation and also with Michael Gough, who plays Alfred. The reference to Vicki Vale being let into the bat cave is an especially nice touch. Speaking of Pfeiffer, she is perfect as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, playing the innocent moments at the start brilliantly, but the psychotic urges in the later parts of the film even better while Danny De Vito was simply born to play the Penguin, being sympathetic yet horrible and disgusting too.While the first film is undoubtedly the best, Batman Returns is more of Tim Burton's statement on the Dark Knight and this universe. His trademarks are in place, while the Penguin is portrayed more as a freak outsider of society than just a villain while the quirky nature of the relationship between Bruce and Selina is also played out in a brilliant sense of twisted humour that only Burton can handle. Plus Danny Elfman's music is perfect with quite possibly the best theme tune in movie history playing throughout.The film is a fairy tale, albeit one without an unhappy ending. Penguin dies horribly, his life in tatters, while Bruce is left to go back to his castle alone, and not live happily ever after with the woman he loves, despite the fact that they are equals. It is a wonderful film and is one worthy of repeat viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first batman film goes down in history as one of the best comic adaptions of all time. Forget the sketchy strictly for children adaptions of today(Spiderman, X-Men), although Daredevil was very good. Batman Returns was a very dark weird film. Michael Keaton proves again that he is the best man to slap on the mask. This movie was very fresh. Good acting, good special effects, very fun movie. There were lots of problems with the films violence and dark tone, many people felt that a film which kids love should not involve these subjects. I thought the films tone was perfect, it made Batman look like a true bad ass and made the villians look like villians, not like guys in costumes doing things "bad" until they get captured. If you want to see a good Bat-flick check out this or the first, maybe even Batman Forever, but if you want to see an overlong episode of ER with special guests Batman and Robin, check out Batman and Robin, probably the worst movie i have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this movie. I really do. The movie stays true to dark, gothic theme which is Batman and they do a really good job of patching up Batman's past from the last movie, including why vicky Vale and Bruce never got together. The only thing I think they could have done better is add more justification to the villains and their motives. I mean how does an insane secretary all of a sudden know how to climb buildings, fight kung-fu style and do all those insane acrobatics?. And how is it, that penguin all of a sudden decides he wants to kill children, and join in a crusade to kill Batman just because they had only one brief encounter. Still, despite the flaws it a great movie. It's too bad the movie ended the way it did though, with Batman's love life gone ( once again) and Selina Kyle (Catwoman) down to only one life. I'm wondering why they don't bring her back, cause they should.</fullReview>

Penguin is a great bad guy,but sometimes he can be a bit too much. For example,when he bites the guy's nose off,or when he attempts to kill the children.

		<shortDescription>Burton and Keaton not only goes out with a bang but with style as well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's Sequel to The original Batman is not only an improvement over its predecessor in so many levels but a dark study into human nature, and its refection on society. All the characters in this film are disturbed, and Burton pulls no punches when he shows their misgivings. Michel Keaton's portrayal of the Dark Knight is a complex character study between Grief and Loneliness, while Michelle Pfeiffer's Portrayal of Catwoman walks the tight rope of female empowerment, and wounded sexual frustration. Danny Devito's Portrayal of The Penguin is a grotesque commination of wounded virtue and brutal animalistic urges that quite clearly puts this film as a whole in perspective in the question of duality. Each of these characters wants to be something that they are not, and in reality, can not hope to be.It's a very mature statement to make in a film like this, especially a super hero film to boot. That's what make Tim Burton's vision of Batman such a celebrated topic among the fans of these types of movies. Because of the levels of maturity that he weaves together in each of his two Batman films, and the experience of watching something more than just a cheap thrill.It's pretty sad that this was the last collaboration between Burton and Keaton on the character of Batman, because it would have been a joy to see the both of them take on more of the legacy of this legendary character and his world. What's even worse is knowing the fact that the next two Batman movies are so bad, that they almost overshadow the good work Burton and Keaton did with the first two movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its been written that the Batman name deserved better, but who's too say? All I know is that this film is a wonderful valentine to flights of fancy capable only in childhood, before society has denuded us, leaving only,by and large, sterile minds incapable of concieving of the majestic, and intolerant of the absurd(to be met with "Superior and correct" condescension, as is proper). Comic fans dismiss this outright, as do most critics (most of them would do well to choke on their venomous bon mots, I think. The world would not morn), not to mention the esteemed (though not by me) Sydney Lumet, but is it truly fair? My opinon-Nay, I have only the most vile, unprintable obscenities as a response to those who trash it on the basis of plot holes. I wish soul-destroying attrocities on the silly, self righteous comic fans who snarl at the thought of their beloved comic idols being translated to the screen with even minor changes. This film is to me beautiful in scope, beautiful in design, beautiful in every catergory. The acting is not "oscar-worthy"(most oscar winners nowadays don't truly receive awards based on merit, but politics. How else to explain Julia Roberts snagging one?);instead it is "just right" for the material. Its a surreal fantasy, juvenile yes, but the best things in life are experienced in youth, not when one is closer to the grave than to the cradle. I see the penguins with torpedos march towards Gotham Plaze,-I think "Wonderful"! The meek secretary who's suddenly a skilled gymnast? "Fantastic"! I like classic films as much as any worthless snob like say, Jeff Shannon of Amazon.com(or as much as they merely profess to like, if want to know what I really think), but my feelings toward these old gems, however strong, are still muted in comparison to what the Burton Batman pictures ingnite in me. They show a world of infinite promise, where every corner, hides a surprise(not unlike an O.Henry tale). One perfectly complimented by Danny Elfman's score.The music is a delicacy to my ears as a ripe cherry cut from a soaked bush after a spring rain would be to my tongue. Its tonal varations are fascinating to follow, from its dizzying heights in the opening credits, to its ominous lows in the Penguin's sewer lair(the excellent use of a choir still makes my spirits soar)this is one piece of film music which is not dependent on the movie. It lives, it breathes as few musical masterpieces do in this business, where everyone and his piece of sh*t brother gets a shot to rewrite your work with his tired hand that would better serve the world severed. Fools have written that Dardevil is the movie Batman should've been. While I cannot deny Daredevil's many good qualities, that movie is like one of the Burton Batmans, yet mercilessly stripped of its unique touches. I prefer seening the Penguin spitting out his monocle (Burton's subtle way of giving the finger to comic purists), to a thousand scenes of Matt Murdock taking vicodin to ease his pain. Realism simply pales before the grandoise, because its so easy to pull off. Make people bleed, make them have conflict, make them speak in halting sentences full of "erms," and "uh's", make them take pain pills. That's not hard. An original idea though, try that one on for size.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and gloomy but brilliantly performed low-camp sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sequel to the 1989 hit, Batman Returns doesn't match up to it's predecessor's standard but is expertly conceived and nicely acted, nonetheless. It's from the darkly imaginative mind of Tim Burton, so don't expect any of the camp or colourful costumes of the original Adam West series to appear here. The film's huge pitfall is that it's not very enjoyable. The backdrop is a dim-lit depressive one, the film doesn't have much of a heart and the overall effect is a rather dull one. The twisted Christmas town-land of Gotham City is hardly uplifting. But still, the film has a lot of good things going for it aswell. `Batman Returns' really captivates in its picture perfect casting. Michael Keaton, reprising his role, is convincing as subtly soft-spoken Bruce Wayne and the dark knight, Batman himself. There's no one else you could envision in the role of the Penguin, other then Danny De Vito and he really captures the role and does a great job of it. Christopher Walken does his usual `mono-psycho schtick' to great reception. But the most impressive is Michelle Pfeiffer as the seductively sassy Catwoman, Selina Kyle. Perhaps her costume is a bit too suggestive, but she's the first love interest to have something important to do with the plot. Her character jumps off the screen with great conviction. Overall, `Batman Returns' isn't quite as good as its predecessor. It lacks the first films action, wit and enjoyability. But `Batman Returns' is very imaginative and the new characters are brilliantly conceived. And it's much better than it's high-camp childish sequels, Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin. A good superhero movie. 6.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The decline begins...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the original Batman, the villain, the Joker was a sufficient force to oppose Batman. In Batman Returns, apparently the producers didn't think that any of villains alone were of sufficient magnitude so they pitted three, the Catwoman, the Penguin, and Max Schreck, to face our hero. Although it should be noted that the Catwoman is not merely a villain but a love interest as well. Like in the case of the Joker, the Penguin's origin was modified from his origin in the comics. It is more grotesque and the character himself as portrayed by Devito is more grotesque and revenge minded than his comics' counterpart who is more concerned with material gain. The materialistic villain in Batman Returns is Max Schreck. Digressing slightly, I just want to say I am a huge fan of both Devito and Christopher Walken. Batman's role is actually slightly diminished since the villains, in addition to fighting him, predicatably turn on each other. Again like it's predecessor, the props, sets, and special effects were state of the art for their time. Thankfully Burton stuck around to helm this one as well. He would be conspicuous by his absence from the director's chair by the time the next installment was released. Solid entertainment, 7/10.</fullReview>

First all i can say is Keaton is the best Batman ever why on earth he wasnt in the other sequels i do not know anyway he came back as the caped crusader with an attitude, fighting not one badguy but two badguys/women (Penguin,Catwomen). I cant think of anyone better to play Penguin than Emmy winner Danny De vito. He is like a hand in a glove if you compare Penguin and Danny. Small,Loud etc. Michelle is got to be the best villan Batman has ever faced. She is smart,sexy and BAD, And she was created by cats, but it would be possible without good old christopher walken for pushing her out of the window. The comments throughout the film are funny and it is all what is expected. Big budget, plenty of action , sexy women and most of all better than the first.

Michelle Pfieffer, Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Christopher Walken - who could lose with this amazing combo. Catwoman and Batman sizzle. Theirs is a classic love/hate relationship. (and yes they do in fact have a relationship - even if it is twisted). Even the music brought a sense of magic to the story line.

		<shortDescription>In some ways, best of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoilers below**One of Tim Burton's better films; in some ways the best of the modern Batman films. (I've always felt the first was one everyone likes because on some level they know they have to; B2 is one you can like even though you know you shouldn't.)When people review this film, there's always the requisite mention of Michelle Pfieffer's sexiness as Catwoman. But I think one reason she worked so well was because she was truly SCARY as well. The Penguin, hard as he tries, is too gross to be scary. With Catwoman, any dime-a-dozen actress could've done the oversexed dominatrix act (see Uma Thurman's crash-and-burn Poison Ivy in the later 4th film). Michelle somehow made Selina (post-mortem) truly eerie. Her wish for revenge against her "murderer" boss Max Shreck, feels completely justified, as opposed to the Penguin's "vengeful" act against the haves of Gotham, with their happy families. That's a nice idea, but too oblique to really identify with. Selina is completely relatable as a working stiff, shoved over the edge, turned bloodthirsty hellcat.A mention must be made here of the creepy subtext that seems to go on between Selina and Max-- both before, during, and after he tries to kill her. The writers were probably trying to give Selina more of an "abused wife" facet. This hint is impossible to ignore in the office scene, when Max catches Selina going through his files, and slowly manuvers her over to the window he's going to drop her out of, quietly scaring the crap out of her the whole while. When he leans in, we wonder if he's going to kiss her or bite her (a direct allusion to the other Max Shreck-- the actor who played the vampire Nosferatu in silent films). It's a skin-crawly scene-- perfect amounts dread and shock as the inevitable comes to pass, yet full of weird chemistry between Michelle and (the awesome) Christopher Walken-- almost more than in any of the later scenes with Catwoman/Selina and Batman/Bruce.Bottom line: one of my favorites from that era. A stranger "Batman" than the first, and definitely better than any since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its all about duality.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that this film was made to be seen on a theater screen. Watching it on video doesn't cut it, as you lose much of the atmosphere of the film: you lose the massive, implacable hostility of the city and the sweeping drama of the underlying themes, and are left with a rather crummy and inexplicably shallow comic-book plot.That having been said--this is an awesome movie! It explores the duality of human nature: each of the four main characters has a face they present to the world, and a dark, hidden side. Batman, rich playboy to the world, haunted crime fighter by night--he recognizes the similarity to himself in the Penguin (publicly a martyred hero, privately a bloodthirsty child murderer) and Selina Kyle (publicly a mousy frump, but with a hidden identity as Catwoman) and even Max Shreck (publicly a successful businessman and philanthropist, secretly a power-mongering, ruthless, amoral egoist.) And just when it seems like everything is simple, the strange pathos of the Penguin's death scene forces us to wonder which was his true nature after all. And Catwoman's departure is equally ambiguous and unsettling.This deeper story takes place amid a surrealistic world of intimidating architecture, killer clowns, and penguins bearing missiles. Below a surface plot which is as 'comic-book' and improbable as can be. With strange elements of humor and violence where you least expect them. And one of Danny Elfman's best scores!If I had to air some gripes with the movie, the main one would be that some of the dialog sounds as if the actors are making it up as they go along. (Maybe this was intended...the most noticeable instance was when Shreck had to make his speech without his notes.) And the violence and gore were really pushed beyond what was necessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragically beautiful (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the most under-rated film of all time (at least Fight Club has a cult following, while everyone besides me thinks this movie is crap). It's also the most misunderstood. Tim Burton created a dark masterpiece that everyone hated when it came out, just because it was so different from the first. Instead of just being entertainment, this movie actually tries be a MOVIE in the classiest sense of the word. It speaks about love, death, family and the human condition. This is the only film in the series that actually needed two villains. Catwoman really isn't a villain, and Penguin doesn't have enough "charisma" too hold the entire movie. Many people say there isn't enough Batman in it, but that is missing the point. It's not about Batman, it's about Gotham City, hell, heaven, and purgatory all mixed in one, and in effect a metaphor for the human condition. When Wayne realizes who Selina is, it is one of the most memorable moments of film. This moment is equaled later with Selina's "can't live with myself" speech. Granted, the film has a few script problems, (the framing Batman thing was a bit clichd) but these are more than forgivable.One of the best films of all time, and the best comic book film of all time by far.

		<shortDescription>Better than the original?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a hard decision to make- which is better, Batman or Batman Returns, as both represent the quality end of action cinema superbly. Batman Returns lacks a truly great villain; Danny DeVito's hammy Penguin is more sympathetic than the Joker but not as charismatic, and the finale stretches the credibility of even a superhero movie. In it's favour, Batman Returns is more exciting than the original, with brilliant performances from Keaton, Pfeiffer and Walken, playing villainous (surely some mistake) businessman Max Shreck. Danny Elfman provides a typically excellent score, and the Christmas stylings work in the film's favour. The things falls apart slightly with the script; dialogue is generally funny (in a good way), but as I mentioned above, the ending was far too silly. Batman Returns is good fun, and possibly superior to the original. It's certainly better than Joel Schumacher's camp garbage take on the caped crusader. 8/10</fullReview>

Tim Burton created a world you can really drown in. Micheal Keaton proved again that he is the best Batman actor of all. His eyes behind the mask say more in a second than this whole "Batman &amp; Robin" crap did in two hours (or did not to be honest). Walken and DeVito give fantastic performances and Michelle Pfeiffer IS Catwoman. I am so grateful Annette Benning didn't get the role (thanks to Warren Beatty for making her pregnant). Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is one of the most erotic I've ever seen in a mainstream movie. Go and see it! It's just great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Batman Returns premiered three or so years after the acadamy award winning original (BATMAN 1989), of course, like all or most sequels, it turned out a little on the wrong side of the yard.Batman Returns is an interesting film, because, a lot of reviews compare it to its predecessor, and, i think that it is because of this, that this film got so much negative feedback.Its a new Gotham City, almost crime ridden, apart from a mysterious Penguin man of the sewer (Danny DeVito) and a new crime boss exec, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Add to the mix a new on the scene good/bad/in the middle figure, Catwoman (Michelle Phiffier) and, of course, the Dark Knight (played again magnificently by Michael Keaton), and you have a seemlessly hit flick to rival it's original, or, even top it. Or so i thought...Once again, its good to look at visually. But once again, i was a little disappointed that Batman was again used as a support character for the two villains. It once again didnt explore that inner fuel of what makes Batman tick, and the story was a visual disaster, not much for the actors to work with.I cant believe that Daniel Waters wrote this script. What was he thinking. Penguin man who hides in the sewers? Drinks and spits vile, eats raw fish? Bites peoples noses? This character was a little to much Tim Burton, ala Edward Scizzorhands, and not like the comic book counter part, who is smug, posperous and a genuine criminal, Danny DeVito's portrayal was that of a monster, a hybrid.Catwoman, apart from Joker in the original, was actually done correctly, the only villain done correctly in my personal opinion.Overall, Batman Returns is a film on its own. Dark, Mysterious. Not Batman! No, Batman wasnt supposed to be like this. I havent seen it as many times as the original, but i still enjoy viewing it for its originality, but like all sequels, it was a little case of "too big a budget, too big a flop". Its a little disapointing, a little sad, and ultimatly, the end of Michael Keaton's reign of being Batman (The best Bat of all?)If you havent already, catch Batman Returns, but remember, its dark, has dark hidden jokes, and isnt the way Batman is supposed to be portrayed. Overall...***OUTOF*****Enjoyable</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Batman Returns" is an excellent sequel to an excellent film. I cannot express enough how happy I am that Tim Burton returned as director and Michael Keaton returned to the title role. Tim Burton is an excellent director! He has the occasional eye-rolling moment, but overall, he is very good at what he does. Michael Keaton is absolutely fantastic as Bruce Wayne/Batman! The Batman suit looks excellent in this film, they really did a fantastic job with the outfit!The rest of the cast is very good as well. Danny DeVito plays a very good Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect as Catwoman (and isn't that bad on the eyes either). Christopher Walken does a very good job as Max Schreck as well. Michael Gough, Michael Murphy, Pat Hingle, and Andrew Bryniarski were very good supporting cast members as well.I don't think I can say that this film was better than the original "Batman", but it was very good in it's own right. The story was pretty good, but there are a few problems here and there that I had with it. Overall, I thought this was a good second installment to the Batman series, but could have been a little better. I would definitely recommend first seeing the original "Batman", and then give "Batman Returns" a look. I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but intriguing sequel to the original (spoilers below)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman Returns" does not really follow as a sequel to "Batman", but stands as a flawed but nevertheless unique superhero movie that inspires in its audience pity and empathy, rather than comical loathing, for the villainous protagonists.The plot is this: a horribly disfigured baby boy is born, amid screams of terror, to two rich snobs in Gotham City. Disgusted with their offspring, they abandon him, throwing the carriage-bound tot into a stream on a cold winter night. The carriage ends up in an abandoned penguin-house where the boy is found, and raised by penguins.Thirty-three years later, the boy has grown into the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and has taken charge of a corrupt circus troupe, intent on taking his revenge on Gotham City. He secures the help of a wealthy industrialist Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who in turn plans to manipulate the Penguin for his own ends.When Max's bullied secretary, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), stumbles onto his scheming, he murders her. But Selina is mysteriously resurrected by cats, and is reborn into Catwoman, and becomes hell-bent on getting even with Shreck.Standing in the way of all three of them is Batman (Micheal Keaton), Gotham's nocturnal protector who by day is a reclusive millionaire, Bruce Wayne. Director Tim Burton was given more free rein with this movie than in "Batman" and in alot of this respects this works. The characterisations and plot are much deeper and stronger in this movie than in "Batman", the plot is less conventional, and the villains are doubly freakish. The only possible flaw in this is an occasional lack of coherency in the story, where occasionally things don't quite follow one another in proper sequence, and when they do, you're not sure when they follow. For instance, does the Penguin plan his final attack on Gotham IMMEDIATELY after his first attack has failed? Selina reappears in Max's office two days after he has tried to kill her. Would this scene not have made more sense if it came the morning after he tried to kill her?Other flaws include some poor editing in the action scenes and there are times when the person under the Bat cowl clearly ISN'T Keaton.However, Burton compensates for these potentially crippling flaws with some broad narrative strokes, filming around striking sets and backdrops. These, along with a rich music score from Danny Elfman, create a wonderfully gloomy atmosphere. The result is more of a dark fairytale than "Batman", and it works very well.Micheal Keaton is back, and continues his consistent performance as the melancholy, conflicted hero of the piece. Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy yet menacing as Catwoman, and her transformation is a highly charged dramatic moment. Once resurrected she stumbles, zombie-like, into her cosy apartment before coming alive in a rage to tear the place apart. There is a strong chemistry between Batman and Catwoman, and their relationship is perfect through it's doomed complexity.An unrecognisable Danny DeVito evinces both loathing and a deep sense of sympathy from the audience as the Penguin, especially in the final moments. His fate is deserved but is tragically unavoidable. The real villain of the piece, Max Shreck, is well played by Christopher Walken, as he ruthlessly cajoles and manipulates the Penguin even as Catwoman eventually gets the better of him. Ironically, it his single deviance from an otherwise selfish nature that results in his downfall.Burton didn't helm the final two Batman movies, but this is widely regarded as his definitive statement on the Caped Crusader. Whilst "Batman Returns" is certainly a flawed picture, it is possessed a wonderfully poetry in its story-telling, as well as an empathy for all it's characters. As such it stands as the best "Batman" movie of the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Keaton's second outing as Batman is an improvement over his first but that's mainly because you don't get to see much of him. The title character is considerably secondary and actually has little crucial screen time when opposed to the appearances and plots of this next group of villains which include Danny DeVito (under heavy makeup) as The Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. These two are appropriately cast and make the best series villains. If given a choice between this series' four films, see this one and completely ignore the other three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For anyone who claims that this film doesn't live up to the original, I strongly advise them to actually go back and watch that film- then be shocked by the desperately slow pace, complete lack of action and unengaging character interaction. While Batman Returns is by no means a perfect film, it must be remembered that this was a major summer blockbuster- and as such, it is surprising just how dark the whole thing is.Keaton is excellent, although slightly underused- De Vito does just about as much as he can to invest the Penguin with some sort of character- Pfeiffer just about convinces- and Christopher Walken is as sinister as ever. The action set-pieces are completely overblown, but fantastically exciting, and the slightly downbeat ending perfectly complements the legend of the Dark Knight.In retrospect, the Batman series as a whole has never been anywhere near to approaching greatness (the least said about the last two films, the better), but at least Burton did make a great Batman movie. If Darren Aronofsky is going to re-invent the series, he'd do well to look at this film before the others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The High Point of the Batman Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the huge success of ?Batman'-it was, untill ?Jurrassic Park', THE definative blockbuster-WB couldn't wait for a sequel, but Tim Burton had other ideas. After ?Edward Scissorhands' (distributed by Fox), Burton returned to Warner Bros. to direct the dark knight's second outing on the big screen. The fact that ?Edward Scissorhands' did well told the studio that people would embrace a `Burton Movie', thus they gave him much more creative control than he had on 'Batman'. The result, I feel, is the best of all the Batman movies. At the time of release, many people felt differently. Parents said it was too dark, and the studio was unhappy that it failed to duplicate the astronomical financial success of its predecessor. The film does feel dark, but that's how Batman should feel-fans and critics now realize that after Joel Shumacher tried to lighten up the series with ?Batman Forever' and ?Batman and Robin'. Another complaint was that the film was too sexual for children. It's an odd claim, as Burton films are notorious for sidestepping sex. Sure, Catwoman has a ?kinky' outfit, but is a child really going to pick up on that? To mirror Catwoman to the female characters of Shumacher's lighter Batman films, she is much more appropriate. For example, the scene in ?Batman Forever' where Chase Miridian is naked in bed is much more visually provocative than Catwoman. Similarly, Poison Ivy in ?Batman and Robin' struts her cleavage quite prominently, while Catwoman is completely covered. ?Batman Returns' is a sequel to ?Batman', but Burton creates an entirely different movie. It's his movie, and Batman has never been stronger. Even now, when polls are taken to determine which actor was the best Batman, Michael Keaton always wins-rightfully so. His portrayal of the Dark Knight is right on, has yet to be equaled, and never will be surpassed. Much more well organized than 'Batman', featuring excellent characters, awesome sets and costumes, 'Batman Returns' represents the high point in the series so far. Hopefully, with the current popularity of superhero movies, Batman will crawl out of the dark and reign supreme once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge "Batman" fan, I can't say I was at all disappointed with "Batman Returns". It was enormously entertaining and, again, brilliantly directed by Tim Burton. The production design is even more deliciously dark, bizzare, original and creative than the first. The movie as a whole isn't however.There isn't any homage at all or tribute to the old comic books/tv show here. It is highly Burton-stylized and definately fun, but some of the original's charm was its somewhat classic colorful comic book feel. In place of this is an unrelentingly dark and cold setting.Danny DeVito is great (despite his rassy nomination and reviews) as The Penguin. He is sure no Jack Nicholson as The Joker, but he skillfully gives an unpredictable performace as a villain so tortured by his past that he feels redemption in inflicting suffering onto Gotham.Poor Batman. He soon finds himself trying to deal with seedy buisnessman Max Shreock (a creepy Christopher Walken), the attractive but dangerous Catwoman and this strange man named Oswald Copplepot (AKA the Penguin) who's affection from Gotham's citizens is about to be used against them. All three are linked together and share the same interest of destruction. They also share the hatred over Batman.Michelle Phiffer is great playing Catwoman. Not only has she never looked better, but she also crafts her role nicely.Keaton gives another great performance as Batman, saying few lines in costume except for things like "Eat floor, high fiber" while fighting.The Batmobile will never look cooler than it does in "Returns". Its many functions range from a rotation pole to the ability to shrink into a skinnier vehicle which is important for zipping through alleys.There is definately no doubt that "Batman Returns" is a lot of fun, but its violence, dark tone and setting and tortured characters give it a very, very cold feel. Is this a flaw? No, but it makes it less enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Batman movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when this movie came out in 1992, I was infatuated with it. I had the videogames based off of it, the McDonald's toys off of it, the action figures from the film, even books and magazines that gave every inch and detail on how every inch and detail of this movie was made. I knew this movie inside and out and loved every frame of this motion picture. Kinda funny that I didn't see it until two years after it was released.I was eight years old at the time and my parents deemed it too dark and gothic for me (I agree, it's too dark for the young kids). But by the time I saw this movie, all two years of anxious, obsessive waiting, it was like seeing the gates of Heaven, and getting a free pass inside. It made me a permanent Batman fan (of course the animated series helped a lot too), a permanent Tim Burton fan, and a permanent fan of any woman who dressed in that Catwoman suit.I don't consider this movie a sequel, because the only connection I can find with the previous Batman live action film, is the references to Vicky Vale, Batman's girl in the first film, and the SWEET Batmobile comes along for the ride. Of course the wonderful Danny Elfman score is still there. Gotham City is vibrant with the twisted vision of Tim Burton, and looks different than the first movie. The Batcave looks different, and Gotham itself looks different. It's like a cross between your dream world and your nightmare.The plot is comic book fun, with the story of The Penguin using the press to elevate his star status, and use the ruse of running for Mayor to plot to take all of Gotham's first born sons with the help of his band of criminal circus rejects. When those plans are foiled, he just releases an army of penguins, from his abandoned zoo hideout, armed with rockets to blow up a huge chunk of Gotham (It's what I'd do if I was a Penguin man). The side story is that of Selena Kyle's transformation into a good girl into The Catwoman an insane tool of vengance and sassy chaos, and Batman who finds a soft spot for her. All of this is flavored with tons of humor that prove the film is having fun with itself, and you should too.DeVito is the only person who I could think of to play a crazy, cranky, horny, disgusting Penguin man. Keaton is an excellent Batman/Bruce Wayne, even though he still doesn't look the part of Bruce to me. A good pack of people have Princess Leia in a bikini in Return of the Jedi as their favorite moment in a movie with a femme fatale. Well not me, Michelle Phieffer in the black leather (or vinyl or latex, whatever it was) Catwoman suit will forever be the role that made me stand up and say "I love women!" She was perfect at acting first like a goodie two-shoes, then an insane woman, who runs around part time as a sex-kitten psychopath, bent on killing the man who killed her. And of course Michael Gough returns as the perfect Alfred.This movie to this day is one of my favorite films, and will always be my favorite Batman movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Batman and/or fun, imaginative movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is easily debatable to determine which of Burton's films reigns as his best. The only other movie which comes close to this caliber of filmmaking it the dark comedy Edward Scissorhands. But Batman Returns is the best movie I have ever seen which utilizes a dark comic atmosphere as the backdrop for a superhero setting. Where it exceeds the greatness of the original Batman is clearly the art direction. The winter season adds to the looming darkness of this film, which is simply fantastic. It also employs four of the perfect actors to carry out these twisted characters. Danny DeVito shines as the vile Penguin, and Chris Walken is beautiful as the manipulative business man. Of course, no one can undermine the fact that Michael Keaton was the best Batman ever, especially in this work. There are also so many perfect shots in this movie, on behalf of our fine director. The most memorable, in my mind, is when the Penguin emerges from the water before his death, the blood dripping from his face. It is just a clear and shocking shot. Along with the most impressive Danny Elfman score ever, this is the perfect Tim Burton feature ever. No matter how many times I watch it, I am in awe of this brutally honest and dark film. God bless Tim Burton!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually sequels are never as good as the original, unless it's a film like the Godfather. I stand corrected with Batman Returns. Who better to fill the shoes of the Penguin than Danny Devito! Michael Keaton returns with the same incredible performance as Batman. This is another brilliant film from the twisted mind of Tim Burton. I have to say that this was one of my favorite movies ever made. I was so impressed with how well this one was made. It stayed true to the original. Gotham City is still dismal and grim. We see many reprisal roles from the original such as Michael Gough and Pat Hingle. Tim Burton is a pure genius. Casting Christopher Walken as Max Shrek is one of the best moves he's ever made. Casting Michelle Phiefer as Catwoman is also a genius move. She is sexy, bold, and funny. She really goes deep into the madness that Selena Kyle is faced with. She brings it to life so well. I can't comment enough on her performance. Burton also teams back up with Danny Elfman to create another incredible score. He uses light strings to bring to life the world of the Catwoman. This movie is by far two thumbs up with me. I recommend it to everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may not be the best 'Batman' film, but it is a very entertaining film nonetheless. The performances are great. Warner Brother's finally gave Burton the control he had sought. He said to hell with the kids, to hell with the critics I want to pay homage to the comic book and make a dark story. Batman is a very dark hero with a lot of chips on his shoulder. Burton did his best to represent this and at the same time throw in an army of circus freaks and one of the sexiest villians ever. Danny Devito gives a very convincing performance as an outcast who has lived a hard knock life and is ready to take revenge on the society that only accepts him now out of pity. Christopher Walken is also very fun to watch even if he cause the screen time to get cut from out hero. In the end this is a very entertaining film one that all who are a fan of the dark knight should see. It's a shame Mr. Burton couldn't have directed the best because he could have really made a dark villain out Two Face and a very entertaining one out of the riddler. As for the fourth one not even Burton could have saved that pile of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the most popular comic boob characters (with the exception of Spawn) Batman has always been the darkest and most mature and that shows in the movies. Tim Burton is a sick and twisted man with a sick and twisted vision and there is no one who could have worked better for directing this movie better. He turns Gotham City into a nightmarish dreamscape where everything is always dark and depressing. Althought no one will top Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face in Batman Forever Dani Divito is sure to give you nightmares for weeks to come as the Penguin and Michelle Pfiffer is sleek and sexy and Catwoman. Althought the movie isn't exactly true to the comic book or the kids Saturday mourning cartoon series it brings in some great new elements like the Penguians gang of violent circus freak and a new bad guy in the form of Christopher Walken, a corrupt business man who wants to take over the city. The one big problem with this movie is that it focuses more on the Penguiens quest for domination and for most of the movie makes Gotham think he is a good guy, he even runs for mayor and they show Batman as a bad guy. Also even though Michael Keaton is not as good a Batman as Val Kilmer he has very few scenes in the film and the ones he is in he doesn't really live up to that tough guy attitude that Batman has. A warning to parents this movie is not the Batman your kids watch in cartoon form, this film is very violent and disturbing and you should take caution before letting young children watch it.</fullReview>

But you must look past the red tape, and realize the sure brilliance of Burton's direction and style.

		<shortDescription>Stylish fantasy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard so many critics claim that Tim Burton's second Batman-movie is actually better than the classic original he directed three years earlier and I'm very soon beginning to believe it must be so. You see, personally I'm not sure what to think. All I know is both of these movies are visually incredible fast-paced adventures with absolutely superb cast. In "Batman" one bad guy was enough, though. Jack Nicholson was so extremely powerful as The Joker there was no need to give him a criminal colleague. Sequel already needed two villains and I can only admit that once again they found a perfect people to fill these legendary parts. Danny DeVito is amazing as The Penguin and I couldn't think of a better actress to wear that lustrous sexy black suit of The Catwoman than the bewitching Michelle Pfeiffer. Don't ask me why but I've always loved "Batman forever", the third part of the series even more than the first two. Maybe it was because of Jim Carrey, who knows? "Batman returns", however, is a stylish fantasy thriller and I guess among Tim Burton's best works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly my favorite of the Batman series and of all Tim Burton's movies. Warner Brothers gave Burton the rights to make a Batman sequel and he said "Ok, screw the kids, this is how *I* think Batman should be!" Danny Elfman's score is phenomenal and powerful throughout many of the scenes (particularly the beginning and Selina Kyle's insanity scene) The two-villain formula works wonders with Devito as the Penguin and Pfieffer as Catwoman and succeeds where Forever and Batman &amp; Robin failed miserably, as it does in all other areas. (why the hell were those two even MADE? ugh) Christopher Walken is wonderful as a totally evil businessman and you can't go wrong with that great circus gang and those rocket penguins. I totally love and adore this movie, it's one of the best ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton was in a dark place when he made this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Keaton returns as the caped-crusader in this second instalment from master-gothic director, Tim Burton. Reviving the partnership he had with musical-maestro, Danny Elfman, in the first film and also in 'Beetlejuice' and 'Edward Scissorhands'.Keaton gives another great turn as the Dark Knight, sadly his last, this time with a new love-interest in the form of Selina Scott/Catwoman. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the feline femme fatale, whose cat-suit provided a whole generation of young men with deep psychological problems.Perhaps knowing that this would be his last Batman-film, Burton spares no expense and also brings us the wonderfully grotesque Danny DeVito as Batman's new arch-nemesis, The Penguin, and the gravel-voiced Christopher Walken as the scheming businessman, Max Schrek.I remember when I first saw this film I was a little disappointed with it. Although I would never have admitted it at the time, I was probably a little young to watch this film at the time. Burton was clearly in a dark place when he made it and I found many of the scenes quite disturbing - especially the scene where DeVito messily eats a raw fish (with rather too much gusto for my liking) and the sight of dark, thick blood pumping out of the nose of the poor luckless moron The Penguin had just bitten was enough to make me get up and leave the room.Nevertheless, this film is very good and most of the cast give strong performances. However, it is much moodier than the first film and I advise parents to adhere to the film's classification when it comes to showing it to children.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me start off by saying that without a doubt anyone who does not like this movie must be a. a ten year old,b. a comic book geek, or c. a person of a similar mindset. Sorry kids, this movie is not 100% silly cornball, comic book hokum, the heroes are all too recognizably human ( as opposed to bland specimens of almost God-like perfection that will fill your head with warm memories of the crudely drawn crap you used to watch a billion saturday mornings ago ), and so are the villains. As much as I enjoyed Spiderman ( I'm a big fan of the comics), I have no problems admitting it was typical, by the numbers Hollywood product that while extremely enjoyable on a puerile level,it doesn't engage on any other(beer guzzling, lets shoot the sh*t over pool fellas just outta college who-you know- just EAT up this crap will inevitably ask "Well, f**k, what else do you want from a movie?" Such people truly are holdovers from the Ice Age, and merit no attention). This movie's strength lies in its sharply drawn characters as opposed to its special effects which is why it will outlive such inoffensive, whiz bang offerings. Take the Supermans: by now, they are quite dated, as is the first Batman movie, and as Spiderman will unquestionably be in a few years, but this movie is as fresh now as it was in '92. Unfortunately, Batman Returns was a happy accident that will never occur again in the history of Superhero films. Warner's ( inadvertently of course) made a smart decision in handing over total creative control to established money maker Burton(a genuine artist with a definite vision; notice the refreshing lack of blatant product placement, or say, stupid flavor of the month pop soundtrack tie ins calculated to make teenyboppers go gaga in perfect, herd-like unison as we all know they do). The result is a wonderful family film that contains S and M images, coarse sexual innuedo, and sizable dollops of bloody onscreen violence that will no doubt scar younger viewers. It's an over the top subversion of the genre, that knows its taking a dump on the notion of Superhero films as school field trip fodder. and is completely unrepentant. Which why its so f******g great. None of it would work of course, if the acting was on the same low level as other comic book films, but thankfully the cast-much to the chagrin of the unwashed masses- chooses infuse their roles with depth. Michelle Phieffer in particular is a stand out as the tormented Selina, and her sexilicious alter ego the Catwoman. Keaton as Bruce Wayne is a revelation. Their scene together at Shrecks party is by far, the best scene in any superhero movie. A 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Burton movie, poor bat film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still genuinely shocked to find people that prefer the next two films in the franchise over this one. While certainly not as appealing as the original, Batman Returns doesn't deserve the stereo-type it's been stuck with. There are two very strong reasons to see this film: the visuals and the music score. Both are gorgeous. Director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elflman are in top form. It's those damn screenwriters who sucked all the potential out of this film. For starters, we've got too many characters competing for precious screen time. Am I the only one that feels a little cheated by the Max Shreck character? Weren't Catwoman and the Penguin supposed to be the villains in this film? Instead, this boring guy steals the 'main villain' credit. There was also a huge backlash over this film being too dark. Let me be the first to support the decision to change the Penguin's origin and demeanor. As Burton himself said, some little guy in a tuxedo just would not have worked. There's also been criticism that as a bad guy, you just felt sorry for the penguin... you didn't fear him. I found this added a whole other layer to the film. Believe me, it was intentional. Batman and the Penguin were of the same ilk. So-called "freaks" from the same background who walked different paths. What made one go one way and the other another? Could it just as easily have been the other way around? Far more interesting than typical maniacal villain b.s. We have Catwoman and Shreck to fit that stereo-type. My biggest complaint about the script is that because of all the new villains, Batman gets even less screen time in this installment than he did in the first film. This is not a Batman film. He is secondary to the bad guys. A trait that has cursed all the bat-films to date. For anyone who's curious, track down the original screenplay Sam Hamm wrote simply titled 'Batman II'. Take a peek at what could have been. Bottom line: the film looks great, it's the story that drags it down. From what I've come to understand: fans of Burton like the movie, fans of Batman despise it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Acting is solid like with the first movie. However, there are a few problems with what goes on. Catwoman isn't a full villain, since she despises Shreck and eventually Oswald. Penguin needs too much direction from Shreck. Another problem is that there's so little focus on Bruce Wayne, and you can't have Batman without him. Alfred's role is much smaller as well. Gotham citizens are shown to be too stupid (like in the first where they're all just standing around being gassed). No way anyone would lay down a vote for a thing as hideous as Penguin. Doesn't come close to the first overall, but still good on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy Godfather II, Batman- a sequel that's better than the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I adored this movie. Not only my favourite in the series, but also one of my all time favourite movies.. EVER!! I exaggerate, I hear you say? Mais non. The sets are spectacular, the performances are unforgettable, and the script is darker than the actors' dress code.The acting: First off, I was a little worried when I heard that Burton was casting Danny deVito as the Penguin, but I was wrong. DeVito, along with Burton's slight alterations to the Penguin's original physique (flippers, frequent BLACK nose bleeds), make the Penguin one of the scariest screen villains in a long time. There is, nevertheless, respectful reference made to Burgess Meredith's character in this Penguin's choice of attire during his mayoral campaign- monocle, cigarette-holder, top hat etc. As for the rest of the cast: Michelle Pfeiffer- WOW!; Keaton, on top form as always as both the moody millionaire and whispering-monotone superhero; and Walken, once again proving that he is king of the screen sociopaths.The script: With classic lines like "I believe the word you're looking for is.AAAAAAARRGGHH!!!!", "They wouldn't put me on a pedestal, so I'm layin' 'em on a slab!" and "Life's a bitch, now so am I," need I say more?The music: That one and only, born-to-score-Batman, Burton-mindreading legend, Danny Elfman. Sorry Elliot, but you're just no good at this kinda thing. Oh, and before I forget, Michelle Pfeiffer is WOW!I will admit that this is definitely not one for the kiddies (unlike Schumacher's crowd pleasing pap), but who the hell said that it was supposed to be?! Batman endured his time as a camp family-hero back in the 60's; now it's time for Burton to show us how he was meant to be (and this time, thankfully without the Prince songs), and, with his new feline adversary, endearing himself to S &amp; M fans along the way no doubt.Will Burton, Keaton and Elfman, like Batman, also Return? Let's hope so.P.S. Michelle Pfeiffer: WOW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not as good as the first film, Batman Return(1992) is way better than the last two when the series became dumb and dumber. Deals with childhood traumas, and adult angst that results from feelings of alienination during childhood years. Not one of the main characters were blessed with happy memories of their childhood, and each has their own alter-ego to fight this traumatic pain. The opening scene is an example of this idea, and one which leads to the main theme of the movie.Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman becomes more melencoly, more saddened by unhappy childhood memories, and saddled with a feeling of loneliness. Danny Devito is a disappointing followup as a villain after the flamboyant performance of Jack Nicholson in Batman(1989). Michelle Pfeiffer is both sexy and hard edged in the role of Catwoman, which is her most complex and ambiouous. When Tim Burton did the Batman films they were very good, and had some provocative ideas about childhood memories, and the feelings of being an outsider.I would have to see a director's cut of this sequel as I feel that some scenes look as if they were trimmed, and maybe there were good scenes cut from the film to fit a PG-13 rating. Scenes, which feels trimmed are the erotic games of cat and mouse between Batman and Catwoman. Films based on comics are more interesting when good and evil become a grey matter where nothing is certain, and the architecture stands with a moody broodish quality. Christopher Walken plays his usual sarcastic evil villain, and plays it with a dark coldness that is a trademark of a Walken villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst I don't think any subsequent Batman film can ever hope to be better than the thrilling 1989 movie this is a decent enough sequel-and just as dark as the original.Michael Keaton returned as Batman and thrilled us all again (it was so sad that he didn't return to the role afterwards)as he battled the creepy looking Penguin and the beautiful Catwoman.The Penguin was okay in this film but he was a little bit freaky and to my knowledge, the comic book Penguin wasn't a freak (well,not a freak like this guy was). Michelle Pfeiffer made an excellent Catwoman. In my opinion she was exactly like the comic book Catwoman. Ever since this films debut in 1992 rumors persist that Michelle Pfeiffer will be appearing in a Catwoman movie. I hope that happens soon.Before this film came out I was quite disappointed when I heard Robin would not be appearing. However, looking back it was much better that Robin wasn't in either Batman or Batman Returns as it gave Keaton a chance to shine as the Caped Crusader. The original comic book Batman made his debut in 1939 and it was a long while before Robin came on the scene to brighten things up.This is a fantastic movie with some truly awesome action scenes.Batman fans will really enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bat is Back to Battle More Threats on Gotham City!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] The year is 1959, Mr. and Mrs. Cobblepot just gave birth to their first son. He was a perfectly healthy child, except for oneflaw: he was hideous! The Cobblepots found their child to be quite fierce, especially when he ate the cat, so they dumped him into the river where he was found by a bunch of penguins. 33 years later, Gotham City has just been saved from the terror of the Joker by Batman. Yet, the city has reported sightings of a penguin creature. This isn't the only threat to Gotham, for there's an evil businessman, Max Shreck, owner of Shreck Industries. Note: Shreck is Yiddish for monster. Max has a secretary, Selina Kyle, whom he loves to torment and she patiently puts up with it. Later, a group of circus crooks attack the city. Batman comes to the rescue. Max escapes and falls into the Penguin's lair, where Penguin makes him a proposition: he wants to go on the surface to find his parents. When Max declines, Penguin convinces him by showing Max his illegal deeds. That night, Selina is pushed out the window by Max and is revived by some cats. She returns home and in a devistating, but wel=acted scene, she destroys everything in her house and makes a cat suit from her vinyl suit. She calls herself Catwoman; Max wants to make the Penguin, who's real name is Oswald Cobblepot, mayor of Gotham City. The Penguin has evil plans for the city; Batman now has two villains to fight, and it won't be easy with Catwoman, because she's a woman, or as she put it: "life's a bitch, and so am I." Catwoman and Penguin join forces to get rid of Batman, so they would be free to work their evil schemes. The Penguin rigs the Batmobile so he can control it and that escapade really wrecks the mighty vehicle.Bruce Wayne invites Selina over for dinner. (We know their trueidentities); The Penguin's candidacy takes a fall when Batman records him saying bad things about the citizens then playing it at his mayoral speech. So the Penguin returns to his lair and devises a plan to kidnap all the first born sons of Gotham. Batman foils that scheme too.The Penguin also kidnaps Max Shreck and has a run-in with Batman. Catwoman shows up also and tries to get even with Max. She electrocutes them both but only Max's body is found. The Penguin shows up and immediately drops dead. So this will be a merry Christmas for Gotham, until evil shows up again. Pretty good. As good as the first. Danny DeVito's Penguin is very different from Burgess Meredith's on the 1966 TV show, DeVito's is a monster. Michelle Pfeiffer is a good Catwoman, practically the same as Julie Newmar, Lee Meriwhether and Eartha Kitt's. Michael Keaton is a good Batman, but George Clooney in Batman&amp; Robin, is NOT a good Batman. So see this movie, it's pretty good!--</fullReview>

But the sheer talent and acting far outshadow any minor technical specs. Keaton is a talented actor, and an amazing Batman. Pfeiffer is a wonderful talent, great with the tormented soul character.

		<fullReview>While lacking the fabulous villain in the form of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, which made the first film so great, Batman Returns does delve into the more dark and disturbing side of life in Gotham which, although I feel this is a lesser film, has some of the finest moments in the Batman film series.With three main villains competing for screen time with Batman himself, ultimately, none of them are sufficiently developed. One of the most common criticisms of this film is that none of the villains match the Joker. One feels though, if it were just Catwoman or the Penguin in this film then they could have been just as much of a match for the Joker. The Joker is so memorable because Jack Nicholson has so much screen time to play around with the character without force-feeding the audience plot-developing lines of dialogue as many characters in this film are.However Catwoman is simply delightful and alluring, and for me, Max Shrek (Christopher Walken at his most psychotic best) is wonderful. Early scenes between Shrek and Selina Kyle, are the best in the film with Walken being both incredibly menacing and hilariously funny at the same time.</fullReview>

But whether this film holds up to the same expectations than the original is in my view debatable.Gotham City faces two monstrous criminal menaces; the bizarre, sinister Penguin and the slinky, mysterious Catwoman. Can Batman battle two formidable foes at once? Especially when one wants to be mayor and the other is romantically attracted to Gotham's hero? Batman Returns is the follow-up to the first blockbuster, which is a dazzling adventure that will leave you breathless!Once again, we see Michael Keaton get out his costume as Batman/Bruce Wayne. The second Batman allows Batman to have more of the limelight, as the baddies aren't as dominant. Again Keaton is cold, callous and ?moody' as Batman. He suits the role and in my opinion is the best Batman for the movies. I was disappointed when he could not reprise the role for the later films. The fighting scenes that Keaton did do in this film weren't bad.Unfortunately, the baddies in this film probably aren't as good as the first film. Could anyone do any better than Nicholson? I think not. Danny Devito took on the hard role as the Penguin. It must have been difficult to walk, talk and act like that gruesome sort of character. In that way, I feel like applauding Devito. Yet his character wasn't that scary. The audience more pity him for the way his family discard him, more than feel threatened by him. But the role of Catwoman, played by the talented Michelle Pfeiffer, was remarkable. It was just like the comic book version had just leapt to the big screen. I loved it. Her sarcasm, her wit and her charm made Catwoman, someone you could love or hate in an instant. The storyline was interesting when it involved Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne. The chemistry they bought to the screen was fascinating. Then as there alter ego, the relationship got even steamier. My favourite scene with Catwoman would have to be when she walks into a department store, defeats the security guards, then blows it up by placing gas cans into a microwave. To finish the scene she flips out and says `Meow'. Tim Burton returns as the director for Batman 2. I thought he got the Batman character correct the first time around, but this time he wasn't as accurate. The darkness in the film is probably a little over the top and makes the Dark Knight just a little bit too dark, yet the set is a pretty reasonable one. One of Burton's latest films Sleepy Hollow, starring Johnny Depp would be just as dark as this. So if you didn't like this movie I would recommend you stay away from Sleepy Hollow as well. I say that it would be an interesting film. Undoubtedly, the best scene in this film would have to be when the Penguin's army of penguins are unleashed to Gotham Square to blow up the city. But of course Batman interferes and turns the Penguins around. The trainers involved in this scene must be commended on the precision they got every penguin to walk like they were supposed to. This must have taken many months of training to get just right. I enjoyed the second Batman movie. The storyline was ok and it did have some enjoyable scenes and I applaud the role of Catwoman. But this film never had the same impact on me like the first and I guess it was never going to. But, Pat Collins from WWOR-TV said:-`Batman Returns was Sensational! A funhouse of comic and crazy surprises.'In my view many sequels are only made for the hell of it. The Batman genre (and other superheroes) can be included in that. What do you think?Rating: 3 Stars or 7/10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>4 stars. The best of the big screen Batmans has superb art direction and 3, (not just one)villians - if you count the Christopher Walken character. Outstanding performance by Michelle Pfieffer as Cat Woman should have earned her an Oscar nomination and never did. Whether purring like a sex kitten or cracking that whip, she's a hell on wheels tornado. Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar have nothing on her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Due to the christmas season I got the chance to see this movie again - it was brilliant - 2 hours of enjoyment and it proves that there was only 1 good Batman and that was Michael Keaton - the other 2 especially Mr Clooney absolutely ruined the character. Christopher Walken you are a god - you just had to love his character as for Michelle Pfeiffer wot can you say she is gorgeous and the chemistry between herself and Keaton made you believe in the characters and wished they were together in the end...Tim Burton was a master of directing this sequel, the gloomy dark side of each character bounced off one another and it was a pity that he did not make any more Batman movies..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I'm writing this but Batman Returns (in my opinion) has to be one the best movies I have seen. Almost ten years later, and I still like to see it frequently. Catwoman is my favorite character, Michelle Pfeiffer did an excellent job. All in all it was funny, had great and smart dialogue, the fight sequences were great. The music is awesome! Alot of people think it's too dark, however, being dark is what gives the movie character. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a film I have loved since I was very young. I first saw it when I was 7 years old and then I didn't know what to think of it. Now 9 years on, I have acquired it and watched it over 10 ten times. The movie blows me away - and it's one aspect only - Catwoman. The movie itself was ok and I wouldn't say the storyline was that great. I like this one the best out of the four films, because it is darker and a much better cast. Christopher Walken is fantastic, Michael Keaton is the best Batman out of them all, Danny DeVito is such a gifted actor and Michelle Pfeiffer is one of the most beautiful and intelligent actresses in movie history. The best aspect of the movie is Catwoman/Selina Kyle played by the very talented Michelle Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer brings wit, intelligence and that bad girl 'thang' in her portrayal of Catwoman. She easily has the best lines and she delivers them perfectly. 8 out 10 OR *** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All Prepare to be shocked! To be insulted and astounded. I actually liked this one. That is right, I liked this one more then all the rest! So, what ya ganna do? Hah? Shoot me? And, to tell the trough, it seemed to me the first Batman movie just didn't work. It had too much of an oldie feel, and also, seems like the Batman movies are a lot better when there are two nasty blokes involved. I loved both the darkness and the shoreline in this one. Catwoman captivates and enthralls as a voluptuous bad girl and the Penguin is a sorry creature that one feels for. I greatly like when the supposed villain is not black and white bad but gray just like everyone in real life. I also think that the male/female combo on the dark side does wanders to make films better. I think the combination of bad girl and bad boy in each movie is a splendid one and works wanders. So, is this movie the best? I am inclined to say it is. I loved the beginning with Penguin and thought both his story and the Catwoman's could stand alone in quality. Also, I have a great liking for the funny little people that hung round Penguin. The fist one was new so it was loved immensely, but it was not that good. I do not believe that any movie after the first could have possibly measured up to it in most people's eyes. I, however, think it does true justice to Batman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no doubt about it--the first Batman is more mainstream, more normal, and more loved. I, however, enjoy this one much more. [I won't even discuss the 3rd &amp; 4th, since I refuse to acknowledge them as Batman films]This movie has more (and better) action sequences, a cooler (darker) Gotham City, and more of Burton's awesome film noire feel. What I love most about this film is Michelle Pfieffer! First off, her performance is AMAZING! She is essentially playing 3 roles here -- pre-transformation Selena, post-transformation Selena, and Catwoman. She's not the stereotypical bad girl (ie Lara Croft), not exactly the girl next door, but somewhere in between--the nice girl acting bad, letting go of inhibitions. She pulls it off flawlessly! The Batman/Catwoman/Bruce/Selena love quadrangle is SO well written, so interesting, &amp; so well played out![Oh yeah, Michael Keaton is perfect too.]Then you have the Penguin. I have to admit he gets on my nerves. In the span of 2 hours, he lives in the sewers, eats dead fish, runs for mayor, kidnaps babies, and tries to destroy the city with...penguins. His plans are lame and unbelievable; plus he is downright ugly &amp; annoying to listen to. He's too Tim Burton-ish (if that makes any sense).Here's what I suggest. Buy the DVD &amp; skip all the Penguin scenes -- you've got the perfect movie :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent sequel but didn't seem like it tried to be better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am huge fan of the Batman series (yes, I even liked Batman and Robin) and I didn't mind this movie. But when it comes to the least enjoyable installment this has to be it. The reason I say that because it was way, way too dark which Tim Burton might've been a little too excited about in the movie. Another reason is that it didn't seem like it tried to be better then the original, which in my opinion is a comic book classic. It needed a little more action and a better story. The performances in the movie were superb no doubt. Danny Devito was unbelieveable as the Penguin. But the one character that I hated to see in every scene that he was in was Christopher Walken's character. I don't think he needed to be in the plot because he seemed useless to me. Tim Burton as usual did wonderful directing when it came to the acting and the action scenes but again it was little too dark for me for a Batman film. It just seemed a gothic story written by Edgar Allen Poe or something. Not a comic book adaption. But I did like it and I haven't hated a Burton film yet. Of course I haven't seen Planet of the Apes yet. I just think it could've been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep Satire, haunting personal ethos, desperate souls...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dark Knight returns, or arrives for the first time rather?... Michael Keaton, of whom the silent majority believe to be the most convincing and well acted Batman/Bruce Wayne, delivers a stoic performance that seems to become more gratifying a second or third stroll through Gotham City. Although he battles 2 arch enemies in this film, there is really a third, Max Schreck. Played to steely perfection by Christopher Walken, as quoted referring to Selena Kyle, "Bottom line. If she tries to blackmail me, I'll drop her out of a higher window." The Catwoman represents female repression and complete anger towards weak female characterization in film or real life. Both the Catwoman and Batman seem anchored to fear in a struggle to reconcile there desire to allow both sides of their personalities to exist in harmony. And thus a connection is made on both fronts...However, where Bruce Wayne is held at bay by Alfred the loyal butler and friend, Ms. Kyle has no one and her sanity slowly drifts out to sea. The Penguin, discarded at birth for being born "a little different," is used in effect to create sympathy within Bruce Wayne, whom has lived through parental tragedy as well. Both Penguin and Catwoman have very similar dark emotions as Batman. Which in the end is fabulous, because Batman makes no direct attempt to kill either character. He knows himself, and thusly knows that their own misgivings will create their own deaths...Although Catwoman has a few to spare I'm sure...Some people didn't like Batman Returns because it spawned sequels that needed more than one enemy...It must be said that in Batman Returns, Bruce Wayne's greatest fear was learning to deal with himself, making the ultimate sacrifice for his own humanity. I do believe that is why Keaton hung up the Cape. 10/10 STARS...A triumph in character development, satire of human relationships, and of freeing desperate souls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Burton-esque sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch the first two movies of the Batman series back to back, you will notice that they are two very different movies. And while the original is better than the sequel, Batman Returns is still a great movie.It is darkly poetic and emotional, very evocative. The Danny Elfman score is more haunted, and sounds closer to Edward Scissorhands than the original. Batman Returns seems to me to be a collection of images and scenes that stick with you. The best example would be the scene before the credits, in which the Penguin's parents take him through a park, and then the opening credits, in which the baby basket goes through a series of tunnels. Everything is bluish or white, and it always seems to be cold. The performances are not really exceptional, though Chritopher Walken is great as a greedy businessman who allies himself with the Penguin. The thing to remember about the movie though is what you look at. This is the best of the Burton-esque films(eg Eddie Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow , and Ed Wood). Watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting on with the concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the smash hit of the first one, the sequel was inevitable. And maybe it was a necessity of director Tim Burton, but this one takes much of the juice the characters of the first movie had and bets more on the pure sensation and feeling of awe. The point is: this movie has much more action and special effects, thus taking some of the wonder of the first movie, which I don't see as an action film. Even so, this movie is beautiful: the sets are astonishing (as we were used to), Penguin's character is one of the meanest villains in the history of comic-book adaptations, Catwoman is one of the sexier (miles away from Poison Ivy's foolishness, and some moments are genius (the penguins taking The Penguin to his underwater grave, "Meeow" and the bomb explodes in the first showdown between the three protagonists, etc). The score is also a must, a much more spectacular version of the music from the first movie, and a much more produced one. A cool action picture altogether, much more spectacular, but not so deep and a little more violent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a sequel, but a new movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not only the best of the Batman series, but it is possibly the best film that Tim Burton has ever made. But when analyzing this movie, many people try to compare it to the original, saying it doesn't leave off at the same place, etc. That is not Burton's intent. He has not made a sequel, but a new segment of Bruce Wayne's life; a completely different movie.The Academy Award winning Batman was certainly great movie, with excellent performances by Michael Keaton as the title role and Jack Nicholson as the Joker. But it lacks something that this movie picks up. It's prequel showed us that the world has many evils expressed in the villains who enter and destroy are lives, and how these evils are always triumphed over. However, Batman Returns explores this theme on a different level. It shows us that these evils not only exist in our peers, but they can also exist in our own hearts and minds.All four principle actors, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Christopher Walken, and Michele Pheifer, develop this theme beautifully throughout the movie. Walken especially, accomplishes bringing to this film the tyranny of villains to this film, developing the theme from Batman offering a contrast to the new aspect. This movie offers so much more that the trash of the later series, and the masterpiece of the original. It helps the audience to reach into their souls to really consider their own mindset in this grim world.10 stars out of 10!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artistic masterpiece although misguided (some minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to appreciate this film you must see it 2 or 3 times . I am not kiding . The first time it is going to irritate you and you mayregard it as a travesty . It is very dark and annoyingly grotesque from the middle and further . The beginning is excellent . I can 't say much but it starts like a marvellous German fairy tale set in Christmas . The gothism and the expressionism are dominant through the entire film since the main plot is also in Christmas . Of course the atmosphere is dark like hell and kind of reminds the Gremlins . There are many colourful lights in the entire Gotham city which only emphasise on the nightmarish facts which take place , and on the moody/sad feelings of the heroes . The 4 basic actors are simply great and have a terrific chemistry . Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman gives the darkest performance of the entire series. He is the definition of loneliness . He is way better from the prequel though where he seemed a bit out of place . Danny De Vito is good as the grotesque Penguin , a twisted mutant with naturalistic insticts . The same go for the feline Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) who is the impersonation of self-destructive sadomazochism . Pfeiffer gives her best performance not necessarily when in the black suit , but in portraying the disturbed secretary Selina Kyle behind her . But the kudos have to go to Christopher Walken because he plays his role with the most amazing way . An evil tycoon who wants to manipulate Gotham and drain the energy for his plant . The sad part is that Max Shreque is the only of these 3 villains who moves rationally with specific motives and reasons . Penguin and Catwoman act inconsistenly and are preposterous .E.g.why Catwoman wants to kill Batman since in the beginning he was the one who saved her life ? She wanted to prove that women can kick a** just like them ? Or her pride simply could not standbeing rescued so she turned against him ? Unfortunately there are many other plot holes like that which make grand cons The music score by Danny Elfman steals the show giving perfectly all the dramatic tension in the souls of the heroes , the nightmarish gothic feeling and a slight reference of Christmas fairy tale for kids !! The same go for the magnificent sets and costumes . Every shot is unique. It looks like a painting picture , progressed meticulously to the last detail . The surrealistic delusional feeling which give you is splendid. The clowns of the Red Triangle Circus gang are pieces of pure art . As for the Penguin 's lair with the vast scenery , what can I say ? NOONE has manged to top this impressive set ever since . So what went wrong ? The answer is the script . There is sick violence in some points and rediculous childness in others . The writers and Burton seemed a bit disorientated and sometimes we have a pure dark mess . This is obvious in the scene where the 2 villains plot to destroy Batman by "turning him into what he hates most : namely us" or the the one -liners during the fights between Batman and Catwoman . These dialogues are so contrived and silly which make the film worst trash from some saturday morning cartoons !! OH MY GOD WHAT WERE THEY THINKING ???? Not to mention some of the choreographied violence in fight scenes which seem to have popped out of Power Rangers !!!! And exactly why did the Penguin want to kill all the first born boys ? Because of the mommy complex ??? These are questions which will go away ONLY if you have watched it more than once . Anyway Batman Returns is Tim Burton 's best directing job to date . It has symbolisms , psychedelic dreamlike imagery and 4 excellently packed up plots corresponding to the 4 stars . You are NEVER bored since each one of them could carry a movie by his/her own . Be prepared though for a little too much dark . In the worst case you can enjoy it as a very bad written cartoon with much irony and black humour. Nevertheless it is an artistic masterpiece with some classic and very powerful scenes like the the transformation of Selina in Catwoman or the intense finale (30 plus minutes long). Not the best inthe series but the the more surrealistic . Just don 't take it too seriously .BATMAN RETURNS 8.5 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Rosemarys Baby sequel lives up to the standard of the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing more than a B movie with an A budget, watching it now you can see a cartoony not comic style to it and an un-credible saturday morning serial feel. The story starts out with a Rosemary's Baby rip off and procedes to avoid other rip offs by taking unjustifiable turns.In one shot Batman is saying "his parents....I hope he finds them" and one following minutes later he suddenly comes up with "I think he knows who his parents are....there is something else" this is an obvious pretence at moving the story along. People have always tried to get darker with sequels, in this one, Tims way of doing so is to turn Batman into a mercenary, The Joker into a violent savage freak, and Vicki Vale into a sadistic lady of the evening.This movie just comes off as underwhelming, the best that can be said is that the performances are mostly excellent, Walken acts like he doesn't want to be there and I have seen him do more than credible work in the past. After looking at all of Burton's work you can see exactly how sick the guy really is, his best work was The Nightmare Before Christmas, but even in that you can see a bit of a derranged psychology.This movie lives up to the standard of it's original. Batman Forever captures the true heart of The Dark Knight, not the original, but the true. You could never see this movie and not lose sleep over it. See this movie if you are after a lighter toned "The Crow". 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the controversies, this is the best live-action Batman movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns was attacked by sponsors and parents for being "too dark". Indeed, it is the most grotesque and "adult" of the live action Batman movies. But, with the single exception of the short-lived Batman tv series, Batman has always been at his most popular when he has been portrayed as a dark avenger of the night. During his first year, as the cover hero on National Periodical's Detective Comics (from which DC Comics eventually took its name), he carried a gun and showed little compassion for villains, some of whom he would throw off of roofs. His background, with his parents being murdered in front of his eyes while a child; his single-minded obsession with avenging their death through a war on crime; and his environment (have you seen the whackos that populate Gotham's underworld?) lend themselves to film noir detective stories, and that's exactly what Batman Returns is.Another complaint is the "mucking" with the Batman legend by changing the origins of both Catwoman and The Penguin. But, as I said in my review of the first Tim Burton Batman movie, even the comic books change various portions of the Batman legend every five to ten years. No one who is a true Batman fan can ever take seriously complaints that a given interpretation "changes" the Batman legend, because it has been changed so many times that there is no "official" version. Batman is a heroic archetype which has been interpreted in incredibly different ways by the various creators who have worked with him.If your favorite Batman is the television show of the 1960's or the comics of the 1950's, then you almost certainly won't like this movie. But, if you prefer the original Bob Kane Batman from 1939, Denny O'Neil's Batman of the early 1970's, or Frank Miller's Batman writings in the 1980's, then you will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Batman movie of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my mind this movie is the best in the series. The sets are awesome, the tone is just right and Keaton is at his best as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He is backed up by two great villians Penguin and Catwoman, played respectively by Danny Devito and Michelle Pfieffer. In this sequel to the 1989 box office smash, Batman finds himself battling the Penguin, a man deformed from birth, who like Batman, never knew his parents and Max shreck, the devious businessman who plans to help the Penguin become the mayor of Gotham City and at the same time fulfil his own questionable plans. Adding to this is Catwoman, who finds herself battling Batman and battling the mutual attraction between them. This movie is a rollercoaster ride of action, crazy characters and powerful emotion and is great successor to the original film. The thing I find most intriguing about this film is the character of the Penguin. In my mind this character is not inherently "evil", just tragic. It's the tragedy throughout his life that has made him "evil" and forces him to do what he has to do in the end. His similarity to batman/Bruce wayne is somewhat noticeable. At the beginning of the film , when the Penguin first appears on tv and Bruce wayne sees it, we can see in his eyes that Bruce Wayne seems to know what Penguin is going through, because he too lost his parents to tragedy and is struggling to find out who he is. It it this level of characterisation that makes this movie so good. Add to that some pretty good action sequences and you've yourself a winner. All in all a great film and a pleasure to watch. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman, for all his shrouded mystery, is just a cop whose role is to protect the entrenched power structure--which not incidentally includes protecting Bruce Wayne's fortune from so-called "criminals" who might want to redistribute the wealth. When Catwoman Michelle Pfeiffer finds a woman being raped in a dark alley, she dispenses with the rapist, then looks contemptuously at the woman and says: "What were you waiting for? Batman to come along and rescue you?" Women need not appeal to cops and other men in power to rescue them from domestic violence and rape; they should seize power for themselves. And contrary to the Batman Returns message, power doesn't mean dressing up in a cat costume. It means joining a revolutionary party to overthrow the imperialist patriarchy.</fullReview>

'Batman Returns', managed to do something that the original 1989 'Batman' film couldn't. Hold my attention to watch the whole of it (until about 10 years after I'd seen it)I much prefer this story, in which Batman is introduced to 2 new villians - Oswald Cobblepot, aka The Penguin (played by Twins star Danny Devito) and Selina Kyle, a slightly out-of-it secretary, who is pushed through a window of a building, to her death, only to be reincarnated, by cats, as the awesome Catwoman (played brilliantly by Dangerous Minds' Michelle Pfieffer).Again, Bruce Wayne/Batman is played by Michael Keaton, and is teamed up with the original director, Tim Burton (responsible for 'Beetlejuice'). Rounding out the core cast, we have Christopher Walken (Max Shreck), in his typical scary role, he's famous for.I always thought that this Bat film was the best because of Catwoman. Michelle portrays her feline character purrrfectly as she back-flips her way through an hour-and-a-half rollercoaster ride of thrills.In conclusion, I think everyone should rent out/own this Batman film (if not, all of them) - it's fast and funky, but with elements of weepy-drama mixed in. Near perfect! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, intertextual, and over looked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sincere parody is never a recepiant of praise in this country. Batman Returns, released on an election year, is a case in point. Not only does it mock corporate control over American politicians, but it also, in itself, is a parody of our culture. To say that the film satirical is an undergesture. Christopher Walken's Max Shreck, the polluting industrialist, and his manipulation of the Penguin is a clear demonstration of this. The intertextual refereces to the silent era are endless. From the visuals that inspire remembrances of German impressionism (the set production, and even the Penguin swirling his hypnotic umbrella, is ala Dr. Caligari) to Max Shrech (the name lifted from actor Max Shreck who played the vampire in Nosferatu--even Max's activities, sucking the power out of Gotham, is reminiscent of a vampire sucking the blood ((life force)) out of humans.) Batman, of course, is the gargoyle over all this, and his cape is full, not only with these terrors, but also with Catwoman, his doppleganger. Here we see a circle of sameness that is not explored with any of the characters in the film series-at least not to this degree. The performances are top notch, the production design is gorgeous, and it is wrought with meaning on ever conceivable level. This is the type of film that Gilles Deleuze would have a field day with. So many images of affect and perception that virtually colide together to form a visual tapestry unlike any other. To say this is style over substance is dismissive and wrong. The substance of the film is built in a rich visual fabric that incorporates parody, our cultural folklore heros, images, performances, and a sense of loss. Batman is the ultimate anti hero, and Burton is a cinematic hero for bringing these various elements together on the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very rarely do movie sequels ever match the grandeur of the originals. Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS, however, does so with gusto. Hardly standing on the shoulders of its record-breaking 1989 predecessor, this mesmerizing blend of Gothicism, film noir, and cartoon chaos is a classic in its own right. High drama, uncompromising humor, and lots of cool things to look at highlight this tale of Batman's war against The Penguin, Catwoman, and a fascist businessman (Christopher Walken). Not even a shaky plot, some absurd set-pieces, and Burton's trademark perversity (much worse here than in many of his other films) seriously mar this wildly original movie that should prove once and for all that superheroes aren't just for kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wasn't a great movie. In general, Tim Burton's films are style over substance, but man what style! The good about this movie is the Batman/Catwoman relationship. It was far more interesting than the romantic dynamic of the previous film, although still not what I'd consider a classic love story. Christopher Walken is fabulous, as always. Danny DeVito does a good job playing the character of the Penguin as written, but I did not enjoy this story's version of that character. The bad about this movie is that it spends more time focusing on the villains than on the title character. This seems to imply that the producer's of the film don't believe that Batman can carry a movie on his own. Nonsense! After all, in my opinion Batman is one of the four greatest comic characters ever created (the others being Superman, Spider-Man, and Wolverine from X-Men). This movie is also seriously too dark, violent, and sexual for kids. It was rated "PG-13", but I'm sure was really close to an "R".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman part 2 beats Batman part 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman (1989, directed by Tim Burton) was certainly not a bad movie, especially because Jack Nicholson played his Joker-role with 110% enthusiasm, but Batman Returns (1992, also directed by Tim Burton) is even better. Bad guy Danny De Vito (playing The Penguin) plays great and bad girl Michelle Pfeiffer (as The Catwoman) is the best and most sensual Catwoman ever! Pfeiffer in her Catwomansuit is simply delicious to watch!! She also acts out the cat-habits like licking herself very good. And then there is Micheal Keaton as Batman. He was good in the first film and there didn't change anything, he's still a great Bruce Wayne/ Batman.Another improvement to the first Batman film is the story. In the first movie the main woman (played by Kim Basinger) is in the film, but what she's doing there? I don't know. In Batman Returns The Catwoman has a very important role which pushes the story along.The conclusion is that Batman 2 is better than Batman 1 and that there is nothing bad to say about the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman returns is the best batman movie and one of the best movies in general.This movie is way darker than the first and the characters are maybe way too creepy for some.The arch villain of the film,the penguin,is a tragic figure and Danny de Vito,although has a little more make up than needed,gives a performance of titanic proportions.Michelle Pfeiffer is the only worthwhile female character in any batman movie.She is amasing.Sexy and dangerous.Christopher Walken is the real bad guy of the film and his performance is so good you are happy when he dies(and with the way he dies!!!).The story is maybe "too much"for some people and I guess that's why Burton never had a chance directing Batman 3.See this movie and avoid the next sequels at any cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best screen version of a comic ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This pitchblack screen version of the batman figure is simply as perfect as it gets.First of all the winter Gotham in which the movie takes place, is a stunningly beautiful, dark and gothic place, a precise interpretation of the best of the batman graphic novels, and perhaps simply the best scenery that Tim Burton so far has produced (even counting Sleepy Hollow). Second -the story line, often accused of being far to black, to me is pure perfection. Never has the dubiousness of the batman figure been better put to light, and the dark corrupt world in which he lives, is to me the essence of the batman myth. After all we are taking about a man who has dedicated his whole life to the vengeance of something that happened to him as an 8 year old. If people want batman to be light family entertainment, they can go watch the 60`s tv-series ("quick robin get the shark spray"). Third, the acting is sublime, Michael Keaton (normally not a favorit of mine) plays him with an intensity that makes Val Kilmer and George Clooney look like something out of the above mentioned shows. The rest of the cast is equally perfect, what makes the difference from the later films is that this cast actually bothers to act, not just make caricatures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Glory of Gotham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton directs yet another astonishing film in which the Dark Knight protects the city he claims as his own. The set design is once again gloriously dark and its night canvas sets the tone. Michael Keaton reprises the role only he is careful enough to understand and brings the mental, emotional and brilliant character to life. Danny DeVito does an extraordinary job as Oswald Cobblepot, The Penguin, alongside Michelle Pfeiffer as the Catwoman. Christopher Walken plays his character well, he just gets in the way sometimes. Micheal Gough portrays Alfred Pennyworth with astounding praise and sarcasm, and Pat Hingle's Commissioner Gorden was not put to it's full potential, but is reasonable instead. The plot is dark and almost too twisted, even for us, but yet we understand that this is the way the Batman is to be portrayed, a dark shadow of a necessary evil. And despite what Joel Schumacher says about the first three films of Bruce Wayne being a whiny "whoa is me, my parents are dead", there is no mention of Bruce's parents anywhere in this film. (After all Joel, we dealt with that in the first film, YOU were the one who brought it back in the third, and by the way, the death of Bruce Wayne's parents is the driving force of Batman, if he forgets about his parents, he fails to be the Batman) You'd think people would research these things! But oh Tim Burton did!!! His artistic genius prevails yet again, and so does this masterpiece!</fullReview>

A storyline of much greater complexity and interest than the original, a much better-looking Gotham City, and the interactions between the Penguin (bird) and Catwoman (cat) are cute and funny. Both Keaton and DeVito turn in great performances, Pfeiffer's has been better but not too shabby. I really liked this movie, and didn't care much for any of the other (modern) Batman movies. The first is probably second-best to this one, and after that the series just went off the edge of the cliff. 8/10.</fullReview>

First off, this is first and only comic strip movie to have a plot. The bad guys are here, and they are more evil looking than ever. The Dark Knight lives up to that name in this movie. And it's the only time he has in the movies or TV. The thing that hurt this film is the fact it will scare the c**p out of kids. But that doesn't matter, it's still a great movie.

		<shortDescription>A film rich in subtext, which makes up for faulty plotline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True, I was wondering where the Penguin got the blueprints, as well as how those bats got stuffed in the Christmas tree. Yes, friends, this film is a flawed piece of art. But it is still rich in the gothic mythos that makes the comic book so grand. Each character is handed a frail psychological make up. The Penguin, though a departure from the comics, clearly defines an idea set up in the DC universe. The villains are tragic. They all have splits, and are driven mad by a set of circumstances. Each character demonstrates a distinct duality--while Catwoman and Batman mirror each other brilliantly. "Gothic" is explored through the gargoylesque Shreck cat statues, to subtle vampire references. Bo Welch's sets are reminiscent of German impressionistic silent films from the Penguin's fake hypnotic umbrella (an image virtually lifted from 'Dr. Caligari' to the character Max Shreck, named from the 'Nosferatu' actor in Murnau's films. Every time I watch this I find something new. It's more than a Batman film, it's a work of gothic beauty. Give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Batman was a dark, hellish nightmare, Batman Returns' has been lowered even further into the darkness in Tim Burton's fantastic follow up to his 1989 hit.Micheal Keaton reprises his role as the Caped Crusader, and as was the case in the first film, does a subtle and effective job of portraying Bruce Wayne/Batman. The real treat, however, is the new villains that he's gained. The Penguin, amusingly played by DeVito is wickedly fun; Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman is a sly, slinky, and intoxicatingly seductive; and Christopher Walken's Max Shreck is a ruthless, tough, and backstabbing businessman. While Batman is the hero, he is completely overshadowed by the fun menace provided by the three villains.Gotham City is even bleaker than before; with wrought iron fencing, soft snowfall and greys, whites, and blacks permeating the entire film. The set design is beautifully gothic and depressing. The look of the film is nightmarish and dull; Tim Burton would not direct anything so absent of color until Sleepy Hollow, 7 years later. Danny Elfman's music is also effective with its subtle, tinny, and foreboding score.While the story is not as compelling as its prequel's was, Batman certainly offers a fun script and great visuals: the attack during the Christmas parade, faithful penguin servants, a cavalcade of circus thugs, and, again, a dark vision of the fair city of Gotham. The film will satisfy any Burton fan and will definitely ring faithfully true to Batman fans.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie! Second only to the first one, it has a degree of lunacy matched only by "Mars Attacks!" also by Tim Burton.Many people feel that this is not as good as the first one mainly because of the lack of a character as powerful as The Joker. Although this might be right, IMHO it only makes this movie a different mix of values than the first one. It has the trademark darkness and psychological paradigms of the first one, but with a slightly sick twist: human oddities play a powerful role in the movie. The last of the "real" Batman movies, it is a must see for the sewer scenes and the "flight" over the abandoned zoo. A great movie by any standard.</fullReview>

Danny Devito is Penguin who was born deformed, dumped into the sewer as a child and raised by penguins. Michelle Pfeiffer is a regular secretary who is murdered by her boss and revived back to life by dozens of ally cats with eight lives remaining. Together they plot to destroy Batman. When they're not trying to do that Penguin wants to become the mayor of Gotham and Catwoman is determined to find out who Batman and eventually falls for Bruce Wayne. Excellent performances and visual effects may not top the first one, but is hard to top by the other two sequels.</fullReview>

The ending is awesome and very "Tim Burton-esque" and when I first saw that movie my eyes were tearing.

		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a explosively entertaining sequel that follows much the same pattern as the original Batman (1989). Tim Burton once again directs a dark moody film once again crafting expressionism and depicting Batman (Michael Keaton) as a dark but likable mysterious hero. The casting in Batman Returns is tremendous Danny DeVito fit the role of the Penguin perfect DeVito's physique was tailor made for the Penguin. Michelle Pfeiffer was aggressively stunning as the Catwoman and she unlike Kim Basinger provided great on screen chemistry with Keaton, Pfeiffer (Catwoman) simply has more in common with Bruce Wayne (Batman) both are mysterious and have two sides of life (split personalities) Basinger (Vicki Vale) was to fragile for a romantic interest of Batman. The Batman-Catwoman love interest doesn't last because we know a hero and villain can't be lifetime lovers. The Penguin (Devito) is a grotesque human-creature who wants to destroy Gotham City due to his abandoned childhood and failed mayor attempt. The Penguin unlike The Joker (Nicholson) is more of a violent destructive villain searching for the past as Nicholson's Joker was a homicidal killing likable clown who plagued Gotham with his joking killer art methods. The Joker also known as Jack Napier had a past connection to Batman remember the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. Christopher Walken gives a good performance as the corrupt hated Max Shreck, but I felt that was immaterial because two villains were enough drama and excitement for Batman The Shreck character in my opinion takes away from the film. Batman Returns is second best in the Batman series trailing only the original all good performances from Keaton, DeVito, and Pfeiffer and good directing from Burton a great movie to watch many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Batman-movie from 1989 is still one of my semi-favorites. This movie might not be as entertaining, but lets face it. It is one hell of a cool movie. Michelle Pfieffer and Danny DeVito are extremely hilarious as the title-baddies. Keaton is as usual a great Batman, and if that wasn't enough, Christopher Walken is swung in to it all! ''Batman Returns'' brings back some memories about that old 60-series, thinking about the evil Penguin and Catwoman. They are still a bit silly today, my theory, on purpice. Even though the nightmare-background (The Penguin is a freak that has lived in the sewers, since his parents dumped him there) you don't really think about it that much. ''Batman Returns'' is in many ways different from the 1989-movie. Well, the comic-action is still around, but the concept has been refreshed in a way I like. Even though the movie itself is quite good, It wouldn't have been the same without Keaton, Pfieffer, DeVito Walken and the great witts. Thrilling and cool. Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Batman-movie from 1989 is still one of my semi-favorites. This movie might not be as entertaining, but lets face it. It is one hell of a cool movie. Michelle Pfieffer and Danny DeVito are extremely hilarious as the title-baddies. Keaton is as usual a great Batman, and if that wasn't enough, Christopher Walken is swung in to it all! ''Batman Returns'' brings back some memories about that old 60-series, thinking about the evil Penguin and Catwoman. They are still a bit silly today, my theory, on purpice. Even though the nightmare-background (The Penguin is a freak that has lived in the sewers, since his parents dumped him there) you don't really think about it that much.''Batman Returns'' is in many ways different from the 1989-movie. Well, the comic-action is still around, but the concept has been refreshed in a way I like.Even though the movie itself is quite good, It wouldn't have been the same without Keaton, Pfieffer, DeVito Walken and the great witts.Thrilling and cool.

		<fullReview>A shocker! A sequel that is as good as the first one without being a remake! Both real Batman movies are cartoonishly violent (that is by no means an insult), SF (Science Fiction) comic book fantasies. That's what makes them great. They are intelligent but don't try to shoot for the Oscars or try to satisfy the legions of critics who hate films that are just escapist fare. Batman movies are supposed to a few hours of fun for the legions of innocent Batman fights to protect. Anyway, this film/movie is a blast. The set designs and directing make this film beautiful to stare at for hours. The acting is great-Everyone from Christopher Walken to Michael Keaton turns in a top-notch performancec and would have all been show stealers if they had been without each other's support. Gotham City is a dark and dangerous place where diabolical Penguins can run for Mayor, anonymous citizens scurry fearfully about, and the only person to protect us all is the Caped Crusader. It is up there with Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Blade Runner's LA. The score only makes this movie even better. The directing just makes the atmosphere even thicker. Then there's the neat story: Max Shreck manipulates the Penguin so he could be his power plant that sucks up power (You can never have too much power). Shreck wants the Penguin to become Mayor or vice versa. Then there's Catwoman, who's waging a war of vengeance on Max Shreck. It all boils down to a wonderful scheme of vengeance, what we are looking for in a Batman movie. The characters are great too: Michelle Pfeiffer does a great job as the confused and lonely Selena Kyle and is prrrrrrrr-fect as the leather clad Catwoman. Danny Devito is a great job as the estranged Penguin who takes his anger out on all of Gotham towards the end. Michael Keaton is dark as the Dark Knight and clumsy as the millionaire Bruce Wayne. Plus, there's the sarcasm. Doesn't the Penguin's Mayoral slogan of "BURN BABY BURN!" strike you as, er, sarcastic?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very dark sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this for the first time after seeing Batman Forever. This one was still great. The action at the beginning was very cool, and the plot was pretty good. Michelle Pfeiffer, like all the Batman babes, was also hot. However, this one is a lot darker and more saddening. Cat woman's insanity really makes me feel sorry for her. Danny DeVito did good with his character as well. I still think that the thing they had in common wasn't "their contempt for Batman," as Michelle put it, but that they had a very disturbed psyche. A good movie, but expect a little sorrowful feel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sequels rarely come close to the greatness of it's predecessor. While Batman Returns isn't better than the first Batman, it is a great film. Michael Keaton is back and plays Bruce Wayne/Batman just as well as the previous film. Danny DeVito delivers a great performance as the Penguin, as does Pfieffer as Catwoman. The story is again dark and just the way Batman should be. Keaton proves he is the best Batman again, and puts successors Kilmar and Clooney in their place as replacements and not the true Batman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first Batman movie(in my review of it I said a big 9 out 10... silly am I... IT'S A BIG TEN!). Batman Returns is a visually stunning film. Its features some of the most wonderful settings in movie history, I am not kidding! The penguin's hideout is incredible and Gotham is even more impressive than in the first movie. Christopher Walken is very good in is role. Once again, Tim Burton created a fantastic setting in which a great story can take place.And it does. The story is a typical comic book story that sticks very well to the Batman character. Even tough I didn't like the Penguin-Catwoman as much as the Joker, I don't know which Batman I liked the most. This calls for repeated viewings. A big ten!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BATMAN RETURNS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a very good follow up to the 1989 original. The story sees The Penguin team up with crooked business man, Max Schrek who is determined to make The Penguin the mayor of Gotham City. Early in the movie, Schrek throws his secretary from the top of a huge building. She then gets bitten by a lot of cats and she becomes Catwoman. Batman senses there is something crooked about The Penguin (who by this time has convinced Gotham that he is a good guy) and sets out to stop him and Schrek. Catwoman also wants to stop them, but only for revenge for what Schrek did to her earlier in the movie. All in all, this is an excellent movie. The acting is good, the sets are excellent and the story is very interesting. I give Batman Returns a 9/10.</fullReview>

But this time Bruce Wayne/Batman must face two villians at once!!The first is the Catman(Michelle Pfeiffer) and the Penguin(Danny DeVito), they are great in their roles for this movie!!The movie also throws in a third villian to power play the Penguin, he is played by a very over the top Christopher Walken!!The main plot is that the penguin wants to take over Gotham City and the Catwomen aids in his quest for power. This sequel takes place during Christmas so if you are sick and tried of all those Christmas movies"jingle all the way""it's a wonderful life"(classic) you can get some christmas cheer and some action from Micheal Keaton as well!!The city is dark in this movie as some spots, but hey it's a great action movie!!It's worth the time to check out this dark sequel!!!It's fun for everyone to watch!!!Do yourself a favor and watch this ASAP!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Knight at his darkest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a bare squeaker decision over its predescessor, this one gets my vote as the best of the Batman movies. This is the Batman mythos as it should always be: a dark, twisted world populated by deeply damaged people. Batman has never been a typical superhero, and this is no typical superhero movie.Yes, it has its share of action and mayhem, but the central pillar holding it all up is the interaction of profoundly disturbed people in bizarre outfits, and the question of what really makes Batman any different from the villains he thwarts.The Penguin, a villain I've never really cared for, is given a great new background here; a tragic, twisted, past worthy of the hero himself. DeVito comes off very well in the role I was convinced Burgess Meredith would own forever. The Catwoman has also been rethought with a strangely ambiguous origin and an unexpected feminist theme. I was originally convinced that Pfeiffer was wrong for this part; I should have learned to shut up after the Michael Keaton contraversy.Special mention should go to Bo Welch's production design, which bounces back and forth between skewed circus-from-hell to Speer-like Aryan designs with out-of-control proportions. While very different from Anton Furst's designs of the first film, it complements the story perfectly. Another special mention to Danny Elfman's score, still one of his best.From its stunning wordless opening sequence to its actionless melancholy ending, this is the thinking person's superhero film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my least favorite Batman movie. It's not that bad though. It's just a little slow and too dark for the kids to enjoy. It has good f/x and great make-up but the plot is a little dumb. The villains are not that great and that's what the Batman movies are about. The plot has Bruce still fighting the scum of Gotham but now he has two baddies to take care of. The Penguin and Catwoman. Both trying to destroy Bruce and each other. Michelle Pfeiffer did a good job as Catwoman and Danny DeVito was also good but the characters were a little dumb. Like Christopher Walken's character. It's not as good as Batman or Batman Forever but it really beats Batman and Robin. Check it out if you like any of the actors or if you just like Batman. You'll be sure to find something you like about it but it didn't do for me what the first did. Batman Returns: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Batman (1989) just like I do most Burton movies. We all know Michael Keaton was the best Batman , but besides Batman &amp; Robin this was the worst Batman movie . The first one really had no plot but who cared Batman didn't need one. So on that level this one was the best , because it's the only one with a real plot . But the first Batman showed off Batman the way they did in the comics &amp; was over the top where it should be , light , funny &amp; lots of action that's Batman . Batman Returns was dark and kinda evil looking , like Batman meets Beetlejuice . And where was the bad guy , like Bond movies the best part of Batman is the bad guy . There where no great bad guys in this one and I say that's what made the first one so good . I mean the first one was by far Jack's movie . So overall if what to freak your kids out this is the perfect family movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good sequel to a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is probably the best sequel to a comic book/action movie. Tim Burton once again captures the audience, now having Batman have to fight off two villains, instead of one. The Penguin is a great villain, and Danny DeVitto really delivers, yet not as much as Jack Nicholson in the original, and Michelle Pfeiffer did a phenomenal performance as Selina Kyle, a secretary who goes crazy and becomes the Catwoman. Burton's vision of Gotham City succeeds once again at making the audience believe it is a quirky, crime infested town. Though some scenes are cheesy, such as the fact that Catwoman instantly learns how to fight better than Batman himself, you still are captured in the feeling that this movie, like the original, is not a movie just to entertain kids with their favorite good guys, like how Joel Shumacher's vision did. The stunts and special effects in this movie are also great, so you do get some visual excitement, too. I also like the fact that Bruce Wayne falls in love with a villain. All in all, this was the last good Batman movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essentially, the end of the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns marks the end of one of the most potentially profitable franchises for Warner Bros. While the character development may not have been as stylish as the first, the somber tone that the series is known for remains intact (aided by Danny Elfman's spectacular score). This sequel narrowly edges out the original as my favorite in the series. Perhaps the fact that this film deals primarily with the "dark side" of human nature is why it did not appeal to most audiences. It's a shame that Joel Schumacher sold out the series by slowly replacing the drama behind the Batman story with the cartoonish claptrap that puts merchandise revenue in W.B.'s pockets. If they choose to do a fifth, it would probably be best to use Tim Burton's "gothic" Gotham City and the "Batman: Year One" plot line. If not, way to go Warner Bros. for destroying the Dark Knight.</fullReview>

Unlike its predecessor, Batman, Batman Returns actually makes you care about the characters, especially Batman and Catwoman or for that matter, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, their alter-ego.

		<shortDescription>The .... Penguin???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie when I first saw it, and I still like it very much to this day. Danny DeVito (one of my favorite actors) was perfect casting as The Penguin. And the potrayal of his character was the best part of the movie. His character was tragic, and yet devious and evil. The only problem is that his character wasn't THE PENGUIN! The Penguin is a dapper don, who dresses very elegantly. Most of the movie, DeVito is wearing some sort of underwear! In the comics the penguin is an excellent fighter, in the movie he barely gives Batman much of a fight! In the Comics Batman has admitted many times the The Penguin is smarter than he is, which is very true. In the movie he is constantly outsmarted by Batman. This hardly ever happens in the comics. Plus, he hates fish!!! (as many people have also pointed out) The Penguin should have been an Evil crime boss who wants ...... money! Well, anyway the movie was good except for the character that was written. Still, I think that Danny DeVito was great with the character he was given.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie, but I feel that some of it might be a little too dark in tone. Especially for the young filmgoers that they were trying to target. Keaton does a good enough job as Batman and, this time, he is given adequate time as Bruce Wayne as well. Danny DeVito made an exceptional Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer was superslinky as Catwoman. I felt we could have done without Christopher Walken's Max Schreck. The character is weak and not given enough motivation for doing the things that he does. And we're just supposed to accept that the Penguin has the blueprints to the Batmobile in order to sabotage it! Now THIS needed an explanation. Not as much fun as the '89 film, but enjoyable nevertheless.</fullReview>

The Penguin, played by Danny Devito was a well developed, and truly repulsive character. The Catwoman character was also fairly interesting. I think the strength of the movie is that it expands on the original comic book characters, while Catwoman could've been glossed over as a femme fatale, she was in fact developed as a repressed secretary who finds her duel identity as a cat very liberating. Devito effectively plays a freakish, repugnant misanthrope. The Action sequences and production was slick and slightly off beat. Burton was at his best.

		<shortDescription>"Batman" meets the dark genere of film noir. But is that good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the first film, and liked it very much. The hero won, the bad guy was killed, and all was right with the world. Although the set pieces and the matte paintings were very dark, "Batman" still saw the light of day. There was a feeling of happiness, excitement, and euphoria in the first film. That all changed and disappeared without a trace with the release of the sequel, "Batman Returns". This isn't just the darkest film of the "Batman" series. To me, it's one of the darkest and nastiest films ever made. Maybe that's because it was so different compared to it's predecessor. However, nothing good or even slightly euphoric came out of this film whatsoever! It's not a bad film, just a depressing one. Everything that could possibly go wrong or bad happens in this film, because the characters and villains in the film simply choose to destroy themselves and the world as we know it. That is the usual premise for film noir, but "Batman" is(at least I think so) not film noir! As for the characters, they have gone from being potent and evil to just plain vile and disgusting. The Penguin reminds me of Mr. Cresote from "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life", because he's just an ugly, slobbering, and unsympathetic pig. He was raised by Penguins too, which adds to more of the realism(that is, next to none). Catwoman is sexy, but insane in the absolute extreme. It's bizarre that after she fell out of a window, a horde of cats managed to lick her back to life. And how is it that she can survive death because of her 9 lives? It's really weird and twisted! Christopher Walken didn't frighten me, even though he's supposed to, in the role of Max Shreck. He looks like, well, a Tim Burton creation. Everyone is this film is twisted up, minus Batman and Alfred, who unfortunately, have little or no screen time or effects on the other characters. To add to even more surrealism and insanity, this Gotham City looks more like Tim Burton's world. It looked almost(if not exactly) like the world of "The Nightmare Before Christmas". It's not bad, but it's wrong for Batman. At least the first film had skyscrapers that were a little more believable. Don't think that you will come out of this movie feeling happy or glad you spent you time and money on it. It's a vicious and crazy movie about twisted people who, despite Batman's heroic intervention, eventually self destruct physically and psychologically. It's a powerful story, yes, and it does make sense. But if Tim Burton wanted to tell it, why did he use Batman as his storyteller? That is what I think, made the film fall. He had all the characters of the old series, but he had a different story. As a net result, the finished product was incoherent and mean. It's interesting, and worth watching(maybe once). But if it makes you feel depressed and beat, don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so near, and such a mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not so much a movie, more a series of photo opportunities. But what photos! This is a beautifully designed film, with some pretty decent performances, and a script that needed ditching and starting over; it has at once far too much and far too little plot, and Burton isn't the director to get over that. As a noirish Christmas movie (which was a good idea visually: it enables Gotham City to have a bit of white in it, while still retaining the requisite bleakness) it bears comparison with Burton's more personal "The Nightmare before Christmas", and there are points of contact with "Edward Scissorhands" too.Rather than learn from this film's mistakes, the further sequels decided to make them again, only bigger (while introducing lots of really stupid ones of their own), by following "Returns"'s terrible miscalculation of having two virtually independent villains who have less and less to do with one another as the dnouement approaches. The film could have worked if only the last reel had drawn the plot strands together; instead, de Vito's (adequate) Penguin is resurrected simply for the sake of him falling over again for no good reason - this is dramatically unforgivable, and dissipates all the energies that have been generated by Keaton and Pfeiffer, who do some excellent work with pretty poor dialogue.</fullReview>

I had heard from Leonard Maltin and other movie critics about how bad this movie was and when I finally saw it, I was impressed. Somewhat.The problem with this movie was the lack of screen time for Michael Keaton. He got the top-billing for this movie, yet he appears in one scene in the first forty minutes. I kept watching and watching for Batman/Bruce Wayne to appear on screen again while they were explaining the backgrounds of the Catwoman and Penguin. By this point, I was bored. But the movie got better after that and the finale was kind of cool.DeVito was good as the Penguin. Pfeiffer overacted as the Catwoman. Christopher Walken was hilarious as Max Shreck, but his character disappears abruptly in the film's second half. I missed his character while we saw the Penguin wreak havoc on Gotham.I miss Tim Burton's Batmans. Batman and Robin was dreadful. Batman Forever was pretty cool.Rating: 3/5</fullReview>

True, the action scenes aren't particularly good, and the characters all wear black all the time, but this is still awesome movie making. The sets are magnificent, the acting first class from everybody, the costumes are superb, and it's got some fantastic scenes in it. Both Tim Burton and the writer Daniel Hamm have admitted this is the darkest of the series, and possibly too dark for a family audience, but this is how Batman is supposed to be...silent, tough, menacing, brooding...although I don't know why people think he's supposed to be insane. He's consumed with vengeance, and that is what makes him do what he does. He's not insane, he's a man who suffered a terrible tragedy as a kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is truly Catwoman's movie--Penguin should have been removed from the script...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first and only ambitious sequel to "Batman" falls short of the original because it is overburdened with characters. This fatal flaw only becomes more pronounced in subsequent sequels. The Penguin (played by Danny DeVito) and all of his cohorts should have been eliminated from the script. This movie is really about Catwoman, a riveting role performed by the ever-lovely Michelle Pfieffer. Like Michael Keaton's character in the first film, Pfieffer's character, a traumatized secretary who survives a murderous shove from a twelfth-story window, finds that her experience has brought out an unnerving and lunatic dark side. The chemistry is excellent between Pfieffer and her psychotic, corporate executive boss (played by Christopher Walken) and, at first, seems quite engaging between her and Keaton. Indeed, she is Batman's feminine side: his missing half. Unfortunately, the Batman-Catwoman relationship is not developed to the degree it should have been due to the distractions created by DeVito's character. Nevertheless, flawed as it may be, this is the one Batman sequel that is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

Although I think nothing can beat the Joker in "Batman," Pfeiffer and DeVito did a good job making their characters look (long pause...) EVIL, in a cartoon-like way. The villains cannot entirely be taken seriously, of course, as Joker epitomizes, but really, what IS Batman without the bad guys? I enjoyed the transition from mild-mannered, single secretary to "femme fatale" Catwoman.

		<fullReview>Why can't they make Batman films like this? This new Batman, ugh. Ditch the neon, the bad sidekicks, and ridiculous writing. No wonder there's no Batman film slated for this summer.I say, bring back Keaton, Burton, and Elfman. THIS film screams Batman from start to finish. It's Dark, well acted, and the music is outstanding. I love it. There is no Batman besides Keaton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only sequel to Batman to be actually good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was original, and full of good stunts, although it was kinda dreary and dark, it was still enjoyable, and entertaining. And Michael Keaton is great as Batman, Michelle Pffiefer is both sensational and sexy as Catwoman, and Dannu DeVito is so-so as the Penguin. All in all the movie was good, but not as good as the original, it didn't have that thing that made the first good. I give it a 6.5 out of 10 Rated PG-13 for action and violence, and for sensuality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies ever made. Tim Burton's best work, IMHO. Danny Elfman's musical score, really compliments the tragic and moving parts of the film. An original-ish idea to have two baddies, instead of just the one, and unlike most action movies, the bad-guys weren't necessarily "evil" (especially Cat-Woman). The conflict between the three characters is what makes the film. The style has to be seen to be appreciated, dark, yet exciting. It doesn't bore you as a lot of dark films do. The story is constantly progressing, and there is no messing about with the pointless bits. It stands up to continuous viewing very well - I watched it several times with only short periods between (a few days), and it took me about 5 or 6 watchings before I decided to put it aside for a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Tim Burton's style. It's dark, funny and his characters have a certain charming quality about them. Yet, 89 minutes into Batman Returns and I'm having serious second thoughts.May be because this is not something we've come to associate with Batman or may be it's the effect of Nolan's masterpieces, Batman Returns simply doesn't work for me. Instead of characters, we're bombarded with ghastly caricatures. Story resembles an out-of- control bandwagon and the sets are outlandish. It might come out as a dark work of art to some but for all it's managed to give me is a mind- boggling headache.Danny Devito had potential but he's been reduced to a whiny, childish mess. For Michelle Pfeiffer, i've just one word - Terrible. Not that I would associate Catwoman with colorful wondergirl stuff but in fleshing out her character to remember the feline fiend, the writers seem to have gone a mile ahead of overboard. Right from the costume, makeup to the portrayal of the character, every single thing is just nuisance. Christopher Walken's Max Shreck seems a confused soul rather than the shrewd businessman he's supposed to be. Bruce &amp; Alfred try to save Gotham in the midst of all this grotesqueness, just as Michael Keaton &amp; Gough try to save Batman Returns from becoming a complete mess. The movie simply did not work for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BATMAN RETURNS is really amazing.The tone is really dark and intense and this had a very parental backlash from critics because the violence was so dark, but now in the superhero film genre, they still do light hearted films, but keep the dark and gritty tone in films.The acting and action scenes are really cool and I really love both of those. Michael Keaton returns as Batman / Bruce Wayne for his second and last time and I could not have think of anyone else. The rest of the actors are really cool and the film is just amazingly well done.The visuals, music, editing, story and pacing are very good in this film and I am very pleased with the final results, but it was not that dark and violent. Overall, BATMAN RETURNS gets an 10 out of 10, while there are some flaws, I still love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good Batman film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say,it was worth spending the two hours seeing this film then have watched the Dark Knight Rises not long ago. Seriously I think Michael Gough is the best Alfred of the 1990s like I really wished Michael Caine didn't appear as the present Alfred. Michael Hough is 10 times better and more of having a butler attitude like Caine! I honestly loved Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, however she doesn't seem to have a good wardrobe when she's back to normal. Yes I know she was meant to be a goody two shoes nerd at the beginning but when she becomes Catwoman, she seriously needed a new wardrobe. She looked like she needed new clothes honestly. The only times she was beautiful, was at Penguins Ball and her costume. The fashion department probably needed Joan Rivers behind the set! It would've been better that way.Oh my gosh, Danny Devito was absolutely amazing at playing Penguin, although I wish his character didn't die in the the end. I wish there was a sequel for penguin so Danny could join again. It would be awesome.Michael Keaton was an alright Batman but Adam West is still on top of the list like. He seemed like a shy and quiet Batman really. We need a better superhero then that to be honest. He didn't show much enthusiasm or interest to make sure Gotham is safe from Penguin. Well at least he saved the day and did recover Gotham although it wasn't in an exciting way! That's just me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my opinion...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoyed the 1989 Batman, you will probably enjoy this one just as much and I actually enjoyed it a little more. While Keaton does reprise his role as the dark knight, this movie felt a little different and in a good way actually. Many have complained that these older Batman films took a different approach towards the caped crusader and his adventures. However, that does not mean that these movies could not be enjoyed. Batman Returns works both as a sequel to the first Tim Burton directed Batman while also working as a stand-alone. There is 1 or 2 references to the 89' Batman but you basically you could have missed the first Batman and watched this without feeling that something was missing. This movie is much more darker than the 89' one, Gotham City is a very uncomfortable looking city and feels as if danger hides behind each corner and I think this adds to the story. It pulls us into its world as we are introduced to what I felt was a very good performance from DeVito as the crazed Penguin who almost felt similar to Nicholson's Joker, with the differences being his back-story (which is somewhat explained) and his goals. Michelle Pfeiffer also gave a good performance as a menacing Catwoman who throws herself into the Penguin's plans to rise up the ranks of Gotham with very evil intentions which are slowly revealed as the movie progresses. Keaton also gave what I felt was a deeper performance as Batman, he made it feel as if he too was worried about the possible outcomes from Penguin and his intentions."Eat floor." -Batman (Batman Returns)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even with flaws, the film overcomes its previous film in all respects and no doubt marked a whole generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a successful first foray into the Dark Knight film, comes three years after the continuation of the story to the big screen especially for first have cost $ 35 million and yielded over $ 400 million at the box office for the coffers of Warner Brothers. And who again assumes the command of this second adventure superhero of Gotham City is Tim Burton, the director of the eccentricities and visual appeal enviable.Many of the previous errors were avoided, but it is clear that others insist permeate this sequence. Now, after running the first Baman, Tim Burton continued to create its bizarre characters and extravagant and began a partnership with his usual collaborator Johnny Depp in the mega-acclaimed hit Edward Scissorhands 1990 - and now enjoying more success returned to continue the saga of Batman, taking advantage of the fact that much more freedom than before, as he also assumed the position of producer of this continuation. Burton called Daniel Waters to write based on the first script by Sam Hamm, the same as the first movie. For this task, two super villains of Batman were scaled to give work to the hero, that even with the best performance of Michael Keaton in the previous, is overcome by the new double evil of Gotham.Many fans wanted to Catwoman as the main villain of the film, but Burton dismissed this possibility, since the comic makes it clear that the two are not always enemies, and eventually teaming up. This duality of Catwoman is featured in the film. While Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne is interested in each other, Catwoman and Batman have disagreements and try to eliminate each other. Pfeiffer causes absurdly dressed in leather clothing fair and those lips and eyes green giants, and is unrivaled as the character he was born to her becoming eternal symbol of sensuality in cinema with his mask and whip, and eclipsing all others in the cast of the film. The emotional instability of Selina Kyle is one of the high points of interpretation Michele Pffeifer that according to Burton, is an impressive professional. The chemistry between the character and Batman is a pleasant surprise - just observe the sequences filmed in the ballroom costumes and Wayne Manor.As well as with his Joker Nicholson in 1989, which was dances and some baseless narrative that served only to exaggerate the madness of the character - Burton and DeVito also deal with a deformed child like an animal that eats cats in a "cage" and that is the height of the construction Penguin as a character who apparently is a compulsive sexual way to stay looking young and beautiful girls with their constant panting breaths as if during a sexual act. Penguin is also clearly fall into the naive promises Shreck and never seems threatening, which is a problem because it is the principal enemy of Batman and justifies the presence of Catwoman on the scene .With the caveats in the construction of the characters in the view of Burton described above, other points are even more improved than the previous film. The Gotham City a wonderful art direction signed by Bo Welch and photography of Stefan Czapsky presents a noir atmosphere and decadent, showing a city intimidating and that keeps the smoke in the streets and now the Christmas atmosphere and snow makes everything even more tense , which leaves its mark and is the main element to differentiate photography from the first film.The fight scenes are better worked. The armor distinctly lighter and offering greater freedom of movement and choreography provides best fights better developed and realistic. The Batmobile was also used in the movie Batman with some changes, having the ability to stretch and shrink the body turning into a missile.The script manages to overcome the former bringing a slightly higher complexity. Again we see the similarities with Batman's enemies, since all choke and feelings, to go through some trauma, bring out another side of the personality that is averse to social rules that stifle.Unlike the first which is also bleak, this second film Burton sparked more protests by fans and critics. Much of what had been seen before, again appears more prominently as the Gothic settings, the psychological motivation of the characters, their crises and disturbances and the attention given to the antagonists, as we see Batman again be supporting in their own history. As with the Joker Jack Nicholson, now both the Penguin as Catwoman get the spotlight.Excessive gloomy weather has been criticized by many parents consider the film too dark and violent for children, who made up a significant portion of the public in theaters. Warner Bros., even with the good reception of the last movie, then decided to rethink the franchise's hero, paying attention mainly on criticism of the somber mood built by Burton, even though this is the ideal climate for the character, which is the world in which it is inserted.Danny Elfman once again back on the soundtrack and only confirms their work, further reinforcing the theme song and inserting new elements to a strong track that leaves the film again in an atmosphere of high tension, recording the theme song from Batman Burton on everyone's mind. Elfman and Burton is definitely a successful partnership where one complements the other, as well as John Williams and Steven Spielberg.The film, even with flaws, manages to overcome his previous film in all respects and no doubt marked a whole generation. Has a better script, a good climax and remarkable characters. No doubt it was worth it and this is consolidated as one of the best versions of Batman in movies, not to mention the latest masterpieces Nolan fleeing any adjustment already made previously been revolutionizing and reinventing the character uniquely and original, going back to their origins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Tim Burton film, batman returns is definitely the darkest of the 4. But I love the way they portrayed Catwoman and the Penguin. Michelle Pfeiffer was the PERFECT choice for Catwoman, sexy and mysterious, just the way Catwoman should be. I think that this film is far better than the 1989 Batman. And seriously there is no one better to play the Penguin than Danny Daveito. And the script was very very sharp. I loved every scene in this movie. And Michael Keaton was great as Batman just like in the first film. And I also love the way Burton made Gotham look very slick and cool. Now, many parents were unhappy with this film being darker than the original, and I do understand that, but Really it wasn't all that terribly dark to me. I just think maybe some of those parents were sheltering they're child a little too much. Sooo pleased with this movie. Really, the best one in the 4 filmed franchise.

Crooked businessman Max Schreck is co-erced into helping him become Mayor of Gotham and they both attempt to expose Batman in a different light.Selina Kyle, Max's secretary, is thrown from the top of a building and is transformed into Catwoman - a mysterious figure who has the same personality disorder as Batman. Batman must attempt to clear his name, all the time deciding just what must be done with the Catwoman.......Much more darker in tone than the previous movie, BR is a lot more Art Deco and it almost appears to be set in the thirties, rather than after the first film. Keaton again is wonderful as the troubled hero, and although we never go back to his parents murder, the autos desolation in Wayne manor is still evident.The villains here are good, but if they were to be in the film singularly, rather than together, it would be a pretty anaemic affair. Devito is great as The Penguin, but he's too pantomime at times. Pfeiffer obviously steals every scene she's in with Keaton and Devito, nut again, she's way too over the top at times.But the film belongs to Walken, as the meglomaniac Schreck. He hams it up so much, The Sheriff Of Nottingham would be proud.Like all of the nineties Batman movies, plot plays second to spectacle, so we are treated to some really good set pieces, beautifully choreographed and filmed.Its pure Burton from beginning to end, and there wasn't a better Batman movie until Ledger became 'stranger'....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns is a dark, well-accepted and well-directed sequel that's just as good as it's predecessor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns, released in 1992, is a dark, yet interestingly developed sequel that follows the 1989 film 'Batman'. In this film, we're introduced to the villains, and they're- Penguin and Catwoman. Selena Kyle/Catwoman gets tossed from her boss from a window. We see she's rescued by cats/kittens. She becomes 'Catwoman'. Penguin is a hideously- deformed and eerie looking person who comes from a rich family in Gotham. The films focuses more on Batman, unlike the first film which was a little more focused on the joker. Nevertheless, the first film was still great. This one, Bat,an Returns, is superbly directed yet again from Gothic-loving master- Tim Burton. This was the last film of the Batman franchise to be directed by Tim Burton. It's one helluva film and it's quite different from the first film, In some ways more than others. It has intense scenes, dark, thrilling scenes and genius acting from all three (Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer). This film truly lives up to its aspects and is just as great as it's dark predecessor. I have to list it as my 3rd favourite Batman film after both the Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises. The film genuinely never gets old. I've seen it a good twenty - twenty- five times and it's still as good as it's always been. Michael Keaton, as Batman, is great and I think he's better as Batman in this film than as he is in the 1989 film. Overall, I rate this film a 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton returns to direct the second Batman movie. Evil businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) intends to build a 'powerplant' that does nothing but help himself. Danny DeVito plays The Penguin who was abandoned as a baby and now lives in the sewer. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is the timid assistant to Max Shreck until she discovers his evil plans. He pushes her out the window, and she turns into Catwoman.The Penguin is no Joker. He really isn't anything that could be deemed superior to the Joker. The good thing is that they put in Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She is much better than all the screaming from Kim Basinger. And the movie still has that Tim Burton style.

		<shortDescription>For all its problems, Batman Returns is still an awesome Batman film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll go ahead and say it, Batman Returns is my favorite Batman movie. As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict &amp; romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman &amp; Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7.5/10 - Burton's imagination gone wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman Returns" is a strange movie. It may not be a film for everyone. Back in its day, it caused such a fuss, and it's easy to see why. This is a very dark film, and twisted, too.There's a scene where Selina Kyle falls from several stories, gets resurrected by cats, and goes bat-sh** crazy, stabbing her stuffed dolls with a knife.The Penguin is such a creepy character. In one scene, he shakes another guy's hand with a dismembered man's hand, and in another, he bites another man's nose and leaves it bleeding.Yes, this is a dark, twisted, bizarre film. In fact, more so than the first one.Yet strangely, it manages to be a really fun film! Here is director Tim Burton at his whimsical best, creating a blend of playful imagination and dark fantasy, and he's doing it in that dark, playful way that only he can do. The scene where Batman takes on the Penguin's Red Circus Gang is a lot of fun to watch, with the different members of the Red Circus Gang appearing in many strange, bizarre forms, and Batman dispatching them with a variety of different methods, like rod that pop out of the Batmobile's wheels to trip them.In fact, while being darker than the first "Batman," this also manages to be more cartoony. There's no forgetting the Penguin's army of rocket-launching, well, penguins, which look funny with those mind control devices on their heads. And, while being silly, it has charm, something lacking in the ridiculous scenes of "Batman &amp; Robin." This is not a realistic film, and Burton makes no attempt to. After all, Selina Kyle is not only resurrected by cats, for some reason, she also gains the ability to fight and be adept with the whip. Are these magical cats? There's nothing to prepare the audience for these unexpected supernatural scenes. In fact, my only major gripe with the film may be the script: It's not exactly the most coherent in the world.The first "Batman" movie was gritty and had the vibe of a crime/noir film. But "Batman Returns" throws away all that, and here instead is this Tim Burton world that is strange and dark, but what an enchanting world it is! It is so imaginative, with great-looking sets, like the Penguin's hideout, and great scenes, too.The first "Batman" had a lot of great, spectacular scenes, and this sequel follows up with just as much spectacle, such as the scene where Batman destroys the Penguin's headquarters. Tim Burton is very creative with the scenes, and there are some memorable images, like when the Penguin takes his hands and forms the shadow of a bat on the ceiling.The story is more complex than the first. The first film was mainly about Batman versus the Joker. Here, on the other hands, are several interlinking stories: The Penguin's attempt to get revenge on society, for it rejected him for being deformed; Selina's/Catwoman's desire for revenge against her boss; the evil Max Shreck's plot involving his nuclear power plant; and on top of it all is Batman's quest to stop them.It is said that Batman is reduced to a mere supporting character in his own movie, and this is no exaggeration. The villains do, in fact, get a lot of screen time. But it is all these interlinking characters that make the movie. The point isn't so much about Batman undergoing a major character arc as it is about how he relates to the other characters.Yet, in whatever scenes he has, the audience gets to know enough about Batman/Bruce Wayne. We first see him in a dark mansion, brooding alone in a dark room. This alone tells us that not only is he a recluse, he's lonely as well. In one scene, Alfred calls him a "lonely man-beast." But lonely as he may be, he may have perhaps found love in the form of Selina Kyle, whose alter-ego happens to be none other than Catwoman, one of Batman's enemies.The romance here is perhaps more interesting than the first. Here, for the first time, is a love interest who is very much like Batman/Bruce?perhaps too much. Here are two people who dress up in costumes and live double lives, and the doubles lives is what makes the romance interesting: While in one form they romance each other, in the other, they fight. Both of them have "a dark side." As Batman says, they're "the same, split right down the middle." The film treats Batman as being essentially the same as his two villains. They're all freaks and misfits. All of them are seeking revenge, with Batman being the only one who's on the right side. The real villain in the story is Max Shreck, who just seeks power.The film ends with a beautiful scene. Bruce/Batman has apparently lost Selina/Catwoman. He's in his car being driven by Alfred. All of a sudden, he sees a stray cat, and he decides to take it inside. Then he sees a silhouette of Catwoman, but it quickly vanishes. The car drives away, and above them, the Bat-signal looms in the sky. All of a sudden, the head of Catwoman appears, and she watches the car drive away. She's alive, but Selina and Bruce can't be together. "Batman Returns" is perhaps the most bittersweet in the series.It's easy to get turned off by this movie. There are those weird, bizarre scenes, after all. The plot might not make a lot of sense to first-time viewers. For me, this is one of those films has to "grow on you." This may not be a film that's easy to get into. Some will probably never get into it at all. But for those who do, they'll be given a taste of Tim Burton's imagination at its fullest, as well as a beautiful, haunting experience.</fullReview>

This is simply a great batman movie, Burton's batman will always be legendary because his vision for batman was perfect with the character. While Chris Nolan had the best stories for batman, Tim's look of the costume, bat-mobile and music is the best. Besides the great visuals, the development of the villains are great! Yes the story is just another batman vs the villains of the week, while Nolan's batman had more complex themes to it but batman vs a villain is really all you need for batman. This film is very controversial for that some feel it's too dark and bizarre but while the film is dark and creepy I think it all makes for a great movie. Some worried that this scared little kids but my feeling is that this movie is rated pg-13 not g so it's not exactly for little kids and I like the fact that Tim was interested in making a serious batman movie not campy or watered down for kids or pandering to marketing. While the first film felt like a Bob Kane batman this one is much more of a Tim Burton-esquire batman. I like the Christmas/winter atmosphere, seeing Gotham covered in snow looks cool. I love Tim's take on the penguin, it's definitely a "Burton penguin" nothing like in the comics and even some thought he was too creepy, mean-spirited and freakish but I feel that he's the villain and should be menacing not campy. I like the back-story that he was born to rich parents who tried to drown him as a baby in shame because he was born a freak, thus he was raised in the sewer by penguins. He wants to belong in Gotham but wants revenge on Gotham, he runs for mayor, tries to drown kids and he's a little perverted but Danny Devito was perfectly cast in the role and gave what might be his best big screen performance. Michelle Pfeiffer is simply the best catwoman ever!(Julie Newmar's 2nd) Her catwoman is legendary and for good reason too! Pfeiffer gives a excellent performance as Selina Kyle, she does a great job making the transformation from wimpy secretary to the empowered catwoman. Great origin story for catwoman, Tim &amp; company were great at making catwoman a complex and interesting villain and of course the outfit is great! She looks like a black cat with a S&amp;M undertone. One of my favorite scenes is when we first see catwoman and she stops a man from mugging a woman and then turns against the woman, telling her that she's weak and I love when she says "I am Catwoman, hear me roar!" and she then back-flips away! That was awesome! Pfeiffer looks very sexy in a creepy S&amp;M kind of a way. I love the way she uses her bull-whip, you don't want to get near her with that whip. I also love her voice. Pfeiffer's performance, her extremely tight leather outfit, mystery and story is the best part of the movie. Christopher Walken is great in his underrated performance as a 3rd villain, Max Shrek, who's interesting in his own right and fits well into the story. I love when he says "what did curiosity do to the cat". Then there's Micheal Keaton returning as Batman, I understand how a lot of people criticized this film &amp; the previous for not showing enough of batman and focusing more on the villains. Batman is definitely low key and we don't find out much about him but it works for Tim. We don't really need to see a lot of batman to understand him, it kinda works for batman to be more in the background then in the forefront. Keaton is still a great batman, he comes off as a real detective, smart. He really captures the brooding quality of batman and batman comes off as a cool superhero in this film. He's not social but he's always there to save the city. I like how Keaton plays Bruce Wayne as a reclusive millionaire loner and I like his relationship with Alfred. There's great action scenes, great music by Elfman and special effects. The film's dark and creepy but it's fun and is a classic batman movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot better than the first Tim Burton Batman film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion this movie romps all over the first Batman. Tim Burton isn't really an action director but the action scenes do not subtract from the overall impact of this movie. Batman Returns as set the standard for the next two Batman movies, though after Tim Burton handed the reigns over to Joel Shumacher Batman has become more comic book like and is slowly reverting back to the original television series. The critics did not like this movie and the reason that they give is that it is not like the original comic books. It is too dark and the characters are not heroic as a comic book hero should, but they are more like the anti-heroes of the late forties, early fifties movies. Batman Returns is considered to be Film Noir, or Black Film, though a friend says that it goes far more Gothic than Film Noir. He also comments that these Tim Burton Batman movies are much closer to the original comic books where Batman is truly a pained individual and suffers from childhood torments. In effect the critics found Batman Returns far too depressing for their tastes. That is why I liked it. I really enjoy Tim Burton movies because they are close to my style of filmmaking and writing. I tend to create characters who are either pained or tragic and spend the movie either destroying themselves or trying to live with the pain. This is what happens in Batman Returns. The three main characters live lives of pain: the Penguin (Danny DiVito) was thrown into the sewers by his parents when he was a baby because they could not live with a freak, the Catwoman (Michelle Phieffer) lives a double life as a secretary who struggles to survive in an unloving, unforgiving world, and Batman also lives a double life as a lonely millionaire who has not got over the death of his parents. The Catwoman and Batman are very similar and as such their respective characters are drawn together. They both live double lives and Burton does well to drop hints of this double nature. On one hand when they are in their masks, they fight for that is their nature: the Catwoman is a villain and Batman is a hero. When they are out of their masks they are lovers for they can see that there is something unique about each other. The pain comes when they know that they must then don their masks and fight. Batman Returns is not a film where the good guy gets the woman in the end because their is a rift between the characters that they cannot cross, and they know it. They love each other yet they know that they cannot. Batman Returns, like Batman, is visually spectacular, but with Batman a bad story and characterisation destroyed that. Batman Returns comes back with a brilliant heart wrenching story that the critics in Hollywood cannot understand. Tim Burton tends not to make films that appeal to the masses at Hollywood and one of the reasons is because the dream world that people love to live in is rudely torn open. Here in Batman Returns, the dream world is ripped open with the realisation that the hero cannot always have the girl. He couldn't relate to Vicky Vale, and this is brought out here, and he cannot have Catwoman, because she is a villain and the hero must defeat the villain. Burton has created a brilliant dilemma here and this dilemma makes American heads hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute thrill-fest from beginning to end!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton went for a much more darker, creepier and serious approach to the "Batman" series and what we got was an absolute blockbuster!. He did a superb job with "Batman", and now he has done an even better job with this amazing sequel.In the prologue a wealthy couple have a deformed baby, and because they can't handle it they throw the baby in to the lake nearby, some years later... Crimes have been occurring around Gotham City, involving a group of Circus Freaks, than the city calls Batman (Michael Keaton) to stop the ongoing and escalating crimes. A local businessmen named Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) forms an alliance with the leader of the Circus Freaks, a man named Oswald Cobblepot (Danny Devito), who is a deformed man just trying to fit in to the real world, and Max tries to help him by making them colleagues, but when Max's assistant Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) discovers he's a evil businessmen she tries to leave the building but Max catches her, and shoves her out of the nearby window, she later becomes Catwomen, and wants revenge on Max for what he did, Batman is framed for things and is now believed to be just another evil villain, and than Batman tries to take down the the evil team...All the actors do a perfect job in their roles, Michael Keaton is always great and will always be my favorite "Batman" of the whole series and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman was a perfect choice by Tim Burton, Danny Devito plays his part well, he really pulled it off,it is really over-acting at it's finest, Christopher Walken was great as the slimy evil businessmen Max Shreck, which his name is a reference to the first 'Dracula' movie, 'Nosferatu', because the actor that played the vampire was named 'Max Shreck'.The atmosphere of the film was perfect, dark, gloomy, perfect for a "Batman" film, the script must have been written really well, because the film always keeps you interested and it never drags or becomes corny it just stays as Tim Burton Wanted it.This film it for any good action lover, it's not to be taken very seriously, hardcore "Batman" fans will not be disappointed, so if you haven't seen it, go rent it, buy it, it's an absolute blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that Tim Burton likes snow so much, because it snows in almost all Tim Burton movies. Owing to the set design and art direction, you may want to settle down in The Gotham City. However, of course the city is not pleasant always. The gloomy atmosphere, evil Max Shreck who does not know the value of his sweet, sensitive and too polite secretary, instead hates her and The Penguin who tries to ruin Batman's reputation, for example there is a Batmobile sequence, a nightmare for a child. Briefly, Burton gets you stroll in a city that is perilous but also wonderland. Batman is almost in every scene, not Bruce Wayne, Batman. I don't want to compare this with Nolan's movies, but just want to say a few things about both. This is the darkest Batman movie so far by the way. We see daylight very rarely. Batman encounters with Catwoman and Penguin many times and they square accounts with each other which is very important. Remember Two Face character's screen time in The Dark Knight. In the first action scene, we see Batmobile's tricks and want to have it as usual. In Tim Burton's Batman movies, the design of Batmobile is very stylish and appealing, despite my favorite is the one in the original animation series. You know, in Nolan's movies, they made a tank that kills the magic. The attack of the bats? Better planned and better directed than Batman Begins. The camera angles and the chaos in this scene are great. In The Dark Knight, people watched an uninspiring final fight between Batman and Joker and Joker's biggest plans were detonating two ships. In Batman Returns, yes, some people explode some places, but interesting, moreover the film has much more. Michelle Pfeiffer. Tim Burton is interested in details such as the appearances of the characters, their personalities, belongings, costumes and actions. At the beginnings, we see Selina's luminous house. She is a woman who is lonely, neglected, not well-cared for herself and waits for his prince. While observing this character, we don't think that she is a clich character we have watched a lot of alike ones, may be because of Pfeiffer (and her acting), may be Burton's meticulous player direction, may be both. Moreover, Catwoman is not a typical character, she seems that she is a feminist, but in a scene, she injures a girl after rescuing her. It seems that she hates men, but she shows interest in Batman and also Bruce Wayne. Everyone knows that she was not comfortable in her costume, but remember pain brings victory :) Catwoman looks great in the movie. Danny De Vito with one of the most realistic, so one of the best make-ups ever made. It is impossible to believe that he is Danny De Vito. The scene he eats raw fish, the scene he drives his toy car and the scene he ambushes Catwoman are my favorites. All these things, details are not childish at all, even if they are for some people. Returning to Penguin, he is a clich villain who hates humanity and whose purpose is destroying the city, killing all the people, but again, Tim Burton does not let us say clich. With his multifarious weird accessories, weapons and actions, he is a character who is interpreted by Burton in great detail like Catwoman, Joker or Batman himself. Burton is like a detail expert. More than one enemy in a movie. This should not been a problem, but when Sam Raimi failed in Spider-Man 3 according to many people including me, then filmmakers and directors have been started to be afraid of doing that. Tim Burton allows enough time for both of the enemies and this works perfectly. We get to know their personalities, but also we watch them in many action scenes and still there are other characters and other stories like Max Shreck or we witness to Bruce Wayne's life, his relationships or the candidacy of Penguin and the effect he creates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply, a wonderful blending of evil clashing with evil clashing with would-be 'just' to produce an interesting character piece on top of a high octane ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Burton's revisiting of the Batman franchise following his 1989 escapades, he delivers a film better than the first, in that it is more mature and spreads out to accommodate the progressions of its three predominant characters. In being given more to do, Burton essentially produces a film that is of a higher quality; doubly able to deliver on fronts of character as well as pay close enough attention to the power struggle going on within the place its set, as corrupt business'; faux politicians and sociopathic civilian inhabitants of Gotham City seem to vie with one another under the careful watch of the film's lonely, somewhat socially inept, billionaire protagonist Bruce Wayne, al Batman.The film will see a variety of characters, three of which are bound in not only their power struggle but also by way of having their names linked to the animal kingdom, interact and form respective bonds as the future of a bustling city hangs in the balance. Two of the film's four central characters are monsters, one a slick and handsome business tycoon named Max Shreck (Walken) with the other a foul, thrice-decade sewer inhabitant named The Penguin (De Vito). This, as the two that complete the quartet struggle with their own issues of violent mask and costume-clad alter-egos which clash with quiet, lonesome and restrained 'by day' personas in Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michelle Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle/Catwoman.The film begins with a grandeur and quiet frightening opening, that of a disfigured baby being born and consequently disposed of by the parents, a nasty sequence in which they head out into Gotham City park in the dead of night avoiding contact with other parents of newborns and tossing the kid over a bridge into a canal. As we watch it float down the various waterways which lead to the sewers, the camera lingers on this baby's cot as we observe it through long pipes and steel barred drain entrances as it drifts, seemingly harmlessly, down the rivers of the city and into the sewers. We are given time to ponder to ourselves what foul, household cat eating beast lies inside. When get a first glimpse of the creature in its adult years, it is by way of an expressionistic shadow, furthering a sense of the uncanny.Indeed, many years later Max Shreck sits in a conference room delivering a talk to some of his business cohorts. His business, simply entitled 'Shreck's', has its HQ based in a high-rise building amidst the others, looming ominously over Gotham; his company's logo on the very top, spinning around and around insinuating the power in the numerous directions the company has in the holding of its power over the city. This, as models of the same logo lie strewn around other Shreck infused buildings. The logo is of a smiling animal, but there is a degree of unsettlement in its features, most certainly echoing what the owner of the organisation is like and has in store for those that dwell in the city ? like Shreck, it is a face that seems to mean well but whose true intentions are much more sinister.Working for him is Selina Kyle, an individual who makes it very obvious she lucks out on men and life in general. Upon being present during Shreck's talk, she attempts to join in with the suit-clad, ego driven businessmen in making a suggestion but is promptly put back in her place with a cruel put-down from Shreck plus a statement which enforces her domesticisation, despite her shortcomings, in that she makes "a Hell of a cup of coffee". Kyle maintains a seemingly odd relationship with her mother by way of the messages she leaves on her answering machine, while the numerous stuffed animals and child's toys scattered around her room maintain the odd aura. When a chance event leads her back to Shreck's office, she accidentally dominates her surroundings by way of ingenuity in cracking Shreck's password to some top secret files; files that reveal acts of a criminal nature ? the consequent punishment for this act of attempting to 'become big' within the office environment is death, instigated by Shreck. Essentially, an event that tips her over the edge and by way of some alley cats; the uncanny rejecting of her previous image as well as a little black magic; becomes the powerful and somewhat man hating creature of Catwoman.The Penguin, in setting up a false rescue of the mayor's child, ascends to the surface with Shreck as his companion when a blackmail plan arises. What you flush, Penguin flaunts ? an idea of things coming back to haunt you when you don't rid your life of them correctly. Despite having this pointed out to him, Shreck makes a similar mistake by only assuming Kyle to be dead when he attempts to kill her, only for her to return and cause chaos. Penguin embarks on a mayoral campaign after winning over the city as this myth becomes reality, but while everyone is fooled, Wayne isn't and there's a superb scene in which Penguin goads Batman for having a direct approach in conversation despite hiding beneath a mask ? there's a moment of realisation when Batman makes it known he's guessed what Penguin's up to, and that he too has a mask on in the sense he isn't the person he says he is, despite, again, the direct approach in reaching out to all the inhabitants of the city. The film's blending of character with a distinct sense of dread as these power-mad people threaten to consume an already bleak looking world actually comes across as quite interesting as certain images of a disturbing nature and individual scenes of menace keep it grounded from reaching too far out to children. The film is to date, of all the contemporary Batman films, my favourite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Returns" is why Burton wasn't welcome back for the third installment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first, but not best, follow up to the successful "Batman" includes two villains: Catwoman (Pfeiffer) and an unnecessary hideous rendition of The Penguin (DeVito). Keaton puts the cape on a second time for a wonderfully meek Batman/Bruce Wayne. Director Tim Burton, however, appears to be more interested in doing things the way he wants, instead of even attempting to continue a good story. The first was a darker and realistic take on a superhero that most be associated Adam West with ? but the darkness and reality of the 1989 film worked well. Here, however, Burton tries to make "Returns" darker, uglier and less realistic. Instead of The Penguin being a beak-nosed mobster who wears a tuxedo, he's a mutated human living in the sewer. Instead of Catwoman being everybody's favorite anti-hero, she's wicked enough to be the main villain. Instead of Billy Dee Williams reprising his role as Harvey Dent, he's replaced with Christopher Walken as the evil Max Shreck ? a new character who looks more like a mad scientist than a corrupt businessman. Even the art design of Gotham City is significantly different and less believable than the first. Burton completely ruined the wonderful world he made in the previous film. Danny Elfman's score is the only thing this and the first film are equal at; everything else is significantly inferior. A huge disappointment.** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cast your mind back to the scorching summer of 1989. Remember what a huge deal Tim Burton's Batman was? Those restricted set-reports! That massive press campaign! That Prince soundtrack! 'Batmania' they called it.However, this writer also remembers a conversation between two girls at a bus stop, slathered with that ubiquitous black and yellow poster, a week after it came out. "Saw that the other day." "Wossit like?" "Bit boring." History hasn't been particularly kind to Batman (less so to Prince's score. Wither 'Lemon Crush'?) Nevertheless, it did generate $750 million worth of merchandise which meant sequel time.Burton hadn't originally signed up for a follow-up (ah, such innocent times), describing such a prospect as "a dumbfounded idea" and even admitting the original was, yes, "a little boring at times". Any subsequent film would have to be treated like "another Batman movie altogether".And so it was: without stinting on the pathos (Danny DeVito's Penguin) or sex appeal (Michelle Pfeiffer's astoundingly horny bad girl Catwoman), Burton would give full vent to his German Expressionist tendencies (see Christopher Walken's second-tier baddie Max Shrek) and cartoonish indulgences. This was more like it! Pre-Batman Begins, Batman Returns is the best Batman film in the canon. No Prince, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman returns, should we care? Yes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More free to apply his personal vision when compared to the first Batman, Tim Burton turns the Batman mythos to a feverish stylized Gothic fairy-tale, on whose core lies poisonous cynicism and pessimism.Gotham City rots. It's business elite sinks in a ruthless corruption and manipulates the political system at will. It's citizens are scared and weak-minded pawns. Catwoman is basically a repressed and suppressed suburban housewife/ working-woman. Batman is a lone and slightly sad, but heroic, figure. The Penguin is ultimately the most tragic figure of all - a direct result of society's anthropophagy.Tim Burton sinks himself in this Gotham abyss, turning it to an almost attractive d&#x3b9;cor, whose heroes let themselves pinch and scrape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Batman film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not necessarily the most successful of the Batman films, this has always been my personal favorite. Despite its chilly Christmas setting, the film was released in the middle of a very hot summer. I was spending some time in Arizona, and going into an air-conditioned theater to watch this frosty film was like a blast of relief. The movie itself combines dark humor and wild visuals, Burton's very best big budget film.Batman (Michael Keaton) does indeed return, with a pair of villains to face this time -- abandoned child Oswald Cobblepot, aka the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the less nefarious and more ambiguous Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). DeVito's Penguin is at the same time less anarchic than Nicholson's Joker from the first film, and more of a threat to Batman because his schemes are more calculated and his political sensibilities more refined. As for the Catwoman, she and Batman strike up a kind of sadistic affair that's paralleled by the hesitant courtship between their alter egos, Bruce Wayne and Selena Kyle.DeVito is an excellent actor and a good choice for the Penguin, but his performance just can't match the kind of charm that Nicholson had in the first film. It's really Pfeiffer's sexy latex-draped Catwoman that makes the film. There's moments of great wit, like when she looks down at her ruined "claw" with an expression that suddenly takes her back to her secretary days (err... "executive assistant"). There's also a nice performance by Christopher Walken (with the rather not-so-subtle homage name of Max Shreck) as a greedy crimelord. He gets more time to develop this outside villain than Jack Palance had in the first one, and brings a lot of moments of great humor to the relationship with the Penguin. You almost start to like him by the end, but his score with the Catwoman must be settled.The theme of the film is, once again, duality -- but it works somewhat better than the first film, because the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is more natural and compelling. I also like the one scene with the Penguin and Batman where Penguin accuses Batman of being jealous, "you're not a real freak." Really great ideas that are well developed in the interplay between these 3 bizarre personas and their alter-egos.As for Burton's direction, it's much more relaxed and distinctive in this film compared to the first one. A new Gotham set was built for Burton on the west coast (the first one was done in England), and the settings and style are more picturesque, dark, and expansive. You can tell that he had just done "Edward Scissorhands" and was really feeling his oats when he did this one, at the top of his game trying to top his previous effort. A lot of people, maybe Jack Nicholson fans, might disagree, but I thought that he got the tone and everything just right for this film. It's not too serious but it's also not too goofy; rather than alternating moments of seriousness and camp we get in the first film, this one has a more consistent tone as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this sequel to Batman, I think it was, like it's predecessor, a great movie. However, I do think it is inferior compared to the first, that's why I give it 8 out of 10.Again, Tim Burton does a good job directing this sequel and Michael Keaton pulls off his performance as Batman, but to me, this movie didn't seem as exciting as the first. Again, I liked the action scenes in the movie and I thought it was great when Selina (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) turned into Catwoman because of her out-of-control behaviour and the way she trashed her house.The reason I think some people say this one is better than the first is because it is more action-packed, which is probably what the comic book is supposed to be. I also thought Danny DeVito looked great as the Penguin and played him very well. To me, this is nearly as good as the first and is also recommended for fans of Batman and DC comics. Shame this was the last of the two movies to be directed by Tim Burton. Joel Schumacher took over for the next two, which I will be watching in the next two weeks and Commenting on them. Good luck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Bat-film before TDK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If we want to talk darkness, sadness, and awesome characterization, Batman Returns is a film any bat-fan should watch. In my opinion, this is probably the most underrated and ignored bat-film to date - perhaps being surrounded by the original Batman (which, while a worthy film, doesn't truly give us the dark angle), and the two sequels which were a circus act.'Returns also has the best music I've heard in a bat-film yet (yes, even above TDK's). The only reason it gets a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 is the far-stretched Penguin story, and a lack of action awesomeness I wanted from a fictional film. I wanted gadgets, jumps, leaps, martial arts, etc. This film raises expectations with some sequences, and the action just stops abruptly with an anti-climax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A terrific reply by Burton to those who thought that 'Batman' was all style no substance. Here we have a genuinely gripping story and one of the best female performances of the decade- by Michelle Pfeiffer. She is positively luminous as Catwoman and sizzles on screen. The Penguin, played by an OTT Danny deVito is less successful by comparison.Batman Returns is surreal and menacing in equal measure. Upping the weirdo quotient is Chris Walken, who alas has little to do. The camera-work and production design are an improvement on the first film. This film has both style and substance. Only in the loud climax does Burton fall prey to commercial instincts and substitutes razzmatazz for action. Also note that the film is simply not suitable for younger children and most of its themes will simply go over their heads.Bottomline:9/10 Brilliant Pfeiffer in vastly superior sequel</fullReview>

Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman in my opinion was PERFECT!! She brought a dangerous yet sexy element to this character, a performance that would be very hard for a different actress to pull off. Danny Devito also gave the performance of a lifetime as the Penguin funny and sinister this too was the perfect choice for this role!

		<shortDescription>Batman returned with style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After first Tim Burton 'Bat' movie we all expected second one to be if not better then at least equal to its predecessor. While "Batman" is mostly one man show (Jack Nicholson) coupled with capable direction of Burton; this one full field my every expectation and I think it is even better then the first and holds a nominee for best Batman movie ever made. Let me tell you why..."Batman Returns" has a great story and every character is elaborated to tiny details. Batman's enemies are Penguin and Catwoman and by entrance of new and interesting characters "Batman Returns" gained only pluses. Here, I must say that all the cast done their job with no stains. Michael Keaton had tougher role then in first one and he passed the test. As always Batman movies is as good as the villain is. Danny DeVito in role of Penguin is amazing, just like Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman who had acting transformation from boring secretary to a deadly Batman opponent and love. If only makers of the "Catwoman" and Halle Berry watched what real Catwoman should be, maybe they wouldn't make one of the worst movies ever. To round this excellent casting I will mention Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. Classic staff and here Walken is memorable.But what movie would Batman be without dark genius, and my favorite director, Tim Burton. Burton created Gotham city that none of the directors after managed to copy (we've all witnessed on how low branches Schumacher took it and how Nolan tried to raise it from dead with success). So dark, creepy and atmospheric. He plays with light in scene where Walken decides to get rid off Pfeiffer, he creates mean Penguin with classic Burton bright side (benneath all he's a good person that is always abandoned from people). There he reminds me of Edward Scissorhands, another Burton's 'child'. So till now you've realized that I like this movie, cause it's a comic brought to life thanks to Tim Burton and his never ending creativity. He managed to round the picture with no holes and if you don't understand Burton's work then you probably won't be able to enjoy in this Batman fully. Cause this one has Burton signature all over it and now it's official that Batman returned with style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as Good as the First!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was just as good as the original Batman. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and this time he has to stop an evil penguin(played by Danny DeVito)from taking over Gotham City. Once again, the evil people or animals were just as sinister as the first movie. I thought that the suicidal penguins were a good idea, but that idea will not appeal to animal lovers. An all-star cast led by Keaton and DeVito were one of the best casts of the late 80's. Danny Elfman created another score with his usual, excellent feeling. The feeling of the film once again fills you with trill and excitement of what is going to happen. This is once again another Tim Burton spectacle. This movie is great to see! I give this film a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, in my opinion, was the best Batman movie yet made, because it achieved the right balance between realism and insanity. Batman Begins tried to find realistic explanations for the freakishness behind its heroes and villains. The world of a comic book hero should not be deconstructed so. Mystery and fantasy should be encouraged, because it makes things so much less predictable. It also allows the creative art director to go absolutely bonkers!!! The Gotham City that Tim Burton creates, projects the world of the comic book onto the big screen with complete faithfulness. Floating somewhere between 40's Chicago and 90's New York, its mass of high rise structures provide a glittering backdrop to the predominantly night time scenes, in which silence is torn apart by flame juggling clowns and psychedelic carnival freaks, a mad business tycoon who wants to rule the city and a vengeful seductress in skintight black leather. All driven by a stellar cast who clearly love the saga and enjoy every line given to their characters. One thing that can be said about the cast is that the primary focus is completely stolen from Batman by the villains. However, the magic used by De Vito and Pfeifer to portray their characters Penguin and Catwoman is so damn alluring I can't see it as a bad thing.The tone oscillates zestfully between child's play and adult fun; the conventional quips are loaded with slick wit and raunchy innuendo, and hearty laughs are followed by harsh violence. It's a roller-coaster, a guilty pleasure. I might agree that Batman Returns is a little more icing than sponge, but when the icing tastes so good, who cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've decided to give you mine opinion on all the old Batman movies. Starting with Batman and ending with Batman &amp; Robin.This movie, Batman Returns, is the second Batman film made by Burton and, this is sad, the last of the old movie to be worth the money. After this there were no good Batman films until Nolan and Goyer decided to make their version of The Dark Knight. With the Joker gone, this film starts to focus on the character it should focus on: Batman. That said, it still gives all the characters a moment to shine. Batman faces two of his deadliest foes: Catwoman and the Penguin, along with the corrupt businessman Max Shreck (named after the guy who played Nosferatu). The cast is great. DeVito was born to play Penguin, Walkens character is the real villain and Michelle Pfeiffer is hot and purrfect as Catwoman (pardon the pun). Once again Burton got the setting right. Gotham during Christmas is a wonderful background to have during this story, that in fact is better then the 89 version. In many things, this is the better Burton film.Then again, on the more important parts, this is the not so good version. Once again Burton got the characters all wrong. Catwoman is, if not true to the original, still good though. She turns into a thief/vigilante after, like the Joker would put it, she had a really bad day. She still is the grey part in Batmans black and white world and she actually makes him love her. So she works and therefor she's okay. The Penguinis was changed radically. He has become a freak who lives in the sewers and is the leader of an ex-circus crew. But, after all, Penguin never was a good villain to begin with. The worst thing is that they took one of the plots, there's more than one, from the old Batman series with Adam West. The Penguin runs for mayor?! WTF is going on? The Penguins other plot is way better but spoiled because of lack of time. That is sad.Still, the ending is great and it is still an enjoyable movie. I'll have it in my collection along with Batman and the new Batman films by Nolan. But Schumachers movies is better of forgotten. "Merry Christmas, Alfred. Good will towards men... and women."

		<fullReview>to me this sequel to "Batman" is as good as the first,except for one minor complaint.i'll get into that later.first,the good.this movie improves i think,on the fighting scenes.i think they were a bit more spectacular.i also think the suit looked a bit different,darker maybe,which i liked.Michael Keaton is good again as the the title character/Bruce Wayne.this movie, while generally staying dark like it's predecessor,occasionally takes on a more magical,almost whimsical tone,which is not a bad thing.this time there is more than one villain.first,there's Danny Devito as the Penguin,and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman.Devito is great as the Penguin,clearly relishing his turn as a psychopath.nothing wrong with that performance.but here is the one small complaint i have:the look of the Penguin itself.to me,it just seems like you could tell Devito had padding on to look fatter.this annoyed me a bit.Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman is terrific,a dream to many males out there.she certainly looked good in that leather outfit.there is also a bit more chaos in this one,a few more explosions,but not so much that it becomes ridiculous.if it weren't for how not quite real the Penguin's bulk looked,this movie would rate as high as the first.however,instead of 10/10*,this film still gets a very strong 9/10 from me.</fullReview>

It also has some fun comic moment in it as well.Michelle pfeiffer steals the show as Catwoman/ selina kyle. She plays the dual role to perfection. She has some fantastic lines and did most of her own stunts. Micheal keaton and her have good chemistry. Danny devito is also good as the penguin. If you want to see a dark batman this is definitely for you. Micelle pfeiffer is at her sexy sensual best. She received an Oscar nomination for love field many of her peers left that she should have received it for this:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, Oh Why Didn't Michelle Pfeiffer Wear A See-Through Catwoman Outfit?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is the burning question of this movie, and Catwoman and Penguin are the most complex villains in these BATMAN movies. Unlike the Joker, you see that Catwoman and Penguin were once put upon human beings before something happened to them to make them lose it. Michael Keaton reprises his roll as Batman and, as in the first movie, does an excellent job in conveying his inscrutable dark brooding intensity. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman? Excuse me while I take a cold shower. Danny DeVito does almost as well as Burgess Meredith in his roll as the Penguin. Personally, I thought the Penguin was always the smartest and most dangerous of all the Batman villains. Again, we have a good story going and it's up to Batman to save the day. Very well done. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the best movies ever! I wish Burton had directed the next Batman movies instead of Schumacher, because Batman Returns is not ridiculously shallow or campy like the Schumacher Batman films (though Batman Forever was somewhat okay).The strength of the movie comes from the characters' psychological depth, Danny Elfman's music,and the visual look and atmosphere of the movie. All the actors were BRILLIANT; they did a really wonderful job and should have received Oscar and awards and stuff. However, at times, it seems that the plot line is not exactly consistent. For example, Max Shreck wants to drain the energy from Gotham City, but this is not given much attention to later in the movie. Fortunately, this did not in any way ruin the movie for me.The Penguin was rejected by his parents and thrown into the river. In return, he plans to murder the first-born children of Gotham. There are Biblical references in his storyline, such as those just mentioned. Selina Kyle turns from a mousy person to the confident and independent Catwoman and unleashes her repressed rage. Throughout the movie, her mind starts to deteriorate (symbolically, along with her costume).The Penguin and Catwoman are characters that you feel very sympathetic for. Their actions may not be moral, but you feel sorry for them and their twisted minds. It's very interesting that the true villain in Batman Returns is Max Shreck, who is the most normal of the three villains, which shows that a normal, everyday, and common human being can be a selfish cruel manipulator.A second interesting idea is the theme of duality. There's Bruce and Batman, Selina and Catwoman, politician Cobblepot and Penguin, and publicly popular Shreck and metaphoric vampire. One of my favorite lines is when Bruce says to Selina, "I mistook me for someone else."Another very interesting idea is that the three villains mirror parts of the title hero's psyche. The three of them show what Bruce/Batman would be like if he had gone the wrong way. One of the characters' lines is, "To destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates the most. Namely, us." Penguin is a twisted version of Bruce. They are both orphans. Like Bruce, Penguin wants revenge for the loss of a normal childhood, but he unleashes his anger on innocent people. Selina is fed up with the injustice in her life and wears the mask of Catwoman to do something about it. She becomes a more destructive version of the vigilante Batman and strikes back at society. Max Shreck is a business man like Bruce, but is very dishonest, selfish, and manipulative in order to achieve his goals. In the debate of Max's proposed power plant, Bruce represents the good side.All this character depth shows how brilliant and thought-out this movie is. I wish Burton had directed the third movie. He would have done an excellent job with Riddler and Two-Face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been apart of all sequels to go bigger and better in an attempt to surpass or even match the original film. While many fail and fade away, their are those few sequels that hit all the right buttons and not surpass, but leaves the original behind. Tim Burton's return to the Batman franchise, takes it to an all new level.The first Batman, a classic in its own rights, is a dark, Gothic tale of revenge. The visual aesthetic has a distinct tone; dark heavy shadows with deep pastels. Batman Returns shows Burton evolving and changing Batman's world. Batman Returns is a dark, romantic fairy tale; with a more monochromatic style working to this tale. Returns does follow steps like all sequels with hard challenges, more villains, fights are more stylised and happen more often, but Returns goes even further to bring a more interesting story.Written by Daniel Waters, Batman Returns is better written and digs deeper into it's characters and reveals more layer in Bruce and Batman. Bruce still grapples with his parents death, but more focus on his love life and the problem he faces with his alter ego. Batman himself become more humane, falling for the wrong woman and hitting public despise. The villains themselves follow a different pattern. Penguin starts off as an animal with a hidden agenda, but he develops as he also tries to work into humanity and for people to accept who he is, and the forgiveness of his parents abandoning him as a child. Catwoman is one of the most interesting villains, as a sexy femme fatale. While she has a motive of revenge against Shreck, her ultimate goal is fun and exerting herself from her repressed and empty life.Doning the black cape again, Michael Keaton brings an even stronger performance as Bruce and Batman. Danny DeVito is amazing as Penguin, really bringing an ugly side to Penguin, not just visually. Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy and sassy as Selina/Catwoman. Christopher Walken is greatly vulgar as Shreck.One of the few sequels to surpass the original, Batman Returns is a fun dark tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would you like a rocket-firing penguin for Christmas?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my continuing review of the Batman films, I recently saw Batman Returns again. I believe that it is one of the better comic-book films I have seen, but it is really bogged down by some issues that cause the film to drag.Basically, the film is about the emergence of two new villains, The Penguin (played by Danny DeVito), a vengeful sewer dweller who wants to kill the children of Gotham in revenge for what his parents did to him as a child, and Catwoman (played by Michelle Pfeiffer), a former secretary who inexplicably turns to a life of crime when she is thrown out of a window by her boss, Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken). And Batman? Christ, who cares. He barely has a purpose in the film anyway, other than to stop the two of them and have a date with Selina Kyle.I said it before in my review of the first film, and I'll say it again here. The film focuses more on the villains than the actual title character, and that is not a good thing by any means. If the characters had any sort of interesting back-story, it might be better, but the way these two come to be villains is just ridiculous. Selina Kyle gets pushed out of a window by her boss, falls many stories, then gets "licked" back to life by cats (no, I'm not kidding), and THEN she proceeds to tear up her apartment, make a ridiculous-looking suit made up of spare leather, and suddenly she knows how to do back-flips and fighting maneuvers? A little explanation would have been nice.The way the Penguin is characterized in the comic books is interesting, because he is a crime boss, and poses a continuing threat to the safety of Gotham. Here, we find out that he was born a freak, his parents threw him into a sewer, and then he was raised by penguins, who supposedly taught him how to read, write and commit acts of crime? And what was his plan? To become the mayor of Gotham? Did he even have any political skills of any kind? The fact that he has become a literal penguin only serves to provide fodder for bad jokes that appear throughout the film (notably, the incidents with fish being offered to him, so he can make a complete buffoon of himself).It seems that the plans these two villains come up with are incredibly stupid and ill-prepared. First, the penguin attacks a Christmas-tree lighting ceremony, apparently to kidnap Max Shreck, and then use him to help him become the Mayor Of Gotham. In addition, he kidnaps the Ice Princess and has Catwoman hold her for ransom, then he frames Batman for her murder (even though Batman can't even be caught by the cops anyway since he sticks mostly to rooftops). THEN, when his mayoral plan doesn't work out, he gets a guy to kidnap a bunch of kids and ride through town on a slow-moving vehicle, perfect for a counter-attack. Finally, he gets a number of penguins to walk into the middle of Gotham City (which is strangely deserted), and fire off a bunch of rockets, which, in the end, we came to find out don't really do all that much damage anyway. And what did Selina Kyle do? She blows up a department store, stalks Batman around and gets shot numerous times before electrocuting her boss. Really smart planning there.Michael Keaton gives a better performance in this film than the previous one, if only because he has shed the geeky, shy demeanor and become more forceful and assertive in his role as a protector. Likewise, the rest of the cast gives good performances as well.I realize that in a comic book film, events may be exaggerated, but the physics at work in this film are unbelievable. First we are asked to believe that a woman who's been pushed out of a window can survive a thirty-story fall, when a woman pushed in a similar situation gets killed instantly. Then, we are asked to believe that Batman carries magical metal wings that all of a sudden take shape from his cloth cape whenever he desires it. Finally, we are asked to think that a woman who gets shot several times, then gets partially electrocuted, can survive just because she's dressed in a catsuit. It's these sorts of situations that serve to stretch the limits of the film.In addition, the whole film seems to take place withing a time-span of three or four days, which in that time, sees Batman getting discredited by a guy who has just come from nowhere looking like a penguin, a woman making up a catsuit, blowing up a department store and following her crush around, The Penguin running for the mayor position and failing, and having the time to "take in the sights of Gotham", plan all his operations and execute them, AND crash a dinner party. Now that's what I call time management!Bottom Line: In the end, though, the movie is enjoyable for what it is, if you overlook the ridiculous villains, threadbare plot and the lack of Batman himself. I give this film a 6 out of 10, and while it is one of the better films, you're probably better off watching the ever more dependable Batman Begins, if you want to see some more credible villains in action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As cool as the first one &amp; Tim Burton's first sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sequel to the successful BatMan movie of 1989. It's still directed by Tim Burton, and Micheal Keaton is still BatMan.In this one a new villain is about to crawl from the sewers with a plan to take over Gotham City. He's a freak of nature, a short guy with the instincts of a penguin. And that's what name he goes by "Pennguin". He was abandon by his parents due to his appearance and the only family he has are the penguins and ex-circus performers. The Pennguin attempts to become mayor by making Gotham believe he is a trust worthy gentleman who just wants to finds out who who parents were and what his name is. Will this bird guy get what he wants? Not only that but BatMan also has another problem to deal with. Another new villain has made her appearance in the crime wave and justice system of Gotham. Her name is CatWoman who is a woman with the instincts of a cat. It's undetermined whether she's friend or foe.With 2 psychopathic characters running around Gotham. It'll be interesting on how BatMan will be able to restore peace to the city.This sequel is as great as the first one. Danny DeVito is excellent as the Pennguin and Mechille Phipper is great as CatWoman. And I highly recommend it to the Micheal Keaton/Tim Burton/BatMan/Danny Devito Fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, perverse, engaging but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman returns is a strange film definitely worth a watch for any Tim Burton fan. The movie succeeds in its artistic presentation of a cruel dark perverse world, where in the night bizarre things happen. Keaton was the perfect batman but I believe he is wasted in this movie, through Tim Burtons decision to focus primarily on the villains. The scenes he is given he plays well but his dark physcosis is tackled in a somewhat comical way this time round.Burtons art work is great in this film with the designs for the abandoned Antarctic zoo, and city hall. Once again Danny Elfman provides a brilliant dark Gothic neo-classical score.Devito has received mixed reception for his performance as the penguin, he attempts to be larger than life, but he fails in producing a performance as entertaining as Jack Nicholsons the Joker. At many points in the film he is annoying.Michelle Pfeifer does what she can with the Selina Kyle/cat-woman character. Her best moments are when she recovers from an attempted murder and loses complete control trashing her apartment.Christopher Walken is probably the best thing in this film, his character is eccentric engaging and strangely charming. No one could've been better in this role than him, he has such a persuasive intriguing speaking tone, ideal for his manipulating and ca jading of the Penguin, when Christopher Walken speaks he subtly forces you to listen, this is the sign of a great actor.However this film fails in its lack of plot depth, it looks stylish on the surface like all of Tim Burtons movie, but the plot is a little sparse and thrown around. Burtons fundamental flaw as a director is that he focuses on style over substance. In saying this Burtons dark representation of Gotham used in both his films is perfect for the dark knight to inhabit.This film is not up to the standard of the first batman, primarily because Tim Burton was given too much artistic licence, so that he could give the film a complete Tim Burton stylisation.But yet another fault is that, if you decide to make a dark film ,there is no place for cringing lines such as "eat floor high in fibre". All in all Batman returns is the second best batman film, but no as Good as the original which places comic book themes in a dark but realistic world, this film places comic book themes in a dark but ridiculous and somewhat perverse world. This is what turned the masses away from it. An art film is never a commercial success, but like many other art films this has achieved cult status.Batman returns is an okay film that could've been much better if Tim Burton had been controlled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns is a great sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is not the sequel people expected. That could be because director Tim Burton was never too crazy about doing a sequel. In a way it is obvious that he wanted to do something completely different. The film was shot in LA (original in England), Anton Furst's Oscar-Winning sets were replaced by Bo Welch, and the costume has gone through a drastic change. As I write the changes I am also writing the flaws. I prefer Furst's sets, shooting in England, and the original costume. Everything else, however, I think is awesome! Tim Burton is a great artist and I feel like Batman Returns is a great work of art. I am not going to spoil it for you by giving away all the symbolisms. The joy of watching Batman Returns is figuring out everything Burton hid under the surface.RATING: 4 (****) out of (****)For the curious: The plot of the film is that Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) is a corrupt business man who uses the Penguin to recall the mayor. However, the Penguin has his own agendas. As for Catwoman, that is a tragedy you have to witness for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misguided, decent sequel to Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can somewhat understand why this film is cherished so much. This film is the darkest installment of the Burton/Schumacher franchise. The movie has a star cast and Michelle Pfeiffer gives a memorable performance as exotic, seductive, but vile Catwoman. The great Danny Elfman music is all still there. Danny Devito and Christopher Walken bring decent comic relief in their roles as villains.The movie suffers from a silly plot devices and rhetoric , which is ironic considering this is supposedly the "darkest, most serious" film in the franchise. Yes, its dark, but in a very superficial, stylish way. The film never aroused in emotion of despair or sympathy for any of the characters because it was filled with ridiculous premises. There is more violence in this film, unnecessary death, even some minor blood, but especially near the end, the violent conflicts never seemed to have a point.The big problem with this movie is that its apparent Tim Burton wasn't sure where to take the character of Batman after the first film. Burton essentially focused on making fantastic Burtonized Gotham City and Burtonized villains. Whereas the first movie was somewhat realistic, gritty and a decent Batman film, this movie makes Gotham City more surreal and goth fairy-tail. Burton changes the origins and motivations of the two major villains (The Penguin and Catwoman) DRASTICALLY from their comic counterparts. The Penguin is changed from a deformed, calculating, crime boss into a genetically altered, naive, and angry mutant who lives in the sewers and never knew his parents (who are human). Catwoman's transformation and origin is almost as absurd. Their motivations are so dimensional, Catwoman is reduced to a simplistic poster boy for feminism.The first half of the movie has a decent plot, but after a semi-climax, the movie spins out of control wrecklessly and nothing makes much sense. For all the flack Batman &amp; Robin got for being campy, this movie has the Penguin......talking to and commanding an army of penguins with rockets on their back. I couldn't believe I was seeing this in a what some considers "the Best Batman movie of all time". There are too many convenient plot devices and inconsistencies throughout the ending. The other minor characters from the first film are gone or do little to almost nothing in this film.Keaton's Batman is still good and convincing. What's bad though is that the film is even less about Batman waging a war on crime than the previous film, and more about angry, unloved, or ugly people (the hero and the villains) never finding happiness or love that they deserve. Burton definitely imprinted his artistic, fantastic, Gothic but dreary style throughout this film, for better or worse. Thus, this isn't really a superhero film, but a typical Gothic "nobody loves me, so I have to wreck havoc" film. Batman's dedication to fighting crime is ambiguous in this movie and I don't feel he becomes a stronger or a resolute character in the end.The movie is decent, there are some good action scenes, and as said before Pfieffer is awesome and attractive in this film. Christopher Walken is sometimes funny and Danny Devito has some good scenes. I think the dark nature of the movie has successfully hid the fact that this movie is just as campy and silly as the next two sequels. In some aspects, Batman Forever is even better at somethings, such as characterizing Bruce Wayne. This film has little to no direction, point, and is more stylized art over substance.</fullReview>

Danny being the Penguin of course.Having defeated the Joker, Batman now faces the Penguin - a warped and deformed individual who is intent on being accepted into Gotham society. Crooked businessman Max Schreck is coerced into helping him become Mayor of Gotham and they both attempt to expose Batman in a different light. Earlier however, Selina Kyle, Max's secretary, is thrown from the top of a building and is transformed into Catwoman - a mysterious figure who has the same personality disorder as Batman. Batman must attempt to clear his name, all the time deciding just what must be done with the Catwoman.If you watch this you'll notice two things. One, the Penguins nastiness and two Catwomans playful antics. Trust me this sequel just didn't meet the advances the first one had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns with a darker edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman released in 1989 breathed new life into the enigmatic crime-fighter. With a brilliant over-the-top performance by Jack Nicholson as the Joker and beautifully dark set-designs that captured the true essence of Gotham City, made Batman a huge hit. A sequel was bound to happen and it did in 1992 but did it live up to the expectation of the first Batman?Well, to be honest it comes down to opinion, while the first Batman may be the more popular choice of the two, there's no denying Batman Returns has evolved the Batman story wonderfully and while the first Batman may have aimed at kids and young adults, Batman Returns isn't aimed for kids or going for Box Office millions like the first film. It seems with Batman Returns director Tim Burton had far more influence over this film than the original.Batman Returns is a dark, gripping and almost eerie film that doesn't contain the same atmosphere as the first Batman, Batman Returns is far more darker and the scenery helps suggest this. Gotham city is covered in snow and skyscrapers are fully placed around the city. Although, it's quite stunning to view these great sets, it's almost beautiful in that Tim Burton fashion. Movies like Sleepy Hollow, The Nightmare before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands feature wonderful sets that are amazing to view and with Batman Returns it's no different.Performances in Batman Returns are all very good. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and delivers a far more deeper and darker performance than his earlier performance. Although, in Batman Returns we learn more about Batman, it doesn't mean Keaton makes Batman more acceptable or open, quite the opposite as in Batman Returns the Batman character is less appealing but more compelling in a peculiar way. The reason for this is because of the way Keaton has made the character more concealed with his emotions and makes us want to observe the character more and really watch his reactions. Michelle Phiffer and Danny De Vito give great performances as Batman's duo adversaries. Although neither performance reaches the extent of Nicholson's " The Joker", they still dig into their characters and manage to produce two very good performances that allows the viewer to not only be entertained by Batman's enemies but also be interested in their own story and how the characters evolve throughout the film.Overall, Batman Returns arguably isn't as good as the original but nevertheless still is a very good film and helps reminds us that Batman isn't a colourful and action-packed movie like Spiderman, The Hulk or The X-men, but a far more deeper and dynamic film that stays true to the characters and the story, unlike Batman Forever and Batman and Robin., the following sequels. I personally don't enjoy super-hero movies but with Batman Returns it's different and being a fan of Tim Burton, it's a pleasure to watch his dark and eerie style capture the real essence of Batman in Batman Returns and the snow-filled sets of Batman Returns, I found to be quite amazing and enjoyable to view, vintage Burton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns made the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the four films in the Batman series (I say 4 because I truly do not include the new Batman Begins in that series) Batman Returns had the best story, plot, sub plots and best acting. Michael Keaton returned as a very respectable Batman and Bruce Wayne this time taking on the likes of the grotesque Pengiuin of the sewer played by Danny Devito. Christopher Walken effectively plays a very shrewed and borderline evil business man Max Schreck who will do anything, even kill to get what he wants. The there is Michelle Pfeiffer who plays nerdy, insecure Selina Kyle who is Max Schreck's assistant. Whe she stumbles on his huge devious plan he takes care of her and Catwoman, the best villain in the series is born. Michelle P stole the show for me as the very dark, seductive and sexy Catwoman. Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne are attracted to one another and Batman and Catwoman are attracted to one another. The best subplot of the entire Batman series. Definitely is underrated here at IMDb IMO. It was one of the better films to come out of the 90's. I watch it over and over and never get tired of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One word to sum up the sequel to the 250 million dollar grossing first film Batman, freak show. First lets look at the facts, Burton's odd casting choice I mean Pfeiffer is built for the slim kitty suit, but doesn't quite feel right as Catwoman. DeVito as the fat freak Peguin is no were near as cool as the Joker and there are much better villains to choose from in the Rouge's Gallery. Also I didn't like the trend of paring up two villains because one is enough to focus on. Keaton is the only saving grace of the film and the only person you care about in the movie. Burton almost makes the same movie again, but not as good or fun. At least Elfman's score soars and the themes match the mood of the characters. The one thing that made the movie even worse was that Gotham looked to Burtonish for me and felt like a sideshow and not a city of crime. I look at the movie like this, an art film with Batman in it.The first Batman was new and fresh while Returns has that been there done that feel. Where Spider-Man 2 topped the first one, Returns took the series one step back and for me one step back is to far. As Batman quotes in the movie "Ok now I'm a little worried", worried indeed...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many ways "Batman Returns" is better movie than Tim Burtons previous "Batman". "Batman" wasn't, in my opinion, fully in the hands of Tim Burton, thus it didn't look so much of a Burton film. It had typical Burton's elements in it, but it wasn't so freely his own. "Batman Returns" is fully his to the core and that shows.Visually BR is still a stunning piece of cinema. Gothical Gotham city is drawn beautifully in the front of our eyes while Batman (Michael Keaton) battles against the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Of all the Batman movies (I still haven't seen Batman beyond) Batman Returns has the best and most fitting cast. It's hard to give out anyone who wouldn't fit in their roles.There is some plot holes but in Burtons case they don't really matter that much; he's good in hiding those small errors in the over all atmosphere of his films.I've heard that from the some reason hardcore fans of Batman don't appreciate Burtons vision, but as a person who likes Batman I really can recommend this stunning vision to everyone, because it has style beyond typical comic book adaptations and it really shows what a talented director can make out of a well known character if just given free hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up, Batman Returns was one of my favorite movies as a child. It pains me slightly to watch it today, for what I thought then was flawless, is now rather over-the-top and melodramatic. But the production is beautiful and I will never forget Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. At the time, I thought she was God's greatest, sexiest gift to mankind.Batman's back and instead of one headache, he now has three: the Penguin, Catwoman and Max Schreck.Everything about Batman Returns is about more. More explosions, bad guys, gadgets, decoration. It's all on a grand scale. Unfortunately the script is not up to snuff, but the makeup of the Penguin is excellent, and the costumes are excellent, especially the Catwoman's! I couldn't figure out if Christopher Walken even tried in his character or if he was truly necessary. Thankfully, the Gotham scenery and the other actors' efforts catapult it above ground.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Batman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** out of **** By the time I'm writing this review, I haven't seen Batman Begins (2005) yet, but I can tell that this is the best (or least worse) Batman movie so far. When I watched it yesterday, I kinda of thought it was cool, but it is too absurd at times! Sure this is not only a super-hero movie, but it's also a Tim Burton one. And as far as I'm concerned, Burton sometimes likes to be absurd at his movies. But don't get me wrong! I liked this movie! First of all, the best of it is the Gotham City itself. It's dark and sinister and it fits perfectly with Danny Elfman's score. Actually Elfman's score is another great point! I guess that the best part of the score is when Selina is tearing up her apartment and becomes the Catwoman herself. The score for Batman is great also, but it's more like a heroic score, while the Catwoman's score is more dark, which sure was something I loved! For Pinguin and his clowns, the score becomes a little more silly and childish perhaps, but it's still a great score.For this movie, the story focus now on the Pinyin. There are also other characters like Christopher Walken's one and his son. I loved Christopher Walken, he's as sinister as hell in this one. And Michelle Pfeiffer as the Catwoman! She is truly great, deadly and hot! This is the true Catwoman, not this stupid clown that Halle Berry played recently! I hate that woman with all my guts! There is not much to be said about this movie, unless you spoil some plot twists. All I can say is that Danny Elfman's score is great, the performances are great, the Gotham City great also, and Michael Keaton is sure the best Batman that we ever had. The only problem of this movie is that sometimes it becomes a little silly and too absurd. I don't know how the Pinguin got to live in a sewers that is so beautiful (if you know how to decorate itself, of course), but that's OK anyway. I would make that water, my own private pool instead of the one I, myself, have. But since this is a super-hero movie, we may even tolerate some things. But Spider-Man is sure much more realistic! Well, a taste is a taste....The only one thing I didn't really get is why the Catwoman wants to beat Batman. Maybe I'll post this on the IMDb forum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Burton's prior entry into the series, "Batman Returns" offers us a story of two clashing forces; in one corner, we have the infamous Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton), who fights crime and swears justice in the vast Gotham city; and in the other corner, we are given the Penguin (Danny DeVito), a deformed, mutant man who lives in the sewers and finds companionship in his web-footed friends (penguins).The best performance comes from Pfeiffer, whose perfect portrayal of Catwoman will make her an even bigger star. Pfeiffer displays a lot of range; her early scenes as the weak Selina Kyle are funny and even touching, convincingly capturing Selina's frustration and emotional repression. At the same time, Pfeiffer manages to make Catwoman a believable tigress, showing impressive skills with athletic martial arts maneuvers in her slinky, skintight black rubber cat suit. With her seductive walk and sultry phone sex voice, Pfeiffer has perfected the good girl gone bad act. DeVito's portrayal of the Penguin is deliriously over-the-top, but the demonic insanity he brings to the role ads a sense of unpredictability to what could easily have become a one-note performance. Christopher Walken also puts in a good performance.Batman Returns is a better film than its predecessor, serving up more action and thrills. Burton keeps things moving at a swift pace, never losing the viewer's interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was trashed by many people when it came out in 1992, and suffered a huge backlash from parents who complained that the movie was too dark for their children. I disagree, because this movie was better than the first Batman, and much better than the ones that came after it.The acting was the best of the four films, with Michael Keaton giving his strongest performance yet, along with Michelle Pheiffer. She was terrific as Catwoman, and should've been in the new movie instead of Halle Berry. The screenplay may have been worse than the first movie, But Tim Burton makes up for that mistake with his brilliant direction, and set design. Before you go see Batman Begins, make sure you watch this movie, and the first to convince you that Batman can once again be a good series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Knight's Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman Returns" is not a perfect film in the empirical sense of the word: there really is not quite enough Batman presence, some of the fight scenes (particularly with Catwoman) don't make sense, and some of the plot points are a bit more fantasy than reality (albeit that's probably intentional). But a mathematical stacking of pros and cons is not what makes a film great or horrible, it's the impact of it and the merit of its artistry. In this respect, Batman Returns is a masterpiece.Tim Burton's major contribution to Batman in general, despite his frustrating insistence on being fascinated with the villains, is giving him back, and refining, his dark nature. Burton, along with Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns (graphic novel) and a few others, re-imagined Batman into the Dark Knight, perfecting him into the somewhat frightening crime fighter Bob Kane was getting at back in 1939. "Dark" characters are often created by piling on violence, sex, or drug use, but Batman needs none of that to be scary. In fact he's better without it. He's dark because that's what he is, and there's a purity to it that no other super-hero can touch. Tim Burton pioneered this image of him in "Batman," then mastered in "Returns.""Batman Returns" centers around four characters: Batman, Catwoman, The Penguin and Max Shreck. These four principles are the force of this movie, and the film's plot serves as an elaborate character study of each of them. Every one of them is both friend and enemy of each other character at different points of the movie, until the conflict between them throws the plot into a frenzy of senseless mayhem at the conclusion, finally succumbing to the insanity of its principles. For this reason, the ebb and flow of the plot is a bit off-kilter, and that would be a problem if any of those four performances weren't absolutely fabulous. Describing someone's acting never does it any justice, so I won't try to get into details, but it should be noted that all four of them spar with each other at full power.The Batmobile is back and still kicking, and Burton and company thought of some great ways of tinkering with their toy, none of which I will reveal now. Suffice to say the Batmobile offers up some of the grandest entertainment in the film, involving chase sequences that stand up to this day due to the sheer cleverness of the situation. The Dark Knight's suit is more regal in this one, slightly grayed, taller and less compacted. Batman looks something like a king in his outfit. As for Michael Keaton, he proves yet again why Bob Kane gave him the nod for the role in 1989. It doesn't matter that the man is not all physically imposing, because that face of his looks so terrifying and dark in the Cowl that his presence is magnified two times over. Keaton's rasp is still on point, able to transform his body language and his voice perfectly under the suit. It should also be noted that Burton's Batman is quieter than anyone else's, including Frank Miller's. I love that. Batman is always too chatty everywhere else. As for Catwoman, Batman Returns perfected her. There is no reason to ever do Catwoman again in any work of fiction, because you will never again create a character so fascinating, sympathetic or more tragic. Burton took a nothing character, some one- dimensional sultry cat-burglar, and made her a vicious look at sexism and the persecution of innocence in an ugly, cruel world. Well done.Danny deVito's Penguin is horribly ugly, completely hate-able, and rather pathetic, which is exactly what they were going for. He's a twisted animal with twice the anger and half the brains, not able to compete with Batman on any real level. But enter Max Shreck, a political monster whom the Penguin happens to have some dirt on, and The Penguin becomes a hand-puppet for Shreck, almost like Max testing to see if he could really make this abomination lovable. He has a mayor in office that doesn't always play ball, so he uses this thing to win the hearts of a Gotham City that is so desperate for hope they will latch onto anything. It's a cruel spectacle executed beautifully, and both actors give amazing turns. deVito will never get the credit he deserves for the film, because he makes you hate him so sincerely you forget to stop hating him when the credits roll. Christopher Walken is chilling, hateful and...(please don't ask me how he did this)...sympathetic. It's impossible to understand, but Walken somehow played Shreck so purely that it's hard not to respect him, even though he is a truly corrupt, twisted creature of a man.The plot is imperfect, some of the fights are odd, and the plot is as much fantasy as that's possible in a movie set in a city, but it doesn't matter. Four fascinating, complicated characters are set into a boxing ring and told to go at it, and Batman Returns is the result. Not to mention the whole film is anchored by one of the most famous superheros of all time. It's a shame Batman gets upstaged by Burton's fascination with The Penguin, but it's a forgivable mistake in a story that's so deeply affecting, and so dark. That's the key thing Returns has that the original kind of missed: the soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strange Sort of Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit my comments on "Batman Returns" are probably biased because I have a strange sort of love for this movie, which I remember that Gene Siskel also had with "Saturday Night Fever." This was the first movie that I ever owned, and I grew up watching it. Batman was probably my favorite comic book hero when I was young, but I have never read Bob Kane. I completely understand why some Batman fans hate this movie, and it's probably the same reason why I dislike the Lord of the Rings trilogy. When you become familiar with someone's work and form your own interpretations, it becomes difficult to watch someone else change it.But by imagining that this movie has no ties to the original comic book except through the superficial use of its characters, it's not difficult to see an odd sort of genius behind it's making. When Tim Burton created this eerily dark version of Gotham City, he was making an homage to "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," which no doubt has had a great influence on his work. Maybe it's true that comic book movies don't blend well with film-noir, but if any comic book had to be chosen to do so, it would be Batman.I believe the reason why some people dislike this movie is because there's no character to identify with. In the first movie, we had Kim Basinger's character, who served as the movie's reality check, and we discovered Batman's world with her beside us. She is one of the heroes of the movie that we could identify with. However, the sequel has no one to guide us through. One of the qualities of film-noir is that there are no heroes, and that's certainly true in "Batman Returns." The main characters in this movie are obviously insane and driven by their own selfish motivation: the Penguin with his self-loathing and desire to make others feel his pain, Catwoman with her intense hatred of her boss and wish to free herself from a male-dominated world, Batman on his continuous quest to take revenge for his parents on every criminal he meets, and Max Shreck in his cynical love of profiteering. The characters aren't fighting for world domination or any of the more grandiose plots we see in comic book movies but for satisfying their emotional needs. There isn't a sense of morality or the incessant good vs. evil undercurrent that is so common in this type of a movie. The characters are caricatures of raw human emotions in collision, and it's interesting to note that the Penguin, Catwoman, and Batman don't even really hate each other. They fight only because they stand in each other's way, and as far as the acting goes, it's superbly under-appreciated.Michelle Pfeifer and Danny DeVito give the best performances in their careers. Pfeifer discovered that even though her face is covered by a mask, her lips are all that she needs to convey the seductive malice in her character. DeVito absolutely disappears behind the Penguin in a role that is both disturbing and incredible to see. (Has any other comic book movie ever dared to create a character that takes pleasure in biting a man's nose off?)All in all, the movie contains some brilliant cinematography by Stephan Czapsky, who also worked with Tim Burton on "Edward Scissorhands" and "Ed Wood." It's filled with strange sexual inhibition and a depressing outlook on the history and future of its characters, and so "Batman Returns" isn't a movie that will ever be liked or appreciated by a wide audience. But for those of us that do love the movie, we tacitly agree that it's the best comic book movie ever made, and we smile at all the "Spiderman 2" yuppies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the original Batman movie in 1989 was a huge hit, a sequel was inevitable. Just like almost all sequels, this one was destined to suck....and it did. One only has to watch the opening sequence of the film to see what is wrong with it. Much darker than the original, BATMAN RETURNS is not in the spirit of the comic books at all. It is in the spirit of Tim Burton's messed up mind. Burton felt it was necessary to make this Batman movie as disturbing and violent as possible, as long it still got a PG-13 rating. It seems that all Burton wanted to do was have every scene as unpleasant as the last one. I'm all for dark movies, but not when done completely wrong as Burton did here. The cast is wasted in this very poor sequel. See BATMAN FOREVER or BATMAN AND ROBIN instead.</fullReview>

Meanwhile, Max's mousy secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Pheiffer) finds out too much and he murders her. She comes back as leather wearing, whip cracking Catwoman, setting out to avenge her death, meanwhile falling in love with both Bruce and Batman. Can Batman defeat these villains, when he is in love with one and the other is thought to be a misunderstood hero?the good: This is twice as more dark, fun, and action-packed then the first! The characters are also a lot more interesting. This is one of the only sequels to be better then the first.First of all, Christopher Walken (Max Schreck) has great presence as the more "human" villain, with just a little bit compassion but mostly evil. Michael Keaton (Bruce/Batman) is more fun here because he shows just how much of a sacrifice being the 'Dark Knight' is, he also has a more interesting romance here. Danny DeVito (The Penguin) is gross to look at but made the character both tragic and very evil. And, my favorite performance, Michelle Pfeiffer (Selina/Catwoman) is amazing here! She goes from mousy to sexy and evil to emotional and slightly psychotic. Here, she is a tragic character and her forbidden romance with Batman was just perfect!Tim Burton also makes this very fun to look at with an even darker Gotham City setting and some great scenes in a deserted zoo and the sewers which is also the lair of the Penguin. It also helped that the film was set in the Christmas season, the snow and everything made it look darker.****</fullReview>

Michelle Pfeiffer is fab as Catwoman and really seems to be getting her claws into the role. I think I prefer Batman films to have one villain, two seems a bit too much as Batman seems to fade into the background as so much time is given to the villains. I preferred Burgess Meridith as the Penquin in the 60's TV show anyway. Batman Returns must be the weirdest summer blockbuster ever released, still its miles better than any of the Batman films that followed. Michael Keaton is good when he's on screen as Batman which doesn't seem that much, he's the best Batman so far thats for sure. Christopher Walken is always good and he's no different here his character reminded me a little of when he played Max Zorin in the Bond movie "A View to a Kill". All in all not bad, but I don't think I'd bother watching it again. ***6/10***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Tim Burton movie, folks! As such, you should know before you even see the opening credits that you will have to read between the lines. Burton is never concerned with stereotypes, he considers them as given. Instead, what he does is - he twists the stereotypes to their most nightmarish extreme. The perfectly incompetent secretary becomes a feminist anti-hero. The child that has been casted away wants to become the mayor by using his sad past. The cold power plant owner is a nice father. The millionaire is not only a superhero, but a superhero who is looking for a soulmate. So, give this movie a couple of chances before you decide about anything. I have seen it three times and I am still discovering new things in the abundance of information that this movie has to over. It is over the top, of course, but you know that Burton uses that approach in order to show something. Keep this in mind and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's Best Work Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman Returns" was my favorite film in high school as no matter what grade level I was in, it kept getting weirder. The more I thought about this film, it looked like a three way circus dealing with a hero torn apart, a freak show who wanted the majority popularity and a Cinderella story where the woman wanted a better life for herself. To most fans, "Batman Returns" was a better adaptation of the comic book than the original, and you know what, they were right.The film's prologue takes place in 1962 of Gotham City where the Cobblepots couldn't be happier with the birth of their first child; yet to know that there son looked hideous like a burned kid going to school, the parents decide to get rid of their son by dumping him in the lake where it takes him to the sewers of Gotham City where thirty years later, the hideous son would grow up to be the mysterious Penguin.Gotham City is pretty quiet on Christmas Eve where no mouse would be stirring, and the deal on making a power plant in Gotham City from Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) is no laughing matter. What the mayor and everybody else don't know is that Max wants to take all of the surplus energy from the sources in Gotham City in order to keep the plant alive. During a speech in Gotham City's fairground, a group of clowns called The Red Triangle Circus Gang attack the citizens of Gotham as it is up to Batman and not the cops to handle it.After battling it out with The Joker and losing Vicky Vale, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) returns as the dark knight and dukes it out with the gang members as he saves Schreck's mousy secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Phiffer) from getting killed. After the incident, Schreck gets kidnapped by some sewer thugs and take him to see the local crime boss The Penguin (Danny DeVito) as he tells Schreck that he wants to be a citizen of Gotham without anybody getting wise and to be loved as he bribes Schreck by showing him all the crap that he once destroyed. So the deal is made and Schreck needs to come up with a plan.Selina Kyle's life is never easy as her comes home from Schreck's Enterprise where from phone call after another, its another story. Until she gives herself a message that she has to file some paperwork for the Bruce Wayne meeting for Schreck's appointment. She discovers what Max is trying to do with the new plans for the power plant and is killed from Schreck as he throws her out the window. Street cats resurrect her as she wakes up dazed and fed up of the life she once lead and starts a new life, calling herself Catwoman.The Penguin's popularity in Gotham City is more than a jock or a hustler would have, as Batman wants to find out what angle the Penguin is getting at. Now with Schreck on the wing of a dragon, he gets The Penguin involved in politics where if the original mayor can't take his job anymore, then The Penguin would win leaving him and his gang of clowns to wreck havoc on Gotham City.During the film, Batman encounters The Penguin as he finds out the schemes he's trying to pull, not to mention the new female vigilante that has been all over Gotham newspapers. During a fight scene with the caped crusader, Catwoman has a thing for the man in black where like Spider-Man and the Black Cat, the new vixen wants to be in the bat's world. Sooner or later the two lovers find out each other's identity in a famous dance sequence where The Penguin crashes the party.I know there are some people out there that might not like "Batman Returns" but you know what, that's okay. The film is much better in set designs, original score, even more erotic than the first film. Just like my days in high school, Batman Returns is a fun house with surprises coming from left and right and there's no stopping the madness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing but not dismal Burton sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The campy, carnival-like atmosphere above ground, while utter insanity in the guise of the Penguin stalks the city, beneath. Sounds intriguing to watch, doesn't it?But Gotham City just isn't what it used to be. Gone, are the beautifully designed Gothic structures, replaced by gadgetry and standard, disappointing Hollywood fluff. There is plenty of eye candy, but that does not distract you from the fact that so much else is lacking. Has Burton lost his edge? I wouldn't think so. But in this attempt, he resorts to obvious fifth-grader tactics to amuse us; ie: the Penguin drooling black filth from his mouth throughout most of his scenes (what WAS that crap, anyway?), and killer clowns (which were oh so reminiscent of the detrital film, "Killer Klowns from Outer Space" and the 60's camp of Adam West). While this production was still quite entertaining, it held none of the wondrous edge from the original masterpiece. I did, however, love the performances of the principal actors; Michael Keaton as Batman (Bruce Wayne), Danny DeVito as The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, Christopher Walken as Max Shreck, and that wonderful Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth. Their portrayals were quite professional; the character depth was well developed and everyone contributed what I feel was their very best. What lacked here, in my opinion, was that lovely darkling nightmarish feel from the first. The Dark Knight having been turned into the Light Grey Knight, Gotham (Gothic) City was dismayingly morphed into a Carnival Midway, and the allowance of the horrid 60's camp at which we all groaned and rolled our eyes to creep into this otherwise darkly amusing production was just purely wrong. Sorry, but I fail to find having my gag reflex triggered to be entertaining. Honestly, I was still amused by this flick. DiVito's talent for acting is above reproach, though I found his constant black drool to be completely repulsive and it turned me off of his character totally. Again, that falls into the area of directing, and in no way cheapens his performance. Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman was mildly reminiscent of Eartha Kitt's portrayal and thus endeared the character. While she delivered her own style and talents to the characters of Seline and Catwoman, she portrayed Catwoman beautifully as a witty, intelligent seductress. Hers was a wonderful performance and I loved the perpetuation of the romance between Batman and Catwoman. "It's the so-called normal guys who always let you down. Sickos never scare me. At least they're committed." Seline to Bruce Wayne. The attempt to humanize Bruce Wayne was a serious mistake. Gone is the edgy, almost sinister feel to the Gothic hero, the "Dark Knight." Enter, instead, the comedic equivalent; this reincarnation of a masterpiece. It didn't work for me on any level. Bruce Wayne, cracking jokes, forgetting his coat over some piece of fluff girl, and snapping off one-liners to the bad guys as he pretends to kick their butts. What a disappointment after the last Burton attempt.I found the change to be sad, rather than fresh or edgy. There were several points of this production that I found to be quite unoriginal. Penguin's plan to kidnap/kill the first born sons of Gotham was rather Biblesque and lame. The James Bondesque music during Shreck's party was rather tasteless. As I mentioned before, the whole movie had a "Killer Klowns from Outer Space" feel to it beneath the failed attempt to be Gothic and dark as the original from which this spawned. The voice designated to Penguin's computer alert system at the climax of the movie was very V'ger-like (Star Trek: the Motion Picture), bordering on identical. And I've got one question. If the Penguin's army is penguins, and he himself identifies with penguins...WHY is he driving around in something as infantile as a rubber duck? Just another contrived and trashy element I found disturbing and unattractive. "How outstanding! You're Beauty AND the Beast, in one luscious Christmas gift-pack." Penguin.While this production fell short of the first, it was still a fun and enjoyable movie, if only for the performances of the main players. I am frankly glad that Burton will not be directing the next installment of this, the "modern" Batman series. I am looking forward to Jim Carey and Tommy Lee Jones's performances. But Val Kilmer in the leading role? We'll just have to wait and see. This one rates a 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

Blow up the city? Why did he not do it before? The script is sadly lame, but the makeup of the Penguin is excellent, and the costumes are, ahem, even better. I couldn't figure out if Christopher Walken even tried in his character or if he was told at the last second to replace Jeff Goldblum. Thankfully, the Gotham scenery and the other actors' efforts catapult it just above par.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman is, let's face it, a weak comic book movie series. So Far the X-Men and Spider-Man have better movies than any of the Batman movies. While Superman 3 was mediocre and 4 was awful; the first two Superman movies are the kings of Comic Book movies that Batman, X-Men and Spider-Man has yet to reach. But this one is probably one of the worst Comic book movies ever. Only Batman and Robin and Superman 4 are worse than this movie.Basically we have this short fat thing with flippers who has a hard time walking and he's a big threat to Batman? Huh? Anakin Skywalker from Episode I could beat up this stupid character. Unlike the Joker, I didn't think for a second that this guy is a serious threat to Batman. Then there was the Cat chick, who was rather pointless too. It looks like they made this film so they can have some hottie walk around in skin tight leather.Overall a rather poor effort. Good thing Batman Forever came along or else the first Batman would be the only one worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has really been unfairly lambasted over the past decade or so since its release. I feel that its reputation comes from the darkness of the film and also from the fact that McDonald's marketed it to youngsters by throwing Batman Returns toys into their Happy Meals. This is not a child's movie, nor is it the first film.Batman was a triumph in its own right, but I find this second film to be superior. The characters are interesting, the scenery is spectacular (Michelle Pfeiffer included), and the script is actually very well done. Every time I watch this film I pick up more subtleties. One of my favorites is when Penguin visits his parents grave and says, "I was their number one son, but they treated me like number two." This line has a great double-meaning. Penguin being treated like a number two son, not quite as well loved or cherished, but also Penguin being treated like number two, as in bodily function, in the less vulgar vernacular, crap. There are many lines just like this one laced throughout the film. It is true, the screenplay does have a few holes in it, especially towards the end of the film, but it turns out to be very enjoyable. There is great character development to be found with Bruce Wayne maturing and Selina Kyle having to deal with her newfound duality. The relationship between Selina and Bruce is the most interesting of any of the films. While the Penguin and bad guy Max Shreck are static characters, they really do contribute to the feel and plot of the film. Heck, Penguin drives the main plot, or is it Shreck that drives it? You decide.The Batman series would go downhill from this point. Batman Forever is actually pretty good, although Schumacher's vision is a little to "bright" for my tastes. Batman &amp; Robin is one of the worst films I've EVER seen. It's no wonder that we haven't seen a Batman film since its release. Batman Returns and the first film really make Batman and Gotham City seem real. Tim Burton should be commended for his vision on these films, especially Batman Returns, the crown jewel of the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman and Robin and Batman Forever are two great examples in the history of motion cinema that proves the theory that you don't need a worthy script to make a movie. Thank the Lord for special effects. Batman Returns not only has excellent performances from Danny DeVito and Michelle "Pussy Cat" Pfeiffer, but remains loyal to the original film having Michael Keaton return as Batman. Also, Batman Returns is set in a realistic "Fictional" city. The next two sequels to the Batman trilogy are set in fantasy lands right out of a 1970's comic book. Buildings that are 200 story long with giant Rome like statues that surround this crazy Gotham city. It goes to show you how special effects can carry a film. The true Batman trilogy ends with this film, the other two are just for show and marketing value. Take my word for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this Batman or the Punisher??? (SPOILERS WARNING)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, well, well... I've read several comments of how good this movie is but I simply can't agree for one BIG reason: Batman. True, he's supposed to be dark, he has a tragic origin and he's obsessive. BUT in this movie he's portrayed just as a sadist. I specially remember the scene in which Batman gives a bomb to a fat clown, smling nastyly and leaving, letting the guy literally explode into pieces. Please. This is not the Batman I know (and I'm a huge fan of Batman). In the comic book he's a dark character, but he's also a HERO, who'd never kill anybody, nor let anybody die. That's why he's called the "Dark Knight", he actually has the nobility of a knight! But in this movie, Batman is stripped off of all that qualities, leaving him as a psychotic no better than his enemies.Overall, a big disappointment. If you want to see a good Batman movie, try the animated "Batman: Mask of the Phantom" or "Batman: Sub-Zero". Now THOSE are good, specially the first one.</fullReview>

The leads Micheal Keaton, Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer are great, and in my personal opinion, Keaton is much better than George Clooney. Make-up and a fake nose does wonders for DeVito, and so does a catsuit for Pfeiffer, who looks absolutely stunning doing cartwheels in that slinky little number! The idea of the umbrellas are really freaky but cute at the same time. Where does the duck come from, anyway?? Tim Burton is really good with these kind of stuff and I wouldn't say this was a bad movie but it was obviously cartoonish. Burton's Sleepy Hollow was a much better film, but that's another matter.

Tim Burton's direction is so overbearing and mean-spirited that the film was doomed from the start. Michael Keaton does return as Batman and does about as well as he did in the original. The absence of Jack Nicholson is felt throughout this film though. Michelle Pfeiffer (Catwoman) and Danny DeVito (Penguin) never do add drama or intensity to the ultimately shallow and dull screenplay. Christopher Walken (Max Schreck) is also wasted as yet another super-criminal who wants to drain Gotham City of its power supply. Overbearing and ultimately stupid, a huge downer. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If people are scratching their heads trying to figure out what exactly went wrong with this franchise, the answer is right here. It is a mistake to cram more than one villain into a movie. The Penguin has always been a fine villain for Batman, but in this movie next to the dangerously sexy Catwoman, he comes off as simply boring. Catwoman should have been the only villain in Batman returns, just like the Joker was the only villain in the first movie. It wasn't bad enough that a great villain like Two Face ended up getting the short end of the stick to the Riddler in Batman Forever, but we had to fit in another hero in Robin. By the time we upped the ante to three villains and three heros in idiotically titled Batman and Robin, it had simply gotten ridiculous.So, if anybody out there reading this is even thinking about making a superhero movie, remember this. One hero and one villain. That's all one film can handle, and that's all you need.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the Batman movies--both of them. Yes, I am in the "Tim Burton Rules" camp. I'm also in a minority, in that while I thought the first Batman (1989) was great, I think Batman Returns is even better.The first Batman had nice industrial hell feeling with all those brown and rusty pipes all over and steam coming from everywhere. The second has the feeling that it happened in the 1940s.This movie also has the best performances in the series. Michael Keaton is Batman, and nothing can change that. Danny DeVito as the Penguin was awesome, just as freaky as the Joker was in the first movie, with plenty of funny lines. My personal favorite is, "You're just jealous because I'm a natural freak, and you have to wear a mask!" But the best performance of all is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, which I will go into later on.The music in Burton's movies is also great. Danny Elfman never gets the credit he deserves. The music is especially good in this movie, when the Cobblepots decide to kill their own son (the Penguin), and the scene cuts to a view of Gotham City, and there is a choir singing. Ahhh...so dark and beautiful.It may be a bit dark (in fact, it's the darkest of the series), but it is also a beautiful production and a wonderful character study, in particular of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, who was absolutely stunning. She is one of my all-time favorite female characters, right after Ripley from the Alien series and Sarah Conner in the Terminator movies. Pfeiffer really brought her to life--one of her best and most electrifying performances. Remember that if Annette Benning hadn't gotten pregnant, Pfeiffer wouldn't have gotten the opportunity to play her. That would've been unfortunate.I love the scene where she trashes her apartment (beginning down the road to being a villain"). I was thinking, "Yeah, girl, get mad. You deserve it!" There's so much raw energy and fury there, accentuated nicely by Danny Elfman's kick-*** score. Even though she was a bit psycho, I could understand her anger. The audience could empathize with her so much that they are glad that she lives in the end. Say what you want about Burton, but at least he, unlike his successor, embodied his movies with FEELING. His characters weren't just a bunch of schmucks running around in costumes for the heck of it--they had MOTIVATION and AMBITION.And the dance scene with Keaton and Pfeiffer at the masked ball...is simply stunning filmaking. Beautiful, SUBTLE background music, gorgeous lighting, and the performances by the two leads--again, particularly Pfeiffer--are just dead-on. Pfeiffer really gives her character dimension in this short scene, showing Selina's attraction to Bruce, her hatred of Max, her need for vengeance, and her increasing fear and insecurity of losing "herself" to her Catwoman identity. I love the way Pfeiffer puts a little 'catch' in her voice (as if she were on the verge of tears) when replying to Bruce's question, "Who the **** do you think you are?" "I don't know anymore, Bruce..." GOD! That was such a beautiful scene.I can't really add anymore that hasn't already been said. But I can leave everyone with my favorite Catwoman/Selina quotes:"Life's a *****. Now so am I.""A kiss can be even deadlier if you mean it.""I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.""I don't know about you, Miss Kitty, but I feel so much yummier.""Every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful. Maybe you should retire.""That's my name, Max Millions. Don't wear it out, or I'll make you buy me a new one.""Two lives left.

That is the best quality of this movie; you didn't have to see the first one to understand this film. Michael Keaton does an excellent job of reprising the role of the Dark Knight. In some ways I think he out-did his first performance in Batman. (Ex. The scene where he sits in the dark, alone in his chambers and the bat-signal comes shinging through the window.) Michelle Pfeiffer as the Catwoman had to be one of the best casting choices as well. If this had been a terrible movie, the chemistry between Keaton &amp; Pfeiffer would make it worth the watch. Danny DeVito's dark &amp; repulsive portrayal of the Penguin was also a masterpiece. Critics raved that this film was "too dark", but in the true sense of Batman it was exactly as it should be.

In Batman Returns, the villains triple up to replace the brilliant Jack Nicholson. So we get Catwoman, Penguin, and stock villain Christopher Walken taking Gotham City by storm and never really seeming all that dangerous. Batman shows up, of course, never really seeming all that impressive. Tim Burton is not great at creating action sequences, but he makes up for it with a very cool look for the sets, the costumes, and the film itself. The movie is mildly exciting at best, but it's beginning to look like a classic next to Joel Shumacker's mediocre Batman Forever and ridiculous Batman and Robin.</fullReview>

And as the first film, falls into the same sins: lack of realism (not even try it) and excessive attachment to the comic strip that gives rise to the central character. Blame it again Tim Burton, which shows little understanding of the comic-book universe and how capable he is of direct cinematic masterpieces or disasters. The film has the participation of Michael Keaton (as Batman), Danny DeVito (as Penguin) and Michelle Pfeiffer (as Catwoman), and only DeVito could shine, incorporating a spiteful and callous Penguin, still unrivaled in cinema.Moreover, the notes I've made for the first film applies perfectly to this also: the cinematography is so black that looks like it's always night in Gotham City, a city that, thanks to the unrealistic scenario, seems a depressed and bloodthirsty version of Orwell's Metropolis. The costumes seem's Carnival masks: Batman exaggerate in plastic polymers and Catwoman would be absolutely perfect in a hardcore and decadent version of "Fifty Shades of Grey"... Again, Burton lost an opportunity to understand that the film audience expects more realism concerning comic-book adaptations.</fullReview>

Burton dark and Gothic scenes gives Gotham the reign of terror look, makes you believe that batman is needed in Gotham. A film that was ahead of it time. The audience of 1992 wasn't ready for this, but as time as gone on the film has become more liked, maybe the downfall of batman forever and batman and robin, everyone seemed to realise then that this film was very good and should of kept Tim Burton as the director. Never the less a brilliant film and 100% must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a pleasant surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really like the 1989 Batman movie much. Sure, Mike Keaton was awesome as Batman, but Jack Nicholson's Joker was way too over the top and silly for me to get any enjoyment out of it. Not to mention the complete disregard of the stellar comic-book character that Commissioner James Gordon is. I didn't like the angle of Joker killing Bruce's parents, and overall the movie was largely ineffective to me. It wasn't nearly as dark as it set out to be.So I obviously go into this expecting mostly more of the same, right? I was half-wrong. Batman Returns is definitely as cheesy and over the top as the first movie, maybe even more. The only difference is, it accepts that and rolls with it. And director Tim Burton greatly succeeded in making this one just as dark and Gothic as its unbelievable madness. It's a balance, one that stays pretty consistent throughout the film.Right off the 'bat', anyone with a brain can surely tell that the acting is greatly improved. Michael Keaton is still the same as Batman, and Michelle Pfeiffer flares it up with a stunning and surprisingly believable performance as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Christopher Walken is pretty top-notch as his character Max Shreck, but the REAL star of the show here, is, of course, Oswald Cobblepot himself, Danny DeVito.I gotta say, Danny did great with his role. He IS the Penguin, no doubt. This is a really different take on the character of Penguin, probably about as different as Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. As different as it is, however, it is that much original, and a really entertaining and satisfying interpretation of the character. In my opinion, it was DeVito's Penguin that was the most interesting, as well as the most well-acted villain of Burton's two Batman movies.However, the movie DOES have its flaws. Most of the action is pretty unbelievable, and overdone (starting to show some camp here, this is thin ice for the Burton/Schumacher difference). James Gordon is still gravely underused, but his persona wouldn't really fit with the tone of this movie I guess. Batman is still a murderous psycho, and isn't bound by any 'no-killing' rule. But given this movie's madness as it is, it didn't bother me as much as it did with the first one (I don't even think he kills in the first one, save for the Joker) There is a lot of sexual humor and I don't really think that sort of thing really fits with Batman, but it IS balanced by the grotesque and sometimes even gruesome imagery and violence. I just think this movie is a pretty hard PG-13. Even more so than The Dark Knight. Also, where did Billy Dee Williams' Harvey Dent run off to?Overall, this movie caught me by surprise, I expected it to be a cheesy Batman movie, and I got exactly that, but a lot more FUN than I thought it would be. Something I really liked in the '89 Batman was the Danny Elfman soundtrack, which eventually even got carried over to the amazing Animated Series. I can truly say even the score was improved with this movie. It's a lot more Gothic and haunting, and I like it more.8/10. Good comic-book movie, one not to be missed, watch it, especially for DeVito's Penguin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven Storytelling with Great Visuals and a Strong Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is an interesting one. It was the second film in the Burton/Schumacher franchise that upon release, scared the crap out of the kids in the audience because of its grotesque, violent imagery and made parents feel uncomfortable letting their kids see it because of the overt sexual innuendo between Batman and Catwoman. Fans seem to generally love it, or hate it. But despite the reputation it held, I still loved this movie as a child. Yes, there were moments that just flat out puzzled me but I still enjoyed it none the less. But as I grow up and mature a little, I see more and more of why this film gets such a mixed reception from the fans. It has some great ideas in there but they just don't quite feel complete in their executions. But does Batman Returns still work as a film? Let's find out!The plot starts off with Oswald Cobblepot, the infant son of the wealthy Cobblepot family who's born with strange birth defects that make him seem half-man, half-penguin. After eating their house cat, the Cobblepots throw him down to the sewers where he gets raised by penguins. 33 years later, Cobblepot sends his circus gang to attack a corrupt business man by the name of Max Shreck's Christmas festivity where he ends up capturing Max Shreck and threatens to reveal his past sins if he doesn't try to get him back into society. Meanwhile, a shy, socially awkward secretary by the name of Selina Kyle, stumbles upon Shreck's evil schemes and gets pushed out a window for it. After getting resurrected by cats, she goes through a mental breakdown where she smashes up her apartment and takes on her new identity as Catwoman. At the same time, the Penguin fools everybody into thinking he saved the Mayor's baby and runs an election to become Mayor.Firstly, I'm gonna talk about why do I think so many people love this movie, the style and atmosphere. Like most of Burton's films, this film has this Gothic, moody atmosphere to it that makes it a very fun movie to watch. The production design is stylized and expressionistic, the score is haunting and beautiful, and the sense of humor is macabre and dark. All this makes for a very appealing movie for both the eyes and ears.But while the atmosphere is great, the storyline is somewhat lost and confused. There's a lot of really cool concepts in this film, but they never seem fully realized and the script ends up suffering because of it. For example, there's the concept of Batman, Penguin, and the Catwoman all being the same deep down as they're all outsiders who put on a different facade to unleash their anger on the thing the thing causes them pain(Batman = crime, Catwoman = women being considered second to men, Penguin = discrimination towards him because of his deformity) but this concept is only brought up towards the end and it feels sorta like an afterthought. They also try to make us sympathize for the villains(with the exception of Max Shreck) which I never did because frankly, they don't come across very redeemable. They just came across as violent douchebags the entire time to me, especially the Penguin, who, even when accepted back into society, STILL decides to get revenge on them and never shows any sign of humanity whatsoever.But at the same time, Burton comes up with a lot of really great images with these characters. There's so many images in this movie that could easily pass off as a painting and there's some even some really subtle symbolism I've noticed after re-watching it. All this makes me wonder if this movie would've worked better had it been its own art-house film with no relation to Batman whatsoever. And it probably would, as Burton doesn't show a whole lot of interest in Batman anyways since all of the villains'origins were changed drastically from the comics and Batman himself is largely overshadowed by the villains in this film.Despite those problems, the cast is still great. Tim Burton may not be the world's greatest storyteller, but he's always been able to get good performances out of his actors and this film is no exception. While Michael Keaton doesn't get as much screen time as expected, he still gave a solid performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. The casting of Devito is pure genius and I can't imagine anyone else playing the part. And Pfeiffer adds a surprising amount of depth and nuance to her character. But for me, the biggest scene stealer is Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. He's just fascinating to watch as this corrupt, shady businessman who always come across very mysterious and you never know what exactly he's thinking. I want to see more of this guy.I also thought this movie was quite entertaining. The black humor throughout was funny. While it may be too grotesque for a Batman movie, the twisted atmosphere made it all the more interesting to watch as you don't quite know what Burton's gonna throw at you next. The action sequences were okay for the most part, but there were some memorable moments such as when the Penguin hijacks the Batmobile or the final confrontation between him and Batman.Overall, while it's not a storytelling masterpiece, the stylish visuals and the excellent cast still make for a very entertaining film. But if you are a fan of the comics, you should probably avoid this one as it is mostly a Tim Burton movie and not really much of a Batman movie. I'm gonna give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The makings, if not quite the results, of a campy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns (1992)I've seen this version of Batman a few times now, over the years, and in many ways it's the best of them all, along with the companion 1989 "Batman." And in some key ways, both of these fall just short of quite gelling into classics.Here's why, both ways.First, remembering Batman as a comic book hero, Tim Burton's version of that world is wonderfully exaggerated and fanciful and actually comic. This is the biggest difference (in my humble view) with the Nolan films of the last decade. Where Burton sees a chance to be inventive and playful, Nolan sees a chance to make the unbelievable real.It's a relief that there is no reality to Burton's world. Sometimes you can tell the movie was shot on a set?and the same set, rather a lot?but that's again part of the "world" we are drawn into.Characters for Burton are about excess just beyond camp. The Penguin is pretty amazing?Danny DeVito pulls it off like no one else could, an equal to Jack Nicholson's Joker from Burton's earlier Batman flick. And Catwoman as played by Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific. Batman himself might be a matter of taste?many people prefer Michael Keaton but I find him dull. And in this movie, he mostly stands around as Bruce Wayne and drives around as Batman. Not much physicality here.Christopher Walken? He starts off being weird and wonderful and then kind of keeps that steady state attitude throughout (even as his world is in constant tumult). It works, but it's not perfect. In fact that's what happens a lot of the time. Some of the "action" sequences aren't as elegantly edited (or shot) as other similar films (especially Nolan's) and so there is energy but not necessarily a visceral involvement. (You have to be thinking about this while watching it, I suppose.)But it's Burton's idea of Gotham, and his development of characters, that makes the movie really special. Whatever its limitations, it has so much that goes beyond expectations?and beyond the somber grandiosity of the Nolan versions?you really need to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A childhood favorite, and a misunderstood classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video.here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with.penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole "9 lives" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable. Batman is the only normal guy in this. in fact, Keaton being the calm cool hero both as Bruce Wayne and batman, grounds the movie and keeps it together whereas the 2 villains are completely crazy and psychotic nut cases. it seemed Keaton didn't have it all together in the last movie, he had a a lot of demons to fight with, but by the end you got the feeling he found his purpose in life, now that hes got a bat-signal and the law on his side. so naturally, in this one he seems more together and knows what hes doing. its the villains who are not together and have all these obvious mental problems, so much so that they actually make batman look normal. if it was anyone else playing batman, it wouldn't have worked. but Michael Keaton has a unique screen presence that when he puts on the bat suit, he literally IS batman and lets face it, no one before or since has had the manly swagger that Michael Keaton had as batman. he was a bit older, getting some greys, was this sort of gruff everyman but has this seriousness and "normal guy" look that makes you take him seriously as batman. other actors who have played batman seem too pretty boy or hand picked and thus don't feel real. Keaton is like the everyman normal looking 40 year old gruff guy and he demands you take him seriously. this is a very artsy film, compared to its blockbuster brother from 1989, which was basically a cut-&amp;-dry blockbuster action/adventure. but it really didn't have any emotion or depth to it, despite Keaton's sincere efforts. Thats where Returns comes in. all the characters are very interesting and in a way, they all echo Batman. Catwoman is the dark vigilante side of him, while the Penguin shows what Bruce Wayne could have been if he turned bitter against the world. I've heard many ppl say that this batman film is not really about Batman himself, and that too much attention is given to the villains, but i will say again, its not a bad thing, and doesn't ruin this film. batman himself is really not a very interesting character when you think about it. hes essentially a guy who's see's his parents get killed as a kid, he trains for X years, then decides to becomes batman for revenge purposes. OK. thats it. there's no more to it really. certainly not something i want to watch for a whole 2 hours. i really didn't see a point in making a whole movie about his origin a couple years ago, i think it was a waste. i was always kinda hoping they would bring back the Burton style of filmaking for batman movies, or maybe even get Burton back to direct. but alas, we got something that felt like a lesser version of the 1989 film. sad. but hey, we always have the Tim Burton films to enjoy. those, IMO, captured the real batman, beyond the facade of "comic book" movie looks (which, in Burton's case, is actually a good thing). as far as i'm concerned, Burton is the only guy to have directed Batman movies. hes the only one who i believed truly understood batman, as you can see in his various films. the other directors never really...got it. they just don't get batman. they only got him as a character, thats it. but Burton KNEW batman, he understood his plight in life, and the darkness inherent in the material. thats why this is to me, the best, and most personal, Batman film. it shows batman, and his villains, at there most raw. they are all hurt individuals, and thats what makes this film so powerful. this is what a batman film should be. serious, witty, playful, phycological, and DARK. while still retaining the comic book style that we all expect. this film also paved the way for the wonderful Batman: The Animated Series, which also shares Tim Burton's dark, Gothic look and feel from both of his Batman films. it even uses the same theme!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For What's It's Worth, A Worthy Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns takes place a little while after the events of the first film. Batman and Gordon are working together to keep the streets safe for the holiday season when a new menace arrives in the sewers. A business tycoon, Max Shreck(played by Christopher Walken) is captured and taken in the sewers to meet the mysterious man called The Penguin. Penguin uses Shreck's connections to resurface and establish himself in Gotham City. Shreck soon uses the Penguin's new popularity to his advantage and starts a campaign to elect him as mayor.While this is going on lowly secretary for Shreck, Selina Kyle, finds out more than she was supposed to and is killed by Shreck. At least for a moment. Selina survives the fall and creates Catwoman to extract her revenge. She also starts a relationship with Bruce Wayne while frequently going toe to toe with Batman.Batman has his hands full this time trying to stop Penguin's true scheme and contending with Catwoman.This sequel draws the focus more to the villains. This works well at some points, like the origin of The Penguin and not so much other times, Selina's transformation scene. It's not that the scene is terrible it's just it drags a bit long. Batman is still present of course but his role is somewhat smaller this time around. The action scenes could also be better polished as the choreography of the fighting looks sloppy sometimes.But for all its faults what this movie does pull off it pulls off great. I'm most impressed with Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as Catwoman which manages to seem confident and edgy but also a little insecure at times. And I'm impressed with Danny DeVito's Penguin. His character actually comes off as pretty tragic at certain points but he still manages to provide a threat to Batman. There are times when I think he tried too much to mimic Jack Nicholson's Joker but I manage to overlook those moments. Gotham City is still beautifully designed and the supporting cast gives it their all. Michael Keaton still gives off one of the best Batman in the history of cinema and Danny Elfman's score is fitting to the dark tone of the film.Overall, this sequel isn't going to please everyone who liked the first movie but I still recommend watching it. It's a good movie and a worthy continuation of the Batman Saga.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catwoman, Batman, Penguin Man, all three separate plots that somehow join together to create this very awesome, awesome movie. The effects were much better than the original Batman from 1989 with the Joker, but hey, the sequel can be the better one sometimes. Things were brighter than usual, and hey, look at that, Christopher Walken. What a disturbing looking man, who would have known that he would have been the bad guy? Quite a sarcastic guy, am I? Well, what's the plot? Catwoman emerges from a woman the guy Christopher Walken throws her out the window. Couldn't ever really catch his name. Her name is Selena, though. Apparently, she has 9 lives like a cat, but I'm not really sure that's a joke. Then, there's penguinman whom you're going to hear about in the beginning of the movie. The gloves from the sewer made me think this movie was going to be about Poison Ivy, but it wasn't. He actually runs for mayor. Pretty stupid, but hey, it works.This is a masterpiece in itself, and you're going to really enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masking a good time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I grew up with the chintzy 60's TV series (and no I'm not that old? POW!). However when director Tim Burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen, I simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from favoring his installments over the much hyped-latest additions ('Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'), which I don't really care for. Even if they're going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore Bruce Wayne/Batman psyche further? but in honesty I don't think there's all that much to tap in to. I wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes that's what Burton brought across, and this is the reason why I can watch them over and over again. After wowing audiences with the 1989 'Batman', thanks to the gaudily Gothic art direction and Jack Nicholson take no-prisoners performance of the camped-up, but psychotic Joker. Burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far; 'Batman Returns'. Camp, but well-done. In what would fair up to being even more expansive, louder, dreary, and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for the price of one. Enter the grotesque Penguin (with Danny DeVito magnificently going out on a limb) and the ravishing Catwoman (a steamy Michelle Pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely) coming to spoil Gotham's party. Again Batman (an aptly brooding Michael Keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit? look at the eyes) plays second fiddle to the bad guys, but I always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique, but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed. And his turn of Bruce Wayne was well served too. Burton's illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his sleek Gothic style engraving an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes. The moody narrative (in what probably is a tad too long) is more so symbolic in its progression, rather show-piecing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant set-pieces and sharply etched art direction covered with shadowy tinges and grey/blue neon lighting of a wintry backdrop. The magnetically free-flowing camera-work takes flight and Danny Elfman's stately spacious score balances the playfulness along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull. The rest of the performances might be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken digs in his teeth into a smarmily glassy role of a two-faced businessman Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back, but gets very little to do as Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough is delightful as Alfred. In solid support are Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also makes a cameo appearance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were a lot of things that were excellent about this movie, like the cinematography and the performances, though it isn't as good as the first film. Michael Keaten is suitably brooding as the Dark Knight, better than George Clooney in Batman and Robin (considered as the worst out the franchise)though he is overshadowed by the villains, namely Danny DeVito as the Penguin, who looked as though he was having a ball, and brought a sense of sadness and grotesquesness to the role. Christopher Walken was effective also as Max Schrek. Stealing the show, with her flawless delivery of not-so special lines, is Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy and manipulative Catwoman. The film looks lovely, with the sets and effects, and Tim Burton directs with detail. However the film does drag, and while there are some intelligent lines from the villains, the script could have been developed a little more. All in all, a dark and entertaining film. Whereas Batman Forever is funnier and more fast paced, Batman Returns is darker, but just lacks the sophistication of the first film. 8/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A daring Super Hero film that does something different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is an odd beast, as it is not really a Batman film nor is it a super hero film. It's very much a quirky art film disguised as a super hero film. Despite the title,this movie is really about the Penguin, his rejection at birth for being deformed, his ascension in the public eye, and rise to power and his fall and eventual rejection of humanity. Batman merely serves as a spectator of the events in this movie having little to do except have sexual tension with the other villain Catwoman. (Michael Keaton and Michelle Pfiefer have the best chemistry of any Batman movie by the way). Speaking of Catwoman by the way, while The Penguin may be the film's main character , it Michelle Pfeifer's performance as Selina Kyle A.K.A Catwoman that really makes this movie worth watching. Miss Pfiefer does a great job playing the mousy secretary pushed to madness. In fact the two most powerful scenes in this movie are owned by Michelle Pfiefer. The scene where Selina Kyle has her psychotic breakdown and wrecks her apartment and the scene where Batman offers her a fairy tale ending of happiness which she rejects for revenge against the man who wronged her. This film is perhaps the most pessimistic comic book film of all time. Every character in this movie loses. Penguin loses his acceptance in to society, Catwoman loses her fairy tale ending, and Batman loses any chance of a normal life. When watching the end of this movie one has to wonder if Bruce Wayne isn't contemplating hanging up the cape and cowl for good. You might be wondering why I gave this film a 5 out of 10 even though I've been gushing over it so much, the simple fact is despite it's title Batman Returns is hardly a Batman film, this film belongs to it's villains and why one of the rules is a super hero is only as good as his villains that doesn't mean the movie should almost all but ignore it's hero. That said I am recommending this film because it is in my opinion the most daring comic book film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning but political edge takes shine off entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Penguin (De Vito) steps into the role as Mayor of Gotham City and trouble ensues for Batman (Keaton) through the opinionated Catwoman.In the sequel to Batman, Tim Burton returns to direct another visionary action fantasy that is interesting but poor when looking at modern Batman releases.Has Tim Burton ever failed when delivering darkness to a tale? No. If you take a minute to recall the dark mind of Sweeney Todd or the musical mischief of Jack Skellington then you know just how dark the director's mind can be and with this picture you would expect to see more dark imagery and imagination, especially considering the amount in the first Batman and in the comic books. And such is the beautiful darkness that the opening scenes bring back memories of his other flicks, particularly Edward Scissorhands. As powerful and creative as Burton is once again (will the man ever let us down?) he is unable to do anything about a poorly scripted plot.The bizarre opening looks as though it will be Burton magic again with Elfman's music juxtaposed with a floating basket in a dark river but what follows is a strange string of events involving a man's quest to find out who his parents were, a man hating cat loving woman and a ridiculous lack of superhero usage.The Penguin, though visually brilliant, is an awkward segment of this narrative. This child in a man's body feels very misplaced in the political side of the world. Running for mayor, finding parents and blackmail is all too much and though De Vito was excellent in many turns, there is simply too much for the character at once to be considered remotely believable.Catwoman on the other hand makes things interesting. Not only does Pfeiffer look the part she embodies the slowly suffocating soul of the protagonist. The strong opinionated woman is a fine addition to the film and is the highlight. Male viewers in particular will love her domineering actions and sequences.The political ideologies are too risky and take the attention of the characters. Perhaps the film is trying to preach but with an unbalanced script with action and talking mismatched its hard to tell whether the film has a message or is there for entertainment.This political edge takes the shine of the engaging action sequences and almost overshadows the action. Batman is even left out for the first half an hour because of the political debates which frankly, ruins it all together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's 'Batman Returns' (1992) caused much controversy from parents over its dark tone. Can one stay that Burton went a little over-broad in trying to create a darker version of Batman. Yes.The film is about Batman (Michael Keaton) must battle the Penguin (Danny DeVito), Catwoman (Michelle Phieffer), and businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken).I don't understand it. How can Tim Burton make two Batman movies that destroy Bob Kane's vision, yet fans love them, while the hate Shumachur's vision, which was true to Kane's (Not counting B&amp;R, of course).Now when one first sees the film, they'll think it story with a nice social commentary on the world we love. This commentary is quite nice, like how people like Penguin, who just want respect and love, are treated like freaks, while people like Max Shreck, who are heartless and cold individuals, are respected by everyone.But by the end of the day, Superhero films are meant to entertain, with nice action sequences, along with nice human subplots. Batman Returns fails miserably at doing that simply task.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before tonight, it had been a whopping 14 years since I'd seen "Batman Returns" (upon its initial theatrical release)...probably because I didn't like it much the first time around. With old(er) age and a more well-rounded appreciation of cinema, I decided to give it another shot, and...well, it was a LITTLE better than I remember it being when I was a tyke. The plot has something to do with a deformed child dumped in the Gotham City sewer, who is befriended and raised by penguins, and somehow amasses a face-painted sideshow cult to do his bidding, rising to the ranks of Penguin (an extremely unrestrained Danny DeVito); meanwhile, put-upon secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) stumbles upon a shady deal her industrialist boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is looking to pull, and is murdered for her efforts, only to be resurrected as Catwoman, a nimble minx in a bondage outfit. Batman (Michael Keaton) spends most of his time in the background of chaotic scenes, and is hardly in the movie. "Batman Returns" shows off director Tim Burton's big-budget stylistic flair, with a taste for the macabre and a morbid sense of humor; the script, however, takes a colossal misstep in putting the Penguin at the center of things, as he is easily the most obnoxious adversary the Caped Crusader has ever had to confront. His endless one-liners only randomly hit the funny bone, and the plot surrounding him feels fabricated. Catwoman has more seductive charm, as does Walken's Shreck, but even they can't detract from this overcooked movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman is back to save the city for a second time. And this time he has two main villains and a circus gang to fight against. As if this is not enough, Max Schrek is badder than Penguin and Catwoman together. This film is very dark, but also pretty camp. People complain about Batman Forever for being campy. OK, they may be right. But look closer at the Penguin and the circus gang, and you will understand what I mean. Some of the characters in the gang even have similar Jim Carrey - expressions. And Penguin drop of one bad joke after another. Catwoman howewer is very dangerous, but not just for Batman. And about Batman in this film: he kills !! Batman has sworn to NEVER take a life. In this film he kills of two members of the circus gang, with purpose. This is odd, because in the first film he does not kill of people.He tries to save Jacks Napier when he is about to fall in the acid ! And they made Penguin a monster. From what I recall, Penguin from the 60's TV - series and Batman TAS was more of a gentleman. And they have to kill him of in the end. So frankly, this film leave me a little disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse Than I Remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this movie on DVD recently and this is the first time I have viewed it since originally seeing it in the theater. All I can say is it is much worse than I remembered. Once again as in the original Batman movie, the villains are the star and not Batman. We get no new character development of Batman, no look into his motivations, psyche or past. The character of the Penguin is bad enough, but the origin of Catwoman is absolutely absurd. Let's see if you are pushed out of a window and fall to what surely would be your death and then a mob of cats gathers around you, you will wake up a world class gymnast, an expert at martial arts and a master with a whip. You can also survive being shot 3 or 4 times at point blank range and survive and electric shock strong enough to fry someone else, heck if you get all this, push me out the window right now! Save your money and your time and avoid this turkey and the following installments of the series, because it only gets worse. One tip to Warner Brothers, whom I still assume own the rights to Batman. How about a Batman movie, about Batman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family values come up unexpectedly in Batman Returns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor Danny DeVito is the Penguin, a fine-feathered villain who turns out bad because he was dumped by his parents. The baby was raised by birds, and now it's hard to tell if he's foul, or fowl. His sad saga is only one of the many threads that tangle the plot of Tim Burton's partially successful, but really bad, sequel to his 1989 Batman. In Returns, we're given three villains for the price of one, but more is not always better. Any one of them could have carried his, or her, own movie, but here they just keep stepping on each other's toes (paws? claws?). The paws are provided by the marvelous Michelle Pfeiffer, as Catwoman. She gets the funniest lines and knows just what to do with them. She is spectacular in her basic black, home-sewn catsuit and her spike-heeled boots. The bullwhip is the perfect accessory to complete the outfit. Too bad the script can't quite figure out what she represents. DeVito is fine, but his birdman of Gotham, badly in need of a visit to the dentist, grows a tad wearisome. Christopher Walken completes the villainous trilogy as Max Shreck (great name), the unscrupulous businessman whose greed may be the downfall of Batman's hometown. He wisely, and skillfully, plays it down.Oh, yes, before we forget--there is what seems like a cameo appearance by Michael Keaton, as the caped crusader himself. The story is overly complicated, the transitions between story lines rather bumpy and the characters (with the exception of that darn Cat) don't really grab our interest. Still, the movie is a visual marvel, great at putting its money where our eyes are, and that's no guano. Would love to see more of Pfeiffer's kitten with a whip in future installments. Don't miss the credits at the end of Batman Returns, to see who plays the Penguin's daddy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Batman, I'm dichotimatically torn...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...by Batman Returns. On the one hand, there's a good story here (Bruce Wayne sympthasizing with both the Penguin and Catwoman, and even Schreck's concern for his son gives him a sympathetic moment or two), an interesting Biblical motif, some good fight sequences which help to maintain the image of Michael Keaton as the Batman, and some generally interesting elements throughout.On the other hand, Keaton seems to think he's in a comedy movie, playing almost all of his Wayne sequences for laughs. He was blown off the screen by Nicholson's performance in the first movie: this time around he's blown off the screen by three less-powerful actors/actresses overacting in concert.And _oh_ do they overact. When Christopher Walken is the most subdued bad guy in any movie, you know you're in trouble. The Penguin isn't so much Dickensian as disgusting as he eats raw fish, bleeds black, and bites off noses. Pfeiffer goes too overly humorous as Kyle, too overly aggressive as Catwoman. These are the comic book characters reinterpreted and stripped down to their _very_ basic elements. I don't mind that they're different from their comic book counterparts, but they're (ironically) much more two-dimensional than their four-color equivalents.Meanwhile, with Keaton struggling against his overacting villainous counterparts, everyone else gets short shrift. Michael Gough is the only other character to remain at all noticeable. Gordon and Chip Schreck are mildly memorable, but can you really picture anyone else in this movie a day after you've watched it (except for SNL actress Jan Hooks, and maybe the memorably icy Poodle Lady)? There's really just too much going on here, ending with a big penguin missle-launching blowout.The second in the franchise, BR remains somewhat entertaining. But it's big, flashy throw-everything-we've-got-and-hope-it- sticks approach is a predecessor to the Schumacher "epics" that are to come.</fullReview>

Michael Keaton and Michelle Pefeiffer try, but can't rise above the material.

		<shortDescription>Darker and bleaker but certainly not better than "Batman" - 67%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last Batman feature I've to review was this one, primarily because I haven't seen it in so long but also because when I first watched it, I didn't know what to make of it. It's much darker than Tim Burton's earlier effort and also more twisted - this is undoubtedly the Batman movie Burton wanted to make the first time around - but at times, the darkness parts just a bit to allow the campy nature to emerge like sunshine over Gotham's neo-Gothic skyline. Like the first, the movie is also carried by its villains but there is no stand-out moment for me. The film's story meanders quite a bit and little feels under threat, meaning Batman has little to do besides turn up in costume and bash the baddies ad nauseum.With the Joker defeated, Gotham's hope for a peaceful future is shattered by gun-toting clowns calling themselves the Red Triangle gang who terrorise Gotham's mayor (Michael Murphy) and citizens during Christmas. Although Batman (Michael Keaton) fends the goons off easy enough, shady businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) finds himself cornered by the grotesque Penguin (Danny DeVito) and quickly ends up in cahoots with the Penguin. But when his PA Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) uncovers Shreck's schemes, she finds herself bumped off by Shreck himself. But Kyle somehow survives and becomes the vengeful, seductive Catwoman whose quest for revenge won't stop when Batman inevitably gets in the way."Batman Returns" opens up a whole new can of worms for Batman to deal with but sadly, Keaton's quiet determination from the first film is absent. He is a curiously detached superhero, devoid of interest or personality. Instead, our attention turns to the movie's three baddies. DeVito is a superb Penguin, repulsive and hugely repugnant beneath the make-up and fat suit and perhaps offers a surprisingly decent baddie to go against the Caped Crusader. Similarly, Pfeiffer is an extraordinary Catwoman - a little unhinged perhaps but light-years ahead of Halle Berry's pitiful "Catwoman" portrayal. Walken settles for being the corporate face of evil but cannot compete with the other two. The film's other big problem, besides an uninteresting hero, is the script which doesn't flow as well as it did in the first film. Sometimes scenes descend into parody (such as the radar on the Bat-Boat thing) while others lack the conviction the earlier film established. Take Penguin's big speech as he's trying to become mayor, the crowd full of adoring voters holding placards adorned with catchy, positive slogans. Within minutes, they're hurling rotten fruit and veg at the stage - did they bring them with them for the rally and if so, how fickle are they for God's sake? Try as I might, I didn't enjoy "Batman Returns" as much as Burton's original "Batman". It lacked the electricity brought by Jack Nicholson's Joker or the steely stoicism of Keaton's performance as Bruce Wayne. By contrast, this felt a little too weird for my tastes and indulged the character's previously goofy side which I thought had been thoroughly dispatched by the first film. But whereas the Joker was an out-and-out baddie, the Penguin and Catwoman are both portrayed as victims instead of true villains which makes it hard to root for Batman, harder still if he felt anything for him at all. It's a technically impressive film - the sets are to die for, Penguin's appearance is a triumph of costume and prosthetics and my personal favourite Batmobile is still there, looking and sounding fabulous. But it didn't engage with me much and I simply didn't enjoy it as much as "Batman". It's miles better than "Batman &amp; Robin" which was so bad that it should have prevented anyone involved with the film from ever working in the movies again including George Clooney. But for fans of Christopher Nolan's sublime Dark Knight trilogy, this film treads an uneasy line between retaining the darkness of the character and tipping into the self-parodying days of the Sixties TV show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Oscar Nominated Smash Hit Ranks As The Very Best Batman Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tim Burton vastly improves the cinematic Batman mythology he originated in 1989 dazzling us with dark, nightmarish set designs, brooding atmosphere and a cast of unforgettable characters played to perfection. It's a playful, exhilarating world riddled with horror and heroism and grandeur. Danny De Vito plays the central villain; a freak thrown into the icy sewers beneath Gotham who returns years later as The Penguin to snare the firstborn children of the city in his murderous schemes. Max Schreck (effortlessly played by the wonderful Christopher Walken) aligns with The Penguin after attempting to murder his secretary Salina Kyle. Salina Kyle survives and reinvents herself as Catwoman. Michelle Pfeiffer is as striking as Batman himself and her scenes with the dark knight are magnetic. Once again, Michael Keaton is the sullen loner Bruce Wayne slash vigilante extraordinaire Batman (after accepting a 10 million dollar raise to recreate his role). Every one and everything in Batman Returns hits the right note including composer Danny Elfman who's musical compositions for the series are among his very best. It's a breath-taking entertainment no Bat-fan should miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns - It Could Have Been Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Batman Returns', the sequel to 'Batman' (1989), was interesting to watch but a lot of negative points come to mind after you see the movie. There were some creative ideas and dialogue in the movie, but the scriptwriters or directors didn't take the initiative to expand on those ideas before going onto something else less interesting. Though Danny DeVito might have done a good job for the 'person' he was supposed to portray, the actual character is hideously uninteresting in this picture and makes you want to turn off the television in a couple of parts. Also, his sidekicks are little more than completely unentertaining as well, which does not help make the villainous plot of the film any more exciting. That being said, Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific as Catwoman, the seductive assistant of Max Shrek (Christopher Walken, with a less than okay performance) who lures in Bruce Wayne with her unique charm. Ironically, there were few too appearances by its star (Michael Keaton, as the unbeatable Batman), and the film comes across as a possibly rushed production sequel and is too mean-spirited for its own good. Rating: Between 2 1/2 &amp; 3 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

A "circus gang" that's campier than anything Adam West ever conceived of. A poodle lady and a batarang fetching poodle. Is Batman in this? Oh yeah, for like two seconds.

An overly bizarre, pretentious script and storyline...that has no reason to be pretentious because it's about the most convoluted piece of hack-dom ever.Michele Pfeiffer and the score were good...but not enough to save this movie. Keaton's sullen, middle-aged, nerdy Bruce Wayne is awful. At least Schumacher gives us a millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne, and a Batman that can fight in the follow up to Burton/Keaton's garbage film. Well, at lease I think it's garbage. If you like ridiculous puppet-Penguin pallbearers...yes, puppet penguin pallbearers...you might think this the greatest thing ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know those films you watched when growing up, that you thought were SO amazing, but when you go back and re-watch them, you realise they're not all they're cracked up to be? Well...this is one of those films. It's the very definition of "style over substance". Sure, it LOOKS great, and yes, it *does* have a memorable theme provided by Danny Elfman, but having said that...there's still plot holes aplenty (big enough to drive a Batmobile through). Where to begin? Let's start with the obvious ones: Since when are their penguins living in the sewers? How does a mutant baby penguin-child survive in said sewers, and where in the WORLD does he find both goons and hi-tech gizmos exactly? Let's not even get into the part involving penguins with rockets on their backs. Seem unlikely? Not half as unlikely as a lonely secretary (sorry...ASSISTANT) getting shoved out of a hi-rise building, plummeting to her apparent "death", only to be brought back to life by a clutter of cats (who appear from seemingly nowhere) via some sort of bizarre cat ritual that involves them jumping over her prone body and chewing on her fingers. This results in her being turned talcum powder white, acting like a zombie and then going all "crazy" at home (her poor stuffed animals meet a grisly end in the garbage disposal). Despite having "died" and then resurrecting, she still manages to create an entire home-stitched dominatrix catsuit (complete with cowl and gloves) out of a single black vinyl jacket. She both feels and LOOKS "so much yummier". Her resurrection also granted her martial arts skills, the ability to wield a whip with expert proficiency and the urge to randomly blow up buildings. Resurrection via kitty bite RULES! I guess feline saliva has some amazing properties in it? Kitty spit is made of AWESOME.Catwoman's not the only one to defy death, though. The Penguin manages to survive his entire sewer lair collapsing on him long enough to drool black-green goo and deliver some lame last line before he falls down dead (finally!) and is miraculously carried into the water by his army of penguins. This is, of course, after he's managed to not only convince all of Gotham that he's some sort of "hero" who just wants to find out about his heritage, but somehow be in the running for Mayor. I guess it's not *that* hard...when it appears that all of Gotham are grade A morons. Didn't they learn anything from the Joker? I guess the Penguin's just smarter than the average Gothamite (he *does* somehow acquire the technology needed to deactivate Batman's Batmobile armour and tamper with it after all. Not to mention he has a vast array of trick umbrellas - talk about fancy technology. He hooks the handle of one of these special umbrellas - that doubles as a mini helicopter - around Catwoman's neck and sends her her up, up and away at one point...simply for rejecting his icky advances. I felt sorry for Catwoman there, but on the plus side, she got to fly over Gotham City's skyline and see the sights).Someone whose the total opposite of that^ and is completely incapable of having fun is Batman himself. Bruce Wayne just sits in his dimly-lit mansion, in a constant state of broodiness, doing absolutely *nothing* until he sees the Bat-Signal in the sky - at which point he's all pursed lips and dramatic head-turns. What a boring Batman! You'd think he'd be playing poker with Alfred at least, but no, he's just waiting for the signal, in a constant broody mood. When he puts on the Bat-suit, however, his mood shifts to...glum. Seriously, his mouth is turned downwards (when he's Batman) to such an extent that it looks like a muppet mouth. His Batmobile - which you can tell was solely designed with the idea of what a great toy it'd make for kids in mind - is ready for ANY occasion. Why should Penguin be the only one with unbelievable technology? As far as the actors go, Keaton doesn't have much to do besides scowl. DeVito is pretty nasty in his Penguin make-up and gives a nicely creepy performance. Walken (as Selina's tycoon boss, Max Shreck) and his crazy grey hair - which looks like the result of too much electricity - is the very definition of "arch". He actually twiddles his fingers in an evil manner at one point. ALL the characters spout cringe-worthy dialogue at some time or another, with varying degrees of success.The one who comes out on top, of course, is Miss. Selina Kyle herself - Michelle Pfeiffer. She is the definitive Catwoman, no matter what anybody else says. Yes, her origin story may vary from that of the comic book character or whatever, but it's of little importance. Pfeiffer exudes sexiness. She rises above the movie's shortcomings to bring us a memorable villainess/anti-hero, who encourages women to stand up for themselves, by gum! She makes the transformation from lonely, frustrated, slightly bumbling secretary (who gives us monologues - out loud - about her love life...or lack thereof), into a back-flipping, whip-cracking (and sometimes jump-roping), stun-gunning dominatrix capable of fitting an entire canary in her gob (I wonder how the bird managed not to suffocate in there?) - and you can't help but love every minute of it. Even when she rather foolishly lets herself get shot multiple times - just to prove a point - but soldiers on, rhyming as she does so. Shreck finally has a reason for his hair looking like that of the Doc's (from Back To The Future) there at the end, when there's some sparkage between him and Selina. Pfeiffer completely owns the part, and it's a relief to see her pop up into frame just before the credits roll (somehow having repaired her cowl - which had previously had holes in it that bits of her wild mane stuck out from). Meow indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will, can't blame Burton for trying...I think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not like this movie at all, actually hated it, and this is coming from a loyal Batman fan. Every time Tim Burton makes a movie he constantly tries to remind you that you're watching a "burton film" rather then just a movie, and for Batman Returns, it's just that. I stopped watching this after my love for "Mask Of The Phantasm" came to DVD. Batman is still a homicidal maniac who hasn't been locked up in Arkham yet, speaking of Arkham Aslyum, where is it? Burton just rathered to kill off the criminals rather then adding the influential mad house from the comics. Batman is yet again playing second fiddle to the villains, having the Dark Knight in only about 25 minutes of the movie. Anyways, I'll get to the point. There is a new nutjob running around Gotham...wait? in the sewers? Finally, Killer Croc is introduced to the movies. No, wait....that's not Croc...that's...the Penguin? Burton portrayed Oswald Cobblepot as a sewer mutant freak, with feces on his pajama bottoms, puking black and green mucus from his mouth with an army of penguins with rocket launchers on their backs, marching around the town like nazi soilders from the '40s. The Penguin has always been a sophisticated gentlemen, a rich greedy crimeboss and owns a local dance club. Oswald always only carried an umbrella with him because his father died of pneumonia when he was a kid, and his loving mother didn't want him to catch it. In Batman Returns, his parents hated him, disown him and threw him into a river. Catwoman was shown as a psychopathic terrorist, killing random strangers and blowing up everything in her path when she was thrown out of a window and revived when cats tried to eat her. This movie is poorly plotted. Burton disregards anything he sees in the comic book and makes it his version and to me; that is not the Batman I grew up to love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Evil land developer Max Shreck teams up with sewer dweller The Penguin to plan to take over large areas of real estate. When Shreck's employee Selina Kyle discovers his plans he kills her, only for her to survive and develop Catwoman as an alter-ego. Gotham City's regular defender Batman, steps up to battle the villains while, as Bruce Wayne, he begins a romance with the sexually charged Kyle.The second of the Batman series had the possibility to go one of two ways. 1 - it could go darker and look at the character of Batman in more detail and bring out the ambiguous nature of him more. Or 2 - it could take the blockbuster elements of the first and up the ante. With Burton on board it was always possible that it would go darker and complex than the first, however instead it panders to the mass audience. In fairness the studios had a lot of money to make from the films and merchandising so couldn't risk the sequel turning people off. So here we have a plot that doesn't really matter. At times it's not really clear why any of the villains are doing what they're doing, the thinnest of reasons suffice - the Penguin simply wants revenge for being dumped in the sewers at birth.With the plot noted on a matchbox, Burton seems happy to concentrate on the set pieces. With the characters set up in the first film, he now can just jump in at the deep end. The end result is a endless run of explosions, gadgets and fights. Keaton is not so effective as he was in the first - mainly because his character isn't developed because we concentrate on the baddies instead. De Vito is a good Penguin and he doesn't ham as much as Nicholson did. Pfeiffer is definitely a better female role than Basinger was, but she isn't fully explored. Walken is always watchable as a bad guy, but here he can't rise above the material.Overall this film bottled the opportunity to build on the dark original. Going for the `bang, bang, boom' audience it throws all it's energy into action and fights. Overall it's an uncoordinated mess - the name Batman deserved better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films. Its predecessor, Batman, in my opinion, is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre. For one to say that Batman Returns was disappointing, he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of Danny Devito as the Penguin. Devito and Walken offer some memorable moments. The tale of Batman is suppose to be dark and Tim Burton has fulfilled how the comic portrays Batman. Batman Returns provides comic relief, action, suspense and fantasy; and it should not be viewed as 'crap', although we are all entitled to our own opinions.</fullReview>

Though I don't think it lives up to the legacy of 'Batman', it does a great job keeping up.Good: It's a dark and gritty version of the Batman which thankfully returns from its predecessor. Keaton and Devito provide golden performances and Michael Gough does a grand job of Alfred. As a minor antagonist, Catwoman is good for the most part with only a few things I would change. The action is good for the most part with a more comedic side without completely disregarding the tone. The gun sound effects are massively improved and the music and cinematography is excellent as expected.Bad: I hated the character of Max Schreck as a villain and as a character in general. No motive, nothing interesting, nothing; just a pawn to the penguins chess board. I didn't really like Catwoman's costume and felt it was very sloppy and odd. It feels like it do desperately craved two hours when it could have been 15 minutes shorter. For example, in total, the penguin has THREE total plans just to slip over that 2 hour mark.Best Part: When the penguin assumes command over the Batmobile.8/10</fullReview>

Though the sad truth i've recently come across is that Tim Burton was (stupidly) given much more creative control for Batman Returns, where he then went on to make beyond dumb decisions such as replacing the far superior writer of the 89 original film with his own handpicked writer to "Burtonize" the crap out of the sequel. All to absolutely terrible effect.As far as the original 4 movies go, the overall quality is painfully obvious to any Batman fan who knows that a MORBID level of darkness and violence doesn't equal a better Batman story in the slightest.Case in point: Batman 89 &gt; Batman Forever &gt; Batman &amp; Robin &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Batman Returns</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the Sexiest of Batman Films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1992, Tim Burton's Batman Returns boasts a star-studded cast complete with the German expressionistic filmmaking style and Gothic production design often associated with this iconic superhero franchise. The brilliance of Batman Returns can be witnessed in recognizing that Tim Burton provided audiences with an art house film masquerading around as a superhero Hollywood blockbuster. From the architecture to the costumes and cinematography, this Batman movie has more in common with art than a movie. Not that movies lack artistic appeal, quite the contrary?after all cinema is the art of visual storytelling; but there is a certain artistic charm that surrounds Batman Returns uncommon in other superhero movies. In other words, the focus was more on the art of a Batman story than the plot. Many comic book enthusiasts also regard this installment (as well as its predecessor) as very close to the comics in plot and visual design. Furthermore, hands down, the most memorable element of the movie is Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, and with good reason. Incredibly sexy, seductive, slightly psycho, playful, and conniving. Juxtaposed against Danny DeVito's monstrous Penguin, Michael Keaton's timeless Bruce Wayne/Batman, throw in the self-centered and ruthless Christopher Walken's Max Shreck, and you have a brilliant cast bringing to life iconic characters under the direction of a then- visionary director before he became a parody of himself.Even the most dedicated Batman fans will admit that this film certainly has cinematic problems. But why are the flaws in this movie somehow forgiven but the flaws in Batman v Superman or this weekend's Suicide Squad held against them respectively? Rewatching this Batman movie reveals that it is likely held is such high regard by superhero movie buffs and fans of the comics alike due to of the A-list talent and the artistic or stylistic approach to this story. Because the focus of the film is definitely on the art versus the plot, narrative flaws can easily be overlooked as the experience of this film rests upon the feel and look of everything more so than the plot in and of itself. It is rare for a superhero film to also be so incredibly artistic. And that is why this particular Batman movie stands unique amongst all the others that have been produced over the decades. The passion for visual design is seen in every shot, every costume, and in the sexiness of the interpersonal relationships between the characters. Just like with interpretive art, various interpretations of tone, feel, message, and impression can be found throughout Batman Returns. Regarding the tone of the film, it repeatedly switches from a campy melodrama to tragic love story to action/adventure. In many ways, this film is representative or even self-reflexive of cinema from the 1930s to the 1950s. Paralleling the film's repeated switches of tone and pace, the characters also change personalities, demeanors, and motives. Moreover, control over situations constantly changes hands throughout the movie. Whether as the audience or a bystander in the movie, it is difficult, at times, to discern the villain from the hero. The magic of this Batman movie is that it bridges the boundaries of so many different interpretations of the Batman universe over the years into a film that embodies the art of filmmaking.Not a direct follow up to the successful 1989 Batman, this installment is often celebrated as the most Batman of the Batman movies; it's the one that somehow manages to reflect more about the hero and his world than any other on-screen representation he'd enjoyed before or since. It's a celebration of the Dark Knight that succeeds, in large part, by its refusal to go too dark, but remains off-kilter and uncomfortable, just enough, all the way through. Likewise, the villains are psychotic, larger than life, and legendary. From the tragic character of The Penguin thrown into the river in a warped Moses fashion on Christmas to the beaten down mousy secretary turned bondage clad 1990s feminist Catwoman, Batman Returns is a quintessential Tim Burton film before he just went way too bizarre in recent years. Both The Penguin and Catwoman can be seen as two different mirrors for our caped crusader. Penguin represents a child of wealth who was abandoned by his parents (not unlike our Bruce Wayne) and Catwoman represents the sensual side of Batman that we seldom get to see but we know it's there because he is human. The combination of characters, settings, and behaviors makes this film a fun, erotic, and entertaining Batman movie. The stratified emotions, experiences, and interpretations provides audiences with a dynamic story that plays out beautifully on screen. In fact, the film is so entertaining to watch that you will likely forget that the pacing, plot, and structure of the film lacks critical value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman gets the Burton treatment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is the sequel to the original 1989 film and because the previous film made almost twelve times its budget ,making one of the highest grossing movie of 1989, Warner Brothers gave to Burton free range to make the movie as he liked to. And here is why the movie has issues for Burton is a really good director in creating strange characters out of some idea and give it a Gothic beautiful style. But in adapting a character of a already existing source isn't his strongest suit and Alice in Wonderland is proof to that! Despite that I will say that it is a fine movie.So to anyone who has see it that is the reason why the Gothic and funny elements of the first film were cracked to eleven in this one. Now to the story it follows the new criminal called Penguin ,played by Dany Devito, who using black mailing tactics and allying with a corrupt business man ,play by Christofer Walker(!) of all people device a plan in order to take over Gotham and Batman has to (of course )stop them. While this plot is happening we also take the origin story of one of the most well known and loved( By men mostly ;)) anti-heroines of all times and main love interest of the Dark Knight ,Catwoman. Now Michelle Pfeiffer did a really good job portraying the sexiness and wildness of the character ,but let's be real here guys, this Catwoman is less and interesting character and more an loose woman in a skin tide leather costume, no offense to Pfeiffer I believe that you are a great person.Now apart from the strange sex under tones one other thing that ,this flick had it was that it is much more darker than the original. In the 1989 movie, yes it had the maniac the Joker, killings and Gothic image, but it was more like a Nightmare Before Christmas and less a horror movie. I don't know why but Burton did the reverse making is more horror flick and difficult to kids to watch. For real when I was ten I though that this film was a horror movie and I was afraid of it. And the design for Penguin, the criminals under his command and the streets didn't help either. So many parents didn't let their kids to go and watch the movie and for ones I don't blame them for it is more for teenagers than for kids.That had as a results the movie though it had more than twice of the originals budget it grossed far less and despite making almost 267 million this massive decline of gain made the studio to rethink who to make a Batman movie less Gothic and murdering and more friendly to children. Just for the record the 1989 film made a bit more than 411 millions so personally no matter what is send for the producer, if you had that facts in your had ,would you have similar ideas? But we all know how that went.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Sequel to a Classic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the follow-up to the hugely successful 1989 film "Batman", and it was an excellent continuation of the Batman story.Michael Keaton gives another cracking performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He was a little more violent in this film with the way he killed a lot of the Penguin's goons.Michael Gough and Pat Hingle return, but there are also a bunch of new actors to the cast. The main villain is the Penguin, played by Danny DeVito. His portrayal of the Penguin is decidedly different from Burgess Meredith's Penguin from the 60's TV show. Whereas Meredith brought out the more comical side of the Penguin, DeVito plays a more tragic and grotesque version. He is creepy, but he also makes you really feel for him.Another villain in this movie is Catwoman, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She is sexy as well as creepy, and the scenes between she and Batman are quite engaging. Christopher Walken plays Max Shreck, the other villain in the movie. Walken is one of my favorite actors, and as always, he was great in this movie.Tim Burton gives the movie the same unique visual style he gave to the first movie. There is a lot more action in this movie, and it is quite thrilling. The Christmas atmosphere is also really nice.You couldn't have asked for a much better sequel. While not quite as good as the original, it is still one of the best sequels out there.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bat, The Cat, The Penguin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Batman Returns" 1992 Directed by Tim Burton Action Adventure/Fantasy/ Starring: Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer,and Christopher WalkenAdding his own spin to the DC Comic's caped crusader, Burton's imagination goes wild turning Gotham City and its inhabitants into a Gothic German expressionism film noir experience. Devito's Oswald Copplepot/The Penguin is the main villain here, abandoned by his parents for his deformity as an infant and raised by the murdering Red Triangle Circus Gang. Copplepot only has hate and revenge on his agenda. Working with Gotham City's most successful business mecca Max "Million" Shreck, Copplepot's plan is to run to mayor, take over Gotham City, and kill the first born children much like his own parents tried to accomplish and only the Dark Knight can save the city and expose him. Keaton and Pfeiffer also sizzle on screen as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Selina is Max's secretary whom stumbles on this scheme, he tries to silence her by killing her but she only suffers from a mental break down and brain damage, causing her Catwoman alter ego to emerge. Pfeiffer turns in an iconic performance here, capturing multiple emotions and a interesting character for the ages. Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman sees reflections of himself in both of these characters and very developed for 89's "Batman" as Bruce Wayne and is perfect as Batman who is in the film at just the perfect moments. A wonderful score by Danny Elfman, costume design, atmosphere, make up, and cinematography, and what seems like a simple story by Daniel Waters on the surface is actually very complex. Burton deliverers in my opinion not only his best film, but also the best Batman film. **** of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember when Batman And Gotham were truly dark? When villains were gruesome and not only sexy and cool? Tim Burton's Batman was the pure version of how it is supposed to be, and it makes me sad that people who grow up watching Nolan's films will always think Catwoman is such a nice lady who marries Batman in the end, and that Bruce Wane is this atrocious version of a spoiled rich kid with toys, stripping Batman's legacy of its darkness and appeal. Michelle Pfiffer in this film gave a masterful performance, along with Danny Devito. Tim Burton provides us with such a dark version of the city so that we can inhale its dense air and feel the sadness of the lonely individuals which take part in this story of angry, sad villains who have a storyline, and the loneliness of the man that is Batman, things that were terribly missed with all the other versions of Batman films. This film was a masterpiece then, and still reigns the darkest realm of all, Gotham city.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's Batman sequel stars Michael Keaton donning the cape and cowl once again as Batman/Bruce Wayne, this time up against Danny Devito's sinister and grotesque Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot and Michelle Pfeiffer's mysterious and seductive Catwoman/Selena Kyle.Now believe or not, this one was actually my favorite Batman movie when I was little, even though this one is considered darker and a little scarier than the first Batman movie, which I will admit there were parts of this movie that I couldn't watch, but like I said in my Batman 1989 review, I couldn't watch the whole movie when I was little because of Jack Nicholson's Joker, oddly enough, Devito's Penguin didn't scare me as much, I don't know, I can't really explain why. Anyway I used to watch this movie a lot on VHS, which I still own along with the DVD and now Blu Ray. I remember though I used to want to be Catwoman and I actually made a costume out of a trash bag, made some cat ears, and painted my face with whiskers, and then went around quoting Catwoman's lines ("I am Catwoman, hear me roar") yeah, I was a weird kid, anyway, back to the review.I still enjoy this movie today, although I don't consider it my favorite Batman movie anymore. What I love about this movie is again Michael Keaton as Batman, like I said before, he's my favorite live-action Batman. Another thing is the Christmas setting, I love the winter look of Gotham City, great production design and cinematography, and finally of course I have to mention Danny Elfman's score, it's just the best. Now onto my complaints about the movie, first off I thought that Danny Devito and Michelle Pfeiffer kind of overdo it at times as the Penguin and Catwoman. I'm not saying their performances were bad, they were both great, Danny Devito is like the perfect casting choice for the Penguin in my opinion, I just thought they should have probably toned it down a little, basically them acting too animal-like, meaning with the Penguin squawking and Catwoman licking herself like a cat, I mean yeah she's trying to be like a cat, but seriously what is up with that? That's taking it a little too far in my opinion. Which brings me to my next complaint and that is, I think the film gets a little too dark at some parts and a little disturbing, I just kind of think they should have toned it down a little, like to how the first movie was. Also I wish they would have made the character of the Penguin look more like a human, like how he is in the comics, not half human, half penguin. Another minor complaint is I didn't really like the redesign of the bat suit in this one, I kind of prefer the one in the first movie, but I didn't hate the look of the bat suit.Overall I do enjoy this movie, even though yeah it seemed like I had a lot of complaints but I get pass them while watching the movie and enjoy it for what it is, and it does have some good action moments. and also it's Batman. So I recommend this movie mainly to Tim Burton fans, but also Batman fans as well. I'd give it a 7 out of 10, it's an entertaining movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe the word you're looking for is 'Ahhhhh!'.All good things considered, Batman Returns is unbelievably awesome. Tim Burton created a despairingly epic world in Gotham City, and I cannot say enough how perfectly wonderful the movie Batman Returns is! It's great all in an atmospheric nostalgic kinda way. The Batman script has been ripped to pieces in a way through way of the imaginative interrupted mind of Tim Burton, and it all works well and it's all to be well loved. Thank you, Mr. Burton. Batman Returns is one of my favorite movies, of all movies considered. I greatly prefer your Batman as best of all!Batman Returns is a visual and audio masterpiece, basically! It's so well-done, to only say the least about it. The actors are excellent, and the overall indulgent satisfaction level of Batman Returns is immeasurable. I loooove it. Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny DeVito...the stars are terrifically cast...look, here is the one thing about Batman Returns that you might have not noticed when watching it, sort of Batman Returns' sexy little secret.....Catwoman is actually the main star, and not Batman! Can you believe it? Catwoman is the lead character. What an unforeseen, yet I say, lovely change of fortunate circumstance for us, the viewers, and I do agree that it may be a bit misleading and ultimately untrue to the original desired upon essence of even making a Batman movie to begin with, whereas Batman is the main star, obviously, but who's complaining? I'm not! Michelle Pfeiffer is incredible! Michelle makes this movie. She is just incredible as Catwoman in Batman Returns. Pfeiffer's purr-fect for the part. This movie is so clearly wholly surrounded around Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, Selina Kyle, while Michael Keaton the co-star is again excellent as Batman, Bruce Wayne. I am here to tell you this, the one particular scene where Catwoman is back handspringing out of the corner Gotham shop that she's set to explode, when she first meets Batman and Penguin in the street where she stops, standing in front of them breathing heavily, looks at the two and in feign disgust she simply utters... Meow ...and the building blows suddenly and then she's off! Oh my God, I love that moment, like, understand, I deeply loooooove that moment. I do. I deeply love that moment as deeply as I love Michelle Pfeiffer, and like, I loooooove Michelle Pfeiffer, deeply. All of my deepest desires are perfectly summed up in that one deep beautiful moment from Catwoman Returns, I mean, Batman Returns. It's really, really deeeeeep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the darkest of the 4 Batman movies (in this series). There is much to like and dislike here. Michelle Pfeiffer is "purr-fect" as Catwoman and owns this movie. Too bad it isn't more about her and less about The Penguin. Danny DeVito plays a nasty, mean-spirited bird, and while the character is well-executed, it drags down the film to an almost depressing level. Curiously, in this one, no one goes to a cell in Arkham Asylum. Not enough gadgets in this one, although the penguins, which are both very real and clever fabrications, are very well-done. If this didn't win something for special effects, it should have. Max Shreck (Walken) is a weak co-villain, but, as always, he plays his part very well as the evil-greedy Capitalist. More grim and graphic than the last two Batman movies (in this series). Children were seen crying, leaving the theater. I wish the film had been more about Batman and Catwoman, don't you? They need to use her in further adventures. (That Halle Berry Catwoman movie was a big disappointment.) I nominate Scarlet Johannson for the role. Catwoman, of course, does not die, even though she was shot several times. Why is that? Nine lives?</fullReview>

And whoever else played him was awful. This was a terrific choice for an actor.All of the special effects can get a little goofy at times. It has some intense scenes though. In my opinion this film is for kids age: 12 and up. So I give this movie a thumbs up. The first film gets two thumbs up. It was amazing. This one wasn't amazing.

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's style really shines in this version of Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel is more dark gritty and has more character development than the first one. The last one had some Tim Burton style going for it but this time it's really really distinct. Danny Elfman did a fine job of composing the Batman theme song and can easily get stuck with that tune in the audiences head. So when I think of Batman this theme song comes to mind since it just stands out. The previous movie shows the villain's origin and this one is no exception, except there are two this time. And it shows how certain character got to where they are. This movie might not tie in with the comics but Tim Burton's vision isn't too bad for this movie. Style and vibe of it is similar to the first one but it has a bit of dark Gothic feel to it. However some areas are just not developed enough to the point it can get sort of difficult to just go with it sometimes. When it comes to the penguins goons and some other stuff, it just seems a bit too far-fetched even for a Batman movie. It might work if it's a cartoon or goes in a really silly direction like the live action TV show. But that just isn't the case here. Also the characters actions and reactions are just not all that believable. Selina Kyle might not seem like a sophisticated cat burglar in this. And her origin might sorta suck in this. But she gives off this crazy and yet tenacious vibe. Michelle Pfieffer was a good choice for Catwoman, she isn't sophisticated like I said but she fits the role of a cat burglar for the most part and her voice is cute but acts crazy and rebellious when it comes to her action. She plays the role of a attractive and yet dangerous Catwoman really well. Well after she turns into Catwoman that is. Now the acting in this flick isn't necessarily good but the villains in this really get into there roles. Especially when it comes to Danny DeVito who played the Penguin in this, he was almost perfect for this role. Well at least for a Tim Burton version, despite him looking like a giant egg man sometimes. He may not be as intimidating as the Joker but he can be more comedical, intentional or not. Kinda felt bad for his character, but only slightly. Both villains are suppose to be a bit more sophisticated but these versions are passable although a bit too insane. Sometimes it feels like too much time is on the villains though than Batman. Which is probably one of the reason this sequel didn't do as well at box office. Cause youngsters go to superhero movies to watch the superhero. Commissioner Gordon is yet again wasted in this. When he plays crucial roles a lot in the comics. Lastly Christopher Walkens is always good and he plays a very very corrupt businessman There is few moments that make this movie stand out though, like the part where the Penguin and Catwoman taunts each other. This isn't necessarily a good vs. evil movie like the first one but has other elements crafted in, which might not be entirely a good thing but it works. This flick has it's flaws and not good as the first one although this has more character development. But it's still worth a watch, especially if you like Batman.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At a time when we were starved of superhero movies, Tim Burton's Batman Returns followed his Batman and was a second oasis in the middle of the desert. And, as with the first (and as is the case with all Burton's movies), production design was a great strength - this film looks terrific.A critical retrospective examination reveals flaws, however. Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman is still a terrific portrayal, flawed only by Keaton's diminutive stature. Danny DeVito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman are both interesting interpretations, and visually fascinating, although I'm not sure this version of the Penguin works for me.Christopher Walken, always good value as a baddie, is one villain too many, however, and my main criticism of the first film - an over-emphasis on the villains at the expense of the titular character - is even more justified by reference to this sequel.It must also be said that the tone - mixing very dark with the camp silliness of the TV series - doesn't quite work here. In particular, the March of the Penguins sequence is so ludicrous that it fritters away much of the liking I had for what had gone before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer can't match Jack Nicholson as villains, but this sequel is still almost as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first sequel in the modern Batman movie franchise, released three years after the original film and directed by the same filmmaker, Tim Burton. I was still way too young for PG-13 rated movies by the time "Batman Returns" came into theatres in the early 90's, and I saw it for the first time over a decade later, in the fall of 2005. It was the first Batman film I ever watched. I first saw the 1989 blockbuster very shortly after that. I was very impressed with this sequel the first time, and have seen both of Tim Burton's contributions to the franchise again more than once since first seeing them more than four years ago. This sequel is not as popular as its predecessor, and may be slightly inferior, but neither film has ever failed to impress me.Christmas is coming, but Gotham City is headed for more trouble this holiday season. The Penguin is a man who was born disfigured 33 years ago and sent into the sewer at Christmas time, where he was found by penguins. He still lives down in the sewer, and during a gathering in the city, he sends a group of minions to disrupt it. Batman is called upon to fight them off, but just after he does, Penguin forces a corrupt businessman named Max Shreck into the sewer and convinces him to help the deformed man gain the respect of the people of Gotham City. After this, it isn't long before Shreck's secretary, the hapless Selina Kyle, discovers the businessman's criminal secret plan, so he pushes her out the window! On the ground below, she appears to be dead, but a group of cats quickly come and revive her! Selina then returns to her apartment, where she soon develops an evil alter ego named Catwoman, another threat to the city! Penguin and Catwoman are both intent on discrediting Batman! One of the highlights of 1989's "Batman" is Jack Nicholson's charismatic and comical performance as the Joker. Two other famous Batman villains from the comic books, Penguin and Catwoman, are featured in this first sequel, and are played here by Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer respectively. Unfortunately, neither of these cast members' performances can match that of Nicholson in the first film. DeVito can be mildly amusing in the role of a demented madman, but certainly not as funny as Nicholson playing the same kind of role before him. Also, Pfeiffer has some weak lines here, such as, "Honey, I'm home. Oh, I forgot. I'm not married," and some things she says as Catwoman. However, these two are pretty good for the most part, and Michael Keaton is still impressive as Bruce Wayne/Batman. "Batman Returns" features the same fantastic Tim Burton-style visuals as the first film (this time with snow), and also features lots of action and suspense, just like its predecessor. There may be more flaws in the script here, with such scenes as the one in which Catwoman seems to make Batman forget why he's fighting her just by saying, "How could you? I'm a woman," but the film is so entertaining that this is definitely not a significant problem.This first "Batman" sequel is not a perfect film, and like most sequels, it's probably not quite as good as the original, but it's still another very entertaining superhero action movie, unlike what followed it in the franchise when Joel Schumacher took over and made "Batman Forever" and "Batman &amp; Robin"! I feel I could rate "Batman Returns" 9/10, the same rating I gave to its predecessor, instead of 8. While it doesn't have as much good comic relief as the dark 1989 release, I think it has about as much excitement, plus the same dark visuals and atmosphere. Tim Burton only directed two Batman movies, but they are both very good ones, and his directing ability and visual style definitely helped. Just like the original, this 1992 sequel is not for little kids, even though it is Batman, but for those who like these comic book adaptations and are old enough for PG-13 rated movies, both films could easily be worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot less realistic than the 1989 Batman but this still isn't a problem as Burton is unrivalled at creating fantastical worlds that you become absorbed into. The stories of The Penguin and Catwoman for example are less believable than The Joker's but DeVito's performance is almost as good as that of Nicholson's. The Catwoman story though seems a bit unnecessary and almost like it would be better if it were left out and more time were spent on making The Penguin's story more interesting. It gets a bit silly towards the end and you begin to see the start of the fall for the Batman franchise as the films never picked up until Nolan's Batman Begins. Having said that this film is not as bad as Schumacher's Batman Forever and no where near as terrible as the 1999 film Batman and Robin. Worth it just for DeVito and Walken's superb performances as the villains, though Pfeiffer is a bit weird in contrast.</fullReview>

I understand, Kilmer could have never replaced Bale, but he would have easily replaced Keaton (who even though was a good Batman, WAS a wimp Wayne). Even if we forget that Keaton was the least good looking and had the least physicality required for an ideal Wayne/Batman respectively, we still cannot forget that he never had the ideal Wayne magnetic personality to attract females. He was a plain idiotic wimp as Wayne. Whereas while Kilmer was definitely muscular/handsome of the two, his was unfortunately limited by the Bad Movie itself that he worked in, that did no justice to the character of any roles in it, least of all Batman. Also, we can't forget that Kilmer did play a very good playboy-Wayne of whatever the script allowed him to. That is what is important (where Keaton failed). Because once you're inside the caped costume, it does not matter who is inside it, because nobody's going to recognise you anyway. So the character that must be given more priority is of 'Wayne' where one cannot hide behind a costume. Remember, Kilmer was a good Wayne/UNDERUSED Batman in a bad movie by a bad director. Keaton was a good Batman/wimp Wayne even in an overall OK movie by a very good director. Even worse was that, unlike Keaton who got two opportunities as Batman under the very good director to prove himself as Wayne and yet failed on all points as Wayne, Kilmer never got a second chance to prove himself as Batman even though he had proved himself as Wayne, no... not even under the same hellish director. MY POINT: If the physically strong, play-boyish Kilmer was that good as Wayne under the hellish Schumacher, imagine how great he could have been in costume (Batman) under the very good Burton. CLOONEY: As for 'Batman &amp; Robin', every thing was wrong about it and so was Clooney who only played 'himself' both as Batman/ Wayne. And he will always be remembered for that. Anyway, except when the movies are called 'Syriana', 'Ocean's Eleven' and 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', Clooney is all 'himself' everywhere. No Surprises here. I seriously hope they destroy all records/sources of that B&amp;R-crap.My Ranking: 1. Bale 2. Kilmer 3. Keaton. Clooney? Who Clooney?AS for this movie, I don't understand why people call this movie 'Dark'. This movie is Bad because it is TOO dark. Totally unwatchable / unenjoyable for children. On the contrary, the Penguin here, would give the innocent children, traumas for life. Don't ever show this movie to your children. Penguin is a seriously (pun intended) a horror crap here. Too Hideous, No Fun. And what's the use of the movie being Dark when you have No Character Development here. Penguin is a ridiculous villain and they have not shown even a single glimpse of his childhood, that is how the Penguins nurture him which is utterly impossible even in comics/fantasy, especially if they portray the movie and the Penguin as 'serious' and 'dark'. But yes, De Vito has been a good obedient actor here and did what he was told to do efficiently.(P.S.: As for the Comparison between those 'Batmen': Believe me, as the tag-line of 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' goes - 'It's Nothing Personal.' None of these four actors is my personal favourite. I love Denzel Washington.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, this had got to be the best Batman movie EVER!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>forget the over-rated "Batman Begins, THIS is the ultimate Batman movie that you are not gonna want to miss out on. this movie has everything, and it totally surpasses the first 1989 mega hit. it may not have done as well as the first one in at the box office, but this is certainly a much better film. the visuals are amazing, Burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again. Gotham city, Batmans hunting ground, is an amazing sight to behold. the story itself is actually quite good and the 2 villains in this one are VERY interesting, much more interesting in fact then there comic book counterparts. Tim Burton and screenplay writer Daniel Walters go a step further to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters. the Penguin, played to perfection by Danny Devito, is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denied him. very disgusting to watch at times, but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever utter in a single film. the other villain is Catwoman, played so absolutely brilliantly by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a WOW performance, and totally steals the show as far any of the past and present live action batman villain's is concerned. she also has a tragic background. her name is Selina kyle, and she is a very put-upon, mousy secretary for a shrewd business man called Max Shreck, who later murders her by shoving her out a window. somehow, she survives and is "awakened" by cats, and decides right then and there to become the legendary Catwoman, not before, of course, the amazing sequence in which she completely lets loose and wrecks her entire apartment in one of the most Oscar worthy performance's of rage and anger i have ever seen in an actress.Michael Keaton once again dons the cape and cowl as Batman and also as Bruce Wayne and THIS time hes much darker. there's not much else to say here except that Keaton is simply the best actor to play Batman ever. he just oozes cool, and he has a kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman, and he is very dark. he doesn't talk a lot, and when he does, he sounds very cool and he doesn't make his voice sound all goofy and fake IE bales "batman" voice in batman begins. he struts around Gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons. he's pshycologically disturbed, and you know it. in this outing he takes on 2 of the most famous baddies to ever grace the batman comic book world.i have to say though, despite the awesomeness of the action scenes, like the scenes with the coolest Batmobile EVER racing down the street knocking thugs to the ground and batman gliding across Gotham, its the romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton that really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the REAL Batman in action, i rate this a 10, would give it more if i could.</fullReview>

Batman fought against Penguin and got a hard time for Cat woman, who is not for Batman and even Penguin. The story was harder than first one. It is about voting for new senator and Batman prevented their plot. In the movie, Tim Burton showed his ability with his ideas about society; I think he wanted to blame the society. Ironical scene(when Cat woman touched Batman's injury, he touched her injury also), and bad people's poor side which wasn't in the first one made more was fascinated this movie. And in this movie, you will find Batman's destiny; He should live without love and happy except with Alfred...(Jesus, he should be gay something?). He will be remain the Dark Knight as it has a good match with Ghodam City. The evidence appeared already in the ending scene as Cat Woman looked Bat Mark........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first movie was better. But I still liked this one. The Pinguin was a little bit gross, but it's OK. It's the spirit of the comic. I loved seeing Catwoman in the movie. I think, in this case, they didn't achieve getting the spirit of the comic. In the movie she looks like a spoiled girl, who wants to do bad things just because. The character isn't like this in the comic. They don't show that she's a thief. It's good for a first approach. It has an open ending, which means that she could come back. And maybe then, the real Catwoman spirit could emerge. But well, I still love Tim Burton and hes darkness. It fits Batman. And to Batman himself: I love the way Michael Keaton plays it. He's the best Batman of all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic companion piece to the original, BATMAN RETURNS is the best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a baby, Oswald Cobbelpotts wealthy parents disowned him, for his freakish looks &amp; homicidal impulses. Dumping him into a cold stream &amp; hoping for his death. 33 years later, he re-emerges as Gotham Cities ultimate crime lord, determined to wreck vengeance on the town, while hiding his evil intentions behind a kind hearted &amp; shy, abandon freak boy who lived in the sewers all of his life, while working with the equally sadistic &amp; cold hearted Max Schreck, whom he blackmails to reveal his toxic waste dumping secrets, if he doesn't. Schreck himself is just as big of a monster, after attempting to kill his nerdish assistant secretary, SELENA KYLE, after she digs up some incriminating evidence on him, about his proposed power plant that he is attempting to use, to defraud the city to hide his evil intentions. From which he pushes her to what he thinks was her death out a window several stories up, from his office. In power, the Penguin sets up Batman for murder &amp; works alongside CATWOMAN to try &amp; destroy Gotham City &amp; Batman, while winning the hearts of his intended victims. While Batman attempts to clear his name &amp; fight off the evil Catwoman, whom he soon finds himself attracted to, with Catwoman even falling for the caped crusader herself. BATMAN RETURNS is a fantastic sequel &amp; great addition to the BATMAN cannon, a fun, wildly bizarre &amp; sexy action packed film from start to finish, never once stopping to take a breath &amp; always ready at all times to deliver something purely amazing at every turn, with plenty of tricks, twists &amp; turns up it's sleeves. This time the producers have decided to up the odds against the Dark Knight, by having him square off against two villains, instead of one. One of these villains played by DANNY DeVITO who is just right as the nightmarish looking &amp; scheming PENGUIN (envisioned here as a freak). MICHELLE PFIEFER meanwhile is excellent in the role of nerdy secretary, SELENA KYLE tuned villainous, sexy CATWOMAN. Equipped with a skin tight, black leather costume &amp; long black whip. MICHAEL KEATON reprises his role as the caped crusader, nailing the role dead on, while TIM BURTON returns to the directors chair yet again &amp; this time manages to deliver a very different looking Gotham City than what was seen in the original film. Burton drops the futuristic, neo noir type settings, in favour of a dark, gloaming Gothic look to Gotham City, that makes it look like it was dropped right out of an old HAMMER horror film, it also being set against the backdrop of a Christmas time setting, with plenty of snow. In fact it almost opens itself up to a Charles Dicken's type world, where characters are cast as either rich &amp; powerful &amp; those who are merely poor &amp; scraping by &amp; this also includes a fairy tale like metropolis, with cathedral like sewer systems. The production design is really breathtaking &amp; wonderful, a real joy to behold. BATMAN himself is equipped with a new suit &amp; even more gadgets &amp; vehicles is added to his arsenal. MAX SCHRECK is very well played by CHRISTOPHER WALKEN, in fact if they had cast someone else in his role, BATMAN RETURNS may not even have succeeded half as well as it does. If nothing else, the film can arguably be construed as more of a horror film take on a superhero movie than a plain action superhero one, the plot is much darker than one would come to expect from a superhero movie, several things point out to it, what with the after mentioned Penguin being a freak, raised by penguins in a sewer, attempting to get back at innocent victims he has watched through the sewer drains for many years, the abducted children he turned into creepy villains, the fact that he has to be caged, the scene where he eats a cat, the Gothic, dark look to the city, the fact that the Penguin is carried away in a black stroller by his nervous parents, while a friendly nice couple trek through the park, carrying their innocent happy child in a white stroller, creepy POV'S at the beginning of the film from the Penguin, as he watches the innocent citizens in the towns square. The Penguin's dark lair, his creepy looking clown henchmen, who snatch children away from their homes &amp; terrorize the citizens, the giant skeleton mask head motorcyclists, a villain dressed up as the devil, weird pale faced villains, Selena Kyle pushed out a window by the evil Max Schreck with intentions of killing her, the stray cats that nibble on her flesh while she is unconscious, the intended victim surviving her attempted death &amp; then seeking revenge on the person who did it, a normal person who goes insane with murderous intentions, a criminal has his face slashed repeatedly by Catwoman's home made style claws, a man's nose is bitten off by the Penguin, burned corpses &amp; freaks rising up from greenish coloured water, old amusement parks adorned with crustacean statues. In fact it just might be safe to say that the film is somewhat like a nightmare that was caught on film. Although how Selena went from a helpless nerd girl, to a dangerous fighting styled criminal is never answered (she learns how to fight the way she does in just a couple of days?) Also notable about BATMAN RETURNS is how it plays quiet heavily on double alter-ego's, with a more psychological driven theme than any of the other films had before or since. Fantastic score by DANNY ELFMAN help make this just as good as, if not better than the first, despite the poor critical reviews &amp; the disappointment of many film goers at the time, who complained the film was just to dark.

		<shortDescription>The Bat is back, and better than ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 1989 boasted the legendary Dark Knight's triumphant explosion onto movie screens worldwide, a sequel to the smash hit seemed destined to occur. Thus, 1992 heralded the return of both quirky director Tim Burton and actor Michael Keaton stepping into the batsuit once again. However, unlike most sequels which generally at best equal the quality of their predecessor, usually falling terribly short of the mark, Burton's "Returns" vastly surpasses the original in almost every possible shape and form. While an entertaining film, the first Batman was deeply flawed, a large portion of which was the film was mainly diverted towards showcasing Jack Nicholson's inspired, show stealing performance as homicidal clown prince of crime The Joker. Nicholson's performance was a triumph, but the downside being that because he was shown so often, viewers got almost no time to get to know Keaton's oddball millionaire and edgy crimefighter title character. Burton rectifies this mistake by diverting much more of the focus of his sequel towards Batman himself, while still churning up a fascinating new cauldron of villains and action setpieces. Once again, Burton's wonderfully creative Gothic design comes to play, but "Returns" shows perhaps his most beautiful scenery yet. The idea for the story to take place at Christmastime was novel, as Burton has several beautifully affecting shots of characters seen through slowly floating snowflakes. The single most affecting shot is the title sequence shot of the baby Penguin's carriage slowly drifting down the snowy river into the sewers, accompanied by Danny Elfman's simply wonderful score, arguably his best to date, save perhaps the Spider-Man films. Batman Returns, as well as being supremely entertaining is also a surprisingly beautiful and moodily shot movie. But Burton also improves on his prior film in other aspects - namely the action sequences have been amped up considerably, and Batman actually does some fighting, unlike the first where it looked like poor Keaton could barely move in the suit. The absence of Prince songs on the soundtrack is... liberating to say the least, namely because it makes more room for Elfman's majestic score, and... honestly, Prince and Batman do not, and should never have mixed. The script also has more memorable and well crafted lines this time round, save those given to Nicholson's Joker, even if the storyline does seem a bit uneven at times (The Penguin seems to be radically altering his master plan about every five minutes, which gets a bit disjointing). The primary cast is nothing less than spectacular, with Keaton giving a much stronger rendition of both his oddball quirky recluse Bruce Wayne, and much more stylish and classy while under the cape and cowl. It's quite a mercy he is given more screen time this time round, as we feel we finally get to know the man behind the mask a bit this time. Danny DeVito makes a terrifying, disturbing and pitiful Penguin, as well as the character and all his foils likely could have been played. Michelle Pfeiffer easily steals the show and creates an iconic femme fatale character as the mysteriously seductive Catwoman. Pfeiffer is nothing less than flat out gorgeous, and her oozing charisma and sexuality is enough to make any man "me-ow". Christopher Walken also has a wonderful appearance as corrupt businessman Max Shreck, as always, getting some of the most memorable lines in the film ("Bruce Wayne?! Why are you dressed up like Batman?!"). Michael Gough as usual IS Alfred, and there's nothing else to be said. Altogether, Burton has rounded together a picturesque, (apart from Pfeiffer as well...) beautiful and very entertaining follow up to his first Batman adventure, with a superb rogues gallery and some much needed time to get to know the said man behind the mask. The story may be somewhat disjointed, and not terribly realistic, but it's a comic book movie - realism is seldom an element present. Any fans of the Dark Knight or Burton's eccentric creativity, "Batman Returns" should be considered a must view. -9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two words: Christopher Walken</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is still considered by some to be the very best Batman film. I heavily disagree even if it is slightly better than its predecessor. The film is also considered the darkest in the series, even though others claim it to be quite campy. Both sides are right to a degree.Once again, the thing I hate about Burton's Batman films is very evident. Burton once more fails to create an illusion of space with every scene obviously taking place on a stage. Keaton puts his best foot forward as the dark knight, but you can't blame me for thinking that Val Kilmer and George Clooney both looked better as Batman.While the film certainly is dark thematically, there is a bunch of really goofy scenes that make it a rather weird mix. I had no problem with the Penguin, but I never enjoyed the film's portrayal of Catwoman. In the comics she's sophisticated and hot. Here she comes of as psychotic and kinda unsanitary.Even with its faults the film is quite amusing, and you can't really hate a film that has Christopher Walken in it. The guy can be funny, even when wearing a ridiculous wig.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>stars: Danny Devito, Michelle Pfieffer, Michael Keaton, Christopher Walken, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Vincent Schiavelli, Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman) and Jan Hooks.I really do enjoy watching this film, but it's only for people that love extremely dark flicks. It's about the hideous Penguin (Devito) that gets together with well respected monster Max Shreck (Walken) and runs for mayor. People soon realize that he is a horribly evil monster. We also have Selina Kyle (Pfieffer) that is just a timid assistant to Max Shreck until she snoops around too much and Shreck shoves her out a window for dead, but instead she becomes skitophrenic and becomes Catwoman. Batman fights both of these people and also falls in love with Selina Kyle, not knowing shes Catwoman. I loved the films wonderful sets and dark tone, but it's not for everyone. Another positive in this film is the wonderful score that is much improved on from the last Batman film (by Danny Elfman). I enjoyed this film, but it may be a tad depressing in the long run.My rating: B. 120 mins. PG-13 for extremely dark violent content and some sexual content</fullReview>

I don't want to forget Devito or Walken either--they're great villains. Not to be mean, but the skeleton they made for Walken looked almost exactly like him. I really enjoyed the romance of this movie too. Catwoman and Batman were so great together! Tim Burton, as always, is a magician when it comes to directing. He uses black mainly, and this movie really worked with the gloomy look. The bad guys were great! Danny is always marvelous.I just didn't like the fact that Catwoman and Batman were separated! I loved the ending though, cause it did give some kind of hope. I pray that Hollywood will see what I see in that romance and get back at it.CATWOMAN AND BATMAN FOREVER!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burton returns as well as Batman and in doing so abandons any pretence of real story telling in favour of a retro-expressionist exercise in psychological damaged character study. Even the production methodology replicates the old studio constructivism of pictures made in Germany's Weimar Republic and its clear that you're looking at a sound-stage the entire time which if anything just heightens the sense that you're occupying a complete fantasy world, superbly realised but lacking in the subtleties of plot that would have made it a more complete experience. As it is the visuals are stunning and its a more technically accomplished, more confidently directed picture than its predecessor but for all that it lacks the unpredictable edge of Jack Nicolson's Joker or the epic scope of Anton Furst's sets, here replaced by some accomplished design by Bo Welch. Its rare for a studio to give a director as much latitude as Burton got here but there's an argument to say that he ran too far with his own vision as the sacrifice of story and the creation of a film with such a dark and foreboding centre made him an easy scapegoat for the movie's apparent under-performance at the cash registers. Burton may have got his own way but his inability to properly balance the material and propensity to over-egg the pudding produced an ugly reaction in the studio, Joel Schumacher. A shame because Returns is a perfectly watchable, occasionally brilliant instalment, it just doesn't quite work as comic book entertainment.</fullReview>

Christopher Walken is superb as always, and Alfred gets some really good one-liners in. I recommend it highly. From reading up on Batman &amp; Catwoman they do seem to fudge the origins of Catwoman a bit if you can suspend your disbelief it's all good.Also, the Batmobile has undergone a few modifications from the previous movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman (Micheal Keaton) continues to fight crime, until the Penguin (Danny DeVito), a deformed man from birth starts raising his eyebrow as a political runner for Gotham. On the penguin's side is Max Schrek (Christopher Walken), a big business man. Batman's life becomes even more complicated when Catwoman (Michelle Pfifer) surfaces, who although a bad girl, stuns Batman.A visual nightmare that is not fun and eternally depressing again lets the villains steal Batman's thunder. The Penquin has way too much screen time, and Batman is AGAIN not developed correctly. There are also a few too many scenes that pulsate with unpleasantness (ie. the "gushing blood moment", and basically every scene with the penguin in it).Although the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Selena Kyle is perfect. If two people of the opposite sex decided to become hero and anti-hero, they would probably act like this around each other. the romance is a great way to combat all of the disgust in this film, although it is not enough.Danny DeVito is over the top, revolting, and gets way too much screen time. I would assume he was trying to make sure the audience hated his character, but it's just too much. it makes us grateful that Michelle Pfifer is in this film, decked out in a sexy, but not slutty, Catwoman outfit. Her acting is excellent.Micheal Keaton, my favorite batman, is cheated out of screen time again. he would probably be regarded by all as the best batman if Tim Burton and the screenplay writer had spent time developing more of his scenes.I recommend the film only if you want to see a beautiful relationship between two of the greatest characters ever to grace the comic book movie screen.**/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. Cool. Keaton reprising Batman. Also cool. Danny DeVito...waitaminnit: why is Danny DeVito in this movie? why is there an additional "big bad," thus taking away from the character development between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle? This is the inevitable simple equation that every comic adaptation proves, but Hollywood either doesn't care or isn't smart enough to catch on: 1 superhero + 1 supervillain = great movie, while 1 superhero + X supervillain(s) = bad movie. Superman and Batman prove the first half of this equation. Superman 2 is an example of a rare exception (as there are to all rules); however, it had Superman 1 to help build up Zod as a nemesis. X-Men barely survived it. All subsequent Batfilms died as a result of it. Too many characters to focus upon requires either 18 hours of footage or the elimination of characters. You can't build characters without scenes of them. You can't have scenes of them if you have to have scenes of the other 13 characters in the film. Pfeiffer as Catwoman is the only saving grace of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In comic book films like the Batman movies, the thing that has to be there, that is at least as important as having a title character that the audience will love to love, is to have a good bad guy, and that means someone that is wonderfully hate-able and has the power to make us fear him or her. The bad guy has to be intimidating, even for us as member's of the audience. Jack Nicholson was able to add his cynical charm to the Joker to make us like him, but just enough to allow us to hate him at the same time, maybe even as a result. His parade through the crowded streets of Gotham City where he gleefully gassed thousands and thousands of people was more than enough to illustrate the extent of his madness and his hatred for mankind in general, but Danny DeVito's Penguin is just not a scary character, no matter which way you look at him.The biggest problem here is that the Penguin teams up with a corrupt businessman (Max Shrek, played brilliantly by Christopher Walken), and even goes so far to run for Mayor of Gotham City. These are not the kinds of things that comic book villains do, and he came off as little more than a hideously ugly candidate for mayor with plans to make himself massively rich off the poor suckers of Gotham. DeVito is one of our few actors who is able to consistently play shady characters who are flawlessly convincing and yet strangely likable, and his talent is completely devoured here in the enormity of the prosthetics that he is forced to endure for this role, which does not do him justice as an actor in any way.Christopher Walken is also an actor who is almost incapable of filling a role without making it hugely entertaining, and he is completely wasted and misused here. Not only is his enormous charisma swallowed up by his goofy mad scientist wig the way DeVito's is by his repulsive costume, but he plays the role of a corrupt businessman that he just doesn't fit in. Like Denzel Washington in Training Day, Walken does not work well here because he is forced to play a character that he is simply too likable to pull off. He does as well as can be expected, and his screen presence was more than welcomed anytime he was onscreen, but the role just doesn't fit him.I love the role that Walken plays, by the way. I am not sure whether this is a throwback to the earlier actor (although it almost seems like it's just too much of a coincidence not to be), but of course you remember Max Shrek as the mysterious actor who played the vampire in the 1922 horror film, Nosferatu. I won't go into too much detail here, but this is one of the most fascinating mystery biographies in movie history, so much so that an entire film was made about this actor only a few years ago, The Shadow of the Vampire, which I highly recommend. Michael Keaton is back again, thankfully, to play the part of the caped crusader (unfortunately for the last time, since they HAD to keep making Batman sequels), filling the role with charm and personality, and Michael Gough is also back perfecting as Alfred and returning as one of the only actors to have been in all four (thus far) Batman films. Michael Keaton and Michael Gough work so well in their roles that it's amazing the series was even able to survive (although whether or not it survived or just became a dead horse will vary, depending on who you ask) when Michael Keaton stopped taking on the role of Batman. I remember when I was in high school I was amazed at how sexy Michelle Pfeiffer looks in that hot little latex Catwoman outfit, but watching now that I'm a senior in college, she just doesn't have the same effect. Instead of being captivated by her incredibly sexy body, the first thing I noticed was her slutty eye-shadow and glowingly bright red lipstick (which is so overpowering in an otherwise almost colorless movie that it almost seems to dance around the screen by itself like the grin of the Cheshire Cat), I was instead amazed at how obvious it is that the Catwoman is meant to have this loose sexual appeal, which I like to think fades drastically as maturity increases. Pfeiffer was able to fulfill this at the time, but I think that she as an actor has matured and taken on more respectable roles since, so that looking back it's almost like looking at some foolish thing you might have done in your own younger days. Batman Returns is entertaining in that it is such a visible spectacle and it is so interesting to watch the new characters, but overall it is a disappointment because it just doesn't have the same substance of the original. There are interesting new characters, but they are little more than strange creations than creatures in themselves, things to be looked at rather than entertained by, leaving this installment in the Batman series as a skeleton of what it could have and should have been. Fans of the old comics are sure to be put off by things like this, as are die-hard fans of the original films, but the kids, I'm sure, are going to love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton probably should not have made this film the way it was. For the most part, it was rather decent in its implementation and design, but it was just far too dark and unusual, like the set designers were in the middle of some acid trip while creating the backdrops of this film. I felt this should have been the last in the series, simply because Tim Burton took this film to a level that was too out there for most regular film goers to conceive. A decent film, but just too much to handle in regards to eye candy.</fullReview>

Michael Keaton reprises his role for the second times as Batman sadly the last time of the four films. His peformance is just as good as before. Danny DeVito performs good as the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. She is so neat just not as Catwoman but as Selina Kyle aswell. She is such a great woman! The film starts off with a bang and battle scenes between the circus and Batman is just excellent! I just loved it when they came out of the giant Christmas present and terrorized everyone!I recommend all Batman and action movie fans that hasn`t seen Batman Returns to this soon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns is one of the best sequels I have ever seen. Like the original Batman, Batman Returns provides Bat-fans everywhere with what they want in a Batman film. It is a very original sequel and doesn't copy the first film in any way (unlike Batman &amp; Robin which just seemed like a not so good re-make of Batman Forever). Michael Keaton, once again, plays Batman brilliantly and , once again, the only thing letting him down is his look. He just doesn't look like Batman, plus, I think Batman should be at least six foot whereas Michael Keaton is under six foot. Danny DeVito is great as The penguin and Michelle Pfieffer is purrrr-fect as Catwoman. Batman Returns, quite simply, is great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[may contain spiolers]Batman Returns is the best of the bat franchise...Batman was much darker than this movie and the later two, not directed by Tim Burton, were too cartoony and childish. Michael Keaton returns as the caped crusader Batman, a.k.a. Bruce Wayne. One evening a horrible, disfigured man-bird called the Penguin [Danny Devito] surfaces in Gotham City. He blackmails cold hearted businessman Max Schrek [Christopher Walken] to help reintroduce him into society. Schrek convinces Penguin to run for mayor so that his power plant can dump toxic waste everywhere and get more money from the city. His moussy secretary, Selina Kyle [Michelle Pfeiffer in her best role yet] finds this out and he ''kills'' her. She is revived by several cats and becomes the hero-villain Catwoman. Now Batman must stop Schrek and Penguin, clear his name, and romance Catwoman all at once.This is the best movie in the series...not as dark as the first one or as childish as the last two. The writing is superb and there is only one dissapointment. CATWOMAN HASN'T RETURNED IN ANY OF THE OTHER BAT MOVIES. She is the best villain and she hasn't resurfaced.My favorite part of the movie is the end, when Bruce wayne walks in that ally and finds the black cat...and then it takes us up the rafters of Gotham City's buildings and we see the Bat signal and Catwoman appears in the shadows...she not dead!this is a great movie and i give it a 10/10..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pros: Sets, directing, humor, characters, costumes, score, action sequences.Cons: A bit dark at times, last 20 minutes ludicrous at times.Batman returns, Tim Burton's follow up to the 1989 blockbuster screams his trademark directing. Burton got more control over the production and the result is a fantastic film even thought the studio execs and the public didn't like it. Danny Devito is manical as the penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy as catwoman and Micheal Keaton returns as batman. Christopher Walken as Max Shreck nearly steals the show and Elfman's score is basically the same from the last movie except for the choir he used. Gotham city is much darker and this film looks like it cost more. The batmobile is featured more and the action sequences are outstanding. The ending gets a bit ridiculous but not enough to bring the whole film down. One of the best blockbusters of the 90's.Premise: Batman battles the Penguin and Catwoman.Batman returns was nominated for two Academy awards and a Razzie award.Grade: 9.2/10 (The best of the series).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SILLY ME. Baaadd sequel. It leaves you feeling cold, and unsatisfied. This is a comic book movie-shouldn't we come off feeling like Batman indeed saved the day, and all might be well? That's the feeling we got at the end of the original Batman, and one that is badly missed here. The only thing we feel by the time the movie has reached it's pathetic (anti)climax, is that perhaps Batman SHOULD join Mr.Freeze, Riddler, Posion Ivy, and all the others in Arkham Asylum.Michelle Phiefer is the only point of interest in this dreary mess, and she is given FAR too little screen time. Catwoman deserves her own movie (although not the one Daniel Waters scripted, which was pure 1960's era Bat-campiness), and indeed one is in the works. Too bad the lesser Ashley Judd will play her, according to the latest news. With a better, more fleshed out Catwoman to play Michelle could really SHINE in a role she made, and has yet to top. Danny Devito is awful. Every second he has onscreen is a waste of celluloid. Bury this flick(except for Catwoman's scenes).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie doesn't absolutely stink. It does have redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, I think its image in evalated in light of "Batman Forever" and "Batman and Robin," both of which absolutely sucked.Good points:Michael Keaton returns as Batman. He is the best to date.Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She simply IS Catwoman. I'd even go so far as to say her interpretation of the character was far more dead on than Nicholson's Joker in the first movie. If those two had been paired together... the thought sends chills down my spine!Christopher Walken turns in another fine performance as a villanous businessman.The mood is still suitably dark. Camp is low, and where it exists it is appropriate.Bad points:The interpretation of the Penguin. This arch-villian was changed so much from the original character (a genius turned to crime) and not for the better (a deformed and ugly circus freak who is just flat-out gross in everything he does). Danny DeVito is an excellent casting choice, but his character was unlikable without a single redeeming feature.The plot suffers from attempting to cram too many villians and plot lines into the allotted time. Splitting the screen time between all three undercuts their stories such that a lot of what happens seems contrived and phony -- except for Catwoman. Her's is the only villian role that seems to flow naturally, maybe because her goals don't involve grand-scale plans, just the thrill of making mayhem while trying to get the best of Batman. Admittedly, it would be a hard choice as to who to leave out as both villians are created or used by Christopher Walken's character. My personal opinion is that a wholly different script should have been used, but perserving most of the Catwoman story line or expanding it because she's just so damn good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome comicbook adaption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's bizarre imagination once again brings the comicbook to life in a way only he could. An army of penguins with rocket launchers, a rooftop clash between Batman and Catwoman and a runaway Batmobile destroying everything in it's path are just some of the spectacular highlights. Unfortunetly, Returns lacks the more realistic, urban enviroment of stuff like the original Batman (1989) and X-Men (2000), taking place in a completely Gothic netherworld that is almost completely detatched from reality. This is it's only fault, however - Returns is an outrageous superhero adventure, with awesome make-up and costumes, witty dialogue and stunning sets. Michael Keaton simply IS Batman, and it's a joy to see him take to the crime-infested Gotham streets again and kick ass. Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life as Catwoman, sexy, deadly and disturbed in equal measure. Danny DeVito is a perfect Penguin, a sewer-dwelling freak with a collection of lethal umbrellas. . Rounding off the cast is Christopher Walken as Max Schreck, not a character from the comics, but ironically the biggest villain of the three. With it's moody yet rousing score, intense action scenes and cool vehicles (including the water-based Batskiboat and a giant rubber duck), Batman Returns is a treat for the eys and ears and even the brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proves the sequel theory wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been born in 1983, I up thinking that every time a movie came out with a number in it, it wouldn't be good. Up until 1992, almost every sequel that was released wasn't very good, or up to the standards of the original. So when "BATMAN RETURNS" was released, I wasn't very enthusiastic (despite being a BIG fan of the first). This movie proved me wrong. If the one reason this sequel isn't as good as the original, it may be that it's better.This movie stuck me with me every second after I saw it. I watched the video of it so many times that it actually wore out and I had to buy a new one. See this movie before you find yourself attracted to some of the action-drama dreck that gets released today.***1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this film is perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns. Summed up in simple terms as one of the greatest films of all time. Why? For me it sums up all the good things about the comic book, keeps true to the origins (mostly), and adds extras that only serve to excite us further. The bat-gadgets that so fascinated us in the first movie are back, better than ever, and the villians are just supurb.Michaels Keaton and Gough are back, as are Pat Hingle as Gordon, and whoever played the mayor. It is important to keep these key players the same, because while not actually relying on the first movie, this can say to the viewer 'Remember when this happened?', and we can identify with them more.Thats where the next two films failed, because the images were so different than we were used to, we were watching a completely different series of characters which no one could identify with.Penguin and Catwoman were played excellently by DiVito and Pfeiffer (very sexy), and Walken was good as the evil (if rather confused) Max Schrek. The batmobile was great again, and the costumes were still believeable, little did we know that this would be the last time we would see them as they were intended. A great foray into fantasy.

		<shortDescription>It was wonderful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns was very good. The backgrounds made an nice-looking atmosphere going perfectly with the story and the different moments in the film. The story was basicly simple, but became better when Penguin and Catwoman met each other to ally up against Batman. There are things I did'nt understand, like when Celina Kael dies and cats bite her and then she gets back to life and has a weird cat influence. But this phenomenon was there to add some mystery to this dark movie. Batman is again fighting the bad guys, and living as Bruce Wayne, the nice billionaire. But there is one detail that everyone should forget to say the movie was at least a bit intelligent;forget that people don't recognize his voice when he has his Batman costume! But still this film was a lot of fun. This is a superhero movie, like the first Batman (not the other two things they called Batman Forever and Batman and Robin!!!!), these were the best superheroes movies of these years! But when you think about it, Batman is not really a superhero;he's just a man wearing a cape and a mask and who has a car named The Batmobile and a weird gun! BUT STILL THIS FILM, LIKE THE OTHER BATMAN WAS A LOT OF FUN AND HAD A TIM BURTON'S DARK ATMOSPHERE!!!I give it 81%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly the last great of the Batman films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Batman at its finest. Keaton and Pfieffer have electrifying chemistry; DeVito delivers as the Penguin, mayoral prospect turned pariah; Christopher Walken turns out a humorous performance of corporate cannibal Max Shreck; Burton's creatively chilling visions of Gotham and the old zoo truly capture the eye (even more so than the cathedral and tall skyscrapers of the original); Elfman's score is simply astounding, mournfully majestic, and never fails to completely encompass the mood of a character or scene. Siouxsie and the Banshees theme song "Face to Face" definitely suits the style and atmosphere of the film more than the artist formerly known as Prince and U2, combined. Returns is by far the best of the series, as well as one of the best sequels of all time, a visual masterpiece to be long remembered.The original film is excellent, as it introduces Batman to the city of Gotham and allowing Bruce revenge for the death of his parents. There had to be a second film, however, that showed Batman as a renowned hero to the city, to fulfill his shoes as a super hero. Returns is that film, as well as one of the few sequels to surpass the quality of the original (Like The Godfather and Toy Story), based on the opinion that this is the STORY of Batman whereas the original was merely the prologue, the introduction (although Robert Wuhl is greatly missed in this picture).This is Michael Keaton's sexiest role, and the sexiest Batman. He is the first, the best, the only. Batman has a great deal to do with sex appeal (at least on the big screen), while Bruce Wayne is about humanity's flaws. Keaton is the only actor to pull off both these characteristics. While Kilmer and Clooney are hunks as Bruce Wayne, their faces are altered, for the worse, by the mask. Kilmer's face is suctioned onto the rubber and Clooney is eaten alive by it. Keaton, on the other hand, is not disfigured by the mask. He looks sexier as Batman than as Bruce Wayne, as it should be, and his Batman is sexier than both his successors hunky Bruce Waynes and clumsy Batmans. Keaton has those bright green eyes shining against the dark makeup, and those luscious, lick-able lips of his, oh my. Keaton is the sexiest Batman, and also the most believable Bruce Wayne. He is the only actor of the three to successfully disguise himself, remaining nearly unrecognizable behind the mask (not to mention he can actually pull off comedic scenes. The others were just too stiff). He alters his voice and the duplicity of his disguise is believable. The other two are plainly obvious (to the extent of Clark Kent and his glasses) and easily identified. The Batsuit in Returns, along with Keaton's face, are the most effective in concealing Batman's true identity.The relationship between Bruce and Selina is better written and played out than that of either Vale or Meridian (was there even a love interest in the fourth?). The recognition of Batman's identity in Returns is one of the most breathtaking scenes of the series, and greatly surpasses that of Vale simply walking into the Batcave unscathed and unconcerned. Returns also integrated its predecessor into the story. Vicki is mentioned, along with her sudden departure from Bruce's life. I was disappointed with Forever when neither Vale nor Catwoman's presence are breached upon. It's as if this is a different city and a different Batman (which they practically are, Harvey Dent went from being the smooth talking Billy Dee Williams to the southern drawled Tommy Lee Jones). The Bruce and Selina relationship is by far the most promising and befitting of the series. It makes the most sense and falls more into character than any of the others. Pfieffer's Catwoman is a stunning performance by a stunning actress, and she truly is the highlight of the film.The missile mounted penguins aren't a problem, as it follows the fantasy of the film and its loose take on reality. The plot, although not the most clever, has its highlights in the fact that every small detail plays a role (Selina's stun gun, Penguin's lists, Batman's boomerang, Max's gun) in the grand scheme. The awkward approach on the villains is also intriguing. The fact that the Penguin wasn't the same as the comics, and that he was a mistreated child with physical deformities (to say the least) adds an obscurity and sympathy to the character that I felt greatly lacked with the Joker (as well as Two-Face, and I won't even start on Mr. Freeze). The other villain, Max Shreck, is a wonderful character (although seeming dull, is actually quite interesting, and well played by the bedazzling Walken), especially his habit of botching up common phrases. "I've got better fish to fry," and "If it works, don't fix it," are just two of the examples that make this character, like the film itself, a gem, truly one of a kind.Batman Returns: 9.995 (rounded up to ten)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First rule in Superhero movies: 2nd is Best!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the first one was vague and virtually plotless, this second entry in the Batman franchise is lavish and darkly beautiful, putting more of Tim Burton's imagination into it.This seems like a rule in superhero movies, to make the second one the better (check out SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II and compare the two).I think all the flaws of the first one is recovered here. We don't have just one, but two intriguing supervillains. Michelle Pfeiffer, seductive and sly, as Catwoman ("hear me roar") in a slinky, leather catsuit, and Danny DeVito as a short, ugly Penguin. The details into how they become who they are is obviously implausible, but that doesn't matter.Tim Burton has alot to say of his so-called evil and gruesome characters.If you look close enough, you will see that Christopher Walken's Max Shreck is the true villain. While Catwoman and the Penguin are wronged victims out for impossible revenge. Pfieffer and Keaton are steamily sexy together, paired up with both of their alter egos. But nothing beats the kinkiness of Catwoman on top of Batman, her feline kiss, and the conversation between the deadliness of kisses and mistle toes.The adult situations and scariness of this sequel might disturb young children, so it is probably smarter to let them view the immature and pointless violence of THE POWER RANGERS.But for the grown-ups who aren't afraid of admitting the love of absurdity like this, and the sophisticated kids, this is artsy action/adventure with a soul and a brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie, it's definately my favourite of the 4 live-action Batman movies. However, be advised that, like the other three, it's not really that true in spirit to the comic. For that you have to see the brilliant animated series and movies. But Returns is a lot of fun as a stand-alone movie; like the first it features a career-defining performance from one of the villains (Michelle Pfeiffer, amazingly intense as Catwoman) and a lot of gothic eye candy. This time, though, the dialogue is snappier, the humour is more sophisticated, and the characters (while cartoonish) are more interesting. The Penguin, here a grotesque monster who bears little resemblance to his comic book counterpart, is a bit of an acquired taste; I found him hilarious. There's a third villain, Max Shreck (which also happens to be the name of the actor who played Nosferatu--there's a hint for you), an evil industrialist played by Christopher Walken in one of my favourite performances from him. Some feel that 3 villains was too many, but I found them each very interesting. Oh yeah, and then there's Batman, Michael Keaton again. He plays second fiddle to the villains this time out (though he gets a few nice scenes with Pfeiffer). But personally I didn't mind. You'll notice Batman does a lot more fighting and stuntwork this time, that's because the batsuit was actually light enough not to hamper movement in this one. Finally, I'll mention Michael Gough, who plays Alfred--he's consistantly great in each of the movies, and this is his best, with lots of dry one-liners. As for the movie as a whole, it reminds me of one of those screwball farces from the 30s, like His Girl Friday (or, more recently, The Hudsucker Proxy) only conceived as a dark Burton fantasy and with action scenes. THere's LOTS of detail and throwaway lines in this, it rewards repeat viewings. Lots of fun for those of you with a somewhat off-kilter taste in movies, and requires you to lay aside expectations, but well worth it! 8.5/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Batman introduced us to the main character, Bruce Wayne by day and Batman by night. In both films he is played marvelously by Michael Keaton. Another excellent trait from the first is the flamboyant and extremely enjoyable performance by Jack Nicholson. Now comes the second film which is better than the first by far. The story is more intriguing and the characters provide brilliant background to an awesome story. I love this movie on the basis of its special effects, make-up, and the performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito. I couldn't have found a more perfect actor to play the Penguin than the incomparable Danny DeVito. He has the movie's funniest lines and creates a character very unique and memorable. The story is too complex to say here since it has many subplots but believe me, it's worth your time and money.</fullReview>

I could just sit back and enjoy a two-hour movie of nothing but the vision of his wonderful imagination.But Batman Returns is more than a fancy ride into Burton's world. The strength of Batman-movies has been always the villain characters and this one is the best. The dark, but fascinating character of Penguin is perhaps the most tragic figure ever shown in the movies. And the psychotic relationship between Selina/Catwoman and Bruce/Batman might be the most beautiful love-story ever shown on the screen.I strongly recommend. This just isn't an action movie. And its comedy side has the dark, black touch of Burton in it. He is perhaps the most talented of the directors Hollywood has and this is one of his best works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is dark like the 1st film but more of a fairy theme. Christmas never seems to happen in this film but then I think director Tim Burton has a fascination for the magical anticipation of the run up to Christmas that is such a part of childhood-witness Nightmare Before Christmas too! Burton blends a number of myths and famous stories into this film- e.g. a bit of pied piper, Moses (Oswald Cobblepot being abandoned as a bay and put in a basket in the water) . It's a good basis for his take on the hero.I really feel the film captures the sense of divide between the rich and poor in this world, the costumes and fashion seem heavily influenced by the depression era 1930's fur coats and top hats for the rich, old dull looking clothes for the rest. For a film called "Batman Returns" it's interesting that Batman is hardly in it and there is basically no character development for him. Burton seems more interested in the villains, the Penguin and the morally ambiguous Cat-Woman the later of which sort of goes through quite an arc over the course of the film. In a way I might have preferred a story focused more on the battle between Batman and Cat-Woman and cut out all the silly baby murdering, circus show, giant rubber ducks and flying umbrellas.My main complaint about the film is the use at the end of it of 'rocket strapped commando penguins', the dark Gothic tone was ruined for me at that moment, it just came across as a bit wacky and goofy. De Vito as the penguin though was a great choice and he's clearly having a ball with the role. The film also lacks the strong emotional connection which Bruce Wayne and Alfred have in the Nolan version, in this version though Bruce Wayne is more mature than the Christina Bale version and seems to need less emotional support. The film really succeeds in capturing the comic book feel of Batman with the set design, haunting visuals, great lines and Wonderful villains.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Undeserving Hate, It's Not That Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is directed by Tim Burton and stars Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne, a millionaire living in Gotham City that secretly spends his nights fighting crime as a vigilante called Batman. After the defeat of his greatest villain, the Joker (Jack Nicholson), Batman has done a relatively good job at keeping the streets clean. However, a new villain is on the rise, a deformed man named Oswald Cobblepot (Danny DeVito), that calls himself the Penguin. Batman must find a way to defeat the new evil, all while managing his very complicated relationship with the infamous Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer).While a good amount of people dislike this movie, I actually really enjoy it. I think there are many good elements to Returns, and it may even be as good as the original Batman (1989). Although many criticize Tim Burton's takeover of this film, I don't mind it all that much. This film may not be perfect, but it definitely accomplishes at least one thing: it's fun.The best thing about this movie has got to be the acting. Michael Keaton's Batman, although not my favorite, is legendary. Keaton definitely does a great job as both Bruce Wayne and the caped crusader, and started an amazing legacy. Danny DeVito also plays a near perfect Penguin, and captures a great image of how disturbing and grotesque Oswald really is. Michelle Pfeiffer, although not my favorite Catwoman, does a great job as Selina Kyle, especially in the sequence in which she transitions from normal Selina into Catwoman. Another great casting choice that's overlooked a lot is Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. Walken plays this dirty business man amazingly, and really shows how cruel a person can be.The direction in Batman Returns, I feel, is really good as well. Many people say that Tim Burton went too much Tim Burton on this film, and made it less of a Batman movie, and more of a Burton movie, which I subtly agree with. Although I still think it has more of a Batman feel that a Burton feel, I do see where those accusations come in play. Certain factors of Returns overly captures the oddness of Burton, and, while that can be good, it goes a bit overboard.My complaints with this movie really lie with small things, and aren't anything big, for instance the sexual element of the film, mostly revolving around Catwoman. Catwoman is a sexy, sleek character in both the comics and films, and that's a good thing, because it adds to the complications between her and Bruce. However, she's just a complete slut in Batman Returns. Not only does she friggin' lick Keaton's face, she has some very sexual dialogue, specifically in "the scene" with the Penguin (you know the one). There are many infamous lines throughout the movie, and about 80% of them come from banter between Selina and Oswald. I'm not going to provide examples, because I don't know who's going to be reading this, but just go under the "quotes" section on IMDb: there's some weird lines in this movie.Another small complaint I found in the film is the vividness of Gotham. Although Tim Burton made his two Batman films dark, Gotham itself doesn't seem too depressing. This is mostly thanks the giant bronze statues positioned throughout the city, and the giant lit up Christmas tree. As far as the statues, they stuck around for Joel Schumacher's Batman films, and we all know how those ended up. Burton makes the city dark, yes, but there are certain parts of the film that just take away from the grittiness that the filmmakers tried to inspire.The last point I'll hit is another positive, and that's the costumes and makeup, specifically on Danny DeVito. The disgusting, round body piece that DeVito had to wear (watch the special features), and the amazing prosthetics on his face, mostly the crooked, pointy nose, are fantastic. The extremities that were involved in making the Penguin look just how disturbing he does is unfathomable to think about. Danny DeVito, who spent five hours in makeup each day, really dedicated himself to this role, and earned any money that Batman Returns provided him with.In conclusion, Batman Returns gets a lot of undeserving hate, and really is a good film, both in Batman terms and in just general terms. Anybody should see this movie, especially if you're a fan of either Batman or Tim Burton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tim Burton film, more than a Batman film - which isn't necessarily a bad thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Re-watching the two Burton "Batman"s I was shocked to find I liked "Batman Returns" more than the 1st. True, the film has nothing to compare with the wonderful over-the-top craziness of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, but in some ways Nicholson so overpowered the 1st film that it felt out of balance. At the same time, and ? for me ? even more problematic were the very un-Tim Burton like touches (the Prince songs? the endless, not very exciting climactic battle, the weak CGI) that seemed grafted on to make some studio executive happy."Batman Returns" seems much more a Tim Burton film; weirder, more perverse, funnier and more unpredictable than its predecessor. While the film lacks Nicholson's magic, it gains a great, funny, and twistedly sexy performance by Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, her dark, dual personality mirroring Batman/Bruce Wayne's schizophrenic existence, and drawing these two "enemies" together like moths to flame.Also fun and often fascinating are Danny DeVito's so pathetic you could almost like him, but so dark he's unredeemable Penguin. And Christopher Walken is a blast comparatively underplaying evil capitalist billionaire Max Schrek. The film looks gorgeous, arguably better than the first. And if the production design can't match the grandeur of Anton Furst's sets for "Batman". these have a lot more Tim Burton surrealist fun-house/nightmare aesthetic. What's missing is much of a clear plot, story elements coming and going a bit randomly. And, like the first film, "Batman" himself is made less interesting than the bad guys. But Burton has always been at his best exploring outsider characters, and creating nightmare dreamscapes, and he gets to do a lot more of that here. As one critic put it; this is a somewhat weaker "Batman" film, but a much better Tim Burton film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comic book movies hold no appeal for me. At least the modern ones. I loved the first two Superman movies back in the 1970s. But that's about it.This comic book movie is a cut above most of them due to the performances of Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, and Danny DeVito. I prefer it to the first Batman, or the subsequent ones. My favorite scene is when Walken confronts Pfeiffer in the office after hours. He's thrillingly alert.The score by Elfman is above average. The set design is predictably spectacular.Michael Keaton really jumped the shark with Batman, and he's nothing special here. For 7 years, from Night Shift to The Dream Team, he was one of America's most interesting big screen performers. After Batman he turned into a smug, pretentious bore. What a downfall. Marrying that pornstar may have been part of the problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Movie is definitely Tim Burton's best movie in the 90's, it gives the viewer the batman vibe that was untouched for years, in this film we see a different batman, a batman that has returned but this time he is more bat than man.I enjoyed Tim Burton's "spooky" take on batman, his directing seemed to be very dark the camera angles he chose however seemed to give the viewer a slight uncomfortable experience, which is not necessarily a bad thing since it makes the viewer get more engaged with the film.As a viewer I really enjoyed the story and how it was structured, as we begin with a short back-story about the penguin, and then we see how Bruce Wayne has been doing after he defeated the joker (in the last film) what made the story really appealing was the creepy yet realistic vibe that I personally felt it gave out.The screenplay is funny yet creepy, as we see a different version of the penguin, in which he lived in the sewer which I felt really matched the theme of this film, the things the characters said and did really made since I felt that Burton took the names of these characters in a very literal manner, for example cat woman was so much like a cat that she actually kept licking her hands and penguin was so much like a real penguin that he ate raw fish, I think this was what made the film really interesting.Though the casting in this film got negative reviews, I really enjoyed it and felt that it made sense, Dany DeVito who was at the hight of his carrier plays the penguin which was the best interpretation of the penguin to date in my opinion, he made the penguin sound, he ate raw fish, he walked like a penguin, he had penguin hands, he had a penguin like body it was brilliant! I also enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer's take on cat woman, personally I liked the 60's cat woman more but she was still really good, and creepy as well. Michael Keaton as batman, which we have seen before, was great I think that he is definitely one of the best batmen to date, he was not too dark, he moved like a bat and he fought like a bat, I also enjoyed his take on Bruce Wayne.The props involved with this film were great I loved the bat suit and the bat-mobile in this film is definitely my favorite. Overall, I strongly recommend watching this film as it is a brilliant, fun and creepy batman film it is definitely one of Burton's best movies to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Different Batman Entry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello readers, I am back with another review, this time about one of the most controversial super-hero movies of all time, BATMAN RETURNS. The film opens with a young penguin being thrown into the sewer by his hateful parents. This calls for Danny Elfman's new musical score to come in. Already I can see how dark this film is going to be than the previous. The reason of this is that Tim Burton had the freedom to make a Batman film the way he liked it which makes for a bizarre and Gothic entry... due to the great success of the first installment that is. So the film then proceeds with an awesome action scene where Batman returns. Then we get a scene with Max Shrek confronting the Penguin played by Danny DeVito who is so freaky and compelling in this film. I always wondered, who the hell taught The Penguin how to talk? The scene is quite scary and now we are finally assured that we are in for one hell of "BURTON" type film. Why didn't he just make another film with this kind of style, why do it to poor Batman? Anyway Max Shrek throws Selina Kyle out of a window and when she lays on the ground a pack of cats start well ravaging her until she comes too in a frightening scene. We then get a scene of Selina loosing her mind thus becoming the film's second villain, Catwoman. The rest of the film drags with fake action scenes and bizarre confrontations. They film becomes very un-enjoyable during the half way point and just becomes ultimately weird. I mean look at all these scenes, there's the bit when Penguin bites this guys nose, Penguin eats a raw fish, Catwoman and Batman get all frisky and it just seems to be more of a BEETLE JUICE film than a Batman film. I mean seriously Tim, why not just make your own bloody movie! Why just completely weird-out the Batman series and thus create Batman Forever! Along with the just as bad Batman And Robin. After a mind bendingly stupid plan by The Penguin we reach the final battle which features a pretty cool scene with Michael Keaton turning around to see the helpless Penguin as sparks pop behind him. So the film finishes with a mystery which leaves me hoping for another Burton film which was never made due to parents, believe it or not! That's your fault for making it all dark and weird Tim! And, yeah the film is OK and with no doubt isn't as bad as most claim but here ends my review for Batman Returns, the wonderfully different entry to the Batman legacy. See you soon for further reviews or you can check out my previous ones...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this one, Catwoman, and Penguin join the cast. I was not a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer in this movie, she just got on my nerves. I think Anne Hathaway is a much better Catwoman. But Danny Devito as The Penguin, he does not get the credit he deserves for that performance, it was great! No Heath Ledgers' Joker, but still great. But one thing, this is no Batman lore. . . . Tim Burton must have NEVER read a Batman comic in his life. But, it's still a great movie, though it's very weird, you'll still enjoy it. It's a good time period. Even if it doesn't follow much Batman lore. You'll enjoy it, check it out, I highly recommend it if you want a good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"An embarrassing lack of juice"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a tendency for directors with a unique look began to dominate cinema more than ever in the 90s. Directors like Tim Burton have a kind of mainstream popularity and creative control only really enjoyed by Cecil B. DeMille and Alfred Hitchcock in the classic era. This meant that, after a certain point, whatever project Tim Burton took on, it looked like a Tim Burton movie. When he filmed Batman in 1989, it was very much a Batman flick, but when he returned for the sequel, armed with the commercial bankability and industry respect that the first picture had earned him, was far more able to twist the production to his own vision.Burton was never outstanding at basic film-craft (otherwise he could be making dramas), but his substantial genius lies in his visual arts. Somewhat atypically for a director, he would have his production design team base everything on his own sketches. His instantly recognisable forms ? a mix of Gothic nightmare and twee Americana ? dominate Batman Returns. It's almost so much here that the sheer weirdness of it all overshadows the comic-book antics. There's also a lot of "clever business" too such as the point-of-view shot of the young Penguin looking out through the bars of his crib being mirrored by a point-of-view shot of his older self looking through the sewer grate. It is very Burton-esque to show things from the perspective of the villainous freak ? and certainly very unusual for the mainstream.As can be expected, the cast members are a suitably over-the-top bunch. Danny de Vito hams it up gloriously with humour and just a little pathos. Michelle Pfeiffer milks those terribly corny lines for all they are worth. Add Christopher Walken into the mix and it seems the writers were spread-betting when it came to throwing in traditional Batman villains. As a result poor old Michael Keaton in the title role is a bit lost, which is a pity because he was excellent in the 1989 predecessor. The most honourable mention goes to Michael Gough, reprising his role as Albert the butler. You have to admire his dryness when he Pfeiffer recommends he pen a dirty limerick for the occasion, and he informs her one has just sprung to mind.Batman Returns is several notches below the earlier movie. It is simply too much of a collision between Burton's world and Batman's world, but there are a few things to be salvaged from the wreckage. For all its basic incoherence, the picture is filled with a wonderful dark humour and numerous silly ideas. Far from a classic, it is at least a good bit of fun, and of course it looks pretty good too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns A Decent Sequel But With Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a decent sequel but with some of the same flaws that were in the first one by Tim Burton. I re-watched the original and this one after seeing writer/director Christopher Nolan's take on the popular comic book character with Batman Begins and the Dark Knight which are so much better than Burton's no offense. Director Tim Burton does an okay job making this sequel but some problems weigh it down which I'll get into later. Michael Keaton reprises the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman whose decent as the character but he isn't as good as Christian Bale in my opinion. He wasn't able to bring the presence Bale brought to the character. Keaton however does what he can with what very little he was given. Danny Devito had a little more to work with as The Penguin and he's okay despite shouting a lot of his lines. DeVito is a good actor but this isn't his best performance. It maybe because I just don't find the Penguin that interesting of a villain but DeVito still turns in a solid performance none the less as the short grotesque and deformed enemy of the Dark Knight. Michelle Pffiefer fared much better as Selina Kyle/Catwoman turning in a solid performance as the dangerous femme fatale. Burton probably should have chosen just one of them to be the villain for this film because their story arcs felt rushed at times because Pfieffer does an impressive job with her role. Well done. Christopher Walken does his best as Max Shreck a psychotic businessman who helps The Penguin run for mayor. Walken sort disappears for much of the second half only to reappear for the third act but he's okay in the role. The rest of the cast are so-so but none of them are memorable. Michael Gough as Alfred and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon have what amounts to a few extended appearances which is disappointing because their characters could've been handled much better. They both do what their roles require I guess though. The action sequences are well executed but none of them are exciting or intense as the ones in Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. The dialog was once again cheesy at times and many characters like Harvey Dent for one aren't even in it or mentioned making their appearances in the first one seem totally pointless. Like Burton's first Batman one of the biggest problems is that this sequel seemed to focus mainly on the Penguin and Catwoman instead of the title character himself especially in the first hour. Keaton doesn't even show up until over 12 minutes into the film. He makes a brief extended appearance with very little dialog for an action sequence and then his character disappears until almost 40 minutes into the movie since most of the beginning centers on The Penguin and Selina Kyle's Catwoman. For a while it seemed Keaton has a cameo in his own movie which didn't help in the long run. After that initial first 40 minutes luckily he's in it more but Keaton seemed to get cheated out of some more much needed development and screen time again. I didn't realize just how little these films actually focused on the Dark Knight until I decided to recently re-watch them. It's always not a good idea to focus more on the villains than the main character because he's the one the audience is going to care about. I thought this problem was solved with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight because at least those films focused much more on Bruce Wayne/Batman especially Begins. The Dark Knight felt like an ensemble piece and by the end I think Bale got just as much screen time as the late Heath Ledger, Aaron Echkhart, and Gary Oldman. That film focused on the four of them evenly giving all four actors plenty of moments to develop their characters and shine. Overall Batman Returns isn't that bad of a sequel it just could have been better. I recommend Batman Begins and The Dark Knight to any fan of the comic book character because both films are entertaining fast paced action crime dramas and worth the time to watch. Batman Returns had potential to be a good sequel only it ended up being somewhat of a letdown compared to Nolan's two superior films on the Cape Crusader. Yeah it has some cool action, a little dark humor, and solid performances by the cast (Keaton, Devito, and especially Pfeiffer) but I just wish the film itself was a lot better than it turned out to be. I'd chose Nolan's two Batman movies any day over this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a film that definitely disturbed some people. You know why that probably is? Because of The menacing Penguin, who is just disgusting to look at. Batman Returns is more of what a Tim Burton film should look like. The film is creepy, dark, and disturbing and gross at times. Now i'm not saying that the original film was bad, but it had it's flaws. It lacked the excitement, Jack Nicholson didn't seem that evil, and it was occasionally boring. Batman Returns is exciting, both Michelle Pheifer and Danny Devito are great as villains, and it's not boring. There are no flashbacks ion this film. That's because we know what happened to him. We know enough about the guy in the bat costume. We learn more about the Penguin than Batman in this film. From the minute Batman Returns starts you'll be creeped out. After seeing this film, my thoughts on Penguins changed a lot. Batman Returns is a better sequel with a better cast. Including:Michael Keaton(You know what he's been in)Danny Devito(It's alway sunny in Philadelphia)Michelle Pheifer(Wolf, The Fabulous Baker Boys)Christopher Walken(Click, Mousehunt)I will come out and say this now. Michelle Pheifer looked hot in that leather outfit. There's something about women in leather outfits that make me watch a movie. Sometimes. Like the Underworld films, Kate Beckinsale looks good, as usual. But i'll see anything with Kate Beckinsale anyways. Danny Devito is disgusting and menacing as The Penguin. A lot has improved on Batman Returns. I didn't love the film, but it's definitely a good entry.The Plot: Batman returns yet again and this time he must face the menacing and horrifying Penguin. The Penguin is actually running for mayor after he saves The Mayor's baby. Or, supposedly saves the mayor's baby. Batman must also face Catwoman, a sexy seductress with Cat-like reflexes. Catwoman is also Batman's love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton had made by far a most spectacular and brooding joyride with the original Batman. Then, three years later, people flocked into cinemas to see this remake of Tim Burton's masterpiece. I have to say though, there are some good elements to this sequel, but are weighed down by the bad elements. Like the villains. Danny DeVito captures the Penguins personality perfectly, but Michelle Pfeiffer is totally unconvincing as Catwoman. How come she tries to kill Batman, but is romantically attracted to him? Michael Keaton gives another good performance as Batman, but has too few scenes in the film. And don't get me started on Christopher Walken and his bad haircut! Anton Furst's Gotham City was so much better than this new production designer's. But, I must admit there are some moments of the film that held me to my seat.The second best of the early Batman anthology, some scenes will have you captivated, others will have you yawning.Batman Returns 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now the parts I enjoyed with the original Batman, are not in this one. This movie is just too dark. It's no longer a Batman film, it has become a boring crime film with another "hero". Micheal Keaton wasn't ever a good Batman and showed it being number 2 to the Joker. Now he's number 3 to Penguin and Catwoman. I do like Catwoman in this movie but I don't understand the Penguin. He's nothing like the comic book Penguin that was clever and suave. Danny Devito shows a just disgusting excuse for a villain. The only thing in this entire movie I like was the Bruce Wayne, Serlina romance. I liked how they were attracted not only as Batman, but as Catwoman as well. Though not even romance can save this train wreck you could call a Batman movie.</fullReview>

Iliked Danny DeVito's rendition of the Penguin, well portrayed like thecomic book villain, but I can't say as much for the film.Batman Returns introduces the Penguin as a pitiable child abandoned byhis parents and raised by penguins, but I really can't figure out howexactly that relates to the rest of the film, even with the reference toit later on. Why would a person so rejected be so eagerly welcomed bythe films only non-super villain?The catwoman side story also failed to make much sense, or inspire me. The Selina Kyle of the comic books is more of a semi-renegade thief witha heart, but that doesn't explain why she would fall for the Batman. Ican understand her appreciation for the cat, but the character wasn'texplained as well as I thought it could be.I'll admit it has been a while since I saw Batman Returns, but I didn'tlike it much then, and I doubt a second viewing would significantlychange that opinion. The first Batman had plenty of jokes to keep themood somewhat light, Batman Returns lacked that sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most anticipated movies in my life, and by far the biggest disappointment. It is hard to believe that Tim Burton directed both this and the original Batman. I went to see it with my brother on something like the second day it was released. The theater was jam packed, and there was a lot of chatting. When the advertisement stopped, and the movie started many people cheered. When they showed Michael Keaton for the first time, many more people cheered, it was pretty nuts. The excitement from the audience very slowly died down and at the end of the movie no-one clapped, no-one cheered, we just all cleared the full theater, most of us with dull looks on our faces.I think the worst part of the movie was the animal element. There were a bunch of bats, a bunch of cats, and a bunch of penguins. The character to take the animal mania the furthest was Catwoman. She licked herself clean, she purred, she crawled like a cat, and oh yeah, she had nine lives. Did we need any of this? Penguin in the comic books wasn't a penguin, he was a fat guy in a tuxedo. Catwoman wasn't a cat, and Batman wasn't a bat.Why must all good comic book movies have sequels that are so silly? We need more people who understand the comic books, and less people who have no problem with making them look real stupid. I'm glad that Burton stopped making Batman movies, but I'm afraid his successor did the same thing with HIS second Batman movie..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Christopher Walken show...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BATMAN RETURNS has the distinction of featuring more memorable villains than any other comic book-based feature film. We have Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (in a role that would've been better served by Sean Young, if you ask me) and Danny DeVito as the mutant Penguin- but it's Christopher Walken as Max Shreck who steals the show: his delivery is the reason. When he catches secretary Selina Kyle going through his files looking for evidence of corruption, he asks her: "And how exactly did you access confidential files..." And here his voice drops to a mere whisper as he concludes: "...May I ask...?" In a movie chock full of what were probably meant to be witty quips (there's very little real dialogue in the film, but that's okay, it's implied: this is only a "comic book movie"), Walken's handling of almost throwaway lines is masterful. Catwoman's costume is sexy, to be sure, and the Penguin is one of the most horrific creatures to ever waddle through a comic book cum movie, but it's Walken as Shreck who really stands out. (Oh, and Michael Keaton is still great as Batman.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's the so-called normal guys who always let you down" !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie for the first time was unforgettable nightmarish experience. I remember ranking it as one of the worst sequels, rather movies, I have ever seen. The time was momentarily excruciating. The dark atmosphere wasn't a Hollywood falsity. Danny DeVito as the penguin was totally awful, creepy, and no funny at all. He was outrageously ugly, too sexually suppressed, moving in great uproar, roaring non-stop and gushing black liquid out of his mouth. In brief, a devil from hell would have been nicer ! Michael Keaton himself seemed spiritless, acting indifferently as if he's forced to do the job, being the movie's least interesting character. Overall it ranged between gloomy and dreadful. Even the slight comedy was very black. Everything and everyone looked factitious, so hyped and none-enjoyable. And at the last climactic sequence I wanted to kill myself better. Did I say that I don't like the Batman character in the first place ?!After 10 years or so, I re-watched it; you know these times when you re-watch your top bad movie to recall what did you hate in it (a little bit of exploring yourself), to review how low can Hollywood go sometimes (a little bit of schadenfreude), or maybe to just punish yourself (a little bit of Masochism ?!).Anyway, I discovered that it is not utterly the Hollywood formula to picture a superhero. There is one bold and deep satire where the businessman and the politicians are exactly the society's rich robbers and ruthless killers. Added to their victims, like (Catwomon), who were literally killed by them to know that honesty is a kiss of death in this world, and if you can't beat them join them. This poisoned society of Gotham (or Gothic Sodom), which's nothing but a dark portrayal of the modern materialistic America, had been done so darkly to extreme degree. The movie looks like nothing but a disturbing film. Although I believe (Burton) learned the lesson early, understanding that in Hollywood ? at the best of times ? you give the studio what they want (Batman, Planet of the Apes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) to let them give you what you want (Edward Scissorhands, Mars Attacks, Big Fish). But unfortunately this time he gave the studio what they wanted in a way they didn't want ! So it was natural that they deposed crazy Burton as a director, making 2 more sequels of their big and loud flicks, however TOO DAMN COLORFUL and MEANINGLESS to extreme degree as well !Few times in the American cinema, there was a dialog could be this smart. Review with me these examples : You gotta admit I played this stinkin' city like a harp from hell. (The Penguin). Women. Nothing surprises me, Chip, except your late mother. Who'd have thought Selina had a brain to damage. Bottom line, she tries to blackmail me, I'll drop her out a higher window. Meantime, I got better fish to fry. (Maximillian 'Max' Shreck). You poor guys. Always confusing your pistols with your privates. (Catwoman). Life's a bitch. Now so am I. (Catwoman). You didn't invite me, so I CRASHED! (The Penguin). Just the pussy I've been lookin' for! (The Penguin to Catwoman). I may have saved the mayor's baby, but I refuse to save a mayor who stood by helpless as a baby. (The Penguin to a crowd of voters). Two lives left. I think I'll save one for next Christmas. But in the meantime, how about a kiss Santi-Claus? (Catwoman). Why is there always someone who brings eggs and tomatoes to a speech?! (The Penguin while being bombarded by food). Actually, this is all just a bad dream. You're at home, in bed, heavily sedated, resting comfortably, dying from the carcinogens you personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice, you tell me! ! (The Penguin). You are the coolest role-model a young person could have. / And you're the hottest young person a role-model could have ! (Volunteer Bimbo &amp; The Penguin).According to my comment's title / a quote from this very movie, Burtun doesn't love what's normal. See his movies to know that well. So it isn't about loving the term "Super", it's more about dealing with it differently, or abnormally; if we want the right word to it. This is a different interpretation of a superhero movie. It is serious satirical fantasy, avoiding being a joke or pure action ride. The comic book movie wasn't less naive like this before, the problem though is that it wasn't more heavy like this before either ! You may love it, or hate it. I hated it highly at first, then respected its difference later. Not all the movies have to be the same thing. About "loving" though, it's clear that ? in the second viewing ? I loved its selection of evil powers, its dialog, and finally sure Pfeiffer's moment when she was talking about going to school without underwear !Despite the fact that (Batman Returns) looks and feels like Danny DeVito as the penguin for most of the time, it is very rare; as abnormal Hollywood movie. If you love the kind, this one won't "let you down".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns, but he probably shouldn't have bothered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns (well sort of) in the sequel to the 1989 smash hit. This feels much more like a Tim Burton project and much less like an actual Batman film. Batman is here of course, but he has a much more subdued role to play in proceedings and Returns likes to concentrate on its villains a lot more than it does on the caped crusader. It became infamous at the time due to many complaining about its violence and grim tone. Yet that's not the issue, the first film had a dark tone, as the problems lie with the storyline and the ideas the film tries to bring to life.Story: The bizarre story features the Penguin, deformed and abandoned as a child, rise from the sewers and attempt to become mayor of Gotham with the help of shady businessman Max Shreck. Elsewhere, Catwoman is created after Shreck attempts to kill his secretary and she causes havoc around Gotham. It's up to Batman to find out their plans and stop them. The plot is all over the place and makes little sense. It doesn't make sense why the Penguin would want to be mayor and Catwoman has no motivation to do what see does. Batman just seems to be shoehorned into things as the villains are given no reason to be against him and he barely gets any screen time, again this is meant to be Batman 'Returns'.Batman: Keaton returns and he's given very little to do here. His Batman is still enjoyably mysterious and brooding, even if he is too cruel. His Bruce Wayne is pretty dull and doesn't act like Wayne should, he's too awkward and not the charismatic playboy we should expect. There's not enough separation with both roles either, when he's Bruce he just acts like Batman without the mask. He doesn't get enough screen time to make a big impression and has no arch which just makes him feel wasted.Villains: Danny DeVito plays the grotesque Penguin and he's nothing like the Penguin should be. It's just a bad character, he's just a freak and has none of the wit or charm needed for the role. We don't feel sorry for him and we don't care about his plight because the character is unsympathetic. DeVito gets into the role and looks ideal, but that's it. Michelle Pfeiffer is having fun as Catwoman and looks fantastic, but once again this isn't the true Catwoman. She isn't a thief and her interest in Batman seems like it was thrown in at the last minute. As said, her motivations make little sense and she just isn't that interesting to begin with. A disgruntled secretary who wants to try to get revenge on her boss, it's pretty weak for a Batman film.Support: Christopher Walken is wasted as Shreck. He's a wonderful actor and could have been superb in a creepy role, but Shreck has no substance. If you took the character out then it wouldn't make much of a difference. Michael Gough is great again and is given a little more to do here which is nice. Pat Hingle is given even less to do than before and his Gordon is useless, he has about 4 lines and his relationship with Batman is non-existent.Action: Burton isn't great at shooting action and it shows here. The opening fight scene is clumsy and just has Batman letting the Batmobile do all of the work. The little fights with Catwoman are pretty daft and the climax just has things exploding which gets dull. The issue is that Batman does a lot of un-Batman things here. He sets some guy on fire, plants a bomb on another and throws acid at Catwoman. It's very distracting and so out of place.Music: Danny Elfman's score is easily one of the highlights of the film. It is a lot more subdued, brooding and darker than before with some wonderfully haunting melodies as well as some suitably upbeat stuff when needed. It perfectly fits the wintery, Gothic look that the film possesses. I'd go as far as to say that this is Elfman's best score.Production: The best thing about the film is its look. The cinematography is truly spectacular. The sets look aptly gloomy and some of the building designs look great, especially Wayne Manor. The idea to set it at Christmas is also really clever as we get many beautifully atmospheric shots of snow falling and the wintery landscapes. The scene at the party with Bruce and Selina is done well too. Yet, similar to the following two films the writing gets silly. I don't want to hear Penguin spewing sexual puns like there's no tomorrow and Batman looks dumbfounded far too much (just look at his failure to save the Ice Princess). It too out of character and it's hard to know what the writers were thinking. There's no big set-pieces either here which harm the film. The opening with the Penguin as Moses is flat and nothing exciting happens in the climax. Conclusion: At the end of the day Batman Returns is a very flawed film. It has good elements as the look it goes for is wonderful and the score is brilliant, but it has so many daft parts. People point the finger at Schumacher but there's a lot of campy stuff here. A lot of people claim that the film is too dark, but I think that's it just too strange and daft for its own good. Most of the acting is iffy, the plot makes no sense, the action is uninspired and Batman is just a background player in his own film. At least Forever knew it was light and ran with the idea, if this is a serious Batman interpretation then something is very wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Nolah's Trilogy Instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not watch Burton's Batman films while growing up and hence, I do not have the nostalgic love for them. I saw them recently, after having watched Nolah's trilogy, and I am not impressed.Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), an evil businessman and a deformed Penguin (Danny DeVito) plot to take over the city through democratic means; the Penguin runs for the Mayor, with Shreck managing his PR. As expected, Batman comes to the rescue.I found Batman (1989) to be mediocre in every department (apart from the the score) but this movie is simply a joke. The Penguin looks nothing like the bird except for the flippers. His henchmen look like they are dressed for a cheap mummers party; they are more ridiculous than scary. They live in the city's sewer full of water with green paint in it, which is supposedly the toxic waste released from Shreck's factories and the cause of Penguin's deformity. For some reason, there are many penguins living in there. If the chemicals caused mutations in a man, why are the birds quite healthy; aren't they more susceptible? Don't the sewers also carry domestic waste and the Penguin lives there? Isn't the sewer ever inspected? It is movie license I suppose.Remember all the fuss about winning Vicky Vale's heart in the first movie? Well she is just shoved into a couple of passing references in this movie. But who is complaining; Michelle Pfieffer's Selena Kyle/Catwoman looks far more desirable. Her character is annoying as Kyle and her motivations as Catwoman are unclear. But as I said before, she is so luscious, who cares about her motivations as long as she is on screen.Both Penguin and Shreck have evil written all over their faces, it is hard to see the people of Gotham trusting them, especially since they have seen many a super-villain. You would think they would wise up a bit. Whatever.A totally predictable and forgettable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move over Nolan-this is the "dark" knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friends will know I have a mixed opinion of Nolans batman films. Begins was dull, TDK was pretty cool and TDKR....well, we have batman and robin to contend with worst batman movie.I say this as my friends say "the old films are to light hearted" I reply "Go watch batman returns" This film takes influences both from Batman and Burton's film he made just before this, Edward Scissorhands. The latter was Burton's personal favourite film, and for this film, he wanted to bring something new to the table.Batman returns has the Gothic, almost fairy tale like feel of Scissorhands-a dark, twisted fairy tale anyway. This is due to impressive production design, and Danny Elfmans score, which has the choir elements added in for that Burton feel.Keaton returns and once again impresses as batman. He isn't in that much (more than in TDKR though) but he brings a real pressence on screen. He is in my eyes the true Batman. Danny DeVito is the warped penguin and he is a very interesting, if vile, character. A great costume and make up team make him a great villain. Although he is not the crime boss from the comics, the abandoned mutant makes him a more sympathetic villain- only Aaron Eckhart is more sympathetic than penguin in the batman films. Michelle Pfeiffer is the scene stealer here as catwomen. Her demented take on the anti hero is very engaging and she has one of the coolest costumes ever. Finally Christopher Walken appears as corrupt tycoon Max Schrek. He is basically playing himself-which is awesome, as he is Christopher Walken.So we have a strong cast-what about the story? While it's morbid and dark, it's very interesting. Its complex and not realistic but is very powerful-but not uplifting. As for the production, Gotham looks as dark as it will ever look-its mostly set at night. Its a memroble setting, but not comic book-y-more Tim Burton-y. The music gets the tone of the film across very well-Danny Elfman has composed a real gem here.The action however is a bit lackluster-the music holds it together, making it seem more exciting. The biggest problem the film has is that its not a comic book movie-it does change the villains backstories, batman is slightly to immoral and the story doesn't have the simple plots or action to make it a comic book movie. Although its not the best representation of batman or comic book movies, and a disappointment compared to its predecessor, its a great watch if your into the dark worlds of Tim Burton-defiantly the dark knights darkest hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>alright as a movie, pathetic as a batman movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, Michael Keaton is NOT the person to pick to play Batman. Bruce Wayne is supposed to be the young, slick, playboy millionaire. Keaton is middle aged, ugly, balding, short, stocky and NOT slick or suave. Batman is supposed to be badass and menacing. He is a vigilante not the town mascot! He is disturbed and almost as much a problem for the cops as he is for the robbers. Most of all he is supposed to strike fear into his enemies. Keaton simply does not pull this off. He is short, stocky and looks like a kid trying on his dad's clothes when he puts on the suit. Combine that with his rigid movement and pathetic attempt at fighting and he can only succeed at making the criminals laugh.Add to that the pathetic villains -we have the penguin and catwoman, neither of who seem very menacing at all and really pose little threat to Batman. Also, WTH is with the thousands of little penguins with rocketpacks?? I might like this movie if I was a pothead but otherwise the march of the penguins is just too cute for such a dark movie.Burton's trademark dark visuals are really the only good thing about the movie. I always liked his representation of Gotham but this can't save a movie doomed from the get-go by bad casting/choice of villains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre Sequel That Got Too Carried Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on opening night and would start my junior year in college that fall. I initially loved this movie when it first came out and saw it twice in theaters. However, I don't particularly like it as much as I did when it was released. Why? I'll explain all that shortly. First, here's what I do love and still love about Batman Returns. 1: Michael Keaton reprising his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He did an excellent job. 2: Catwoman: Michelle Pheiffer was superb in the role and she not only stole the movie, I felt she was the best thing about Batman Returns altogether. Selina Kyle, the costume, and the attitude and her relationship with Batman both in and out of costume. 3: The Penguin's mutated look and nothing more. Nuff said. 4: Wayne Manor and the Batcave. The only two sets I really liked. 5: Michael Gough as Alfred. 6: As I said before, Batman and Catwoman's relationship as foes and in regular clothes, we see Bruce pursue Selina, unlike the first film where Vicki pursued Bruce. Plus, the reference to Vicki from the last movie gave it a nice touch of continuity.Okay, here's why I don't give Batman returns the high praise given by many. The four Batfilms of the 80's and 90's share a common link when it came to the directors. To me, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher both did good on their first films, but got too carried away with their own visions in their second go around, only Schumacher was worse about it.But yes. I feel that Tim Burton got too carried away with his vision in Batman Returns.1: Gotham City did NOT look like Gotham City. I absolutely refuse to believe that set for downtown Gotham was actually Gotham Square. The Zoo where the Penguin's hideout looked like something of a hybrid of the Nightmare Before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands. 2: The Penguin. While I like Danny DiVito as an actor and the mutant bird man look, the Penguin's storyline was totally disgusting to me. The Penguin was portrayed as an ugly character who was a product of circumstances he could not control (his deformity at birth) I hated his storyline. After watching the Penguin on Batman: The Animated Series, I kept thinking, gee, why couldn't they have done that in Batman Returns? I liked it better when the Penguin is highly intelligent and considers himself a member of Gotham's elite. 3: The Red Triangle Circus Gang. What a sick filthy joke! I really hate these guys with a fierce bloody passion. They made the Penguin look even worse. I would have preferred real underworld thugs in comparison. Tim Burton got too carried away with this part. 4: Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. I liked the concept of the evil businessman, but Shreck's look just did not fit into the Batman universe for me. I'd have rather seen somebody like Rupert Thorne over Shreck any day. 5: I know that Dark Knight fans prefer Batman Returns over the Schumacher films, but I am one of those fans who like the Dynamic Duo, so I am a Robin fan and the fact that he was excluded from this film is one reason I don't care for it as much, even though he had been given a much better costume in the comics. But then again, there was talk about Robin being a street guy played by Marlon Wayans. So I guess I am grateful that Robin wasn't included just for the sake of not messing up a popular character.Overall, I still enjoy watching Batman Returns and I love Danny Elfman's musical score on the soundtrack, but the film got way too Tim Burton-ish for me. Batman and Catwoman really made this movie, even though Batman is once again upstaged by the villains. But to be honest, I like Batman Forever over this installment. Batman Returns to me, is mediocre at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this film is very stylish (and it's able to maintain it that way throughout the movie), it can't make up for a broken up plot that consist of things that are left with out explanation, points in the story that aren't followed through, and points in the plot that feel like they were tagged on like for example, the climax which involves a plot that lacks in build up (it feels like it just came out of no where). The film also in a way falls flat in the action department as the script occasionally resorts to inane dialog and graphic violence that's somewhat uneasy to watch. Plot aside, one underlying problem in this movie is that the title character doesn't really play a central part here (it's really instead centered around Catwoman and Penguin).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Difficulty with Duality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.What Burton brings to the table is a quirky design sensibility. All other elements of his films are conventional Hollywoodisms. But when he hits a sweet spot with that situational and production design, it works. At least it works as a voyage to another planet.His first Batman film was a disaster in this respect: it visually lacked both imagination and control. He knew he screwed up, and this time he fixes nearly everything that was broken the first time around. He still has that dead melodramatic third act, but everything else is great.The city bears some similarities to the Gotham of the first, but he lives in this one. It has a perverted life, rather than the carcass of the first. He literally places his camera among architectural elements of the city this time. The batcave is completely reinvented to be more jagged, dark and schizophrenic. The contrasting ice cave really does contrast: it has light and color and movement and life of a twisted sort. The chemical factory and cathedral of the first was just a set of large props.Someone paid attention: the `world' of the city is blunt industrial, an anti `Metropolis,' largely broken. Michelle's apartment is modeled after the building in Welle's Kafka movie I think. (You can visit that building today.) The cave has organic roughness, a completely different world altogether. This craftily sets the `two-world' theme of Bruce's mind in which we presume this all happens. But the clever introduction of a third design consciousness is what makes this really fly. The ice cave is part sewer and part 1964 New York World's Fair. The structural elements here are so radically different in conception that I can only think that three different talents created these three architectural notions. (Incidentally, we saw these structural elements revived in the recent interiors of the ice cave in `Die Another Day.') Keaton does change character depending on the forces of the surrounding built space. This is a fantasy that perhaps only an architect could appreciate: a visual drama of dual forces within the mind.Even Elfman's honking is better. The `girl' in this one participates in the split world dynamics as well. Very clever writing, this. Michelle's architecture is what she wears, which is another element of the genius in the art design. The problem is that something happened -- I do not know what -- and the effect was messed up at the end when they changed the costume all around. This was in the days when Michelle still had something to offer, and because I have hit her hard on some other films, have to note some informed work here. Most of the body acting is by doubles of course, but her face shots in costume use a knowing device: in `real' life, she acts with her eyes and as Catwoman, she acts with her mouth. That mouth is borrowed from Helena Bonham-Carter. (In fact, when a film actress makes something work, many lessor actresses appropriate it. Its part of the game, and one can have some fun with Michelle's later films guessing who she's imitating.) DeVito is one of our most intelligent actors. Not as an actor, but in his understanding of reflexive notions in humor: his `Momma' was based on Nabokov! As with the Joker before, he's just a disgusting prop here.Esther Cobblepot is a redhead.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BATMAN RETURNS: As the pitiful, orphaned psychopathic freak the Penguin and the power-hungry capitalist villain Max Schreck (named after the actor who played Nosferatu) plot to gain domination over Gotham City, the Caped Crusader battles an equally fatal distraction... Cat Woman. The discussion topics - in Batman Returns An argument could be made for the value of mental health counselling: All masked characters in the film are presented as emotionally dysfunctional.Batman, director Tim Burton was given free rein with its sequel. Batman Returns is more malignant in its style, atmosphere and feeling. Without a doubt Batman Returns will remain the best movie in the series.Batman Returns was unlike any other film I'd experienced. If I had to think of four words that night to describe it, I'd have chosen?Bleak The wintry setting made the theater's air-conditioning that much colder.Raw Like chapped winter skin, the character's emotions envelop you in a sheath of exposed nerve endings.Vulnerable From the opening sequence to the final credits, there's an overwhelming sense of sadness that permeates nearly every frame.Personal I'd never felt such empathy for heroes and villains alike. There are no winners here. Even in victory, there is loss.Whereas other comic book films?X-Men, Fantastic Four, Spider-man?have taken the explosive, CGI, Jerry Bruckheimer route, Batman Returns is subtle, grounded, and real. Batman is a human consumed by the desire for justice. He has no super-human abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Batman's arsenal is made up of exceptional observation skills, a sharp intellect, finely honed physical skills, and the innate ability to emotionally detach from a stressful situation. Burton exploits this humanity as the foundation upon which the film is built.The true power of Batman Returns is found in the character relationships?Before Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, Batman Returns was the crown jewel in this hero's filmatic crown. Even now, it stands the test of time as one of Tim Burton's finest films and a character drama all comic book adaptations should aspire to. If you haven't seen it, now's the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I should watch it in 1992</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what is batman before 2012 . I started watching "Batman begins" and the following two movies and then I get attached to the concept of Batman . Then I started watching "Gotham" and now I decided to watch the 1989 and maybe later I will start reading the comics.The main points that I will comment on are 1- I felt that the movies at that time are more addressed to young audience that to adults . Like when Penguin says I will kidnap all kids . I felt like Disney movie . 2- Now the stories are more realistic than what is was . Like how the penguin is raised inside a Zoo and he looks educated although he never went to school, and the way he controls the Animal Penguins.Over all , I think the movie is excellent and I loved watching it and part of my enjoyment is to see how the movies industry evolving through time not only in terms of technology , but also in term of story telling and roll play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple decades ago when this film came out, I thought the Batman series of films was generally OK. Watching them today I'm left in complete disbelief over how over the top and silly the characters and stories are. DeVito does a good job in portraying the hideous villain in this one, but gosh, the Penguin is absolutely disgusting. Those close-ups of him eating raw fish and oozing blood out of his mouth are gag inducing, making it utterly unbelievable that this was a serious contender for mayor of Gotham City. What were they thinking? Say, do you know there was a real person named Max Schreck? He was a German silent film actor who portrayed the very first movie vampire in 1922's "Nosferatu", one of my favorite classics. So I wonder if Christopher Walken's character in the picture was inspired by the real deal. Interestingly, the word 'schreck' is German for terror, so there may be something to it.As a comic book Batman fan, I can't get too worked up over this picture. Michael Keaton is not my idea of a suitable Bruce Wayne OR Batman actor, and the design of the bat-suit for the movies is too bulky and gawky for me. Seeing a whole closet full of them here was a bit of a surprise, not to mention the accessories. I guess I just never thought about it before; all that high flying action probably causes some damage every now and then.One thing the movie managed to remind me of today is just how long global warming hysteria has been around. An entire new generation has now been propagandized to believe that Man has something to do with impacting the weather. The Penguin's off the cuff remark to 'stop global warming and start global cooling' was almost up to speed in 1992; the world's mean temperature hasn't changed one bit in the last seventeen years as I write this.With a quick nod to Michelle Pfeiffer as a sexy Selina Kyle/Catwoman, that's about as much faint praise I can give the film, and even there I have to hold back. The picture's dialog is filled with double entendres and sexual references, and to my thinking, brings down it's value as family entertainment. I'd rather think of my super-heroes as being more traditional and conservative. But I'll hand it to Max Schreck, even as a greedy capitalist, he fully realized that an economy with one percent growth like we have today simply sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns - The Motherfucking Reckoning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton takes another stab at directing a film starring the beloved caped crusader, The Dark Knight of Gotham City, Batman. Whereas in the first film, Batman felt a bit overshadowed by the campy Joker character, but now Batman has up to three adversaries that you care more about than the title star. Catwoman, a revenge seeking feline imitator. The Penguin, a criminal who was actually raised by penguins. And Max Shreck... And that is it. Sometimes I felt myself actually rooting for Catwoman to kick the snot out of Batman and just due the guy in because Bruce Wayne felt so unimaginative and boring. Which isn't good being as though Tim Burton has the imagination of a hawk's eye and got too wrapped in the visuals of the film. Looking like Gotham is one thing, but feeling like Gotham is another. Tim Burton's direction is not very inventive, although he does seem to know where to go and who to focus on in any given moment. Danny Elfman's score was (of course) the best part of the entire film minus Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as the sexy Catwoman. So what do we have? Pros: #1 - Danny Elfman's Score #2 - Tim Burton's Visual Style #3 - Michelle Pfeiffer/CatwomanCons: #1 - Unimaginative Cinematography #2 - Overshadowing of the Main Character #3 - A Weak Story Without Characters To Match</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi all.....I am here to discuss you about this Tim Burton's batman.First of all it should be praised for its fine art work though its mostly comical and like a toy thing(after seeing Nolans series).I know it is unfair to compare these two as the time frames were different with obviously Nolan having a better advantage of technology and CGI.But the depth is some what not so intense in this Batman movie. One more applause to the person who wrote the dialogues.They are pretty good and catchy.Performance-wise I would say Pfeiffer stole the show followed by DeVito and lastly Keaton himself.I find him very incapacitated or unable to let out his expressions thus lacking dialogues.May be Bruce Wayne's character is such where his alter ego goes suppressed in terms of expressions. I am pretty interested in Batman movies after watching Nolan's series.So i cant rate this more than 7 as per character development,story depth and intensity.It is mostly comical at times with the characters mo-to not given so much depth.Wonder Y she transform's into cat-women after that fall sounds like she is mad. Christopher Walken deserves a special mention as his performance is shrewed,subtle and selfish.Highly capitalistic and manipulative.He is shown as a corporate giant who tries to use corporate style crime's for his benefit. Music was O.K reflecting the dark theme.Bottom Line-Great artistic setting's,comical and not that intense.Lighter vein taken well be children under 15 and a few adolescent's.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns (1992) ** (out of 4)Tim Burton's sequel finds Michael Keaton back as Bruce Wayne and his crime fighting alter ego Batman. This time out he must protect Gotham City from The Penguin (Danny DeVito) who is trying to fool people into electing him Mayor with the help of a crooked business man (Christopher Walken). Also, Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) plans to seek her revenge against the men who have done her wrong. BATMAN RETURNS, much like the previous film, is pretty to look at and it features some terrific supporting performances but like many Burton films I think it suffers from too much style and not nearly enough substance. For the life of me I can't understand why this story would get the green light and especially when you sit back, look at it and see how silly it is. The entire premise seemed to come from an ugly, deformed child being born and then its parents throwing it in the sewer. The second "story" comes from Pfeiffer's character being abused. I personally found both of these characters to be rather sad so it was hard to really root against them no matter what they were actually doing. Another problem is that both of them, along with the Walken character, are much more interesting than our hero. This was true in the first film and it happened again. It's so clear that Burton was in love with the villains that I think he pretty much forgot who the star of the picture was. The film is still worth viewing for the costume design, terrific sets and some pretty amazing cinematography. Of course, you've got some terrific performances from Keaton, Walken and especially DeVito and Pfeiffer.</fullReview>

Meanwhile, Batman (Michael Keaton) ponders the Penguin's pretext, while pursuing Catwoman with and without his cowl.The edgy sequel to Tim Burton's Batman, Batman Returns' over-the-top Penguin performance is balanced out by Pfeiffer's quintessential portrayal of the femme feline.As for what to give a vigilante millionaire for Christmas: How about an acrobat-orphan boy that he can dress in tight short-shorts?

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Tim Burton's first tip at Batman and felt he'd found a good actor for the lead, Michael Keaton as well of course as a highly individual and laudably retro- representation of the dark and monolithic Gotham City, making it almost a character in itself and thus easy to accept the grotesque and deranged characters which emerge from the gloom to take on the blacker-than-black hero. Here though, I felt that too much was not enough as we get two villains for the price of one, as The Penguin and Catwoman make their bows in Batman's rogues gallery meaning we get two origin stories, a changing shift of perspective and of course two big (or is that one?) deaths at the end. I can't fault the acting - as I said earlier, I like Keaton's calm demeanour as Bruce Wayne which turns to cold steel when he changes to his alter-ego, while Danny Devito, if never looking like my image of the comic-book Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer (who certainly does) obviously have fun wearing the clothes and hamming it up in the dark. Christopher Walken also gets in on the act as an un-costumed mega-rich do-badder who casually throws a pre-feline Selina Kyle out of a high-storey building amongst many other sins.Overall though, I felt the narrative was over-cluttered and that a shorter film concentrating on just one enemy would have made for a less demanding watch. For all that the film's special effects are terrific, with lots of pyrotechnics to the fore while I also detected more humour on board to help lighten the journey somewhat. Burton is unquestionably a very talented director with an eye for a memorable image of which there are several here but this time I think he overcooked the feast. On his next outing both director and star were gone although the idea of paired villains wasn't but by then the element of realism was starting to crumble, to the detriment of the drama on the screen. It would take Christopher Nolan to go back to Burton's dark vision, obviously via Frank Miller to produce a Batman for the 21st Century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less than the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this for the first time recently on Blu-ray, I was a little disappointed. The film has a lot going for it: a great music score; an impressive use of colour; vividly-drawn villains; nice sets; beautiful photography. The problems seem to be with the plot and the handling of the characters. A lot of the action seems arbitrary, with all of the characters lacking believable motivation. It's hard to care about any of them. Danny DeVito as the Penguin makes a better villain than Jack Nicholson's Joker (the previous film had toppled over into "the Jack Nicholson show") but the actor and the director fail to make the character even vaguely sympathetic. The Penguin wants to be liked, so what does he do to achieve this? He's a villain so, naturally, he cons everyone. Michael Keaton is competent as Batman but again, it's hard to warm to him. Even having seen the previous film, the viewer doesn't get much sense of what makes him do what he does. Michele Pfeiffer's Catwoman comes off best in this respect, mainly down to a good performance: again, the script doesn't make much sense any of her actions.The director's eccentricities are initially appealing, but the film just isn't enough *fun*. Maybe Tim Burton did treat the material with respect, but the overall effect is too po-faced. The essential ridiculousness of the characters isn't quite acknowledged ? we don't laugh at these grotesque and dysfunctional people, but we can't believe in them either. Finally, the film is too long-winded. With tighter editing, ten or fifteen minutes could easily be taken off its running time, giving it a faster pace.I'll be branded as a heretic for saying so, but I think the third of the initial Batman quadrilogy (Batman Forever) is the best of the four films for bringing back the fun, just as Ed Wood is the best of Tim Burton's films by a long way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman's a murderer. There's no getting around that. He literally killed someone. And Batman?just?does?not?do?that.I'm revisiting some of my favorite 90s movies for a special series, and to be honest, I was thoroughly looking forward to this (unknown number)th viewing of Batman Returns. It's a real "summer" release, it contains Selina Kyle ? an awesome Catwoman and the original and still best Batman ? Michael Keaton along with the wonderful Tim Burton. So why would I only rate it 5/10 stars?Well, the story sucks. Really it does. Where the cinematography is awesome ? PURE Burton ? as is PURE Pfeiffer as Catwoman, the movie sags with the broken story. And it was the start of the original Batman franchise: More is more. Let's add more characters! That'll spruce it up. (Not really, but they thought so, all the way to Batman &amp; Robin?) Let's offer a suggestion: Pitch the Penguin (DeVito.) Keep but tone down Shreck (Walken.) And re-write the finale.Of the original four Batman movies, two directed by Tim Burton, two by Schumacher, this one is the one that's a direct sequel, whereas they flat-out mention events/characters from the previous installment. It's some time since the events where Joker (Nicholson) died in #1, and Batman's been waiting and now respected by (the now elusive) Commissioner Gordon (Hingle.) A new gang's in town, led by the Penguin who has an agenda.The Penguin's kinda, sorta controlled by Millionaire Max Screck who both wants to promote Penguin to Mayor and has a somewhat dead, but devious nonetheless, secretary Selina Kyle who becomes Catwoman when she falls to the felines around her and then she falls further for Batman and/or Bruce Wayne, who's struggling dual identities, still since?My head is spinning, and that's thanks to screenplay writer Daniel Waters. There's more and that's just too much. And that's, well, too much in a movie that could've been a contender. It's a beautifully shot film, despite being a cross between typical Burton and Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses oddly enough.The movie starts off promising. It has that summer movie feel, regardless of the "Christmas" theme, in addition to a bloody fun Comic-Book movie feel, but surely sinks into over-plot'ness with too many angles. So many, that no wonder both Burton and Keaton refused part III. And it ends on such an outrageous finale, things that Batman would not surely do, that you wonder if they had an inkling of how to end the movie.And does everyone bypass the fact that Batman actually killed someone? Intentionally?! Spoiler alert or not, Batman attaches a bomb to a bad clown figure and pushes him down a shaft where he explodes. Not a thought goes into this scene, nor repercussions. Surely, Christopher Nolan would've explore Batman being hunted for murder.This all said, I still do rank it upwards to five out of 10 stars for the fantastic score ? possibly the best score of all (so far) six movies, the best song ? Face to Face by Siouxsie and the Banshees, the best baddie: Pfeiffer's Catwoman was simply delicious and one of her all-time best roles and the overall look of the sets and cinematography was superb.Despite all that's wrong with the picture, it's worth a shot for some good lines, Pfeiffer and Burton's vision. Get past the spotty story and the fact Batman would NEVER kill someone, and you have the only worthwhile sequel to the classic and original Batman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Tim Burton Batman (1989) movie was VERY good. I enjoyed that film. This movie is VERY fun and VERY enjoyable. With a stellar cast that includes Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pffiefer, Christopher Walken and many others, one would expect the brilliance and excitement of the first film doubled. However, that just doesn't happen in this sequel. There are some great performances in the movie, but basically there are just too many villains intertwined with each other's movements. It gets tiring to watch with too many great actors getting their faces plastered all over the screen all at once. It feels almost like a competition at times. The scenery is fantastic and there are some amazing special effects but the storyline is watery and tiresome. It is simply not original enough to be an exceptionally good film. Batman has some great new gadgets which will entertain and thrill younger movie-goers and the characters are extremely savouring to watch but I couldn't help thinking that Tim Burton knew this was going to be his last Batman movie for warner Bros and therefore decided to jam all his ideas into a Gothic and somewhat suffocating two hours. This should have been better.</fullReview>

I didn't like ending because of fighting in canalization when Penguin died on maybe silly way . I didn't like and dose of action because there are some maybe annoying action . Soul of the movie was empty . That was because Burton now made some childish play . He maybe cared too much on costumes and visual performance . I still think that it is annoying in visual part .

		<fullReview>I can't figure out why I like this film so much. The acting was kinda poor, with exception of Pfeiffer's role, which I thought she did a great job with. (I believe she stole the show) The effects leave a lot to be desired. The story was ok, you know vengeful penguin out to destroy his enemies and take over as leader type deal. Yet I am drawn to watch this movie again and still enjoy it. Michelle Pfeiffer's role was not just a sexy catwoman, but a twisted dual personality of a sweet nerdish 'old maid' and the aggressive 'cat' dominatrix that she becomes. She draws the viewer in to sympathize with Selina and despite the fact she wants to do harm to the lead hero, we still root for through out. Maybe thats why I like this film so much.two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I ashamedly admit: my favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever anyone asks me my favorite movie, I cringe and say "Actually, it's *Batman Returns*." Then I cover my ears when they yell out "What? Are you crazy?" Actually, it's a fair question. This film is really an acquired taste, and yes, it does have its flaws. For one thing, of course, it's not at all true to the comic book: Batman kills, Catwoman is not a thief, the Penguin is not an aristocratic mastermind. For another thing, the acting borders on awful, from Michelle Pfeiffer's irritating "I'm-so-lonesome" schtick at the beginning, to Danny DeVito's thoroughly repulsive histrionics. But this film somehow transcends these picayune concerns and becomes a dark, almost poetic masterpiece. Tim Burton fills the screen with haunting, daring, and nightmarish images, that capture the essence of the Dark Knight, if not the details. If you're a Tim Burton fan (which I most assuredly am), you should know that this is probably the most Tim Burtonesque film he has yet made. I dunno...guess I can't really put it into words...I am a longtime Batman fanatic, and for me this movie captures all the darkness, fierceness, and tragedy that surround the legend of the Dark Knight. It IS worth renting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Tim Burton's BATMAN movies have dated really badly since their release. I disliked the first film so much so that I never got around to watching this sequel until now, by which time I've been spoilt by the Christian Bale movies. Burton's movies are a cross between the campy tone of the 1960s TV series and the dark seriousness of the Nolan trilogy, but they fall down on both counts.BATMAN RETURNS comes across as a surreal comedy more than anything. That's the only way you can explain the ultra-poor acting of Michelle Pfeiffer as the silliest Catwoman ever; I think even Halle Berry was better than this. Pfeiffer's acting is so grating and hammy that I'm surprised she wasn't nominated for a Razzie award. Danny DeVito is better; he's hammy, yes, but his costume is a character in itself and I think Burgess Meredith would have been proud.Elsewhere, we have a sprawling plot focused around massive set-pieces but a general feel of padding/sleepwalking in between the noisy bits. Keaton's Batman is a bore, overshadowed by the flamboyant villains. Christopher Walken's here, but he gives exactly the same performance as he did in A VIEW TO A KILL, so if you've seen that film you don't need to bother with him in this one. BATMAN RETURNS as a whole has a silly, set-bound, anything-goes style feel to it and you get the impression that Burton's heart wasn't really in it. You know what? Mine wasn't either...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is the second Batman film Batman Returns. In all honesty I can see why people like this movie and also why people don't. I do like some of the ideas presented to us in this, but there are also some really big problems with this movie.Onto what I liked. I liked the idea of a sympathetic villain (or in this case villains) in a comic book movie. I liked the way it was handled in this movie for the most part. Even at the beginning when they show what happened to The Penguin, nobody even said anything and already I felt sorry for him. With that said it isn't thrown too out of proportion - I still felt Batman is the good guy.For the most part this movie actually is almost like the 1989 Batman film. The visual style is pretty good. You have great performances from both the hero and the villain(s) and other things like that so I'll skip that and go onto the complaints.I really didn't like how the Bruce Wayne/Selina Kyle relationship was handled. For the most part it felt rushed, as themselves they only share about 5 scenes in total, so in the scene where Bruce reveals his identity to her in a pleas for her to stop - there is hardly any dramatic backing for it.Not to mention I really didn't like how Batman focuses his efforts on Penguin and Catwoman instead of Max Shreck. At the roots - he is the main villain of the movie and it is pretty well established that Penguin is working with him, so why does he get a free pass for most of the movie? We don't know. If there is anything else - this would be nitpicking to an extent but this is a Batman movie where we hardly see Batman.So this movie is okay. I do like some of the things they got across in this movie and it does still keep the atmosphere of the original film but things like Bruce and Selina's relationship is rushed and I find it weird that Max Shreck isn't given as much attention by Batman as the other villains. It is okay but this does have a lot of problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though popular among fans, I think Burton slipped this time. Camp humor is pretty strong in this one (penquins with missiles and a poodle? Aye.) and the satire was no where near as clever as it liked to believe it was. Michelle was great as the tortured Catwoman (the only thing I like here really) and while it was interesting to attempt to make the Penquin a sympathetic character, I found him gross and uninteresting. Max Shrek, while Walken was great as always, was such a dumb shallow satirical cartoon. "Surplus, shame on you, no such thing." Did it really have to be dumbed down this much? Naming the dude after a vampire and being a power plant hungry industrialist to boot? Batman loses most of his mystique this time as he is seen arriving and departing as though he were the cableman and as Wayne he sits and looks grim and plays the straight (boring) man with Max and Selina (I'm actually convinced that it's meant as a comic riff on the character of Batman.)All of that is made even worse thanks to a poor script with contradicting character behavior and several plot holes important to character arcs (not a priority here apparently.) A lame macabre wishitwas version of the 60s show which did almost no justice to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this comeback 3 years after succeeding in the original Batman,our hero - Michael Keaton - is here facing his final appearance as both Bruce and the flying detective and strongman.The story isn't there like in 1989 -and despite all good efforts of various famous actors ,-this plot is a bore,-as I'm concerned. After giving The joker a terrible beating ,Batman should have met some other challenge - more dangerous and furious than the penguin, and a angry woman.There has to be some development and progress to keep the suspense and action going - this story is lacking in both and I think that Batman is facing clowns in a theater this time.Although both the penguin and Catwomen gives some fight - they are no threat to Batman ever,I think - I must admit - I am not a bit disappointed,but very .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is horrible. Tim Burton has a unique style of making movies, and they are good. But, taking his style and adapting it to Batman just doesn't work. It also screws up the story(whoever wrote it contributed in making this movie crap.).I'll start with the story. The Penguin is not a sludge-spewing, half-man half-penguin who lives in a sewer. He is an upper-class villain midget who dresses in a suit, hence the name Penguin. Catwoman was OK. I hated almost everything about this movie.Also, Michael Keaton is the second worst Batman ever. The first is Val Kilmer.Bleh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If De Vito and/or Pfeiffer were in every scene in this movie I probably would tack on at least one additional star. Their characters, Penguin and Catwoman, are developed so well they elevate the film from the rather dubious crop of comic book that have been made. Burton's direction and visual flare, and Elfman's genius score are a perfect pair yet again. It's a huge improvement over the first "Batman," which was low on story and high on Jack Nicholson's scene-chewing. It's a hell of a lot spookier and darker than its predecessor, making it more faithful to its comic book source. If the movie were just overall better, De Vito's Penguin would go down as movie history's wickedest villains (he's like a Charles Manson with lame wings), and Pfeiffer's Catwoman would be among the silver screen's greatest female roles. The uneven script stifles the flow of the movie, and I'm sure the studio tinkered with Burton's singular vision with its need for blockbuster box office and perpetual tie-in merchandising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BATMAN RETURNS is really amazing.The tone is really dark and intense and this had a very parental backlash from critics because the violence was so dark, but now in the superhero film genre, they still do light hearted films, but keep the dark and gritty tone in films.The acting and action scenes are really cool and I really love both of those. Michael Keaton returns as Batman / Bruce Wayne for his second and last time and I could not have think of anyone else. The rest of the actors are really cool and the film is just amazingly well done.The visuals, music, editing, story and pacing are very good in this film and I am very pleased with the final results, but it was not that dark and violent.Overall, BATMAN RETURNS gets an 8 out of 10, while there are some flaws, I still love this movie.</fullReview>

Better than even odds within that hardware store movie bin is a copy of Batman Returns. That means whatever you think it should, it's a freebie. This is a movie that could have really benefited from more colors, like for instance anything other than dark blue. Also Tim Burton really mailed it in for this one, just nothing going on, a hollow affair driven more by viewer nostalgia than by merit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid sequel that has Tim Burton's fingerprints all over it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of the original Batman it was clear that the studio decided to give Tim Burton much more creative control and thus why we get this film. This film sees Batman attempting to stop businessman Max Shreck's attempts to make The Penguin the Mayor of Gotham also while interacting with another new Villain Catwoman. Now Michael Keaton reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and once again he puts in a wonderful performance. Michelle Pfeifer is also fantastic as Catwoman she is a good mix of sexy and dangerous and really adds to the film. Now Danny DeVito was perfect for this Penguin and he is totally gross throughout the character really is disgusting which is what it was meant to be. Christopher Walken as Max Shreck was a great performance as the lesser villain in this film and he is truly the worse human possible. Now one negative like both the Burton's and Schumacher Batman films is the role of Commissioner Gordon his character is just a waste of space and not needed throughout any of these films and this upsets me after seeing what Christopher Nolan has done with the character. The story is nothing special either the motivations of both The Penguin and Catwoman aren't revealed till the very end and this really shows that the story wasn't a true priority apart from Shreck's story. The script was decent but nothing special and it doesn't really seem that it was a problem. The style of the film was truly a mixed bag though the style of the main characters and this Christmassy Gotham which is cool. But the Burton costumes created are rubbish and they really make it feel like a cartoon at times. The soundtrack is great and helps add the tension. This film is decent but with more mistakes then the first Batman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is the reason why Tim Burton was chosen not to direct the other two Batman sequels. Burton was making another "Edward Scissorhands" while directing this. He made Penguin too tragic, and made you feel too sorry for him, just like Edward Scissorhands, despite his horrific schemes like ruining a tree-lighting celebration in Gotham City. Batman movies are NOT SUPPOSED to make you feel sorry at all for the bad guy, when this one actually does. This definitely is not Batman at all, not what he really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not BATMAN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll always remember the anticipation I had for this film back in the summer of 1992 a young 15 year old kid who was still feeling the euphoria of Batman 89' . That film in my opinion brought Batman to life and made people forget about the campy Batman. Batman 89' was not only dark it was heroic and for me it was THE definitive Batman movie.So when it was announced that another Batman movie was going to be produced I was very excited and expected it to be just more of the same with some new villains. I really hoped that Two Face would be the main villain but when it was announced that Catwoman and the Penguin will be the villains I didn't protest because I thought that they might do the job.Anyway the big day came : Premiere night. Now in those times there was now internet to give away plot details so I'll I Knew is that it's Batman against Catwoman and the Penguin. I still had tremendous anticipation. But as the film started I was starting to doubt whether I was in the wrong theater as the Penguin's origin came up . Throughout the film my heart sank as I watched this poor excuse for a Batman film.After watching the film a couple times more I tried to analyze why I ,a Batman fan do not like this film and the reason is simple it is not a " Batman" film it is just Tim Burton taking Batman his own way,this macabre, morose, dark abomination was a Batman film in name only .Quite frankly and excuse my language the film's plot Sucked !! What is it all about ...is it about Batman? And if so, just what the heck was he doing besides standing around brooding ? seemingly a secondary character to the villains? The Penguin story was pathetic , after living in sewers with his stupid Red Circus Gang he tries to become Mayor of the City and almost succeeds !! I also found nothing appealing about the kidnapping and the potential murder of young children?Also you have these penguins with rockets attached to their back about to attack Gotham ! Penguins for God's sake !! This was the best and most exciting climax they could come up with for this film? On top of an already cluttered film, you have this Max Shreck,a character who was never in the comics tossed into the mix. What was the point of his preposterous power plant storyline? He wants to build a new power plant for Gotham, and Bruce opposes him. Wow, that's interesting! A ray of hope in this film and this why it gets 4 stars is the Catwoman story line which was told well.Another thing which angered me and which made me ask the question : is this really a sequel to Batman 89' ? I really don't think so ! so many things are different . Gotham City looks different ,cluttered and small. What happened to Harvey Dent ? Vicki Vale ? Alexander Knox ? The old mayor ? Nothing is present or is explained.Finally, just when did The Batman do anything "heroic" in BATMAN RETURNS? I wanted to see Batman do some classic "Batman stuff" like chase down and dispense justice to street thugs, crime kingpins, and the like. How about some iconic, Batman-like poses once in a while? When, at anytime in this film, did you feel like Batman was saving the day? When he's taking on the Red Circus Gang? When he's foiling the Penguin's kidnapping plans? When he's saving Gotham from a mass of missile-equipped Penguins? Come on ! Batman is a superhero, yet there is nothing heroic about BATMAN RETURNS. There isn't one moment in this depressing film where we are given the iconic, heroic Batman. Never does this film offer anything a Batman fan can feel good or proud about. There is nothing about this Batman that makes you want to cheer.But now here comes the questions is Batman Returns the worst Bat-film ever ? Well in my opinion this can be put it one sentence.Batman Returns is a Great Tim Burton film, a bad and weird film and a horrible Batman film So if you are a Tim Burton film you'll like this film , if you are a normal movie goer you'll find this film "weird " and if you are a Batman fan like me you'll hate this film.Luke Mizzi 4/10 ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>seen years later, a rare sequel that's better as an adult then as a kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not gonna lie, for a while I was a bit down on Tim Burton's own sequel of his 1989 classic post-modern adaptation of the the dark knight. It was mostly in due to feeling that the script was weak, with dialog WAY over the top, and an overall appeal that just at times seemed either too serious for its own good or too hokey (I mean, penguins doing what they do in their final moments in the film, who'd of thunk). But seeing the film years later, as Batman Begins now has its mark in the comic-book world, I've found a greater appreciation for it and Burton's vision. It's actually one of the best of the franchise, a given to be better than the Schumacher films, but with an added appeal after seeing countless other films since taking this is as a kid.Even as it isn't necessarily great, it has brilliant things about it, from its lavish and spooky production design (hell of a way to make that Penguin lair), fantastic make-up, and twists that have a perverse fascination here and there as a blockbuster entertainment. I'm also very fond of the performances I see again. Keaton still has that deadpan style as Batman that works (even if he's lesser as Bruce Wayne); Pfieffer is the best that could be done with Catwoman; De Vito stand out and occasionally steals scenes as Oswald Cobblepot (his plight is almost the most poetically tragic of the series, however if not the best as a villain); Christopher Walken is, well Christopher Walken in one of the lesser of the over-the-top roles he's done.But maybe most of all that has me gravitating more to Batman Returns as one of the better sequels of the 90's is how much of Burton's vision makes it to the screen, and how his control over the material is present throughout very strongly, as the sense of humor is either very dark or just very silly (in a good way, "My Babies!" Penguin cries out looking on at his confused penguins). And Danny Elfman's music is one of his best, at being at times eerily somber but with that Gothic edge the material needs. Plus, Burton understands a slight 'camp' element to what the Batman world might have, but doesn't overplay it like Schumacher did. In short, it's really just good entertainment that is maybe even more appealing after seeing all of Burton's films and, in general, just seeing more movies and understanding sloppy vs. successful in these hugely produced franchise pieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My buddy and I always loved Batman. We used to rent the animated series all the time. He owned the first one and I owned the second one. We loved all four but this one not so much. I watched it four nights ago and it was fantastic. I was blown away by how good it was. The Penguin is played very well by Danny DeVito, Catwoman/Selina Kyle was played to perfection, and Anne Hathaway will not top it.The plot is better than the original, because it is a better idea. The penguin wants to get into the world and meet his parents. He chooses the wrong person to get him into it, Max Schreck. Schreck creates a corrupt version of the Penguin.Christopher Walken played Max Schreck to perfection, but his son was an annoying little prick. And the carnival gang always creeped me out, and still does.Overall, not as good as the original, as it is less entertaining, but more thought out. This one is the last one before the murder of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ehhh it was OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it hilarious that some people call this (and I'm not joking here) "a 10" and "the best movie ever made". Please. Now while that may not be the majority of people, it still seems pretty silly to me how one could think that. I guess if you really like Tim Burton you might say something like that, but he has made better movies. Anyway I digress.I saw this on TV today for the first time in about 10 years and remembered how disappointed I was when it came out. I'll grant Burton an eye for the visuals, and would agree that his Batman movies have the best looking Gotham City and have the best Batman (Keaton). However, in this second installment things went a downhill for me. First of all Batman himself is given a back seat and instead we are forced to deal with Devito's Penguin. Once again the most gullible citizens ever are lead to believe that this clearly insane or at least odd and disturbing character would make a good mayor, kind of like they were tricked into believe The Joker was an "okay guy" in the first one. Also the needlessly dark touchs like the Penguins plan to kill all the first born sons of Gotham don't work for me. Also some of the stuff comes off as just tacky like the little penguins with rockets attached to their backs or the henchmen dressed up as clowns (didn't we already have a clown in the first one?). The ending is pretty anti-climactic as well and overall it isn't all that entertaining. I think that I actually got more enjoyment out of Batman Forever then I did out of this one (though I think this movie is technically better made). In conclusion this movie isn't the worst movie ever, and has some good moments and an excellent visual style that really resonates the world of Batman. However, some stupid plot points and needlessly dark/bizarre elements keep me from really liking it. If you are a fan of Tim Burton's work you will probably find something you like here. Even a Batman fan can find some good stuff as well. But just because there were worse Batman (and comic book movies in general) made after this doesn't necessarily make this a good let alone great movie. If you really like Batman read the comics books.Zoopansick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, a mutilated circus freak runs for mayor, Bruce Wayne learns that fishy swirl is supposed to be cold, Michelle Pfieffer becomes the leather fetish fantasy of a million school boys and Christopher Walken acts like he has no idea why he's here in this insane Batman sequel that is completely bonkers, but still awesome. After delivering a monstrous hit in 1989, Tim Burton was lured back in 1992, and despite McHappy Meal tie ins and big plans to make lots and lots of toys, he went and made a movie that was about as un-toyetic (a term I heard coined by Joel Schumacher) as you can get. We have a dirty joking sewer dwelling circus freak living with an army of penguins in the remains of Artic World, we have a woman wearing skin tight leather giving herself a bath by licking her suit and putting live canaries in her mouth (no seriously, Michelle Pfieffer actually had a live canary in her mouth during one of the scenes in this movie), we have Christopher Walken throwing secretaries out of the top story of his department store building and then offering to be covered "up to his eyeballs in raw sewerage." Then there's Michael Keaton tying bombs to people's chest and then laughing at them before punching them in a hole to explode. While I love this movie, it is not hard to see why the film company was a little annoyed with what they got given by director Burton here.We open 30 years in the past with Pee Wee Herman (Paul Ruebens) and Simone (Diane Salinger) as the Cobblepotts, an upper class Gotham City couple who give birth to a deformed son who, as well as having conjoined fingers resembling flippers, is also able to kill cats and eat them while a toddler. Not wanting the burden of raising a child with a lot of problems, they decide to dump him in a freezing river where he eventually gets discovered and raised by penguins. Fast forwarding to Modern Gotham, the little Cobblepott has grown up to be The Penguin, villainous leader of the Red Triangle Circus gang who start conducting series of raids on Gotham. In the meantime corrupt and opportunistic business man Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is trying to get council approval to build a new power plant, that will actually act as a capacitor that sucks power and stores it (?)... Anyway, his secretary, Selina Kyle, a shy wallflower who lives in a crappy apartment and has relationship issues, finds out this confusing information and then attempts to black mail Shreck, who throws her out of the top story of his Department Store building, where she is revived by cats and goes insane, becoming Catwoman. After the accident, Selina meets Bruce Wayne and the two embark upon a much weirder, but somehow more engaging romance than Wayne had with Vicki Vale in the first film. Anyway Catwoman and the Penguin eventually work together to take on Batman while Shreck tries to get Penguin elected mayor. Everything goes wrong and the three of them end up trying to kill each other as they all converge upon Arctic world along with Batman for a final showdown which involves rockets strapped to penguins backs, a woman being shot 4 times, a man being electrocuted to the point of becoming a charred corpse, and another one with sewerage (or some other type of unpleasant green goo) oozing out of their mouth before dropping dead. Yeah. Kid's movie folks. Anyway, apart from being way over the top for the intended audience this is a wonderful world that Burton has created and he has populated it with some fascinating characters brought to life by great performances. Michelle Pfieffer is utterly fearless as Selina Kyle/ Catwoman. Hers is a riveting creation, dripping with sexiness and cynicism that we see echoes of in Anne Hathaway's Dark Knight Rises Selina Kyle 20 years later. In the case of De Vito, he is aided by a script that plays to his strengths, giving him all types of crudity and innuendo to spout, but it's worth nothing without the menace he brings with the way he carries himself and his line delivery. Michael Keaton approaches Wayne with the same brooding he did in the original, but once again gives frequent winks to the audience. Christopher Walken isn't really needed here, but he still brings something to the film by acting like you'd expect a normal person to act in these circumstances. He greets most of his scenes with a confused look on his face and a determination to dead pan and take it all in stride. There's so many other things that can be talked about here, I haven't even got into the look of Gotham or the minor players, but this is such a dense vision, so brilliantly realized in such a bonkers way, we'd be here all day. This is nuts. Absolutely nuts, but at the same time it's bloody brilliant. It's a shame Burton's vision alienated studios to the point this was the last time we would see him, or Keaton, but what a fun ride they gave us for two films! Batman Returns may not make a great deal of sense, but it is a rich, brooding, compelling and infinitely watchable film that I appreciate more and more as it ages. Arguably the best in the series and well worth a look more than twenty years on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton delivered once again with this second great installment in his Batman film series, that would unfortunately be ruined by Joel Schumacher when he took over for the next two installments. But let's forget about that and let's focus on Batman Returns.Everything that was good about the first movie remains here. Michael Keaton delivers an even better performance as Batman than he did in the first film, and it helps that this time he gets more screen time and we delve deeper into his psychosis once his complicated lover/enemy relationship with Selina Kyle/Catwoman comes into play. Michael Gough also remains perfectly cast as Alfred and Gotham City still oozes atmosphere.As for the new additions, Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect as Catwoman, perfectly capturing her seductive, brutal and (for this movies purpose) slightly psychotic personality. Christopher Walken is also a worthy addition as ruthless tycoon Max Shreck, making what could have been a campy character into a cool, sinister and collective one.Danny DeVito as the Penguin is the one aspect of this film I'm torn on. While DeVito gives a memorably fantastic performance, and this version of the Penguin makes for a great character in any other film, he isn't really the Penguin from the comics, and this as usual reeks of Tim Burton's habit of changing source material to suit his own themes (see also, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). Despite all of this, Devito does shine throughout and his sympathetic, vile character does enough to make you forget the differences from the source material.Another problem is that the script does feel a bit overcrowded at points and it does feel like the script could possibly do without the addition of Shreck.Nevertheless, this a sequel that isn't quite as good as the first installment, but still great nonetheless.</fullReview>

Keaton still makes a good batman. The bat suite was tampered with a little bit but it mostly looks the same. But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say? Is he maybe half penguin? Still Danny deVito played it well. Catwoman is a bit far-fetched.

When Batman has something to do, the action's actually pretty fun. The Batmobile seems to roar onto the screen (even more so than last time) and there's a confidence that goes along with an anticipated sequel. But the performances from DeVito and Pfeiffer get lost in something that feels like cinematic depression.5/10Also, Christopher Walken steals the entire thing. That kinda surprised me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roundly considered a disappointing follow up to Tim Burton's original "Batman," "Batman Returns" still has much to recommend it. Burton takes even more of a morbid funhouse approach to this film than he did the first one, and it's extremely dark in a way that I like.The biggest problem is that neither the Penguin nor Catwoman is as compelling a villain as the Joker, and the two of them combined can't muster up the same level of energy and menace that Jack Nicholson's Joker created singlehandedly. Plus, I always thought Michelle Pfeiffer was miscast as Catwoman, though I liked the origin story they give her here.Still, the film looks fantastic, as all Tim Buron movies do. The production design is a marvel.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I finally got my chance to see The Dark Knight and I'm very happy to say that it's the best of the series. But before I do my review of the best I'm going to do my review of the worst, Batman &amp; Robin.No matter how good Uma Thurman looked has Poison Ivy there's no disputing the fact that not only did Joel Shumacher really butcher the directing but Akiva Goldsman made the worst script in his career; a complete 180 from his brilliant "A Beautiful Mind". George Cloony was the worst Bruce Wayne (yes he was worse than Adam West) Chris O'Donnell as Robin wasn't much better and Arnold Schwarzenegger became the worst villain of all time as Mr Freeze. I give it a 3/10 for the pure fact that it can be enjoyed if you really have no taste.Next worse is Batman Forever. Even if it had the most Oscar Nods of the series so far Tommy Lee Jones and Chris O'Donnell doomed the movie from get go. Although Val Kilmer wasn't bad as the caped crusader he just didn't fit the role like Michael Keaton did before him. Another problem was that Joel Shumacher replaced Tim Burton which pushed the comic book appeal way over the top. I've got to say that Nicole Kidman was really good in her role and that she did bring the film up a few notches, but the true star of the film was Jim Carrey. He was so funny and yet so insane in his role has Edward Nigma/the Riddler. I give this a 6.5/10 for not being a total flop.Now the series begins to get better with Batman Returns. Although Danny Devito wasn't great as the Penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer brought the real villain to the film. In this instalment Michael Keaton and Tim Burton return to their respective roles has Batman and Director but they definitely lost the magic after they switched the villains. I give this a 7.5/10for not butchering the series.In 3rd Place the original Batman movie which was fantastic. Jack Nicholson was great has the comical Joker and if I were judging this on awesome cartoony flavour than this would be #1 but since I'm not I put it at 3rd. Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson play off each other so well and there's very little more to it. I give this a 8.5/10 for being the best original and the best Joker until TDK.In 2nd place Batman Begins reboots the series with a fresh new cast. Christian Bale completely renews the character of Bruce Wayne with a new sense of confusion and bringing a real anti-hero play into the role which is a great spin on the character. Michael Caine does a fantastic job as Alfred and completely blows Michael Gough out of the water. Bringing Morgan Freeman into the movie was a great idea all together. Liam Neeson was a refreshing change from the cartoony villains from the earlier movies and has a great heir of arrogance. The only bad part was Katie Holmes playing Rachel Dawes, she was just a bad choice for the part but luckily she was replaced for the latest instalment. I give this a 9/10 for reviving the series.Finally in 1st place is The Dark Knight. The film is not only the greatest Batman/ Superhero film of all time it's also one of the best films of all time. Director Christopher Nolan brought back the realism he used in Batman Begins as well as the actor's. Christian Bale completes his turn to the anti-hero and is so real in the role, but the real star of the movie is the late Heath Ledger. The darkness he brings to the role rivals Hannibal Lecter as a villain. He is so evil and you just can't deny liking him no matter how much you hate him. His plans, or rather lack of plans makes everything very suspenseful. Another star of the film was Aaron Eckhart has Harvey Dent/ Two Face. He brings the knight in shining armour feel to the movie to contrast the anti-hero Batman which is nice until he snaps. I'm not going to give away how or why he snaps but when he does he plays a villain that reminds me Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars 3. He's good but just snaps. Next Maggie Gylenhall plays Rachel Dawes with a much more commanding and sincere character than Katie Holmes did. Gary Oldman is spectacular has Capt. and later Police Commissioner James Gordan. He never loses his trust in our caped crusader even when the world has turned against him. The final stars of the film are the mob boss Maroni who is a new kind of boss instead of the same Old Italian wacko. There is one thing you can't forget which the design for the latest two movies is. To be short and frank are amazing. The Batmobile is so much cooler now than it was and then the Batcycle is even cooler. I give this a 10/10 for bringing the superhero movie into the category of Oscar worthy Drama.To end off I just want to say that I love all the movies (except Batman &amp; Robin) and can say It's one of the greatest series in movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's sequel to his 1989 hit movie manages to be only slightly better than the original, if only because we are spared the Jack Nicholson show."Batman Returns" does have a deal more action, which is good. The plot in between time, however, is fairly dull even though it is original. Michelle Pfeiffer makes a good 'Catwoman', but Danny De Vito and Christopher Walken are only okay as 'The Penguin' and power hungry industrialist 'Max Schreck' respectively. Of course Keaton returns as our masked hero, but we do not see a lot of him.The film's main plus is its visual splendour, as we once again have some great sets and special effects to look at.Saturday, July 4, 1992 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burtons triumph!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie Tim Burton really succeeds to put Batman in the dark world of Gotham where he actually belongs. No bright shiny colours or bad cut action scenes as in the horrible followers by Mr Schuelmacher.The story is excellent, you really understand WHY this persons put on masks and change into their alter egos. The acting is superb. Keaton,DeVito and Walken is great and on top of that, the queen of this movie, Michelle Pfeiffer. The best scene is when she turns into Catwoman for the first time and the one where "the bat,the cat and the penguine" first meet outside the exploding store. But of course there are several highlights. And who can resist a dialogue with lines like: "Oswald, Its some BODY here to see you..." followed by the entrance of lovely miss Pfeiffer.Add to this Danny Elfmans music and ofcourse the outstanding settings and you have this great movie. By far the best in the series and possibly the best "make-a-cartoon-alive" movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd, sad and ultimately empty nihilistic nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It can only be hoped that "Batman Returns" is not representative of the state of Tim Burton's mind. If it is, I'd like to recommend extensive therapy. While it's true that Batman has always been about the dark weathers of the human soul ? particularly to outsiders ? Burton's movie does little to explore them. This is one of the most depressing movies he's ever made. It's a nasty, nihilistic and uncompromisingly ugly little movie that wallows in misery and despair.Consider the opening scene. A deformed baby is born to a wealthy couple who keep him in a secure cage fit for The Tasmanian Devil. Without a word, they put their little bundle in a basket and throw him in the river where he spends the bulk of his life living in the sewer. This image is as depressing as it sounds, made worse by the fact that the parents never speak. Perhaps a piece of dialogue might have helped us to understand their decision. Heck, it might have helped if they seemed even feel the slightest bit bad about it.The rest of the movie is pitched at that level, and isn't made any better when the kid grows up and emerges from the sewers years later and becomes the pawn of a heartless industrialist Max Shreck who, despite the kid's disgusting appearance, wants to make this penguin-like creature into the city's mayor because Penguin has blackmailed him. Shreck looks like a cross between David Bowie and Andrew Jackson and played by Christopher Walken as if he's doing a bad impression of himself. In all reality, he's more or less extraneous to the plot. The story could easily go on without him.Shreck is guilty of all manner of corporate corruption and gives no second thought to murdering his nerdy secretary, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) when she uncovers his evil schemes. He pushes her out a window, she is licked back to life by cats, she goes home and makes herself a skin-tight cat suit and - VOILA! - Catwoman. Actually, in the comic books, Selina Kyle earned her moniker because she makes her living as a cat burglar. Weighing the former with the latter, the cat burglar holds more credibility. Then again, there's hardly anything in this movie that does.The Penguin and Catwoman are supposed to be sympathetic. One of the treasures of Batman lore is that his adversaries always have a method to their madness. Their circumstances illicit our sympathies, yet somehow, this script misses the boat. We are suppose to feel for the Penguin character who was thrown away and shunned by society, but Danny DeVito's portrayal doesn't help. How can we feel sympathy for a rotten little man with bits of raw fish dribbling down his chin and blood pouring out of his nose? He almost dares us to like him. DeVito is one of the best comic talents but his performance is curtailed by what he's required to do.As Catwoman, Michelle Pfeiffer does give a serviceable performance, but there's nothing beyond her posturing. Around the edges of the story lies a potential strained relationship between her and Bruce Wayne. The pieces are there and so is the sexual tension, but the script just won't go there. That's the problem with the whole movie. The characters seem halted, as if Burton doesn't want to hold them back as characterizations without letting become people.Batman himself never emerges as anything more than a functionary to this story. He actually seems out of place here amid a cityscape that seems to be made up of rot and decay. The script and the production design soak in their misery without ever giving us a rhyme or reason. It is unclear what Burton really wanted from this script, or from his production design. "Batman Returns" looks grim and gloomy, like a nightmare world where the sun never seems to come out.*1/2 (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylistically intoxicating, if you can get by the intense darkness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically, the downside of this film, to me, is how dark and depressing (and at times, disgusting) it is. This is one of those examples where whatever shortcomings the story and/or character development may have, it is nevertheless an addictively compelling work of visual art, and it works on that level alone. The plot is not bad, but it is not really what drives Batman Returns. The cast is very good, I think. Keaton is IMO underrated as Batman, DeVito and Pfieffer convincingly portray twisted criminal insanity, and Walken is crucial in giving the film a greater level of complexity.Again, the visual look is a wonderland of Tim Burton-isms. The icy winter setting, whimsical penguin commandos and circus crime gang, incredibly cool Batmobile and Batmissle vehicle sequences...there are just so many things to capture the imagination.The problem, of course, and it is a significant problem, is how dark this film is. It is scary, violent, sometimes gross, and ultimately depressing. Batman should be dark and thought-provoking, but this one reaches prohibitive degrees of darkness. It is definitely not appropriate for family/children, and arguably may not really have much redeeming value for adults, either. (The whole issue of which was kind of responsible for the much different excesses of the Joel Schumacher films.) Batman Returns is like one of those really weird paintings that may qualify as works of genius art, but which may not be worth looking at, just the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly moronic sequel, that lacks the entertainment value it needs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is a movie that is too moronic and dull for it's own good. Michelle Pfeiffer is not the problem in the movie, contrary to what people have thought, she actually gives a sly and Humorful performance. The real problem with Batman Returns lies in the movie itself. The original was dark itself, but at least it was highly entertaining to watch. Batman Returns is often sadistic, cold and very hard to watch. Jack Nicholson was able to provide us with some great humor, and make The Joker a great villain, but Danny DeVito, despite the fact that he tries hard is just too dark for my liking, heck there are even kids put in danger!. When I watch a marvel type film, I wanna be entertained, not depressed. Batman Returns really is a depressing film for the most part, it lacks all the proper ingredients that Batman had.Performances. Michael Keaton does fine with what he has to do, but his role doesn't have the depth that he did in Batman, therefore he naturally struggles at times with the material at hand. Danny DeVito is OK as the villain. He's much too sadistic and cold for my liking, it really drained a lot of the film for me. Michelle Pfeiffer is a beauty, no doubt about it, and her sly and witty performance, helped make some of the movie bearable for me. Christopher Walken is always a great, slimy villain, and did pretty good here as Max. Michael Gough is solid once again as Alfred. Rest of the cast are adequate or good.Bottom line. Batman Returns is a sequel, I won't be viewing ever again. It's too dark, too humorless, and lacking in entertainment value. Stick with the original.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was around 1995 when I saw Batman Returns (I was five) and the image of the Penguin carrying an umbrella that functions as both a machine gun and sword (and many more) was iconic. I remember a lot from this movie than the first one. One of the reasons why I enjoy this is because of their choice of Keaton and his take on Batman even though this is his second time.Tim Burton skillfully depicts Gotham City the way I envisioned it, well at least way before Batman Begins came out. Without looking at the characters and Gotham itself, I could feel the "gothic" ambiance which probably gave the city its name. Michael Keaton as Batman, although only second to Christian Bale for me, does a great job as the brooding creature of the night and as the civilized Bruce Wayne. But, from my observations, his role here seems reduced compared to the first, it felt like he only had a few lines. Speaking about roles, boy did Commissioner Gordon lost a lot of his already minor role. DeVito rules as the Penguin. You kind of pity him during the first parts of the movie then as it progresses you find him even more pitiful as a misunderstood villain. I guess Pfeiffer's Catwoman was right-on but I honestly didn't understand her primary role throughout the duration of the movie. Christopher Walken is wonderful as always. For some reason, he bears a slight resemblance to Jack Sparrow and even shows a hint of his personality here. Everything in this movie seems to fall into the right place if you disregard realism and errors like how the Penguin got a wacky replica of the Batmobile in just a few days (maybe it's possible), how a duck could work as an amphibian vehicle, why a member of the Penguin's circus gang had to fight Batman while swallowing a sword when it would be easier to hold it with his hands, how the bat-signal formed perfectly in the sky, etc. I believe Returns didn't get a lot of attention, so that sucks. Overall this movie is superb as a Batman film and, if you like, a Christmas film as well. It's better than Batman '89 in some ways but again it just lacked attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman at X-Mas......OK, I'm interested. Originally to cast Annette Benning, the CatWoman role seemed to be in safe hands with Ms. Michelle. And Danny DeVito being allowed his freedom of range in playing the Penguin was a great touch. Add some Walken, and we have a film.Not as big a blockbuster as the original, it still carried well. Unfolding a bit slowly and seemingly a bit mixed, it didn't quite follow the comic lore, but, neither did any of the other films in the original quadrilogy.Keaton played his role a bit better this time around, but was also given more script and screen in and out of the mask. He also had the advantage of being the original.Plan on the popcorn, but no breaks allowed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe more Burton than Batman, but an exciting visual feast from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What got Tim Burton to come back to the Batman franchise as a director was, at least in part, being offered doing a "Burton" film. His kind of film. The comic book roots are still visible, but the touch of the man definitely shines through. The Gothic visuals are a definite plus, and really work well with the characters(whom Burton treats with the right amount of screen-time each... it's note-worthy that the first character seen who links this to the first film *isn't* the title character). The grotesque villains and imagery works as well as it did in the first film, although it may at times become silly. The development is quite good, and this manages to provide motivation for several main characters. It also keeps to a quite high pace, without being overwhelming or hurried. The acting is great. For almost all of the film, I wasn't thinking that I was watching Danny DeVito portray The Penguin... I was watching The Penguin. He disappeared into that role. Michelle Pfeiffer does marvelous as both Kyle and Catwoman(and this one actually uses a *real* whip), and also shines in all her scenes(and her on-screen growth and transformation is an accomplishment). Keaton brings the Bat alive again, and does well as Bruce Wayne, too. Walken is creepy as usual, and he really adds to the film. The dialog is well-written and equally well-delivered, throughout. The humor is just about perfect, it never goes too far, and never tries too hard, but the film definitely delivers some (intentional) laughs. The plot, while it does perhaps suffer from what appears to be interference by the studio to keep the character of Harvey Dent out of the film, is magnificent. It all comes together and works. The production design is excellent. The sets, the costumes, props, everything. The film is dark, the tone and feel, throughout. It is most definitely *not* for children. The sexuality and violence alone should tell anyone that. The special effects are expertly done throughout. The direction, cinematography and editing are excellent. This may not be quite as much of an achievement as the first, and have fewer iconic shots and details, but it is definitely a worthy sequel. You may also want to give the commentary track, by Burton, a listen. I recommend this to any fan of the first, the characters, and the people involved in putting this on the big screen. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark and brooding vision!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We're in the year 1992. Its been 3 years since the release of the critically acclaimed Batman (1989) and the fans are standing in line eagerly awaiting the follow-up. There premiere arrives and the fans are... divided. Batman Returns has a stellar cast who provided excellent performances and the film was even darker than it predecessor and it featured even more action so why was the film not as successful as the original. I am a great fan of Burton and I love his work but I have to blame him for not making as good a film as the first. "Why?" You ask. Burton had complete creative control with this one and therefore it is a much more personal film but he did turn Batman into a side-kick in his own movie (he did in the first film as well but in this one we barely get to see him). Without any reins Burton went completely overboard in darkness and brooding. He also turned a sophisticated villain from the comics into a bloody animal. That being said this is far from a bad movie it simply falls into the category; not as good as the original.The performances from the cast are good, no exceptions. Michael Keaton returns with his wonderfully manic interpretation of the character that is Bruce Wayne/Batman and I for one believes that he deserves the cult following he has as the character because he is excellent. Luckily Batman's love interest was replaced with an actress with talent this time around. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman and arguably gives the best performance in the entire film. Her transition from boring office secretary to irresistible temptress is excellent and more importantly believable. Danny DeVito does a great job in spite of a character that just doesn't cut it. I love DeVito but I just can't take the character seriously and he never becomes a true menace to Batman the way the Joker did. Christopher Walken is great as well. His portrayal of the power-frenzied maniac is pure joy to watch. He is a true scene stealer and a much more credible villain than the Penguin in this movie.The score is pretty flawless but that is what one has come to expect out of Danny Elfman who is one of the most talented composers in the industry. His score elevates every scene, be it a quiet scene in front of a fireplace or a fight scene on a rooftop. In short he is brilliant. Two thumbs way up. In fact the soundtrack is one of the only things that are superior to the original which was marred by Prince's very 80's sound.The film certainly has merits and quite a few but in spite of these merits the film is simply too Burtonesque and too many liberties is taken with the source material and therefore Batman Returns stands as a good albeit flawed addition to the Batman franchise. However, this was the last good Batman film in 13 years. Burton made the Batman franchise only for Joel Schumacher to kill it. In the end though Batman Returns is an entertaining film with a few problems.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman reviews, part II: A fair sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an excellent first movie, Tim Burton is back for the next revisionist adventures of the Dark Knight. Only, this time, there are two super-villains.Burton keeps it going and presents an even darker and more disturbing vision of Gotham City, forsakes somehow the psychological side of the superhero and focuses more on giving more action, chases and technological gadgets for this first Batman sequel.The movie opens on the apparition of the Penguin, played by Danny DeVito. The Penguin keeps many characteristics coming from the original comics, like his arsenal of umbrellas, his short and chubby stature, his kick for birds (especially penguins) and his top hat. However, many modifications have been made, mainly to remain faithful to the dark and sinister atmosphere which already prevailed in "Batman" and which stays in "Batman Returns". These changes are mainly mirrored in his appearance, since he's now presented as deformed, with fins instead of hands, a long beak-like nose and his grotesque clothes.The Penguin comes up to the surface after having lived his whole life in Gotham's sewers. He tries to find his parents only to discover that they're both deceased. Machiavellian businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) then suggests the Penguin to present himself in the elections to become the mayor of the city, with less-than-altruistic plans.The other villain who jumps into the game is Catwoman or more commonly, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). Kyle is Shreck's awkward secretary and when she discovers her boss' malevolent plans, he throws her of the window. But mysteriously, after a group of cats gathered around her body, Kyle gets up, goes back home, where she goes completely berserk, and creates her feline alter ego.It's now up to Batman (Michael Keaton) to come to terms with those two new adversaries who each have different plans and objectives.The Penguin is accompanied by henchmen who look like a group of artists having escaped from a freak show or from the carnival from the movie "Something Wicked This Way Comes". As for Catwoman, she's a thief and she falls in love with Batman. The situation gets more complicated when the real people, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, begin to feel a particular affection for each other.The Penguin and Catwoman team up to discredit Batman and arrange things so Gotham's citizens would turn up against him, which would make things way easier for the Penguin and his election plans.It must be said that their plans are meticulously prepared and greatly imaginative. Let's say that their actions are more convincing than the Joker's ones in the first movie.But in "Batman Returns", the characters are generally more two-dimensional than in the first movie. The psychology of the characters is far less explored and it's the general presentation who wins in that case. Not only do the look and the costumes of the characters are carefully prepared, but the action scenes also are.The Penguin's presentation is fairly good. He's ugly, grotesque and frightening. His den is no less either. The Catwoman costume, made of leather and 'claws' is appropriated for such a dark picture.Many gadgets appear in "Batman Returns". Some are original, inventive and useful, while others are frankly ridiculous. I didn't like what looks like some kind of 'batarang' which automatically hits the enemies one by one and the Batmobile which 'auto-mutilates' to escape from the police cars. However, the Batsuit's retractable wings is a brilliant idea.Gotham City still is a Gothic, dark, disturbing and postmodern metropolis. But the atmosphere is different somehow. The action of the film is set during the Christmas period, which is even more bizarre. We could almost assert that it's some kind of test from Burton's part before the director would launch himself into the production of "The Nightmare Before Christmas". At one certain moment in the movie, we even see sunlight, which didn't happen at all in the first movie.The dialog is sometimes bizarre, should it be intentional or not. It can lead to lengthy, boring and disconcerting scenes. But there also are grandiose lines, such as the one where the Penguin distorts the most famous line from David Lynch's movie "Elephant Man". And we must not forget that scene where Catwoman meows in front of Batman and the Penguin, just before the store behind her blow up.I also loved the scene where Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle become aware of each other's respective alter ego. There's visibly something that happens in their minds at that precise moment."Batman Returns" is far from being perfect, but it's a much acceptable result nevertheless, especially with such expectations from the public's part. You must notice that if there's something difficult in the film industry, it's to make a sequel from an already acclaimed and popular hit picture. But Burton succeeded in his challenge.And when you look at the Batman movies which follow "Batman Returns", that is those from Joel Schumacher, the value from "Returns" heightens even more. Some people would even say that this movie is a consolation prize. But while this film is not as good as the first one, it must be appreciated. And it's not necessary to force yourself. It comes all by itself...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's dark vision of Batman's Gotham City is impressive...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton creates a dark vision of Gotham City and its inhabitants with BATMAN RETURNS, which begins with a stunning opening sequence with a freakish infant being disposed of by cruel parents, all to the pulsating and powerful score by Danny Elfman that sets the mood for the rest of the film.MICHAEL KEATON returns for his second turn in the Batman role, convincing whether he's playing Bruce Wayne or the masked crusader; MICHELLE PFEIFFER has a grand time in her dual role as Selena, the mousy secretary afraid to express an opinion or the aggressive, sensuous and sinewy Catwoman who finds a willing opponent and lover in Batman, a love/hate relationship that builds to a frantic finale. The wonderful MICHAEL GOUGH is Alfred, Batman's faithful, wise and all knowing manservant. And, of course, DANNY deVITO gets a huge share of the spotlight as the villainous Penguin, conspiring with power hungry Max Schreck (CHRISTOPHER WALKEN) to get rid of their opponent, Batman.While all the performances are right on target, it's the special effects and sets that dominate the story with its mean and twisted nature sharply accented by the dark foreboding appearance of Gotham City, its Herald Square resembling a bleak counterpoint to New York City's Rockefeller Center. MICHAEL MURPHY and PAT HINGLE are present in minor roles but the film is carried by Keaton, Pfeiffer and DeVito.The screenplay is about as dark and mean spirited as you can get with comic book material, but it's the dazzling production design that gets the attention all the way through, usually on the sinister and somber side. There's a nightmarish quality to some of the action scenes and Burton, of course, is a master at this sort of thing.All told, a very enjoyable take on the Batman legend, dark to be sure but never dull with lots of juicy dialog for clever exchanges between Batman and Catwoman in their game of oneupmanship. MICHELLE PFEIFFER is especially good at capturing the dual nature of her role--and makes a stunning Catwoman with a whip. MICHAEL KEATON is not an actor I personally would immediately think of casting as Batman, but he does extremely well in the role.Summing up: Dazzling sets, good script and Danny Elfman's mesmerizing score are a solid combination to make this Batman a worthwhile viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed Opportunities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this is not a superhero film. It's barely a Batman film. Instead of giving us a straightforward film, Tim Burton sidetracks the film with so many plot twists and story lines, that the whole thing gets bogged down.The script is badly written. In the beginning, we hear about a power plant. About halfway through the film, the whole idea of a power plant disappears. Later on, Penguin has obtained some plans to the Batmobile. They're not even crude drawings, just plans. Where did he get them from? Unfortunately, we'll never know.Then we have the villains. The nose-biting, mucus-spewing, deformed Penguin is executed in possibly the worst way. How did the Penguin find the circus? Just how did he return to Gotham City as a lone child? The entire freakishness of the Penguin just makes you not sympathize with him, as Burton no doubt wanted, but want to tell him to "take a hike" and do something that's actually believable. Catwoman isn't so much a disaster, but she is ruined nonetheless. Licking herself, fashioning a whole suit out of a jacket, and becoming a martial arts expert overnight, she also is a sad mock-up of her comic book counterpart.One of the things I like best about Batman is that he rose out of a tragedy and made the best of it. Keaton, while giving us an excellent performance, loses any heroics Batman had about him in the first film, and instead brings us a dark, rarely speaking, killing creature of the night. He brings us the dark knight, but leaves out the caped crusader.The sets are cluttered, dark, and sad. Gotham is supposed to be a creepy place, but not a Gothic place. The city is just a twisted reality, but the film gives us a city-in-a-matchbox. That's how cluttered it is.I can at least say something good about the score. Danny seems to want to try and give us a heroic sense, but is deflated by Burton's "genious". Poor guy.However, I still like this film. Why? It gives you such emotion with the portrayal of it's characters, it's hard to forget. Also, buried deep within these villains, you'll find the comic-book characters you know. Their original origins are, whether on purpose or not, mixed in with the movie origins.Overall, it's a good Batman flick, with some missed opportunities. However, there is some good acting and character development found here, that cannot really be explained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman, and Catwoman Are Up To Par, but the Pitiful Penguin Ruins The Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman Returns is the 1992 sequel to the original 1989 Batman movie. Most of the original cast returns, and Batman faces two new- but familiar foes. The Penguin played by Danny DeVito, and the Catwoman played by Michelle Pfeiffer emerge to wreck havoc upon Gotham City and cause Batman even more problems.The movie is not the blockbuster that the first film was, and is too grotesque and gloomy to be appreciated by young children. This is a cold, dark film, filled with pity and shame.The movie opens with the wealthy parents of a deformed baby, putting him into a baby carriage, and dropping him into the Gotham River on a cold winter evening. They don't care if their baby lives or dies or gets devoured by wild animals. The baby floats downstream into the city's sewers, where he is rescued and raised by penguins. Thirty-three years late,r the baby emerges out of the sewers fully grown, with an arched back, a deformed nose, and claws. Going by the name Oswald Cobblepot, the pitiful creature has only one goal in life, to discover who his parents were, and find out why they dumped him like garbage.Cobblepot, later in the movie, becomes vengeful at the citizens of Gotham City for living the fulfilled lives that he had been cheated out of. As Cobblepot emerges from the sewers, newspaper stories circulate about the mysterious penguin-man threatening Gotham City. Oswald is outraged at the fear and scorn he receives, and refuses to allow anyone to call him Penguin. But later, feelings of hate, greed, and vengeance overcome him, and Penguin is the only name he wants to be known by. The Penguin unlike the Joker in the original Batman movie is a pitiful, depressing creature. I felt so sorry for him I was ready to cry. How could his birth parents be so cruel to him? This kind of dark story may have worked for "The Elephant Man", or maybe even "The Sixth Sense", but not for "Batman". "Batman" is supposed to be based on a comic book character, played out for action, adventure, and even laughs. This is not supposed to be a serious dramatic tragedy, like Charles Dickens' "Oliver Twist", or even "Great Expectations." Like in the original "Batman" film, Batman is portrayed as a loner, an oddball who happens to be on the right side of the law. Even though he is summoned by Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) via the Batsignal to handle a recent crime wave, he is still feared by many people in Gotham City because of his scientific genius and mystique. Keaton is not as wooden and comical as Adam West (the original Batman) was, but is completely overshadowed by the pitiful Penguin, and the fetishistic Catwoman.Michelle Pfeiffer who plays Max Shreck's (Christopher Walken) secretary curiously stumbles upon her bosses scheme to control Gotham City. She then is thrown to her death by the evil tycoon, so that there won't be any witnesses to his illegal activity. Pfeiffer however, is licked back to life by alley cats, and later becomes Catwoman. Catwoman sews up her own fetish costume and mask, and vows vengeance on Shreck and the rest of Gotham City ESPECIALLY THE MEN.Catwoman being a "cat" has nine lives, one of which she loses courtesy of Shreck, one courtesy of Batman, and one courtesy of Penguin after she tells him that he is too ugly to deserve her affections. The Penguin attached her to his flying umbrella, and she flies off to her third death, in a scene of outstanding special effects and creativity by director Tim Burton. Now this is one fantasy sequence that is classic comic book Batman. Later in the movie, in the Penguin's hideout, she loses her fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh lives when Shreck pulls his gun on her and also Batman. Will she also lose her eighth and ninth? I enjoyed Tim Burton's special effects, his dark, brooding Gotham City set and skyline. There were some good acting performances especially by Michelle Pfeiffer, but "Batman Returns" spends too much time dwelling on the shame and hurt of Oswald being dumped and abandoned by his birth parents. This type of screenplay is certainly not meant for the young audience that superhero films are supposed to appeal to appeal to. Maybe if "Batman Returns" had some comic relief, and comical characters to deliver it, it would have been better. But the character who we empathize with most with is the Penguin who is not sinister or goofy but pitiful. This is not what comic book Batman is supposed to be about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is so bloated and heavy-handed that one would think this was a Joel Schumacher opus, rather than a Tim Burton film; his heart just doesn't seem to be in it. Danny DeVito does nothing with the "Penguin" (calling Burgess Meredith!), Michael Keaton is truly ponderous as "Batman"(Adam West is looking mighty fine..)and Christopher Walken makes absolutely no impression as the dastardly "Max Shreck." Only Michelle Pfeiffer scores as "Catwoman"; her "meow" is almost worth the price of a rental. Almost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns was well-received in its American premiere. The film is dark, brooding, intense and most of all depressing. One knows from the start that there is no way for it to really end well. I found the film a little too dark and a little too slow as it moves to what seems like an inevitable bitter end. I think it could use some editing to speed the pace a bit. The film is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. It is difficult to imagine that such a dark film will attain much cinematic success. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again. With this culture of ignorance in the Information Age persisting, fed by the corporate media, Michael Keaton has appeared in one of his best films yet, and in one that brings humanity down to its root nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My brother and I walked out of the theater in 1992 feeling like our souls had just been crushed. We had both loved Batman so we eagerly anticipated its sequel and we came away disappointed by what seemed like a bloated mess of a sequel with too many villains, too much humor, and no clear focus. We also both hated the Max Shreck character played by Christopher Walken and felt he was just in the way of things. Time has altered my opinions on this film a great deal but I include my initial teenage reaction for comparison. I still feel it's a flawed movie and one that often feels more like a director's cut than your average edited-down theatrical release. As a whole, I'm not sure the narrative of the movie is at all times clear and a lot of that does have to do with juggling several plot lines and main characters. I'm still not entirely convinced Christopher Walken is necessary to the movie at all, though like most people I do enjoy his performance. Which is kind of my opinion on Batman Returns in a nutshell: there's a lot to enjoy but on the whole it's a movie that could stand a good trimming.Michael Keaton is a very good Batman. Perhaps the best ever. But once again, the focus is on the villains. Danny DeVito's Penguin is gruesome and miles apart from his comic book counterpart. I never really had a problem with this as I always thought the Penguin was a lame villain anyway. At least DeVito's is scary. There's also a good deal of dark humor to be had with him and some camp value, such as his assault on Gotham with penguins mounted with missiles. That part's admittedly more adorable than exciting, though. Michelle Pfeiffer's sexy Catwoman has become an iconic movie character in her own right; the standard by which all other Catwomen are judged. So far they've come up short. She has many of the movie's best lines. Christopher Walken is amusing in that Walken way as an original character for the film, Max Shreck.Even more so than the first film, Tim Burton creates a film full of amazing visuals and eye-popping special effects. At times decidedly campy, it never crosses the line that Joel Schumacher's repulsively gaudy films did. The only real problem with the movie, like I said before, is that it feels overstuffed with ideas and characters. While I believe Max Shreck could have been eliminated and the movie would not have been hurt at all, I think you could have kept him and still helped the movie out by editing some scenes down and quickening the pace a bit. Still, it's a fantastic sequel with great style and atmosphere. Memorable character and set designs, special effects, and good performances all around. It's too flawed to be considered Burton's masterpiece (at least in my opinion) but it's also too impressive to be ignored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a corrupt businessman (Christopher Walken) and the grotesque Penguin (Danny DeVito) plot to take control of Gotham City, only Batman (Michael Keaton) can stop them, while the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) has her own agenda.First of all, this cast is amazing. Setting aside the supporting actors (including the great Paul Reubens), the four key roles make this an instant classic for any movie fan, regardless of their love of Batman.But also, I think Tim Burton "got" Batman in a way no other director has. Christopher Nolan's films may be the best from a critical standpoint, but Burton's are best at visually blending the comics and reality. His world is dark, but still fun. Nolan's Gotham is a hopeless land.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mind superhero films moving away from the comics. So don't take my love of Batman Begins and my distaste for this movie as just the typical obnoxious fanboy ranting. The 1989 Batman was a magnificent film. Unfortunately, Tim Burton couldn't make lightning strike twice.I like movies that are Character driven. Unfortunately, this movie is not driven by characters, it is driven by character traits. Catwoman is sexy and Penguin is disgusting. Really nothing more to go on, other then more nifty ways to make toys.Just thinking out loud here, but, are we supposed to like Catwoman? I mean, she's obviously not a total villain, she fights for what she thinks is right. Okay. But she's still not the least bit likable. Hell, the penguin is more likable then her and were not supposed to be able to stand the site of him.A little quirkiness like Catwoman being flown around on a helicopter umbrella is definitely not 1. Funny 2. Suspenseful 3. Enjoyable 4. Quirky... Basically, what were we supposed to be thinking and feeling during this movie? SOme of these scenes only work to try to add a little weirdness to the film, but ultimately fail miserably. Because this movie is not driven by its story, action, or characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman Returns to the Wrong Comicbook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns series in the 1980's gave us a darker-than-usual world for Batman. Tim Burton carried this over in his first Batman movie, but the story was clunky and too mean-spirited. This movie is even darker and more mean-spirited than the first, and does not follow the comicbook history of the characters, mostly in the villains.The penguin in the series is *not* a deformed freak; he is an obnoxious thrillseeker, who was more of a pain in the butt to Batman than a deadly threat. Likewise, Catwoman was a mysterious villain whose motives were never explained; the origins of both these villains have been re-written for this movie, which is fine, except that they are ludicrous and change the entire character of the villains to something one-dimensionally mean. Devito and Pfeiffer are perfectly cast as the Penguin and Catwoman, but they are never allowed to breathe as the characters. If the film-makers had lightened up and gone for an intelligent script, Devito could have had a field-day as a dangerous but lovable munchkin, and Pfeiffer doing much more with her role as Catwoman. Instead, both are lost in ten pounds of gloom, darkness, and leather. The story is ludicrous, but that's ok, it's a comicbook, so plot doesn't matter. This is *not* the attitude that Frank Miller had when he wrote the successful series; readers didn't buy it because of the look, just as audience's don't buy this movie because of its look. If Miller had sat down and wrote out a story in 15 minutes, it would have been much better than Batman Returns. Would he have written a story about penguins with rockets attached to them attacking Gotham City, while the Penguin tries to escape on a giant motorized Rubber Duck? I don't think so. This movie was a tremendous, painful waste, all the more so because of the actors involved and what they could have done with an intelligent script. ("An intelligent script? What are you talking about? It's only a comicbook!") Tim Burton is the wrong director for this series. It needs someone with a handle on the story and characters foremost, not the scenery. Whenever a movie is based on a comicbook (except for the first two Superman movies), the producers only look at the art, not the story...because they don't understand the stories. They only understand how to recreate the image. And to assume that comics readers only look at the pictures. That Tim Burton would make such a mistake is what depresses me. I haven't been able to stomach seeing another Batman movie after this one.Three out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of bats, men and sequels....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see what Tim Burton was trying to do with "Batman Returns".In the original, there was darkness enough but also a bit too much of the flip attitude of the TV series for his taste. After all, we're talking about artistic integrity here. Once and for all, he wanted to make his OWN interpretation of the "Batman" mystique, which he did here.Point of order - this movie is indeed successful in showing how good a craftsman Burton is for dark, gloomy images of despair, misgivings and doom. But, is that the right attitude for a movie about a super hero to strike?In a gloomy, seemingly refrigerated Gotham City, Batman must battle the evil of not only The Penguin (DeVito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) but also of businessman Max Schreck (Walken) who plans to drain all of Gotham's energy for his own power plant, along with a few other twisted deeds he has hidden up his tailor-made sleeves.BUT, and this is the important part, the first movie had a successful villain in Nicholson's Joker (as if there were any doubt). Here, the villains are seen more as objects of pity (the deformed, pathetic Penguin; the put-upon, mentally abused Catwoman; the power-hungry, grasping and son (Bryniarski)-obsessed Schreck) than of anything inherently evil. And then there's Batman - as portrayed by Keaton, he feels more like a cypher - an empty suit, if you will - than he was in the first film. He doesn't even give a flicker of the torment he felt in the original. Here, he just broods. As before, the scenery is beautiful, if more dark. Burton is, first and foremost, an artist and shows his talents in composition and design. But even though the first "Batman" was far more successful, it had less to do with Burton and more to do with the calibre of other talent involved (Nicholson, Basinger, Wuhl).Devito plays a one-note villain without any nuance or subtlety; Pfeiffer makes a suitably flaky Catwoman and, even though she tries, her character is far too pitiable to be threatening' Walken basically plays his umpteenth baddie but still pales in comparison to similar parts he's played in "True Romance", and "A View to a Kill" (sure, it wasn't very good, but it was still better than THIS!).This series would have to wait to improve ("Batman Forever"), but as far as sequels go, it at least kept with Burton's vision, even if it didn't keep with the entertainment value.Three stars for "Batman Returns". TIDBIT - Reubens and Salinger, who played the parents to DeVito's character, were featured in an earlier Burton effort - "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure". Talk about a token gesture....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A close second-best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is where the Batman franchise ought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind "Batman Forever" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case.Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how "Batman Returns" can be considered at all disappointing.True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in "Batman," a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honour of the 1920s German silent actor), his partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's "Richard III"), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on.Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the hero's return</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Batman Returns", Tim Burton succumbed to an important priority in American cinema: giving a sequel to a blockbuster. Three years after the most successful movie of the year, "Batman" (1989), here comes the hero of Gotham City again for the pleasure of many spectators. Like its predecessor, "Batman Returns" enjoyed an enormous commercial success. Tim Burton made Batman come back once again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the Joker did little to improve the image of Gotham City. Indeed, violence and corruption still exist and here, the second word is epitomized by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two crooks who are eager to take control of Gotham City are going to make life difficult for Batman. His task will be more difficult with the apparition of Catwoman... Tim Burton still delivered much work on the scenery and it seems that he tried to correct the faults of the first movie. It means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better mastered than in the first Batman. But he didn't neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that. If in the movie of 1989, Burton had focused on Bruce Wayne/Batman's psychology, here, it's the penguin that obviously interested him. The director attempted to make of him, very well acted by De Vito an ambiguous character. On one hand, he's full of bad intentions (previously quoted) but on the other hand, he's searching for his past and would like to be considered as a real man."Batman Returns" also appears as crazier than its predecessor, especially with the cast. I think of Mich?le Pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as Catwoman. Besides, at the time when I'm writing this review, it makes me remember that a new version of Catwoman is currently at the cinema. But given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), it is sure that her performer Halle Berry must pale into insignificance beside Pfeiffer.Ultimately, this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and it enables to develop Tim Burton's peculiar style. We also still find his taste for the strange and the Gothic. Concerning Batman's other adaptations for the screen, you can skip them. "Batman Forever" (1995) and "Batman and Robin" (1997) are no good. I heard that Christopher Nolan was shooting the beginning of the Batman story and it was to be released next year. Will it match Tim Burton's works?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman II is a disappointment. Actually, a better word is gross. There is really not much more to say about Danny DeVito's Penguin, operating in sewers, grotesque and crunched in features. By contrast, Burgess Meredith was amusing, carried himself well -- actually, I think he was my favorite Batman TV villain, aside from Julie Newmar. DeVito is shorter, squatter, grosser, uglier. Apotheosis: biting the journalist's nose, just great. The storyline for his part was too complicated, the cinematography too dark and pompous. The only good thing at all was the attempt at the someone sympathetic look at him based on his origins, but this dies as the rest is just garbage (sometimes literally). Michelle Pfeiffer partially redeems the movie as Catwoman, and her sympathetic storyline is thus enhanced some. In contrast to his role in the battle against the Penguin and company, in which he is almost a footnote, Batman (and Bruce Wayne) square off against Catwoman, a sympathetic, modern-woman villainess. Keaton, however, still seems not to quite measure up, overall presence, monotone or whatever. Thus, he was told, skip it next time.Regardless of some good Catwoman moments, a so-so Batman and an abominable Penguin man have the overriding aura in this film. No ride into the sunset, or the moonlight, but into the abyss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall I found this movie to be throughly disappointing. With Batman (1989) setting the groundwork for what could have been a tremendous series with almost limitless possibilities, I feel that Batman Returns was a step backwards.Overall the visuals were pretty amazing, especially for the time. Tim Burton at his dark brooding finest. Unlike Superman and Spiderman, Batman is suppose to be a dark, tormented individual with many complexities with his life. Tim Burton really nailed the overall feeling of this and plays on it nicely. I also enjoy the fact that the death of Bruce Wayne's parents was not rehashed, as was relentlessly in the future installments, thus taking away from those movies. The visual effects of Batman Returns were effective and used in moderation and to an expert degree.I feel that the majority of the issue with Batman Returns is the overall story. The background of the Penguin was nicely covered and added to the empathy felt for Oswald Cobblepot, however Catwomen, who had more a villainous role was cast by the waste-side. A lot of Selena Kyle's backstory was done with simple spoken word and felt crammed into the script and didn't fit the mood or purpose. Such as Selena telling us that she is single and that she lives alone, we could have gathered that visually. Very little was explained after her transformation as to where her martial arts training came from and what her overall agenda was, other than going after Max Schrek. I also couldn't help but notice the total uncomfortable and awkwardness between Catwomen and Batman. It felt like uncomfortableness between the actors as oppose to struggles between the characters, their feelings and their agendas.There was no real climax to this movie as it kind of just dragged along. The Penguin's death was rather lame and uneventful, almost meaningless as Catwomen became the main focal point although Penguin was portrayed as the catalyst against Batman.The directing, the musical score and the actors were all fairly good, the story just handicapped them from bringing any real power or life to their characters. At any rate this is still the second best Batman out of the first four (pre Chris Nolan) but it in no way lived up to, equaled, or came close to the 1989 blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not a great movie. The beginning was awesome when Batman battled the bad guys in his Batmobile. When I watched the beginning, I thought that this would be an awesome movie. I was wrong. The ending was stupid. Batman ripped off his mask and exposed his true identity to Max Shrek. Batman would never do that. The reason why he wears his cowl is to keep his identity a secret. When I saw him rip it off, it ruined the whole movie for me. If he had only ripped it off in front of Catwoman, that wouldn't have been bad because she had already learned his true identity. When I bought this movie on VHS at Wal-mart, I had a feeling that Batman would lose his mask in it. But I had no idea that they'd be so stupid as to make him take it off himself. I was so irritated that I thought about taking the movie back to Wal-mart and getting my money back. I later learned that they don't give refunds on opened movies. The original Batman was the only good Batman movie of the original four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too over-the-top, but it has its moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a certain something about 'Batman Returns' that doesn't quite fit. Perhaps it's the mix of film noir with superhero-after all, isn't film noir the opposite of the notion of a superhero? Film noirs are about an Everyman in an odd situation, thrust into something he can't possibly stop; comic book superheroes are those who choose a life of salvation, who give something away voluntarily. Tim Burton's 'Batman' was a good comic book adaptation; one of the best. It blended film noir with action hero, super-hero-type stuff. Very risky, but it paid off. 'Batman Returns' fails miserably.The Dark Knight always was a bit darker than his other superhero friends, such as 'Superman' or 'Spider-Man.' If I had to choose a favorite, it would be Batman: The world he lives in is darker, and he is much more identifiable than someone who is extraordinary; Batman is just a guy tired of the bad life, much like Robert De Niro's Taxi Driver, who once said, 'Here is a man fed up with the crime on the streets.' Batman is, in a way, a sort of Taxi Driver.But director Tim Burton, whose other director outings have included the colossal hit 'Batman' and 'Edward Scissorhands' (both very dark films), fails to seamlessly blend film noir with superhero. The two are contrary, Batman living in a 1940s-era Gotham City always worked, but there's something wrong with this Gotham City. It was the start of more bad sequels, which would all lose the classy vision the original sustained. Things started getting darker and yet, at the same time, much brighter. Dialogue started getting cornier. Situations started getting ludicrous. 'Batman Returns' was the start of this; I keep repeating myself but I'm not sure how to explain what feeling this film gives me. In a way, I love Tim Burton as a director for the Batman series; in another way, I don't. In a way, I like the dark look of Gotham City; in another way, I think it's too dark. In a way, I loved the original; in a way, the sequels all suck.Batman (Michael Keaton), a.k.a. Bruce Wayne, is once again called out to stop the unstoppable Penguin (Danny DeVito), who is trying to take control of Gotham City with the help of Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Christopher Walken (what's his character's name in the film? Who cares.)Many villains followed, many sequels followed, and they all stank. 'Batman Returns' makes the mistake of turning the Penguin, a very dark creature (from what I can tell as I never read the comics very much at all-barely ever, in fact), into an overly creepy, corny character who speaks a lot of clichs. He doesn't convince; Danny DeVito is the perfect casting choice, but his character is too weird to like, or even have fun watching. There's a certain joy in watching Jack Nicholson parade around as the Joker in the original 'Batman'-and though he was the bad guy, I myself kind of felt sad when he died at the end, knowing he would never be seen again (unlike the comics and television shows where he always appears to have died, only to come back again). Danny DeVito is great, but the things his character does, and the way he is captured on screen, is almost too dark to enjoy. This film is essentially much darker than the first, something I never imagined possible for a Batman film. Burton really pushed the envelope on this one.I must admit I have, on occasion, viewed the 'Batman' television show; not the 60s one (though I've seen that, too), but the cartoon show. It's splendid fun; it's a lot like Tim Burton's sequel but actually captures more of what the original film had. The villains, especially the Joker, are great fun to watch. I recommend the cartoon over this film, as Batman fans will find it much more respecting to the comic-strip, and regular moviegoers will actually find it a lot more fun to watch.'Batman Returns' tries a lot of things, but it doesn't get away with them like the first film did. How are we supposed to enjoy watching creepy villains that aren't any fun to watch? To be honest, I don't care. I gave up on trying to solve this after the third film, which though truly terrible, was even more fun to watch than this film (don't ask me why). The fourth was unbearable, but that's another story.2.5/5 stars -</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton can't help himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with Tim Burton is that he lives in his own little universe where the rest of us wouldn't even want to visit.It's not that the man hasn't done some good films. "Beetlejuice", "Ed Wood" and even the first "Batman" film were actually all pretty decent outings. It's when he's left on his own to indulge his inner weirdo that we get some pretty funky results.All Burton/Schumacher Batman films can be divided into a checklist. "How I became a Supervillian" Check. "Batman goes into elaborate costume change sequence" Check. "Supervillian shoots his own minion" Check. "Big overdrawn battle with bad buy at end." Check.Danny Devito seemed like a good choice to play the Penguin because of the similar body types. (Short, pudgy.) But the characters are completely different. The Penguin was a sophisticated, Gentleman bandit. Devito has made his career playing, rude, crude obnoxious characters. Loading him down in a ton of makeup didn't help.Michelle Pfeiffer might have been the stuff of a hundred lesbian fantasies until Haley Berre did the same role some time later, but as a character, she was kind of shallow.And replacing the kind of grim comic book Gotham of the first movie with the weird fantasy of this one further disconnected it...</fullReview>

If they have the Peguin in the new, Christopher Bale Batman movies, I hope they do it a lot better than this ridiculous piece of crap, which was by far the worst of the 4 80-90s Batman movies. Catwoman did not have a good origin, although Michelle Pfeifer was pretty good. The mistake of this and all the 90s Batman movies was they put too many characters in it. The Nicholson-Joker 89 version did not do this, neither did the two Bale movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of a perfectly good joint...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy watching movies when I'm high. As 'The Dark Knight' came close to theaters I decided to watch Tim Burton's 'Batman Returns' to hype my anticipation. What a waste of a Joint that was. This movie made me almost fall asleep. It was just too boring. As a loyal fan to the comics I absolutely refuse to believe that was the Penguin on screen. Killer Croc is more like it. Burton's version of the Penguin consist of a sewer mutant deformed freak who was raised and yes - educated by NAZI penguins with Rocket Launchers on his back. After the Penguins changing his diapers, feeding him and teaching him how to talk proper English grammar he rises from the Sewer to try and become Mayor of Gotham City. Sounds like a comedy? it's not. it's a movie that tries too hard to be serious. Things only get worst when Selina Kyle falls to her death out of a window and becomes the menacing 'Catwoman' after being half aten by Cats. It takes at least 20 minutes in between takes to see the hero of the story (Batman - In case you were wondering). This movie doesn't really have much of a plot. If you want to see it I'm not going to stop you. But don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Top of the list for worst movies. I don't know why these early Batman movies had our hero fighting two villains at once (actually three if you want to count Max Schreck). In my humble opinion, just fighting either the Catwoman alone or the Penguin alone would have had a tighter dramatic structure. However, watching a flock of penguins waddling around with missiles strapped to their backs, supposedly a threat to the citizens Gotham City, was unintentionally one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other then the disastrous Batman And Robin, this movie takes the cake. Batman is yet again just a secondary character to the villains, getting as much time as The Scarecrow did in Batman Begins. In this movie, dumb-witted Tim Burton re-designed the Penguin. He portrayed him very simular to the villain Killer Croc. The Penguin, instead of being a Rich, snobby Nightclub and casino owner, who often supplies Batman with information was turned into a sewer mutant freak puking black and white mucus from his mouth, with feces on his pajamas. Raised and learned English grammar by a bunch of NAZI marching penguins with rocket launchers on their backs who tries running for mayor. While Selina Kyle is pushed out of a window, killed brought back to life by a bunch of cats trying to eat her and becomes Catwoman. But in the comics Catwoman is an ally. Just a sneeky thief. Burton portrayed her as a terrorist. Blowing up buildings and killing everyone in her path. There was no use for even Batman being in this film, he was portrayed as a psycho murderer, Killing petty thugs in his twenty minute cameo scenes. It had no plot at all and was just overly dumb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a quite decent film. In fact, nearly as good as the newest Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises, though it is on a very different vein: this film should be watched as a dark comedy. To say that it is dark film is rather silly in my opinion: everything looks like it was made of cardboard and everything looks fake and harmless. The main villain is rather pathetic and doesn't appear to be serious in any part of the film. Overall, a quite entertaining film but nothing that one could call: a dark masterpiece, as some people had said before about this film. Tim Burton is not the greatest filmmaker ever: his films are cute cardboard looking fantasies, but they fail to attain any sort of greatness a-la-Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Tim Burton, not Batman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in the Emergency Room a few months ago. After all of the good shows were finished, I searched for something to watch and stumbled on "Batman Returns." With no guide, I decided to stay there. I noticed that I sort of enjoyed it, but everything seems more entertaining when you are in the Emergency Room and your pain just melted away. I was also numb to the transgressions of the film because, for some reason I will never comprehend, I had watched it more than one time before. Numbness, however, does not equal quality, and it is never there the first viewing. The problems evident in the first film grow as cancer and leave only sadness, hurt and shame.A crime wave increasingly engulfs Gotham City as Christmas approaches. Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) pushes his design for a new power plant in a private meeting with the Mayor (Michael Murphy) and his aides. In reality, his plant is designed to drain power, simulating a power shortage so he can be the city's savior and turn a sick profit. When Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), his insecure secretary, discovers this purpose, Schreck shoves her out of a top floor window. Revived by Cats, she returns to her apartment, mentally snaps, and becomes Catwoman.Meanwhile, the Penguin (Danny DeVito) kidnaps Schreck. In his lair near the sewers, he blackmails Schreck into helping him with a heroic introduction to the public. Schreck soon arrives at a scheme to recall the mayor so he can push his plant unopposed. He convinces Penguin to run as the replacement. Even when he bites a man's nose for all to see, the public still adores him. That reaction is simply too big to leap, much like how the Penguin's men find blueprints to the Batmoblie, much less the technical knowledge to rewire it. Catwoman later joins Penguin after Batman interferes with her vendetta against Schreck, but Penguin is preoccupied with bedding her.The plot I have just described is not as clearly stated in the film. The film jerks unevenly from one subplot to another, and eventually the main story becomes blurred under all the shifting sands.Director Tim Burton's portrayal of the Penguin is unforgivable. Instead of a high class criminal who happens to be fat and have a big nose, Penguin is now a hideously deformed midget. When he is only a baby he eats a live cat. His hands look like claws. He spits and drools blue saliva. His underlings dress in circus costumes. At one point he eats a raw fish, and I don't mean sushi. He actually bites the fish and digs in. Scientists should study his immune system. He violates so many laws of biology he may as well be a new species.Rarely has a cinema character been so filled with pain and hatred. His parents dumped him in a sewer stream as an infant. At some point, circus performers take him in and incorporate him into their freak show, later shut down after complaints of missing children. The Penguin has no function in life; he only wants to hurt people. He is a sexual deviant, such as the time he massages a woman's breast while placing a campaign button. His ultimate plan is so depraved the film should be rated R for that alone. When we see it in action, his gang's transportation is so inefficient they can not possibly finish even a fraction of what they are attempting.The whole film is mean-spirited, but never more than during Penguin's demise. He is publicly disgraced and pelted with rotten fruit. Afterward, he wildly screams "MY NAME IS NOT OSWALD! IT IS PENGUIN! I AM NOT A HUMAN BEING! I AM AN ANIMAL!" Next, his life's dream fails and then his gang abandons him as Batman closes in for the kill. In the end, he is reduced to screams of misery as he wildly slashes air with his umbrella. As his slow, inhumane demise reaches its conclusion, blue ink pours from his mouth in such great amounts he would be dead in seconds were it blood. I normally enjoy seeing villains suffer, but the Penguin's thirty minute destruction is depressing, not fun. He was never treated as a human from day one; he never had a chance. Yes, he is evil, but the indescribable cruelty he suffers is so great that in the end I pitied him.The film's blunders do not end with Penguin. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) remains quiet and reclusive. "Why are you now determined to prove that this Penguin is not what he seems? Must you be the only lonely man-beast in town?" wonders Alfred (Michael Gough). We first see him sitting pensively, gazing at the floor as if an internal battle is happening in the deepest recesses of his mind. Again, the film treats Batman as being a curse. During a key scene between Wayne and Selina, he speaks about he could not reconcile the "two truths" of his life. His "difficulty with duality" destroyed his previous relationship. He later speaks about being "split right down the center." Even the cavernous, dark sets of Wayne Manor suggest a depressing, lonely existence.The whole movie overflows with festering pain and permanent wounds. Instead of delivering a dynamite climax, the film focuses even more on torturing its characters. Schreck and Catwoman eventually turn up, and then it becomes her turn for an emotional beating. It is the only part of the climax that works, and it does because of Walken. Actually, the only dramas that work are those involving Schreck, and Walken deserves exclusive credit.During all of this, Wayne tears off the hood of his Batsuit. Catwoman earlier penetrates it with homemade claws. The inconsistency continues as Wayne conveniently drops for five minutes after being shot. More proof that Burton is willing to bend anything to fit his misplaced exercise in malice and spite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get sick thinking about this movie. Really, seriously, legitimately sick to my stomach. It's either because it was really bad, or it had so much muck in it that cinema screens across America had to be scrubbed after showing it.Actually, it's both.This sequel to Tim Burton's groundbreaking 1989 version of "Batman" features the return of Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight. With Burton's trademark directorial style, there's bound to be some darkness. But not only darkness-- dankness as well! Danny DeVito, as the sewer-reared Penguin (there are penguins living in the sewer?), looks like an escapee from a low-budget toothpaste commercial. Michelle Pfeiffer, as the other villain, the kinky Catwoman, looks like she lost her way on the road to that elusive porn awards ceremony.Even the Joker's tumble into a vat of green acid was pleasant compared to the sickening imagery of this movie. Beyond the look and unsavory feel, the film dreadfully wastes such talent as Burton, Keaton, and Christopher Walken (of course, he visits the bottom of the barrel quite frequently) on a much more nauseating re-tread of the exact same shtick.The one main thing going for this movie is something it only acquired in 1997: the fact that it was nowhere near as bewilderingly awful as "Batman &amp; Robin."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Too Dark Knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's first Batman film was widely praised, largely for its serious tone. Serious by comic book movie standards anyway. There was darkness and gloominess in that first film which Burton used to great effect. In Batman Returns Burton upped the ante on the darkness. He went really dark. I mean really, really dark. Way too dark for his movie's good. One can imagine thousands of happy young tykes bouncing into the theater excited to see a Batman movie only to come out two hours later crying their eyes out and headed for an appointment with a child psychologist. Fun for the whole family? Not this movie. This is more horror film than superhero saga. I guess when a movie begins with parents tossing their infant child into a river you can forget about it being a feel-good story. And when that child floats into a sewer and is rescued by penguins we know who our villain's going to be this time around.So it's Penguin. And Burton's concept for this character sinks the movie. What a vile, disgusting creature. A sick, twisted, perverted little man whose diabolical plans, when finally revealed, are almost too awful to comprehend. It's the stuff of nightmares. If Burton was looking to frighten a whole generation of kids he probably succeeded. If he was looking to make a good movie he failed. The Penguin is a depraved character who makes the movie way scarier than any mass-audience comic book movie should be. And aside from the scares parents will probably want to be covering their children's eyes and ears with all the upfront sexual innuendo in the movie. "Mommy, what's poontang?" This is a Batman movie for crying out loud, you know kids are going to swarm to see it. But Burton made a movie with very grownup sensibilities. OK, so maybe it's too adult, maybe it's not what you really expect a Batman movie to be. But putting that aside there's still the fact that it's simply a bad movie.You feel bad for Danny DeVito who, in playing Penguin, was given a character who wasn't salvageable. Penguin's not the only villain though. There are a couple more and they largely fail too. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Selina Kyle who is of course destined to become Catwoman. How exactly does Selina become Catwoman? Quite ludicrously. Pfeiffer makes the most of what she's got to work with. Catwoman's got her moments which is more than you can say for Penguin who is an off-putting, grotesque abomination from start to finish. Then there's powerful, corrupt Gotham businessman Max Shreck. The best thing that you can say about this character is that he's played by Christopher Walken, who always brings his own unique touch to any film. But Shreck's not particularly interesting, has no backstory to give us a reason to care about him, and he disappears for large portions of the film. Three villains in this case don't add up to much. And oh by the way Michael Keaton's Batman again. Keaton was largely overshadowed by Jack Nicholson's Joker in the first film. But, both as Batman and perhaps more crucially as Bruce Wayne, Keaton contributed a great deal to the first film. Here he really doesn't get a chance to do much of anything at all. Neither Batman nor Bruce ever are really able to grab hold of this movie. It's a dark, gloomy tale of the bad guys, the Penguin in particular. And where Nicholson's Joker infused the first film with so much energy the Penguin sucks the life out of this film. There's very little to enjoy here. Is it so much to ask to have a little fun in a comic book movie? No fun here, just gloom and doom and a movie which really disappoints.</fullReview>

I've also noticed that most of the good reviews are from admitted Tim Burton lovers, something I make no claim to be. "Batman &amp; Robin" is constantly maligned for being the downfall of this franchise (before Chris Nolan got his hands on it, of course), but this movie is just as bad as that one. I don't know, Burton's first Batman along with the two Nolan episodes are wonderful, but the other three ("Returns," "Forever," and "Robin") are just a waste of time. Maybe a 13 year old boy will fall for this crap, but the only adult fans I can imagine enjoying this film are those who will buy anything Burton does simply because it's Burton.</fullReview>

The sequel brings in two tone villains from the cartoon that nobody even liked including The Penguin and Catwoman. Danny Devito was the best choice for the Penguin but I never liked the villain. He just seemed like some old guy in the sewers with a birth defect who likes to play with birds and collect umbrellas. Catwoman was a bad choice for second villain. She made no sense to be here, I hated her character as well. Plus ever sense the Halie Berrie version of Catwoman came out, you can't take Batman Returns Catwoman seriously. Christopher Walken as Max was alright, not a bad guy from the cartoons but he was a good mad up bad guy who ran on his own rules. Keaton returns ounce again as Batman and his performance has dropped low ever sense the first Batman. Sure this film is dark and has an edge but it falls like a rock. Batman and Robin at least was perfect for a six year old to enjoy while this film would make kids run and cry. The villains are lame, the plot with Penguin is stupid, and the directing is all down the toilet. Batman Returns gets the big 2, low sequel that has no entertainment.

Even a Luke warm homage to Burguess Meredith would have been a better sequel to the first Batman.Imagine this: DeVito could have played a millionaire eccentric bird lover whose fortune had been taken away, (obviously a rip off plot from Trading Places) but it would lend the character some more power. Then he attacks the city with his army of penguins. Lovable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have really never seen a film that is worse than this. There is one improbable situation after another and nothing is thought out to make any sense. It looked to me like the makers of this film figured that they had a gold mine on their hands and because the first made a ton of money, they could make a quickie film that has no concern for detail, plot, characterization, direction, script, stunts or anything that makes a film entertaining.The film looks like it was filmed on a sound stage and you can tell because when it is supposed to be below zero outside, there is no mist coming from the breath of the people in the scene. And that is only one small complaint. The biggest one is that this film suffers from what I like to call the respected man is suddenly a bad guy syndrome.Batman is a respected, hard working, guardian angel in Gotham City. He has been like that for a while now. Suddenly a shady figure that is grotesque looking and walks like a Penguin enters the picture. Within days of his arrival on the scene, not only has the penguin miraculously discredited Batman but he has managed to get the entire city against him. He has been ostracized from public safety and this leaves the Penguin alone to do his diabolical plans.Is this the best they can come up with? I mean, aren't writers smarter than that? Can't they write a better way for the Penguin to do what he does? I really hate this movie. With all that I am, I hate it. But it made a ton of money because kids love this crap and for the rest of us that want to see a good film and hope to God that this film will be a welcome distraction for two hours of our summer, are not only disappointed, we are disgusted.

		<shortDescription>this movie went so wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Michael Keaton and Tim Burton return for this sequel to BATMAN (1989), this movie was a terrible followup to the blockbuster film. While the original film was dark and terribly entertaining, this film was far, far darker and offered little that could be seen as entertaining.Instead of a funny and over-the-top villain like the Joker, this one features Danny DeVito as one of the ugliest and most repellent villains of all time. In addition, the back story just made no sense at all and was just 100% stupid. A horrid couple have a horribly deformed baby. So, they do what most folks would do--chuck the kid in the sewer! There, he is somehow transported to a land where he is raised by animals. Later, he creates an army of evil armed penguins.Now, no matter how good the film is from this point on, the premise and characters are so stupid that it can't help but fail. It's visually impressive but also ugly and nihilistic. After starring in this mess, I can understand why Keaton bowed out of future Batman films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible and even more cartoonish than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sequel that I did not expect nor like. I figured why not see if they can at least try and make something better. But nope , it still plays like a cartoon. Danny Devito has got to be the worst actor to play a villain in a Batman movie with Schwarznegger a close second. Not that he just overacts but there is nothing menacing or interesting about his Penguin character - in the comic books he is not a mutant like he is portrayed here ,here he is more a caricature. Catwoman is also another boring character and Michelle Pfeiffer is sorely miscast with her cheesecake look at me acting. Once again Keaton returns as Batman(good lord ?? you mean no other taller decent actors would step up ?) I'm sorry but I cannot watch a short shi* play Batman. Lousy movie yet again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I've ever saw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is bad beyond belief. I don't know, perhaps, there are worse movies than this one, I just haven't seen them. And I am not the kind of person, who would say it about any movie that I did not like. I never gave a movie 1 star before. I do not believe in giving a movie 1 star if I think it is over-hyped or I disagree with the high ratings it received here on IMDb. I would give it 4/10 3/10, whatever I think it deserves in my opinion. And Batman Returns is still 1/10 for me. Everything about it is bad. There is not much story to speak of. There is Batman/Bruce Wayne, the rich man, who fights bad guys. There is not 1 additional thing in the movie that we learn about his character. What are his motivations? Not a word. There is another rich man Max Shreck - he is bad. Nothing more to say about him. Does he care about anything (his money, his power, women, other people idolizing him). Well we do not learn anything about him either. There is Penguin. We know his parents abandoned him, because he was a freak of nature and he has disgusting habits. Well, he is disgusting, I get it from the first introduction do I need the whole movie about seeing him do terrible things to others... But I am not expecting much out of a story. It is a superhero movie. They don't usually offer much in terms of character development. Although, this movie is the worst one of the pack. However, the story is not the worst part. What is truly terrible is the acting! Should I call it amateurish. No I think it would be offensive to amteur actors. I honestly believe that if somebody just picked up some random people from the street and cast them they would come off more believable, more human-like than what we see in this ... garbage movie. And some last remarks. I am no writer, but I can create a better script in a couple of days. I am no director, but I can create a better movie than this stinker. P.S. Usually when I watch a bad movie, I just start making fun of how unbelievable the script or terrible the acting is. This piece of crap is beyond my capacity for humor. I was bored out of my mind and finished watching the movie only because I was astonished by how terrible it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodness me! It's Christopher Walken!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my goodness! It's Christopher Walken as Shreck! Goodness me! We must all respect this movie now.Goodness me! I cannot believe Walken is in this! Golly Gosh Goodness Me! Even though this movie is dull as dishwater, at least we have Christopher Walken as Shrek! Goodness Me! We are lucky! The first Batman gave us the "Goodness Me!" factor of Jack Nicholson appearing as The Joker ( Goodness Me!). This one gives us the "Goodness Me!" factor of Walken appearing in it.Shame there are no other saving graces for this bland extravaganza. Pfeiffer is bland. Devito is short and bland. The script crawls along like a turtle with leg trouble.Still, on the redeeming side we have Walken as Shrek. He can save it for us. Goodness me!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most horrible and violent movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comment does have spoilersBatman Returns has got to be the most overrated movie I have ever seen. One of the main reasons why I hate it is because of the animal cruelty. In the beginning, the Penguin is born and his parents lock him in a cage, 2 seconds later, you see a cute cat going past the cage and you see the Penguin grabbing it and killing it, you hear the cats screams and crying out. It was just horrible.Then halfway through the film, Catwoman is working for the Penguin and she eats his canary. What was the point in that?Don't see this film if you love animals, in fact don't see it anyway because of the bad acting, bad story and bad special effects.</fullReview>
