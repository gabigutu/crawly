		<shortDescription>The Pieta of Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Rublev (alternately transliterated as Andrei Rublyov) is an epic film created by the Soviet-era director, Andrei Tarkovsky. It was financed and created during a brief cultural thaw in East-West relations, marked by the end of Kruschchev's reign. Within reason, the 205 minute director's cut represents exactly what Tarkovsky wanted in the movie. Unfortunately for Tarkovsky and for us, Kruschev was deposed shortly after filming began, and the 205 minute version was not seen until twenty five years after its creation. The Breszhnev-era censors first trimmed 15 minutes from it, then censors and marketers trimmed more. The shortest known version has been truncated to 145 minutes. Even more sadly, Tarkovsky was never again to get approval for the projects he really wanted to film, or an adequate budget to film the ones that did get approved.Fortunately for us, this movie, recently rereleased in a DVD transferred from a pristine 35mm print, may now be viewed intact, and it is one of the great triumphs of mankind's stay on the planet. It is a masterpiece almost without flaw. The beautiful painterly images follow one another in breathtaking succession. At least three of the eight chapters, if taken individually, could stand alone as separate masterpieces.The ostensible subject is the life of Andrei Rublev, a 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia's greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Rublev himself, however, is merely a useful device. Little is known about him, and most of the episodes in the movie come straight from Tarkovsky's imagination of what might have been. Sometimes one must ignore the facts to get to the truth.The movie is not about one talented monk, but about Russia, and Rublev stands in as a useful symbol since he lived in a time when he could personally witness two of the key elements in the development of Russia's unique culture: the growing force of Byzantine Christianity, and the Mongol-Tatar invasions. In addition he was an artist and a thinker, and experienced first-hand the difficulty of following those paths in Russia. Rublev's own inner conflicts allow the filmmaker to illuminate thoughts on the pagan and the sacred, the nature of art, the relationship of the artist to the state, what it means to be Russian, and what it means to be human.It is beautiful, mystical, and profound, but the truly inspiring aesthetics are matched with complete technical wizardry. I simply don't know how some of the shots were created. One I do understand, and stand in awe of, is a continuous single camera shot, just before the church door is breached by Tatar invaders, which involves action in several different locations at multiple elevations as well as the correct timing of hundreds of extras and horses. It makes the first scene of Touch of Evil look like a high school film project.It is a difficult movie to follow. One might liken it to James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake as a work of genius so monumental and complex, and so disdainful of traditional narrative form, that it requires extensive thought and study to understand it. And even after studying it, watching it repeatedly, and reading Tarkovsky's own comments about it, one still finds it opaque in many ways.Tarkovsky was free to create the work of art he wanted, without concern for profit. The original 205 minute cut was also free from outside censorship. He used this freedom to realize his personal artistic vision. There is no other movie like it, and there may never be. Score it 11 out of 10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What side will you take?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some historical knowledge will definitely not hurt while watching this film.The medieval society was deeply religious. The church influenced every aspect of people's lives from birth to death and was part of the state. It means religious leaders were as important as rulers.In Russian society men were wearing beards and women covered hairs. Remove a beard from a man or uncover woman's hair and you will humiliate them, they would feel like modern people being undressed in public.Paganism is a form of religion, where people believe in many gods instead of one. The main Russian pagan gods are the goddess of the earth and the god of the sun. Among others - the god of storms and lightning, the mythical young women living in forests and rivers. Despite many centuries of suppression of paganism by authorities some in modern Russia still celebrate the feast of Ivan Kupala (which could be translated as Ivan Gathering) depicted in the movie.Also I have to mention, that Soviet censors told Tarkovski the movie is too cruel. They told him the scene with a burning cow, for example, is absolutely unacceptable. Tarkovski tried to defend the movie. The cow wasn't harmed, was his reasoning. Still the film was cut. The censors knew better what is good and what is not for the viewer.This brings us to what is the message of Tarkovski in this film. There are many messages actually. I'll be telling only about one here, because it is not hidden. It is there, in the dispute between Rublov and Theophanes The Greek. They both are talented, both want to bring people to humanity. Theophanes is tired, he says - common people live in darkness, they are completely consumed by sin and the only way to make them humans is to scare them and punish them. Rublov advocates for love. He says: people live very difficult life, it's amazing how they endure it. We have to love them, to remind them, they are humans, they are Russians. You see, the first is the position of the Soviet system, the second - of Jesus Christ.Me? I'm still sitting on the fence. :)I recommend to watch this movie many times. You will do it without my recommendation though, if you (like me) will not understand everything from the first view and you like to think. The mesmerizing beauty of this movie will help you to return easier. For the first time be prepared for not a cakewalk. There are two things to consider here. One is the cruelty. Though it is absolutely necessary in this film, most of us living in a comfort of modern society are not ready to it. The other is the pace. Often it is a pace of real life. Peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Andrei Rublev" is not merely my favourite all-time film; it transcends such pat, by-the-numbers praise. I have seen "Andrei Rublev" three times (twice on the big screen), at three very different points in my life. Each viewing, it has spoken eloquently and directly, has immersed and fascinated me. And has moved me with superlative skill and force. Other great movies have entertained me, inspired me, made me think; only "Rublev" has palpably altered my outlook on life.Andrei Rublev was a medieval Russian iconographer; the film chronicles his struggle to maintain faith and artistry in a world of immeasurable cruelty and suffering. Rather than give us a crackerjack plot line with all the proper scene climaxes &amp; paradigm shifts, director Tarkovsky presents us with a world in which we must immerse ourselves; once we are inside, we are confronted with rigorous pain and profound triumph. The movie is divided into chapters; the final one, involving an orphaned bell-maker's son, is a stunning film-within-a-film that provides a microcosm of the whole movie. That section, if it stood alone, would be my all-time favourite film.Be warned: "Andrei Rublev" is SLOW. You have to slide into it; it's not a flick which dazzles, it is a world which beguiles, and which demands to be inhabited. Also, there are EXTREMELY difficult scenes to watch--torture and bloodshed abounds. Watching the Tartar attack on a Russian town is the most painful experience I've ever had--not just in a cinema, but in life.For those willing to make the gruelling trek, however, "Andrei Rublev" is an inspiring, life-affecting experience. Created under an oppressive Soviet regime (which banned the film for years, recognizing its symbolic commentary on 20th-century Soviet government), the film shows how life can be valuable and even joyful, no matter how much suffering stands in the way.Especially recommended for Tarkovsky fans, Dostoevsky fans, fans of medieval art, and anyone grappling with questions about suffering and human expression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody Tarkovsky!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He has ruined cinema for me and this is one of the masterpieces that did it. Everytime you see one of his film's you proclaim: "That's the best picture ever made!" Which can't be true as that was the last Tarkovsky film you saw. I've seen this one many times at the cinema and is the best three hours of celluloid you're likely to see apart from Solaris, which is Tarkovsky anyway.Tarkovsky wanted to make art that would change people's lives and in this he succeeded. Although his life was troubled and his projects clawed into life randomly from the grip of his film studio bosses, when viewed as a whole they seem to be all part of some great plan that was meant to reach fruition right from the start. He believed that ultimately it is best to do things that deepen one's inner life rather than impoverish it. That may explain why you leave most Hollywood films feeling soiled. There are too many great scenes and moments in this astonishing and monumental work to mention so I won't. Suffice it to say it would have been fascinating to have seen what Tarkovsky would have made had he lived and returned from exile to his homeland. Recent events in Russia and the Balkans make this film even more vital and pertinent today.The trouble is Tarkovsky's films have such extraordinary purity and spiritual depth that no other films seem able to satisfy one in the same way. They seem flat, lifeless and unable to compete. Why watch the let's-pretend-grown ups like Tarantino when you can watch a real grown up? So like I said, Bloody Tarkovsky. He has ruined cinema for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The gospel according to Andrei Rublev</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who has seen this movie roughly five times and regards it as the greatest masterpiece in the history of cinema, I find it difficult to fathom how anyone can think that Andrei Rublev is "slow" or "boring". It is true that it's slow-paced, and perhaps too demanding in its unconventional structure of narrative, but I would prefer this to anything commercial cinema releases in its quest to appeal to as broad a market a possible. In other words, given the choice between a film that treats its audience with respect and gives you enough credit to assume you are willing to sit through roughly three hours of lengthy dialogue and long takes, not to mention some of the most mesmerisingly beautiful visuals ever seen on screen; and one which treats its audience like a demographic that can be appealed to like consumers, not individuals with their own dreams, fears, hopes and aspirations, I know which type of cinema truly bores me.It is often the case that art serves as a mechanism used to comment on social- or individuals ills; rarely however, if at all, does it reflect on itself and its own function to humanity. This is what makes Andrei Rublev a unique and important film, since it addresses the role of the artist in the world. Any questions regarding historical accuracy (or rather lack thereof) towards Rublev's personal life are slightly pointless, since the character is merely used as a vehicle to drive the thematic elements of the narrative. That's not to say that Rublev here is an empty shell, it's simply that Tarkovsky used him as a means to impose his personal views on the subject. Why create art? Does being an artist mean expressing love for humanity? If so, why should one express love for something which seems to hate itself? These are just a few of the questions which arise from viewing this film (and some of which Rublev seems to ask himself, illustrated by at first a naive belief in the good in all humanity, then disillusion, and eventually a rekindling of faith), but it makes the montage of Rublev's work at the end of the film all the more effective, since it creates an understanding of the pain and anguish that lie behind these images.To regard Andrei Rublev as one movie (assuming that the general definition of a movie is simply a big chunk of storyline) would do some injustice to the brilliantly unorthodox nature of its narrative, in that it's a collection of eight mini-story lines, all of which can be viewed as individual pieces, and three of which could easily pass as masterpieces in their own right. My personal favourite is the third one; Rublev's dialogue with Theophanes The Greek over the self-destructive nature of humanity is, to me at least, one of the most moving moments on film (this is possibly due to Theophanes voicing an opinion I personally arrived at some time before initially watching this film - and one I unfortunately happen to agree with).Like most of Tarkovsky's movies, Andrei Rublev demands repeated viewings so the film can be absorbed and understood in full. But by doing so you'll begin to realise that this is possibly the most rewarding of all cinematic works, and consequently the most wonderful. The best film ever made? I certainly think so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is impossible to understand at once. You need to watch it at least twice to be able to understand something. At first it seems to be an abstract art-house film about a painter in the 15th century, a film which talks about one artist's plight towards his own ideals in difficult times, a philosophical/historical movie. And it may be the part of the great Tarkovsky's intention.Yet as you watch it twice you realize that it is also about religion. And about the ideal of man. The first scene clearly shows how man has always strived to reach towards something higher and how he often failed. This film is also about human nature, as always in Tarkovsky's films. We follow Andrei through his dark and troubled times and adventures and of special importance is the Tatar attack part. Here we see Tarkovsky depict the everlasting hunger for power and the effect it can have on a man. The Russian prince betrays his own country and must stand trial to his own conscience after watching the town of Vladimir get destroyed by the horde of wild Tatars. The scene in the church is also of greater significance, as is the river scene with the pagan festival. They all show the conflict of religions and also moral values.All said, the movie wouldn't be as great without the last part, the one with the boy and the church bell. It illustrates the rebirth of Russia, Christian Russia and the final scene with the hoisting of the bell is one of the best scenes ever in film history. It shows us that faith is a feeble thing;if the bell didn't work, everything would have ended differently. But thanks to a boy's dedication and hard work, the bell tolled and the faith returned to the feeble heads and hearts of people.The miraculous sudden appearance of color in the very end and the wonderful,solemn music really highlight the ultimate message of this film. Which is-art is sacred and immortal and transcends time.At the time of its release, I believe only Tarkovsky himself and perhaps Andrey Kontchalovsky, the co-writer, knew just how great a masterpiece this film really is. It has taken the world some time to discover it, but it was worth it. With perfect acting, specially by Anatoli Solonytsin, perfect music, perfect screenplay and perfect direction, what else can I give it but a perfect 10?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest films ever made. Films like this are what give the medium its purpose. It is rich, beautifully shot and acted, and extraordinarily powerful. Like all great works of art, it requires many viewings and much thought to discover the various layers of intellectual and aesthetic meaning within it. That is why a simple description of the plot would give the prospective viewer little idea of what the movie is actually about. True, it is the tale of Russia's greatest icon painter. But it is also a rumination on art, the artist, relgion, love, culture, conformity, cruelty, and much more. See it and discuss it with some bright friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the greatest film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the great quantity of films in existence, there are very few that even come close to being considered the greatest of all time. Having seen my share of 'masterpieces' I have come to regard Andrei Rublev as the greatest of them all, although I admit that this is debatable. Nonetheless, this film seems to be stigmatized as being too long or boring - maybe because it's by Tarkovksy, or that it's black and white, or that it's Russian - I really don't know where this comes from. If you can get past any preconceived notions of what the movie is going to be like,and just sit down for a few seconds and watch it, you will probably be able to see from the beginning that this is an extremely important, unmissable film - not to mention captivating and exciting, although very dark and disturbing throughout. The amount of skill and thought, and work that went into this film echoes within the timeless imagery that the director has created. Any serious fan of the cinema would be doing themselves a serious disservice by avoiding this movie any longer. If you interested in the works of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, you'll be able to take something of another level from this film, as there are many subtle references and parallels to their writings and teachings throughout this movie. It could be argued that the film itself is a cinematic representation of the law of three. Regardless, this is a truly extraordinary thing to behold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is set in mediaeval Russia, the world of unspeakable cruelty, poverty and injustice. And yet, this is a profoundly humanistic, profoundly spiritual, profoundly individualistic and profoundly uncompromising film. The photography is absolutely beautiful, mesmerising, original and superb. But it is the anguished soul and conscience of this film and of its main hero that truly make this a great picture.There are no cliches here, no stereotypes and no sucking up to the audience. A brutally honest and yet very moving, touching and optimistic film. And it is not about the nature of a genius. Rather, it is about a man's ability and duty to preserve and be true to his humanity, his freedom, his soul, his heart and his gift, no matter what century it is or what the circumstances are. Watch it to remind yourself of what it really means to be human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knowledge as an Impediment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I follow several threads of fine films. Most of these concern intelligent notions of structure, of architecture. Welles, Greenaway, Eisenstein, Kurosawa. These mend sense and intellect enhancing both.But there is another thread, one that eschews selfaware structure -- where idea is anathema. Nature is celebrated. Rich intuition and meditative spontaneity are sufficiently nutritious in some hands, but these are amazingly few. The so-called 'new wave' tried it, at least initially. Lots of other appearances as well, mostly failures, some lovely. Among the attempts, I know of only two filmmakers who have mastered this tricky approach of avoiding knowledge: Tarkovsky and Malick. Of these, Malick is more abstractly sensual.After all, Tarkovsky must deal with that dark cloth of Russian self-pity, that tradition of grand themes and epic fate, something which does not burden Malick. So the metaphoric content is heavy. That's fine, an acceptable skeleton for a nearly three hour meditation. All is self-referential: a set of images about an imagemaker: the actor's wife played the retarded girl who factors so importantly. During the production he was cheating on her with who was to become his second wife. The girl goes off with a Tartar, leaving Rublev. Many other scenes refer to Rublev's situation, resolved by Tarkovsky's action. For instance, we have a sequence where Rublev hesitates to paint a scene of fateful pain. This is followed by Tarkovsky doing just that. The extension of metaphor among parts of the film (ballooner and bellringer to Rublev's story) extends from the film to the filmmaker and thence from him to us.What I found even more interesting was his confidence in complex compositions and long, long multiperspective tracking shots. Compared to other swoopers, this camera seems curious, impetuous, not at all as if the shots were planned. Hard to believe it is only his second feature. This alone expands one's imagination with only a couple viewings, but combined with the notion of folded metaphor (including visual metaphor) it becomes a truly great and singular work.(Some classical symmetries touch multiple places: a jester within the play; solitude in the context of relationship; creating in the unknown; broken symmetry through one twin killing another. Some new ones: pagan fire and water underlying ritual exuberance, either sex or religious art.)Alas, the DVD has a discouragingly vapid commentary. But then I guess that's the whole point, and with the loss of potatohead Soviets, we need to substitute the next best thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You'll cast bells, I'll paint icons"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as Andrei Rublev faced doubt about whether or not, having sinned, he could continue his celebrated iconography, I likewise find myself in two minds about Andrei Tarkovsky's film. My experience with the director's other work is, as usual, limited, but I still couldn't shake that persistent expectation that I would love 'Andrei Rublev (1969).' There is certainly much to love about it, but my appreciation for the film can best be described as admiration rather than affection, and, though I can speak with only the utmost praise for Tarkovsky's achievement, it doesn't occupy that exclusive space close to my heart. The film is a deeply-personal religious work, an examination of faith and moral values, and so perhaps it's inevitable that the film didn't leave such a deep impression, considering my preference towards atheism; one unfortunately cannot discard all personal convictions for the mere purposes of appreciating a work of art. I do, however, like to think that the majesty of cinema, in most cases, is able to transcend religious boundaries.Andrei Tarkovsky released his first feature-length film, 'Ivan's Childhood,' in 1962. Even prior to its release, the director had already expressed interest in filming the life of great Russian iconographer Andrei Rublev, even though very little is actually known about his life. Working with a screenplay written by himself and Andrei Konchalovsky, Tarkvosky began filming in 1964, and a 205-minute cut was screened for a private audience in Moscow in 1966. The critical response, however, was mixed, and sizeable cuts were made to the film's running time, before a 186-minute version screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 1969. I'm not entirely sure which version I ended up watching; the time counter indicated somewhere around 165 minutes, though my brief research couldn't uncover any major missing sequences. In hindsight, I should probably have held out for longer and acquired the Criterion Collection DVD, which restores the picture to its four-hour glory. In several years' time, when I inevitably decide to revisit Tarkovsky's film, I'll make certain to do just that.'Andrei Rublev' is divided into nine distinct segments, including a colour epilogue displaying Rublev's weathered icons as they exist today. They each explore a facet of the great painter's life, placing particular emphasis on his faith in God and how it relates to his work on frescos and icons. Interestingly, though Rublev (Anatoli Solonitsyn) himself appears in most of the stories, he is often hidden in the background, a passive observer on the behaviour of others, including Kirill (Ivan Lapikov), who is jealous of Rublev's recognition, and young Boriska (Nikolai Burlyayev), who successfully casts a bell using faith rather than knowledge. One consequence of this narrative format is a lack of cohesiveness in Tarkovsky's storytelling. We adequately follow the plot of each segment, but, as the whole, the film doesn't seem to build towards any notable climactic revelation ? the completed film is equal to the sum of its parts, which is still very impressive, but pulls it short of being a masterpiece. Once again, however, I must acknowledge that the 205-minute version may potentially correct this problem.One statement that can not be disputed, however, is that 'Andrei Rublev' really is a beautiful piece of film-making. Vadim Yusov's black-and-white photography captures the exquisite delicateness of nature with almost heartbreaking intricacy; even the raindrops of a midday shower are imbued with the gentle elegance of the Heaven from which they ostensibly fell. Tarkovsky finds simple beauty in the quiver of a tree branch in the breeze, the leisurely flow of a river, herds of livestock fleeing from an aerial balloon. In portraying the complete opposite, the destruction of nature, the director is capable but not quite the master he is otherwise. The raiding of Vladimir by a troop of Tatars was obviously supposed to be the centrepiece of the picture, but Tarkovsky underplays every detail to such an extent that his "chaos" ultimately winds down into a staged conflict. Compare this sequence with Sergei Bondarchuk's burning of Moscow in 'War and Peace (1967),' in which one feels as though he has descended into the fires of Hell, and the contrast is telling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who is more truly arrogant - a film-maker who makes a three-hour film, or someone who takes it upon himself to criticise the film after only watching two hours on the grounds that "my time is too valuable"? Tarkovsky spent 1961-65 planning and making the film and 1966-71 waiting for it to get some kind of release. Is three hours of your time really that much more valuable than ten years of his? One thing I will say, though, is that the subtitles on the London print were appalling - whoever thought that contemporary American slang was an acceptable way of translating medieval Russian should have suffered the same treatment meted out to the stonemasons. But I certainly can't blame Tarkovsky for that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more I explore Tarkovsky the more I get confused. No, don't take me wrong, I get confused in which movie of his should be my favorite. Ivan, Solaris, Stalker all were 9/10 that is I simply loved all those, but after watching this I have to rate this as 11/10 and my favorite AK's creation but it doesn't seem very real as all his other movies (so far I have seen) are all simply beautiful. AK's movies are the link between me and Russia, as I am not Russian and don't even know their language, culture or even country very well. So after watching his work it seems to me as if I am getting closer to the country and everything about it. It's an amazing experience for me as a viewer and a person.Now talking about Rublev, this movie is rather than a story of Rublev is a story of his times, times he lived in. Turbulent times that Russia in general went through as he lived in it as a painter. I think this is a major point why this movie is so good and works so well. The photography is amazing each frame of the movie is actually as if a work of painter, background score is too good blends very well with the scenes, acting too is good especially the main central role. He makes you feel his problems, worries, soul search all as real. Coming to direction it is undoubtedly one of the best works of Tarkovsky and I wonder why this movie is not listed in any of the top 100 movies of all time as a matter of fact any other Tarkovsky's movies. Each frame of the movie is picture perfect right from the opening scene when a man is trying to fly in the hot balloon to the end when the bell is tolled perfectly to the great art work of Tarkovsky in real. The movie has all the Tarkovsky's signature element in them, beautiful use of earth elements air, water and fire to the great effect as well his soul searching, God related questions, answers, explanation and all. Also most important point for many movie goers who criticize him for his slow paced movies, this one is very different from his other movies, even though it's long but not for a single second you will feel bored as it is not slow paced and keeps you engaged in the story. Rating: 11/10. I cannot wait to explore his other movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the All Time Greatest Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched the 205 minute cut of Andrei Rublev, on a DVD from the Criterion Collection. At first, I was extremely confused. But soon enough I was able to accept the fact that this would not be a "conventional" movie, so to speak, and sat back and relaxed, ready for one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life.That being said, once I was finished, I thought, "Meh." The film seemed to me to be overly long and a bit boring in parts. I still liked it, but thought that it was overrated.But then I couldn't get it out of my head. I kept thinking about the symbolism, the beautiful black and white cinematography, the somber performances, the haunting soundtrack, and the brilliant direction.I realized that to view this film, one must be prepared to watch three and a half emotionally taxing hours of pure, unadulterated genius. And so, within a few hours, my opinion of this movie changed to mediocre to one of the greatest movies of all time.God, looking back on what I've written, I realize that I must sound like a pretentious hipster d-bag. I assure you this is not the case, and my reviews, on IMDb or otherwise, don't usually come across like this. I can only say, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and one that requires repeat viewings.</fullReview>

Basically this story, divided into eight episodes, charts the life of the famous iconic painter, artist Andrei Rublev (Anatoli Solonitsyn), who lives in 15th Century Russia. The film is essentially a study and insight into the meaningfulness and importance of art, religion and faith, and how these ideas are challenged with the events played out. The historical events that occur include an attempt at the first hot air balloon, the decoration of Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow, and of course the Tsardom of Russia, which included the invasion by the Tatar people. Starring Ivan Lapikov as Kirill, Nikolai Grinko as Danil Chorny, Nikolai Sergeyev as Theophanes the Greek, Irma Raush as Idiot Girl (Durochka), Nikolay Burlyaev as Boriska, Yuriy Nazarov as The Grand Prince / His Brother, The Lesser Prince and Rolan Bykov as The Jester. In the leading role Solonitsyn is a good noble character with a keen eye for his works, being set in a medieval period the most memorable scenes for me were the battle sequences, a crucifixion, the unearthing, raising and ringing of a large bell, and a short breakaway from black and white to colour to see the real works of Rublev, I will confess I found it hard to understand what was going on, but for the imagery, such as costume and sets, this is a worthwhile biographical drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To review Tarkovsky's crowning achievement one must realize that this is a film that goes above and beyond what anything from any other filmmaker is capable of. Andrei Rublev is a film that goes beyond the capacity of conventional cinema (art film or otherwise)and becomes the essence of film as art. Andrei Rublev ceases to proclaim a message as many other films, but rather offers what every filmmaker strives for: a look at why art exists, and its role in life for all beings. Andrei Rublev is a film that won't speak to everybody, it won't even speak to all artists, but to those it speaks to will become moved in ways unimaginable. The film captures not only the essence of the artist's purpose, but also our purposes as individuals.The film begins with a short scene wherein a man tries to fly, but comes crashing down witnessed only by a horse. This short scene alone offers so much, the man representing the fall of all men or our need to become above other creatures, the horse representing life or loneliness and the barren countryside representing a world that is unfriendly to all men. This scene alone is up for multiple interpretations, many of which would be equally right. The film never tells you how to look at it, but allows you to bring your own philosophy and meaning to it. Ultimately its basic themes are vivid, but its many meanings remain as ambiguous as ever, countless viewings will bring more and more to the film, and in truth it is probably impossible to fully fathom the meaning of it. As with all great art it must be experienced and made to relate to one personally to find its meaning, it cannot just be viewed and admired.The vivid themes of the film come from the ideas of art, man's need for art and the artist's role in history. Andrei Rublev is a film that deals with both the futility of being a Christian artist in a Godless world, and with the impact art can have to bring God to a more personal level. These themes are developed in seven stages, each one differing immensely from the other, with the core ideas and the artist Rublev being shared in every one. Though these themes seem to center around and deal exclusively with art, they are very implicit to every human being's lifestyle. Art can be used as an allegory for our gifts, the idea that we should not hide what we can offer the world, just as the artist should not hide his art from the world. Our gifts and talents can be used to glorify God and bring hope, even if the world does not have a lot of hope, despite the often felt futility of doing what we are gifted in, we bring goodness into the world through them.Ultimately the film offers this at its core, however there are many more ideas and meanings the individual must bring out of the film to impart its full impact. Through patience and connections the viewer can make the film into a personal experience and in doing this may become moved deeper than ever before. After all isn't this every artists wish?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most profoundly affecting film of my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having had the privilege of visiting Russia and anticipating a return next month, I admit to being a complete Russophile. The mystery, emotion and history of this remarkable country have found places in my soul I was scarcely aware of. This masterful film manages to evoke the sensations I felt during my month's long visit. The Russian people, among the dearest I have known, have suffered as have few others in all of history. The art of this magnificent country is always tinged in dark tones. The music, if not in a minor key, evokes minor key emotions. The literature, even with Gogol, clearly delineates the suffering and hardships with which all Russians are familiar. Therefore, it was not surprising to find all of this so strongly depicted in Andrei Rublyov. However, the beauty that somehow transcended the misery and bleakness constantly before the viewer was redemptive. The scene in which the iconographer holds the sobbing boy is one of the most touching and devastating on film. I sat before the screen with tears streaming down my cheeks. It may sound hyperbolic, but I found this film absolutely life-changing. I am returning to Russia to volunteer in an orphanage. Moreover, I am fully prepared to end my life in that great enigmatic country. Indeed, this film has changed my life. I cannot recommend it too highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You cannot see this movie without being prepared. You want to see it preferably alone with no disturbances. And you need patience and the right mood - contemplative, philosophical.This movie is an experience. I have seen nothing like it and doubt I ever will. I am a cynic by nature yet this movie completely affected me, even though I cannot put a finger on why. I broke down and wept at the end of the bell making scene. It was a spiritual experience.Andrei Rublev was my first Tarkovsky which helped (he does get repetitive across movies), but it's still easily his best work. In my opinion, that's because this movie proves that art and hard work are not mutually exclusive, but in fact good art *requires* hard work. Just notice how much vision and effort has gone into the last bell making scene. Also the raid scene, the orgy scene, the violence, all these are impossible to be art without the effort.I feel like I'm overselling but this movie is a masterpiece. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Soviet-Russian screenwriter, film editor, poet, film theorist and director Andrei Tarkovsky's second feature film which he co-wrote with Soviet-American screenwriter, producer and director Andrei Konchalovsky, is somewhat based on the life of 15th century Russian painter Andrei Rublev and is a Russian production which was shot on locations at the Nearl River, in the city of Pskov and Vladimir, the rural village Lzborsk and the town Pechory and Suzdal in Russia. It was screened Out of competition at the 22nd Cannes International Film Festival in 1969, was released in the Soviet Union in 1971, five years after Andrei Tarkovsky had completed it, and was produced by actress and producer Tamara Ogorodnikova. It tells the story about icon painter and monk Andrei Rublev who once upon a time in the 15th century leaves his peaceful and secluded life in the Andronikov monastery and embarks on a personal journey towards medieval Moscow with fellow monks Danil and Kirill in search for work, inspiration and wisdom. The moralistic, innocent and idealistic painter has been protected from the darkest sides of humanity for a long time, but on his way he is faced with real evil for the first time in his life and this encounter challenges his ideals, his view on mankind and his faith in his religion and art.Distinctly and engagingly directed by Soviet-Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky (1932-1986), this quietly paced, historic and epic story which spans over two decades and is mostly narrated from the protagonist's point of view, draws a pervasive and incisive portrayal of a man's metamorphic voyage through medieval Russia in the early 15th century. While notable for it's versatile and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designers Sergei Voronkov, Ippolit Novoderyozhkin and Yevgeni Chernyayev, black-and-white cinematography by Soviet-Russian cinematographer and professor Vadim Yusov, costume design by costume designers Lidiya Novi and Maya Abar-Baranovskaya and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven, narrative-driven, mysterious and biographical period drama depicts an empathic and internal study of character and contains a prominent score by Soviet-Russian composer Vyacheslav Ovchinnicov.This contemplative and psychological examination of an artist's conflicts with his faith in life, art and religion, his relation to the world and the consequences of his confrontation with the world, is impelled and reinforced by it's fragmented narrative structure, philosophical and mindful dialog, multiple viewpoints, voice-over narration, colorful characters, substantial character development and the fine acting performances by Soviet actor Anatoly Solonitsyn (1934-1982), Soviet-Ukrainian actor Nikolai Grinko and Soviet actor Nikolai Sergeyev (1894-1988). A poetic, spiritual, existentialistic and masterful piece of art cinema that leaves an unforgettable impression and which gained, among other awards, the International Federation of Film Critics Award at the 22nd Cannes International Film Festival in 1969.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Two Andreis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Tarkovsky has created here is nothing short of a masterpiece. I consider this to be a truly landmark film. How, exactly, is it landmark? This is the first film that established cinema as an art form. Sure, there were plenty of great films before. However, they were just that: great films. There were great paintings before painting became a pure art, just as there were great songs before music became an art.What is art? Was there ever a more passionately debated question that the meaning of art? Art is nothing that can be defined by words; words are merely symbols, and symbols each represent an individual concrete idea, which make up sentences that best attempt to explain a concrete idea. Anyone who has read George Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR is familiar with this concept. In it, the totalitarian government tries to be, well, a completely totalitarian government. It is so extreme that it even attempts to control the thoughts of humankind by changing the language they speak. This is precisely what language does - it limits ideas. How is this barrier surpassed? Though art, by Jove! Tarkovsky's only major film before this was IVAN'S CHILDHOOD. While an excellent film itself, it was only the precursor to a great filmmaker's oeuvre. The only other Tarkovsky films I've seen are STALKER and THE MIRROR. He has a very distinct, personal style. His films are the closest anybody has gotten to a creating a memory. They are not traditional story lines. This is where the landmark effect comes in. Before Tarkovsky, there were, as I have said, other great films. For example, there was the American CITIZEN KANE. At its time, it was a really revolutionary film, and the closest anything had gotten to being a piece of art. Many scenes from Citizen Kane were nothing short of mesmerizing. However, the film itself was still just a film, albeit excellent. Movies from that time were not yet an independent art form. They were sort of a mixture of other arts for all of the senses. For aural, there was music; painting, sculpture, and photography were feasts to the visual senses; for the mind, literature was created, taking the forms of books and plays. When movies came around, they were a combination of these older delights. Some music scores could stand alone by themselves. The stories told in movies were either adapted from an older play or book, or were written in such a way that they could easily be made into a play or book. The most beautiful films consisted of 24 potential pictures to be placed in a gallery per second. They never really fit together all too well. Sure, in the best films (again, CITIZEN KANE) they seemed at ease with each other, but they were still somewhat detached. Tarkovsky was the genius who changed this. Yes, there are those people who will claim that, "Oooh, the pretty images were my favorite part," or "I found the choral music to be absolutely delightful." That's not the point. Each of the elements of this film is like a brushstroke in a mural or a single violin in a grand orchestra. They all become one to form a new art: cinema. This new cinema can feel like many different things. Some people might get a dream or a pleasant memory from it. This is more the case with Tarkovsky's THE MIRROR. What is found most in ANDREI RUBLEV is a variety of emotions. The ultimate experience is that of finding artistic influence. Rublev, the title character, is never actually shown working on one of his paintings. The audience never even gets a good look at one until the very end. It's more about what made him into an artist. A good way of describing this is that it's a piece of art about art. Rublev's art is icon paintings. There is a young boy whose art is church bells. Tarkovsky, the good religious man, shows that God's art was his beautiful creations like the plants in nature and the animals that roam the land (namely horses). All of this is created by the struggles that every human experiences. We cannot express pain if we have never felt it. We cannot express joy if we have never experienced it. Throughout the film, the audience slowly begins to understand just how complex this idea really is. Tarkovsky has created something of an oneiric beauty himself. He does not limit himself; as he had often tried to stress, there are no symbols in a Tarkovsky film, only images. These images express what symbols cannot. This film reminded me in a way of a story told in Michelangelo Antonioni's THE PASSENGER. In it, there is a blind man who finally is cured. At first, he is in love with what he sees, but after a while, all he notices is all the ugly dirt everywhere, and so he decides to end his life. A Tarkovsky film has the opposite effect. It is so beautiful that we begin to see the whole world as it really is. It is easy to forget the grandeur of old trees or the soothing waves that a breeze of wind creates when it passes a field of grass. ANDREI RUBLEV is a refreshing reminder of these; it has one of the most satisfying conclusions in cinema history. The spiritual people have a god (or several) to thank, while everybody else can just relax and enjoy the beauty that has evolved from nature. It's not very often that a movie changes ones outlook on life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Russian film and one of the best films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably the best film in Russian cinema crafted by the one of greatest filmmakers of all time, and considered by some to one of the best films ever made.Andrei Tarkovsky had already put himself on the map as an internationally-recognized director by the time this film was made, having won the Golden Lion award in Venice for his first full-length feature film IVAN'S CHILDHOOD.ANDREI RUBLYOV was his second feature and remains his most ambitious and monumental undertaking. The script, by Tarkovsky and Andrei Konchalovsky, follows historical record scrupulously and where no record was available, makes educated speculation in its story about the title 15th-century icon painter's tribulations.The story's universal concerns of finding meaning, direction and conviction in one's life transcend the cultural and historical trappings. The film is uncompromising in its level of historical detail, entirely unsentimental and is devoid of Soviet propaganda, and so inevitably when it came out, Soviet censors suppressed it, demanding cuts. The film was not seen by the world at large until seven years after its completion, four years after winning the International Critics' Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.There are several versions of the film running up to 205 minutes. The 185-minute cut was Tarkovsky's preferred version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>art and history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We know so little about Rublyov and there are very few historical documents, all very brief. What is known is that he lived in 15th-century Russia and that he is considered to be the greatest Russian iconographer. I think I can start already from here by telling that the movie Andrey Rublyov is (among other things) the story about artist and his position in the world, pictured through the regime of the middle-age Russia in this particular case but the story has universal character.You can be very famous (Rublyov surely is!) but yet history might not know anything about you. An artist is often (so to say) a product of his/her time because no one is isolated from the historical events in one way or another. This movie (to quote Tarkovsky) will tell you of the impossibility of creating art outside of the nation's aspirations, of the artist's attempts to express its soul and character, and of the way that an artist's character depends upon his historical situation. As an artist, I was deeply moved by this movie. There is also some hardness that lasts long after the movie ended? Although the movie is named by Andrey Rublyov, he appears to be just one of the characters, often passive as he is merely observing the situation but deeply affected by the events.All main characters are different and interesting. All of them have their own tales, personal philosophy and approach to art and events. For example, Theophanes the Greek is already an established iconographer, old enough to live without illusions. For him, art is but a craft. I liked some of his lines very much, like when he said: Yes, I'm going to die. The other day, I saw an angel in my dream. "Come with me," he says. And I answer: "I'm going to die soon anyway, without your help." Or when he said (referring to people): Today they praise, tomorrow they'll abuse what they praised only yesterday, and after that they'll forget both you and me. They'll forget everything! The script is written by Andrei Konchalovsky and Tarkovsky. The particular historical background is not bright but has history ever been?! Religion and the regime are in the center of the story but there is much more than that.The entire movie is black and white except the very end, where we can see the actual Rublyov's iconography and that almost gives a sense of the miracle.The movie won three awards. Not enough I would say! Tarkovsky's cinematography is simply beautiful! I think this is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Andrei Rublev (1966)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Rublev (the film likes to call itself &#x421;&#x442;&#x440;&#x430;&#x441;&#x442;&#x438; &#x43f;&#x43e; &#x410;&#x43d;&#x434;&#x440;&#x435;&#x44e; - The Passion According to Andrei, but pretty much everyone calls it just Andrei Rublev) is a '60s biopic of the titular Medieval iconographer, directed by Andrey Tarkovsky. The movie's strong religious thematic makes it a wonder that it was even made in the Soviet Union in the first place (but it was screened only outside of Russia for quite a while and it also gained some controversy for some sexual scenes and depictions of violence, including some questionable animal treatment.The movie deals with several religious and artistic issues, a lot of which is probably lost on non-Christians such as me. From what I can gather, the film likes to focus on Rublev's creative crisis and struggles to go on with his art while living in dark, turbulent times. The entire film is shot in B&amp;W except for the final sequence, which just shows some of Andrei Rublev's most famous icons, and this scene is completely in color, therefore separating Rublev's somber life conditions with the beauty of his art (Tarkovsky doubted the use of color in film for a long time because he felt it should only be used to highlight something, as the human eye doesn't naturally focus on colors). There are also many religious symbols, and some personal (horses symbolized life to Tarkovsky).Tarkovsky has always been hit-or-miss for me, but Andrei Rublev is such a catastrophic failure of a film that I find the high praise for it absolutely flummoxing. This biography of a Medieval icon painter has some of the worst qualities a film can have; an artificially prolonged runtime filled with loads of tedious and pointless scenes, similar characters who are easy to confuse (also, I love how the camera is often positioned behind them so you have no clue who's talking), and clumsy character development. The atmosphere is nothing like in Tarkovsky's other works - here, things are happening on screen but it's impossible to care for any of it, there's just nothing to grab your interest and to top it off, the pacing is terrible. Usually, the dialogues in Tarkovsky's films never match the power of his images, but here, the dialogues are so painfully bland and disengaging that it just makes the film even more tedious to sit through. Everything this movie has to say about artistic growth and creativity is singlehandedly made irrelevant by the fact that it fails on every possible aspect, except for the impressive B&amp;W photography.First, the movie fails as a biography. Alright, so it shows different chapters from Rublev's life, and it was incredibly well researched (the script was being written for two years), I'll give it that. But all in all, Andrei Rublev isn't even the main character and sometimes gets completely lost in the sea of similar-looking characters who I often confused for each other. In the end, I learned nothing about Rublev's work or his creative crisis. The dialogues are so dull and awkwardly structured that there was never a point when I could ever sympathize or care for him, or any of the other folks even. Some artistic choices in the film also seem pointless to me, like the opening scene where a nameless guy goes on a balloon trip and crashes. If you get too close to the sky or are unprepared, the earth pulls you back down. The only problem is that the scene just feels like it doesn't belong there, as it's completely unrelated to the rest of the plot and is not that good in its own right. Putting all that aside, I still respect the historical research done for the sake of the film's accuracy.Then, the movie fails at being though-provoking. To make a viewer think, you need to make him engaged in what's going on in the film. To do that, you have to make the film interesting. From the beginning onwards, there's rarely a scene to catch your attention and the characters' introductions felt all wrong. The pacing is nothing like in Stalker or even Zerkalo. Here, almost every scene feels inconsequential and so much, so much can be cut from the film to make it better. For example, the scene where the Tatars kidnap the mute girl feels like an eternity for no good reason.Finally, the film fails at being entertaining. While chapters The Feast and The Raid do stand out in some aspects, the vast majority of the movie is just so, so ungodly boring, endless and sleep-inducing. Even the final sequence, an epic retrospective of Rublev's art, goes on for an eternity (I do, however, like the final image of the horses by the rainy pond). It's not because of the slow pace, it's about the complete lack of crap given about the viewer.</fullReview>

You just know Tarkowski put it there on purpose. Sometimes you can guess what the purpose was, and sometimes not. And it's okay, because often Tarkowski himself couldn't explain the things he did. He wanted the symbols to have different meanings to different people.His black-and-white cinematography is gorgeous. You can tell that each shot was planned like a painting.Warning: people with short attention spans and seekers of immediate gratification (in other words 99% of American public) should not watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterwork of serious art, but requires patience...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't bother with this film if you haven't got patience. Don't bother with it if you aren't interested in being challenged by a serious art film. There is nothing fast or light here. Those who are seeking out films that are spiritual, reflective and artistic, you've found one of the absolute best.One could recommend it simply as a master-class in visual composition. Tarkovsky shares some of the mature Fellini's sensibilities for many different elements of dimension and movement in a medium or long shot. There are often people in the fore, and background. He includes fog, smoke, or drifting snow to add further dimension to the shot. It is very painterly. It is an interesting approach to a biopic of a painter that barely ever shows him paint. Instead, the encounters he has, the things he sees, and his reactions to these things are what inform us. His work is showcased at the end of the narrative, as a coda to the story. How true to history Rublev's story is, in my opinion isn't important. Tarkovsky has created a protagonist, and events that not only explore the mind of the man well, but also give an overview of what Russia was going through at that time. I recently watched this film for the second time. While the first viewing left me thinking that the ending segment is the strong pay-off for the patience it takes to watch the unabridged version (the Criterion Collection DVD was my my medium of viewing this film),on second viewing, I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. I would also recommend the partial commentary on the CC DVD in helping inform the viewer about Tarkovsky's approach to making this film.

		<shortDescription>The Long Journey of an Artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Rublyov (1969) by Andrei Tarkovsky is my number 1 (shares with Tarkovsky's Zerkalo) film of all time. It is a pinnacle of film-making for me - one of few most visually beautiful films as well as one of the deepest films ever. The beauty of every frame is exquisite - I have to pause film very often just to admire it.There are only couple of more films that have touched me as profoundly as Andrei Rublyov did. I am always surprised to hear that it is very slow film - for Tarkovsky, it is very well paced, and I am never tired of its 3+ hours running time. Film based on life of the 15-th century monk and icon painter Andrei Rublyov who wanders through the country torn by barbarism, and later by Tatar invaders. Tarkovsky explores several very important topics in his film: what is talent and how an Artist is responsible for it? The Man and God, the Artist and the Power. The final 20 minutes of the film are the best and most inspiring I've seen in the cinema. For me, the last chapter of the film, "The Bell" is perhaps the greatest in its emotional impact piece of cinema ever made. I can't stay calm and collected when I see it. Boriska sobbing like a child after his Bell rings - and he is a child, a boy, lonely and lost; Andrei breaking his vows of silence, his words to Boriska of hope, of many roads they would walk together. Andrei's icons that we are finally allowed to behold and admire, their breathtaking divine beauty and serenity, their melodic lines and pure joyful colors, the faces of the saints and angels with their eternal mystery, quiet knowledge and sadness, looking inside themselves and inside our very souls; the music that literally takes you somewhere above this Earth, to the heights of such purity and beauty that you could hardly breath and where even the "swiftest birds" of pain and death can't reach you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to describe and put into words just how great something is without going overboard but this is one of those rare films that deserves all the praise in the world. Why this isn't mentioned by more critics and die-hard film buffs is a mystery because this is easily one of the greatest achievements I've ever seen and it puts to shame some of the other films that have had the monitor "Great" slapped on them. Story is about the 15th century Russian monk and painter Andrei Rublyov (Anatoli Solonitsyn) who is summoned by the Grand Prince to work with Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev) in painting the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow.*****SPOILER ALERT***** During Rublyov's journey he witnesses first hand many of the atrocities that are taking place in his country including a pagan orgy (in which he is tempted) and the Tartar raids that has Rublyov himself killing another man. All of this leads to Rublyov making a vow of silence, "I have nothing more to say to men" but over the next year he witnesses the casting and raising of a bell by a bell-maker's son (Nikolai Burlyayev) who knows that he will killed by the Grand Prince if it is not successfully completed. Rublyov is so moved by this that it restores his faith (spiritually and artistically) and tells the boy that they should go together, "You'll cast bells. I'll paint icons".With this one film director Andrei Tarkovsky has achieved something that most (if not all) other filmmakers could only dream of but he still had to deal with the Russian censors who forced Tarkovsky to edit certain scenes of brutality. The question of what is art and what inspires it has been a debate with Tarkovsky throughout his career but with Andrei Rublyov he seems to use him as a metaphor for where artistic motivation comes from. Without poverty and inhumanity would there be art? Tarkovsky asks these questions but this film is more than just thought provoking because it's also one of the most visually stunning cinematic efforts I have ever seen. Cinematographer Vadim Yusov's haunting black and white imagery makes the bleak Russian countryside look absolutely breathtaking and this is one the finest films ever shot. At 205 minutes this fragmented and episodic film covers events from 1400 to 1423 and while other films are lucky to have at least one memorable scene in it this seems to be one incredible shot after another and the casting of the bell stands as one the most indelible celluloid microcosms ever captured. From the opening scene to the end shots where the viewer can see Rublyov's actual paintings Tarkovsky's epic film is indeed a masterpiece and it's the perfect example of cinema as art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>andrei, what is art?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>is this a movie about andrei rublev, the iconographer, or about andrei tarkvosky, the filmmaker? i don't know. what i know is that tarkovsky is a master. a master of film who made seven masterpieces in his career. a man who dared to film what can't be filmed, who put his camera where no man had done before. andrei rublev is his personal testimony about art. about man and god, man and his work, about man and man. it's his depiction of a diseased world, of the search for harmony and peace, about the impossibility of the utopia of paradise. it's a film that can't be watched, but it has to be experienced. if tarkovsky found himself in the character of rublev, then this film is the comparison between the two of them. he transcended time and space using shadows, sounds and voices. his photography is like no other. texture, weather, the four elements, perspective and nature, all elements of a whole, of the unpronounceable truth that are his films. there is freedom in this movie, but there is also torment. it is a collection of pieces about life and about the earthly struggles. it's almost like we're god, watching everything, experiencing our own creation, our fortune. at the end, we see the works of the artist, the icons painted by rublev. they come at the end, like they're a consequence, an echo. because if man can't find perfection and harmony in the world he lives, he must create it somehow. he must be an artist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe we should experience this film with our Heart and Soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1966 Andrei Tarkovsky directed Andrei Rublev, also known as The Passion according to Andrei. The film loosely depicts the life of Andrei Rublev, an early 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia's greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Tarkovsky used this historical figure to anchor the film in one of Russia's most tragic period, making Andrei Rublev not only a witness of his Time but also depicting the artist's creation process, the importance of his faith, the Loss of it and more importantly how the two (Art and Faith) can help go through event you can't really grasp or even understand. The complexity of the film as well as the political implications explain why Andre? Rublev was not released in an atheist USSR until 1971 and in a censored version mind you.The film starts with a prologue where we see a man call Yefim taking off from the roof of a church in a hot air balloon and escaping a mob trying to prevent the Take-off. Yefim seems highly exited and delighted by the sight he experiences from the air; but as the air balloon crashes, we understand that elevation in this obscurantist time is not going to be easy. We fall before we reach enlightenment. This is our Human Condition, this is what Life is about and the shot of a Horse lolling in the grass by a river bank epitomizes Life, its struggle and its beauty. This prologue summarizes metaphorically the seven chapters that follow narrating the trepidations of Andrei Rublev looking for elevation and falling back into his Human condition.For Andrei Rublev, Faith and Art are intimately linked, he paints religious icons and frescoes because he believes this is his priesthood the only way he can transmit his Faith to the people. Losing his Faith in Humanity might imply losing his Faith in God and so in Art. It's only when Andrei witnesses the casting of a bell that his life turns around. He meets the character of Boriska,the bell caster, another creative character a reminiscence of young Andrei and when Andrei sees the young Boriska collapsing on the ground of fatigue and breaking into tears, he takes him in his arms to comfort him and break his vow of silence. He understands he is not alone struggling with the concept of artistic creation and Faith as both (the young Boriska and the older Andrei) brought people so much joy. An artist with a vision can create and eventually echoes god's power of creation by using his or her technical skills but more importantly his or her heart and Faith.The "tour de force" of Andrei Tarkovsky is to use the same creative process than the one of his film's protagonist. By putting his heart and soul in the core of his cinematographic technique he transcends the genre and the medium. We understand that "in cinema it is necessary not to explain, but to act upon the viewer's feelings, and the emotion which is awoken is what provokes thought". To this respect Andrei Rublev is a film to experience and I humbly suggest we experience it with our heart and soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The patient tale of an artist in an empty land.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that you must understand about the Russians in literature and similar arts is that they are patient story tellers. Apparently all Russian novels show this when compared to the quick and explicit writing in the West. If you don't take this fact to heart Ivan Rublev will just be tedious and boring.This is the story of an artist, a painter of icons, and you will see the original icons in all their glory at the end of the film in a full color coda to the story. The artist lives in Russia, which is a vast, often swampy, land with bitter weather. The people, in this film, are clustered in islands of human society where people seem to have made a stand against the land and the weather. Between these islands there is very little and you can see what I mean in the second sequence of the film in which an obviously drafty barn serves as a shelter for dozens of peasants, monks, and entertainers. Outside there is nothing much until a handful of soldiers shows up to drag away one of the entertainers for no obvious reason, disappearing again into the winter pausing only to smash the jester's psaltery.We then meet and actually start to get to know the protagonist, Rublev in the third sequence, some twenty minutes into the story. We meet him at a monastery, which is another island in the landscape. At this monastery we also meet a Greek painter of icons who is also ah historical figure who will show up with his paintings on a Google search. At this point the story settles down and begins to unfold over the next three hours.Toward the end the film becomes a project film about the casting of a great bell, not in a factory but in the open with the work taking place with make shift equipment and a terrified overseer. He is afraid because, as is made perfectly clear in the film, he really knows very little about bell making and bragged his way into the job claiming to have inherited secrets from his father. The film ends with one of those long tracking shots for which Tarkovsky is justly famous.One might mention parenthetically that it appears that Tarkovsky's reputation for tracking shots made such shots a part of Russian films and culminated in a film called The Russian Ark, which is one long uninterrupted tracking (and wandering) shot of the Hermitage museum in Saint Petersburg (Leningrad) where we have a tale woven of the palace and the residents as seen by an unidentified time traveler.At the end the screen floods with color and the icons themselves appear, not as a part of the story so much as an instructive historical footnote. The rest of the film is in black and white with, it seems to me, a sort of film noir approach to fifteenth century Russia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Russian movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is a movie about the medieval age in Russia. It's about a dark and dangerous time. I wouldn't wish to be born at that period of time even to my worst enemy. The only island of stability and culture in that ocean of darkness is a Church institution.This movie is a set of episodes from around a life of famous icon painter, a monk Andrey Rublev. Yes, it is not exactly his life stories; these stories about a life of that time, about hideosity, about severity. There is much naturalism in it; but there's no "too much" naturalism feeling which leads to a poor style. You understand it while watching: this is the way that it was then, nothing more.It is a masterpiece of photography and scenery. A visual image settles firmly into my memory. It is a genius acting; even a small role of Yuri Nikulin is a diamond between other diamonds. Crowd scenes are really massive. Altogether, there is a complete diving into the atmosphere of the movie.I don't much connected with faith nor religion internally. It's not close to my feelings. But I don't think that the movie is about religious feelings. Also I do not know much about details of that period of time in Russia; but it's not really matters too, methinks. But I consider this movie as a genuine art, and I'm very proud that my homeland is a homeland for a such genius person as film director Andrey Tarkovsky.I heard that Tarkovsky was a kind of fanatic. I heard that for achieving maximum realism he allowed horses to break their legs due a filming process; or even some people accuse him in burning a cow alive during the battle scene of Golden Horde's warriors raid. I do not know how much truth are in that statements, and I wouldn't comment these no more. All I know that his fanaticism was well transformed into a great result which couldn't be achieved by anyone but him.My rate: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema as a language to tap into dreams. Tarkovsky had a gift for finding universes of mystery in the most mundane sounds, gestures and spatial relations. This isn't a grim, dry account of medieval Russian hardship that you need a Ph.D in history to understand, but something altogether more universal and mystical, drifting along a strange harmony between pious faith and an orgiastic pagan spirit of adventure. Something unique about Tarkovsky as a director was his ability to create an inscrutably overwhelming sense of fear without any "horror" elements, even while indulging in his "stagier" whims with dueling monologues and aching long shots. But that fear is just one side of the same coin as discovery &amp; beauty. In a just world, this would easily knock The Godfather off the top of the canonized Greatest Of All Time lists, but caring about that sort of institutionalism is a waste of life.Oh, and if you take issue with the "animal cruelty" featured, feel free to leave your country for once and expose yourself to some non-Western cultural attitudes toward animal life. Not everyone has the emotional maturity of a child and values horses over humans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to describe in words all there is in this? I'm not sure, but I will give it a shot. This is the first piece by the director that I've seen. I don't know much about Russia, their history or the culture(which, I've come to realize, may be a prerequisite to follow it, at least being informed about the time and the place), and I haven't learned the language, but the subtitles(though I understand that apparently not everything is translated) certainly help. The plot is well-told. There is impressive imagery in this, both in the visuals and in the dialog. The latter holds truth and is well-written. Deep, poetic, haunting. The acting is magnificent. There are universal themes herein. The editing and cinematography are excellent. Neither leave much of anything to be desired. The war-scenes are an achievement... so much chaos on the screen, yet when we're meant to focus on something, we do, and anything that's supposed to be noticed, is. There is violent and/or disturbing, but none that felt gratuitous, material in this. There is some nudity in this, and it is not captured in a way as to conceal it. The Andrei Tarkovsky Collection DVD has several features, including interviews, and they are worth watching. I recommend this to anyone interested in the medium of film as an art form. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect film, both emotionally powerful and intellectually stimulating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No other film can impose a specific atmosphere more than "Andrei Rublev". A few have matched it, but probably none will surpass this. More so than any other film I've seen, "Andrei Rublev" shows why this period in European history was referred to as the dark ages. It was an age when superstition ruled over actual science and thought, when violence was commonplace, and daily life was plagued with a sense of boredom and pointlessness. The film is bleak, depressing, and slowly-paced, but also extremely enlightening. The film imposes questions about what is the responsibility of the artist (if they have any at all).The film is perfectly composed, and manages to be both an incredibly emotionally and intellectually stimulating experience. Few films have managed to combine both. Andrei Tarkovsky's direction is among the most technically accomplished in history. As I said above, the film has a consistent aura, which should be credited to Tarkovsky. By the end of the lengthy running time, you'll be exhausted by just how monumental the film is. Don't watch this expecting entertainment, but as far as pure film "experiances" go, this is as amazing as "2001" or "The Seventh Seal". (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great intellectual epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's great epic is about events that occurred in and around the life of the 15th century Russian icon painter Andrei Roublev. It is not about the life of Roublev himself and, unlike other films about artists, it is certainly not about Roublev in the act of creation. Tarkovsky saves his creations to the end of the film in a series of tableaux in colour, (the film is in black-and-white), of Roublev's genius. Divided into a series of chapters, it touches on those significant events to which Roublev was a witness and although the historical episodes are presented with an uncanny attention to detail, it is more with the spiritual and metaphysical elements that Tarkovsky concerns himself.Roublev's journey through life is a deeply religious one but he is continually questioning and rediscovering his faith. His own inherent goodness is tested by the evils of the world around him. Even within the enclosed order of monks there is jealousy, envy, arrogance and doubt; so rather than being an account of the life of Roublev the film can be seen as a discourse on the thoughts and beliefs of it's creator.In cinematic terms it is an extraordinary amalgam of form and ideas. Tarkovsky composes the film with the bravura of an old master, (you can see the influence of Ford as well as Eisenstien in the compositions). Films made today just don't measure up. Made in 1966, Tarkovsky made no concessions to either popular taste or to the direction which international cinema was going. It is, on the one level, art-house cinema of a deeply reflective kind while on another level it is an accessible historical epic that works on a visual, as well as a visceral, level. Mind-blowing in the very best sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate dream-film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers.The first time I saw this film I fell asleep after the first fifteen minutes. I decided to give this film another chance and I am very thankful that I did for it remains one of the five best films I have ever seen. It is hard to define this film. It is frightening, spooky, awe-inspiring, horrifying and incredibly dream-like. Ultimately, ANDREI RUBLEV is not necessarily about the title artist. For many, Andrei Rublev is about the artistic spirit of the 15th century painter. This spirit is manifest in various fictional and non-fictional figures placed within Rublev's time period. Several of these individuals include a bell-maker, a jester, a group of pagans, and Rublev himself. The movie highlights the fact that the path of the artist is not always an easy one. Even thought the artist may experience various tribulations and successes, he or she must try not to disregard the talent possessed. Rather, the artist must continue to create beauty within a world that is characterized by hatred, killings, and religious intolerance. The nature of the artist and his responsibility toward the community is perhaps the theme that most pervades and unites the film, and almost every episode presents at least some variant of it. The balloonist in the prologue takes the risks every true artist must take in stepping beyond the boundaries of the known, and challenging the fear and conformism of the people he wishes to benefit. The jester embodies the creative spirit of the people and their resistance to authority (religious and secular). Kirill represents the untalented artist and although he is untalented and jealous, he is aware of how the artist should endure and pleas with Rublev to resume his vocation. Rublev, in contrast to his three partners (Daniil, Kirill, and Theophenes the Greek), has genuine love, humility, and self-effacement, putting himself at the service of God and man. During the film Rubilev tries to forge a style that allows him to express his love for humanity. In essence, Tarkovsky wants the viewer to realize what the true artist represents and (from Tarkovsky's point of view) Andrei Rubilev represents the true Russian artist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Journey of Faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that will stick with you long after the screen goes black. It's the kind of movie that will burst into your thoughts at various moments and attach itself to all other aspects of your life. It's the kind of movie that you will come back to again and again.You can describe "Andrei Rublev" in a variety of ways: a historical epic, an examination of the role of the artist in society, a scathing portrayal of communist authority, or my personal favorite - a journey of faith. "AR" is all these and more.Some people will complain that this film is non-linear, that there is no plot, instead you have 8 separate and, at first glance unrelated, subplots. But isn't this the story of life? When has life ever had a linear plot line? It is a series of experiences, memories, and emotions that, for the lucky ones, leads to some personal revelations.SPOILER: In this movie, that revelation comes with the casting of the bell. That Andrei witnessing a young boy whose "Father taught him" completing the biggest bell in all the country convinces Andrei that faith is enough and that art and the ability to create art is a gift from God.So much can be said of this movie and yet words aren't enough. So many great moments stick out to me... Andrei's face when the pagan girl swims by him in the river, the confrontation between Andrei and Kirill about Andrei wasting his gift, Andrei reading "Love is patient, love is kind...", and of course the full color epilogue, which after viewing misery and desperation for 3 hours seems something of a miracle. This scene puts the viewer in the position of the Russian peasant - living with suffering and destruction, surrounded by bleakness and desperation, black and white... and then to behold an icon - a glimpse of God's beauty and of His love... there are no words.This film is pure beauty. It is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time. It is, as with all Tarkovsky movies, a statement about the director himself - about his own doubts, angst, and guilt, and his own redemption in art and in God.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrei Rublev (1969)**** After the successful debut with Ivan's Childhood (1962) very talented Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky decided to shot a picture about the XV Century famous icon painter.This is not a typical biography film since there are little facts about Rublev. Instead, Tarkovsky used this historic figure to tell some universal truths about mankind in general and Russians in particular.However, he made a masterpiece. This is very demanding movie that requires multiple viewings to fully grasp its amazing content enriched by extraordinary shots. It's like reading a heavy Dostoyevsky novel ? sometimes you must repeat some parts. But, if you are open-minded and concentrated the whole way through you'll be richly rewarded with some brilliantly clever, revealing and meaningful content about human vanity, responsibility and spirituality. Tarkovsky's skill is tremendous, pace is deliberate (in good sense), photography and sounds are breathtaking and acting is superb. You won't find entertainment in this one unless entertainment is profound meditation on human nature. So, if your favorite movie is something like Harry Potter... don't bother with this one.</fullReview>

And each time I come full circle, it all ends here, in this film. And it all starts here anew.What is so fascinating about Tarkovsky is that he reaches so far, goes so beyond ourselves and our capacity to understand in images. His camera doesn't only move, it lingers, and it lingers all the way to our souls.And, if you are like me and enjoy instead of dread the existence of variant versions, it's very rewarding to see both versions, the so-called Scorsese cut (released by the Criterion Collection on DVD in late 1990s), and the one more readily available, the cut that Tarkovsky had to make after the authorities demanded some changes. But this doesn't mean that this shorter version should be any lesser. In fact, what has been omitted in the shorter version hardly touches the essence of the film. Plus, it has a bit more complete use of music.</fullReview>

This film is divided into several segments and while I found some more interesting than others, it is a very rewarding experience as a whole. Its story is about Andrei Rublev, a Russian icon painter in the 15th century, but the movie also thoroughly depicts this turbulent period, approaching themes like the Tatar invasions and the constant battles between rival princes. The camera work here is simply outstanding and I really liked how Tarkovsky filmed many scenes in the nature, having some beautiful landscapes in the background. This film is an impressive reflection of an artist's conflicts with his faith in art and religion and it's not to be missed.</fullReview>

I would still say it was an excellent film, but I was disappointed since I was expecting a transcendental experience by watching this thing.

Yes, it is a bit too slow, not that it made it unwatchable, but simply because very slow is not always the best way to go. Sometimes a bit faster can help it. I mean, if they had edited out a bit 15 minutes of fat from this 205 minute film it would have been more powerful. Yes, the ending is very powerful, but not as powerful as I was expecting.Overall a very good film and everybody that calls himself or herself a film buff should see it, but don't expect that it is "the greatest film ever", it is "only" a great but flawed historical film.

		<shortDescription>Less A Biopic, And More Of A Great Meditation On Medieval Russia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An epic that succeeds in all of its three hours (I say this because several versions exist), Tarkovsky's preferred vision stands as one of the greatest Russian movies ever made. Because only little is known of Andrei Rublev's life, a heavier focus is made on the hardships and violence of medieval Russia. In doing so the film can approach themes such as artistic freedom, religion and (Ironically) repressive authority (As the film was banned in the Soviet Union, until a few years later when they released a censored version).Though it strangely begins with an unexpected hot air balloon ride, surprisingly in these few short minutes the film has featured many of the themes that will be present throughout the picture, such as life and creative hopes dashed. Religious icon painter Andrei Rublev (Anatoly Solonitsyn, in the first of many Tarkovsky productions), and other wandering monks seek work as they travel across the fields and treacherous landscapes of 15th century Russia. Ever the observer, Rublev is forced to hear the arrogance and shortcomings of his companions, as well as the locals whose lifestyles can be seen as sinful to others, and will eventually fall to the wrath of Prince's and Tartars. It's a long narrative where more hopes are crushed than realised, but ultimately depicts the violence and hardships of the time effortlessly.I've come to respect that the film's focus switches from Rublev and his surroundings, as the cinematography and shots that Andrei Tarkovsky and Vadim Yusov employ just blend the multiple narratives seamlessly. As for music I can only really remember the last 6 or so minutes of the film, but the hundreds of extra's, set pieces and moments I don't want to spoil has its own kind of musical rhythm. The recurring themes are ever present, and the early moments of Tarkovsky's references to classic paintings start here (Such as "A detail of The Hunters in the Snow" (1565) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, though it features much more prominently in "Solaris", 1972). Of course there is the small amount of infamous animal abuse of a cow and a horse, but I also sternly believe that it was kept to a minimum and handled very well given that the cow was covered in asbestos, and the horse was heading to the slaughterhouse regardless (Trust me, it really isn't all that terrible considering some other movies).Final Verdict: Actions speak louder than words in "Andrei Rublev". Whilst not deeply ambiguous, it certainly fulfils an artistic purpose that never comes off as arrogant. It is as epic and grand as the paintings themselves, and whilst not my favourite of his works it could most definitely be Tarkovsky's masterpiece. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art for art's sake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second of Tarkovsky's films that I've seen, and on first viewing I can detect deep and very individual stylistic similarities with "Stalker." But "Andrey Rublev" is a still broader and deeper film, and I can also tell on first viewing that I will want to watch it again, and that the opportunity to do so will uncover worlds more. In fact, this is a difficult comment to write because it seems like any attempt to encapsulate the experience of this film in less that it's slow, still, and sometimes turbulent full length would be in vain. This is ostensibly a film about the medieval Russian painter Andrey Rublev, but Tarkovsky has taken the opportunity to make it a film that is really simultaneously a stunningly full portrait of the both loft and low Russia of his day, and a meditation on the nature of power, art, and religious faith.It moves at a deliberately very slow pace, but in every long, still shot where life is allowed to play out without the boundaries imposed by quick cuts, something subtly and revealingly fascinating goes on. We follow a half-nonsense peasant dance, for example, for longer than we would ever expect in a film, and that length is at once uncomfortable an very revealing. It's beautifully photographed, and must have had lavish resources behind its simple-looking recreation of a rural Russia of centuries ago. It's easy to see why the Soviet government was divided and eventually changed its mind on the release of such a beautiful film, honoring a national hero, but showing Christianity favorably in contrast to the invaders and questioning art's subservience to authority. I know I'll be rewarded again by letting the scope of this film wash over me, and letting the various elements making up the conversations on its thematic elements work against each other in my mind in new ways each time. In that way, it is, though much more laconic, reminiscent as some have observed of Dostoevsky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unforgettable masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's "Andrei Rublev" is a cinematic work of genius and an artistic masterpiece. It unfolds with such poetry and such intense beauty and horror that it will likely stay with you forever. There is so much about the film that one could praise or babel on about, but few words can actually describe what an experience this film is, and how deeply it reaches you, the viewer.The cinematography is amazing. Tarkovsky's use of slow motion, black and white, and long moving shots is astounding to say the least. The costumes and locations give the impression that the filmmakers went back in time to get their shots. The music is incredibly moving and haunting, adding another level of meaning and nuance to the film. Their are images and moments that are truly disturbing and others that are truly breathtaking in their beauty. This is not a "light" film; it fearlessly tackles many philosophical issues such as death and purpose of one's own life and the boundaries of faith and morality. It's an extremely complex journey that constantly provokes you to ponder your own life. The characters and their stories are very relatable, even if the film is set six hundred years ago."Andrei Rublev" is certainly a film like no other, and a challenging and powerful viewing experience. It's also a film that demands two maybe three re-watches, as I plan on doing myself. Perhaps what it does best is encapsulate the human condition; for this alone it's worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Andrei Rublev is widely regarded as a masterpiece and one of director Andrei Tarkovsky's best works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Rublev is like no other Soviet film. In my opinion it's Andrei Tarkovsky's greatest cinematic achievement. The film is loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev, the great 15th century Russian icon painter. Andrei Rublev is set against the background of 15th century Russia. Although the film is only loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev, its depiction of medieval Russia is realistic. Tarkovsky created a film that shows the artist as "a world-historic figure" and "Christianity as an axiom of Russia's historical identity" during a turbulent period of Russian history, that ultimately resulted in the Tsardom of Russia.Filmed during the golden age of Soviet cinema Andrei Rublev was not however released in the atheistic and authoritarian Soviet Union because of the films's religious themes and political ambiguity. A cut version of the film was shown at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI prize. In 1971 a censored version of the film was released in the Soviet Union. The film was further cut for commercial reasons upon release in the US in 1973. Because of this several versions of the film exist. Tarkovsky's direction is brilliant. He not only makes the film compelling but also beautiful (like a black and white painting in the style of realism). The film itself isn't really about Andrei but about Russian society during his lifetime. There was instability, suffering and mistrust. But even so there was still hope, and as Andrei later discovers, resilience and strength. There is also a good number of lessons in morality and philosophy. Even though the film is long not a single scene feels like it should have been left out. Unlike Sergei Eisenstein's historical epics Andrei Rublev doesn't have any elements of propaganda. It's an accurate look at the old Russia. I give Andrei Rublev my highest recommendation. It's unusual, powerful and significant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>foremost I should add that this is the first Tarkovsky film I have ever seen, &amp; though I do not think it would be the best introduction into his work (the version I saw clocked in at over 3 hours &amp; from what I've read that's it isn't the longest, which may seem tedious to first time viewers), I really have no right to comment, being the only movies of his I have seen are this, Stalker &amp; Solaris. Personally I am an enthusiastic lover of period pieces, particularly the ones with the best "brush strokes" as i like to call them. This film was hands down one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.Two of my most favorite filmmakers are Stanley Kubrick &amp; Akira Kurosawa. I believe Tarkovsky belongs in the top league with the latter two along with Ingmar Bergman, Orson Welles &amp; Alfred Hitchcock, amongst others. These filmmakers truly capture the artistic side of film-making while providing enough to tantalize our senses (breathtaking imagery, amazing direction, grade A acting, etc) There is too much going on this film for me to review. I will most definitely have to watch it again. Plus enough have commented enough to provide readers with enough insight IMHO.If you appreciate films from such aesthetic (non-Tarkovsky) period pieces as Kagemusha, Barry Lyndon, Chimes At Midnight, or appreciate Tarkovsky's other works, than this is most worthy of a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and Profound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis film is ostensibly about the life of the 15th Century Russian painter of religious icons, Andrei Rublyov. However, instead of doing a straight-forward account of Rublyov's life, director Andrei Tarkovsky uses scenes from Rublyov's life to weave a cinematic poem on the theme of the healing power of art and creativity in even the darkest times (in this case, the brutal world of 15th Century Russia, poverty stricken and ransacked by invading armies).The film is structured in eight "chapters", plus a prologue and epilogue, which do not necessarily focus on Rublyov. The film is made in black-and-white, with the exception of one colour sequence, and, as always with Tarkovsky, is never less than beautiful. The film is a haunting, dream-like experience, some may find it very slow-moving, but Andrei Tarkovsky was not trying to create entertainment but art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest post war Soviet films *****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***** Andrei Rublyov is a perfect synthesis of great cinematography, artistic/ philosophical theme, interesting story/ narration and firm acting. It does not yet contain the subtelty and "glowness" of tarkovsky's later films (Mirror. Nostalghia) but it contains memorable visuals, with Tarkovsky's infamous slow pace already intact.If you do not like to think while (or after) watching films, you will not like this film (or any of Tarkovsky's films for that matter). In other words it is not Hollywood, nor action, etc. though it does have violence.Plot Synopsis: An infamous Russian Icon painter (true character) is invited to paint a cathedral for one of Russia's "knyazs" (lord). As Rublyov and his companions travle through war ridden medieval Russia, his faith in God and the goodness of men deteriorates. He witmesses murder, war, rape, tortue etc. In one of the most disturbing scenes, the Lord for whom Rublyov is working has some stone cutters do a job on the same cathedral. They finish the job and decide to move to the Lord's brother, to carve the cathedral for him, remarking that the brother has even a better type of stone (cathedral walls). As the Lord overhears that he sends out his men to blind the stone carvers so that they cannot do the same service for his brother, with whom he has rivarly over control of Russia. The blinding of the carvers in the forest is one of the most horrifying film episodes I saw. The cinematogrpahy, in black and white with some colour at the end, is stunning. The acting is slightly theatrical, with some Kurosawa influence notable. Pay attention to the expressive music. Highly advisable for film lovers and thinking men. Vlad</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perfection is not the word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this sublimely poetic, gorgeous piece of epic black and white filmmaking from russian writer/director andrei tarkovsky surpasses all filmed epics to this point in film history and that includes 'gone with the wind' and 'lawrence of arabia'. it is hard to find the proper words to describe this metaphorical experience, for much of the meaning of this film is quite relevant to soviet russia circa 1966 (when the film was released). ultimately it is about artisitic freedom and the eternal quest of human kind to somehow transcend the constraints of existence. this theme is beautifully illustrated in the brilliant opening sequence of the film in which a 15th century russian country peasant attempts to escape a horde of marauders via a primitive hot air balloon. the peasant ultimately fails, but it is clear that tarkovsky is telling us that trying is all that matters; not whether you succeed or fail. the wonderful thing about this sequence is that it stands alone within the context of the film. the peasant who takes the hot air balloon ride is never heard from again, but a shot in the middle of the film alludes to this sequence and invites us to make a metaphorical connection between the peasant and andrei rublev's quest of artistic freedom and rublev's quest to find the meaning of life within the confines of his strict roman catholic lifestyle. the criterion collection dvd of 'andrei rublev' is a must see for any serious film enthusiast. the dvd features the 205min director's cut of the film that was never released in russia or the united states until now. the russians felt the film was too weird and violent. as a whole the hidden message in the film secretly spoke out against the suppressing nature of the communist party in the 1960s. in america where a 180min version was released by columbia in 1969, the film was considered too artsy even for the art house crowd. tarkovsky's cinematic technique is a sight to behold. there are bravura shots throughout the story that make brian depalma's so-called 'bravura shots' look like child's play. the invasion of the cathedral by the tartars is one of the most horrifying war scenes ever put on film. nevertheless, despite the brutal imagery of the middle part of 'andrei rublev', tarkovsky somehow achieves pure cinematic beauty as he ends the film with a section which features the son of a bell maker heading the construction of a new bell for the recently rebuilt cathedral, which had been all but demolished by the tartars. the boy's quest is so gripping that we find ourselves immersed in a story that essentially has nothing to do with the overall plot of the film or so we are led to believe. rublev actually has an encounter with the the bell maker's son at the end of the film at which time tarkovsky's themes unify with great success. tarkovsky ends the film with stark color shots of the actual cathedral frescos of andrei rublev. somehow tarkovsky has creates a film about the process of artistic creation within the restraints of censorship from a brutal horde of invaders without showing a single brush stroke on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult but ultimately rewarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film several years ago, and found it very hard going. I definitely appreciated it more upon a second viewing. Tarkovsky's film is like a great piece of literature. This film isn't immediately accessible, like ?Ivan's Childhood', but it is full of hidden meanings which perhaps become clearer upon repeated viewings. Whatever its faults ? it is overlong and at times hard-going (perhaps Tarkovsky wanted the audience to know how it felt to be long suffering! Excuse the cheap joke), it is a film that lingers in the mind and makes you wonder both about the film-maker's objectives and about the life and work of the icon painter Rublev himself.I liked the idea of the figure of the artist attempting to transcend the human world and to find a higher meaning. As many here have already pointed out, there are parallels between Rublev and Tarkovsky. I particularly enjoyed the scene where Andrei refuses to paint the Last Judgment, a scene designed to intimidate the ignorant mass of peasants into obedience; similarly, Tarkovsky refused to make films which were nothing more than just Marxist propoganda.The film depicts a terrible period of Russian history, but against this violent backdrop, it shows how Rublev created beautiful, transcendental art. As the episode of the casting of the bell shows, great art can emerge from the most desperate of situations. The scene is almost a key to the Russian mentality; one capable of both extreme cruelty &amp; suffering, but also of great faith and compassion.Some of the episodes are oblique; I enjoyed the pagan episode and I think Tarkovsky treats it with a hint of ambiguity; when the girl kisses Rublev, he does momentarily appear tempted. He tells her that people should practice brotherly love not lust. This comment becomes grimly ironic in the following scenes as one Prince betrays his brother in a battle for power. I was enlightened by others' comments here about the contrast between Rublev and his fellow artists. Beside them, he comes across as pure, perhaps rather too much of the saint. I liked the figure of Kirill, an all too human man riven by his jealousy of Rublev and by his own inadequacy; but, he is able to transcend this ego in order to urge Rublev to paint again.</fullReview>

This film is based on historical facts and events around the period and life of Russian icon painter Andrei Rublev. Symbollically this film starts with a man accomplishing the miracle of taking flight, a very haunting scene. The struggle throughout the film is for the human spirit to take flight. What does it mean to be human? How do we differ from beast? This film is a great Religious experience. This film is a pilgrimage. Also a very convincing portrayal of medieval times.

		<shortDescription>The Soul is of significance, not life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie is named after the artist Rublyov, and the protagonist name is Andrei Rublyov, it has nothing to do with biography. It is no documentary either. This is an expression of Russian common man belief, that no matter how dull and ugly life can be the soul is what matters only. So it is wrong to consider the movie as a historic one, it is an allegory of Russian reality what it was, is and will be.I have seen most of Tarkovsky's movies and this is the easiest one to understand. It has a simple one-sentence message and it is repeated in every episode "Russian reality may be mud and misery, but greatness is to be sought in the beauty of human soul".For every one that consents with such a message, this movie is a poem.For the ones that disagree it is dull and boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hawks defined a masterpiece as a film with three great scenes and no bad ones. What would Hawks have said about Andre Rublev, a film with no bad scenes and some fifty scenes that are not just great but perfect in every aspect? This is one of the most difficult films ever made, so don't expect a cake walk going into it. Truth be told, I shut it off after the first tape of two on my first attempt. I tried it again later the same week, and found it to be one of the best film ever made, maybe even the best (although I'd have to see it once more to confirm that). When the screen went black, I was ready to pass out. It was a complete religious experience, one that can bring you closer to God than any church or even Bible ever could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The camera work in this movie is wonderful from start to end. Unfortunately, the beauty of the camera work sometimes gets in the way of the story-telling. In almost every scene, the camera lingers beautifully on scenes, so that I both appreciate the visual art and wish the movie would hurry up and tell the story. All of the acting is very good, but it's rarely demanding because the camera owns the scenes, not the actors.The story is episodic, with little connection between most of the segments except the recurrence of the title character, a 15th century icon-painter. The first episode, about people flying a hot-air balloon, seems to have no connection to the rest. In another episode, Andrei wanders into the frolicking nudity of a pagan summer festival, where his monastery robes make him obviously out of place.A few of the episodes shared another connection besides having Andrei present. The connection is a pair of twin brothers, both princes, who hate each other. In one of those, a prince guides a band of Tatar horsemen to Vladimir, a town ruled by his brother. He invites the Tatars to loot it, so that in the process they will kill or terrorize many of the other prince's subjects and ruin one of his towns.One episode can't properly be described without a spoiler warning. Skip the rest of this paragraph unless you like spoilers. It shows a band of workers who, after building a palace for one of the twin princes, set off to work on their next construction job. But their next employer is the prince's brother, who intends to employ them to build an even grander palace. The prince sends horsemen after them, where they blind the unfortunate workers. OK, no more spoilers.The best episodes are near the end. The main character in one of them is a woman Andrei had rescued during the attack on Vladimir. The woman was mute and somewhat disturbed, possibly as a result of the attack. Similarly, Andrei was deeply troubled by what he had done to rescue her. When Tatars appeared again, she ran to their leader. Andrei tried to rescue her again, but she resisted. Fortunately, she turned out not to need a rescue that time.The final episode was the best of all, and features the most challenging and impressive acting performance. The teenage son of a bell-maker leads the casting of a huge church bell, because all the other bell-makers had died of the plague, and he is the only one who can be found who knows the secret of bell-making. It's a big job, requiring construction of a casting pit, a mold, melting furnaces, and a structure to lift the finished bell from the pit. He is very nervous, because he's doing an expensive, difficult, uncertain job without his father's guidance, for an employer who might kill him if he fails.I saw the director's original 205 minute version, on the Criterion DVD. Soviet censors cut the movie, troubled by the allegorical reference to treatment of artists, including movie-makers. Later distributors cut the movie further, to make it accessible to a broader audience. While I would object to cuts for censorship, I think the movie would tell its story better if it were heavily cut for length. Any editing to improve the story-telling would unfortunately come at the cost of some wonderful cinematography, since every scene in the movie was a visual wonder. For all its beauty, I don't think there was even two hours of story-telling in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It is an awful sin to deny the divine spark"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This dark rumination on man's savagery, and artistry, is difficult to watch and follow at times, but it succeeds in creating some indelible images. In that sense, it is an epic achievement. This movie deftly captures two opposing facets of man -- the sadistic plunderer and the divinely inspired creator. We observe a being who lives in a world of mud, putrefaction, and fire -- a hostile place in which experiencing each day's dawn seems a quiet miracle. Yet we also see a being who mirrors God's creativity in awesome works of art and engineering. The plot line is difficult to follow and gets bogged down at intervals. (The summary on Wikipedia is quite useful.) We begin with an amazing depiction of medieval man in flight -- perhaps an acknowledgment of human beings' potential to soar above their base nature. Along the way, we bear witness to cruel and senseless violence -- the pummeling of a jester who gives downtrodden peasants a rare laugh; the chasing of a naked pagan woman into a lake, perhaps to her drowning; and the nauseating rape and pillaging of technologically advanced Tatar horsemen. Along the way, there is suffering and mortification for man and beast alike. Though this 3.5-hour tour-de-force is purportedly about icon painter Andrei Rublev, we see precious little of him. All too often, society's tortuous struggles eclipse the main character. Director Tarkovsky is nothing if not original. He unblinkingly confronts man's worst behavior and is leisurely in the way he does it. At times one prays, along with the characters on screen, for the torture to cease. I've been curious about Tarkovsky since viewing his stellar "Solaris. I'd like to see more of his work.</fullReview>

There are also religious discussions and faith affirmations among the characters suitable to an epoch of intense spiritual religious life like it were Middle Ages. There are extraordinary sequences like for instance the sack of Vladimir and the casting of the huge bell for the prince. Andrei Rublev goes through all this somehow anguished and without feeling to decide to go painting the icons on the Trinity Monastery like he had been asked to. At last and after the bell was built and put to work he finally decides to go to the Monastery and paint those admirable icons we can see at the end of the movie.</fullReview>

From the terrors of marauding legions of Mongul hellions to celebrating pagan spring rites on a lovely riverside evening. Andrei Rubliev in his clean slate of uncluttered preconceptions walks a kaleidoscopic pallet for every being encountered, large and small, through this cinematic sojourn as a medium is redefined in the eyes of director Tarkovsky. It is a beckon of film creativity unmatched at the time of production. Suppressed for many years and shown sparingly in shortened forms in European art houses it remained largely unseen. Legend/myth/facts collide as Martin Scorsese finds the original unedited 208 minutes version under a mattress in countryside Russia in latter 1988, or so the story goes. This is a must see film for anyone who ever considered they thought themselves a critic or chronicler of cinematic poetry. The behemoth tale requires some serious attention and perhaps a token smidgen of bloodletting. After my initial viewing I wanted to toss half my DVD collection as this is what a movie should be.

		<fullReview>What certainly makes Andrei Rublev a masterpiece of a movie is its tone. THe film is filled with really crude realism, darkness, religiousity that just makes you understand the times the film is set. Note that this kind of dark medievality is similar to the one appearingin the rest of Europe, so it helps picture the 1300s.The Famous iconographer I've never heard of before watching this movie, Andrei Rublev, is a very religious person living in a really dark time. While it doesn't show as much constant brutal violence as for example Schindler's list has, the minimal violence shown is still really shocking and brutal. As I stated above I didn't know much about this iconographer, so I searched, but found really little information about the character, maybe I'll learn something when we get to that form of art in school.I wouldn't say that this movie was "Beautiful" or that it had "great visuals". It wasn't a movie that gave you positive feelings in the end, because it wasn't meant to. It wasn't a movie with the sort of great visuals Stalker or The Mirror had. But nonetheless, Andrei Rublev is on of my favourite Tarkovskij films, together with the other two aforementioned films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly the greatest Soviet film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russia have been responsible for some truly fine films, fantasy, animated or otherwise, but Andrei Rublev is truly something special. If there is a Soviet film more visually stunning, powerful, thought-provoking or emotionally profound than Andrei Rublev I've yet to see it. Sure, it may not appeal to all, there have been complaints about the animal torture/killings, the slow pacing and being perplexed by the symbolism but neither were problems for me(but if they are for anybody else that's understandable).Andrei Rublev looks absolutely stunning for starters, not just of any Soviet film but one of the most beautiful-looking films ever, every angle and frame is perfectly composed and with a hypnotic dream-like quality. The film also contains some of the most jaw-dropping and powerful symbolism of all of film, the casting of the bell was the standout with Rublev's colour montage close behind, but the snow crucifixion, the battle and the balloon flight were also memorable images. Tarkovsky's direction is just impeccable, so much so Andrei Rublev for me has to be one of the best-directed films there is. It's very thoughtfully scripted, the hauntingly exquisite music score is not one to forget, the pacing while deliberately slow beguiles rather than bores or frustrates and the story is powerful, inspirational(in how Rublev struggled to overcome the hardships he faces) and poignant. Not only that, but Russian medieval life has never been captured more authentically on film to the extent that the viewer is drawn right into this world, nothing idealistic or overly stylised here, this is compellingly hard-hitting stuff and not in a sadistic way(to me). Anatoli Solonitsyn commands the screen in the title role with vigour and emotional intensity while Irina Tarkovskaya is like a Russian Giulietta Masina(a regular Federico Fellini leading lady if you're not sure), and that's meant in a good way.Overall, majestic cinema(a phrase I very rarely use) and a film that film buffs must see if they haven't already. A very easy 10/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's sweeping epic "Andrei Rublev" (which is really pronounced "Andrei Rublyov") is not just a look at the medieval Russian painter, but really a look at maintaining one's humanity in the face of terror from all sides. Having left his monastery, the title character (Anatoly Solonitsyn) then has to contend with the Tatar invasions. But he never abandons his strength.The movie was famously cut to hell by the USSR's censors. I guess that they didn't like the focus on religion, although the scene of the pagans probably irritated the Politburo also. Fortunately, nowadays we have the complete movie. One thing that the viewer notices is that the movie is broken up into chapters. One of Tarkovsky's beliefs provides some insight into this: he believed that life consists of different stories, and there needs to be a way to connect them (I don't know if I quoted him right, but it was something like that).Anyway, this is definitely one of the all-time greats.</fullReview>

A vision of how to see the world fully formed as its own chapter of cinematic history, where a tappestry rich in spiritual textures is entered and abandoned at will, the frame experienced then as disparate planes of existence which overlap, supersede and inform one another. His masterstroke is the removal of the cut, whereby essentially different scenes can now be read as a flow of life. And again in how reality is understood as a continuum that flows in and out of the mind, where shadows and reflections manifest where they shouldn't be.This is the first point I stand on, that Tarkovsky's world in this film cannot be fathomed outside of the mind, without the shadows it casts around us. The mind is then a fundamental tool where the formations of life begin.The existential problem posited by the film is how man, who is shown to be small and incomplete himself, can muster strengths and passions to complete a world left incomplete by creation. Having started out as mere characters in the middle point of this narrative we call life, how to become authors who can understand what has been created in order to write the chronicle of it. How to paint the face of god? And how to meditate on that struggle in film? Into this terrifying dilemma of existence, which is the quest for meaning and pattern, he places the artist with the divine spark, he who must paint the face of god. This is the starkest contrast of the film, the mechanism that drives it forward, how this humble man can accomplish this great spiritual task in a godless world where the face of god is precisely absent. It's not strange then that the icons of the Orthodox church portray Christs as lean, stoic figures. Suffering in this part of the world which now and then Attilas and Khans devastate it, is to be abided as the only mandate of god. Art then imitates life, these faces who must survive in the wastes, elevating it to a representation of the divine.We see the artist suffer a crisis of conscience at the face of this violence, a refusal to be the divine vehicle anymore. How Tarkovsky resolves this crisis is where the film falters for me.In watching a young boy cast a bell, a holy fool who succeeds against all odds, his faith is restored. Having wandered the latter part of the film a pathetic, passive figure of silence, he is made whole again by this meaningful, but chance event. The tools then by which we can understand meaning and purpose to life are not discovered inside, through a stillness of mind and right concentration (which in meditation is experienced as the appearance and disappearance of forms, leading at the ultimate stages to the disintegration of the mind and body), but rather are encountered as apparitions.Whether or not then god speaks through the ringing of that bell, the echo of it reveals the men who created it to be still small, prone to the same despairs and suffering. Essentially humans, aching for salvation in an ugly world. How to transcend then this mortality, the need for salvation which is a form of clinging that clouds the soul, this much remains outside the movie's interests. For that we'll have to go ahead to Solyaris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You must be patient to appreciate the greatness in this film. It's long, but portions of it are as majestic as any film even made, there is some astonishing camera work, and, yes, some of it is trademark Tarkovsky, ponderous and with seemingly superfluous imagery and dialogue.I like "Solaris" more (in fact is one of my favorites), if only because the bafflement of the characters in "Solaris" at the alien presence is more perfectly matched in that film to Tarkovsky's often baffling style. But if "Roublev" is your favorite movie, I'm not going to argue with you. Roublev's, his brethren filmmakers', and, occasionally our own, struggle to create great things speaks powerfully from this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense visual poetry for the soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is beautiful. This film is powerful. This film is art. It is more meant for the soul then the mind. It is simply visual poetry. Within every single frame is a unique painting by itself. The imagery is simply stunning, capturing every moment, and every emotion of Andrey Rublyov's historically medieval journey filled with existential angst, spiritual depth, pain, love, and a never ending search for the meaning in the lives we live. This film does require extreme patience though, for it is very slow, (three hours long) especially by Hollywood standards, and quite complicated, but is none the less extraordinary and is definitely worth the watch or watches. You can not judge this film by seeing it once, for their is to much depth and understanding and thinking for one individual to take in. It has to be viewed multiple times to get the complete complexity of this unique story. But is so worth the viewings, and is such a rewarding experience. I claim this film to be possibly the greatest cinematic achievement in the history of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first had the chance to see this film some years ago at one of our local art cinemas. It was the official Soviet-sanctioned cut of the film (cut from the original 205 minutes to just over 180 minutes). Despite this, I was entranced by Tarkovsky's vision of art &amp; spirituality. The film is shot in a (sort of)flat,lusterless black &amp; white, with one colour sequence (I won't say what,or where), that looks hypnotic on screen &amp; manages to capture the look of 15th century Russia. The films's pacing is slow (something that Tarkovsky was wont to do in all of the films that I have seen of his), but if you can get past that, a cinematic feast for the eyes is in store. The best news is that a brand spanking new print of the original 205 min. directors cut is now being screened in limited distribution (i.e. it won't play at most mainstream cinemas,so you'll probably have to keep your peepers open when/if it plays at your local art cinema),as it's (mostly in) black &amp; white, and in Russian with subtitles. Don't let this sway you from experiencing this astonishing piece of Russian film making from a now departed film maker. Rest in peace, Andre Tarkovsky</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping Tarkovsky, Despite Epic Length</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What intimidates on first glance: a 3-hour plus Russian movie, told in chapter form (like a proper 1200 page Russian novel), about a famous Russian painter, and realized on screen in a deeply sustained, poetic film style, is hardly the best offering to a man or a woman (or a subliterate teenage boy) expecting the latest in nutritional entertainment from t.v or the local cineplex. But no, this flick is gripping, stark, visually mesmerizing from start to finish due to director Tarkovsky's ingenious eye, and full of unsettling, intense scenes of intellectual as well as spiritual action, man. Got it! And, yes, there's plenty of atrocities, as well. You can't film over 5,000 extras and not expect some excitement, especially when the subject covered is the wasteland that was 15th century Russia. And the damn thing even has rampaging Tartars in it, with only a sadly absent soundtrack of decent metal making the experience a real head-trip. Not convinced? It was banned in Russia. Lots of powerful contemplation on hand here, as the subject is really creativity; what motivates it, what sustains it, and, most importantly, how can man justify being creative and producing art in an evil, uncomprehending world? Of course other equally light, philosophical issues are explored as well, like religion and war, etc. Film's final chapter, depicting the trial of a teenage bell-maker and his comeuppance at the hands of an evil Zsar, is by far one of the most poetic episodes I've ever seen on film. Well worth the time. Additionally, the only film I've seen to document 15th century Russia and include the popular Rudy Ray Moore epithet: "motherf---er!". Powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a genuine epic of Tarkovsky's faith for art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russians must be really proud to own one of the greatest director, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alexander Sokurov, his unique successor. Well, I'm proud for them.Knowing nothing about this film but its director, I bought this DVD and set out watching it. Its vigour and beauty really overwhelmed me to the core. Even in black and white, Tarkovsky's cinematic language is surprisingly daring and comprehensive. Getting used to the tranquility in his later works, now I'm convinced he's capable of dealing with other uproarious themes like violence and comedy.As Tarkovsky showed me this grandiose historic event, I unconsciously related it to Sokurov's "Russian Ark". I found that living in a country of great amplitude really endows people with special talents. Russia becomes a magic country since the first time the two directors captured my heart.This film contains many subtle, symbolic elements both in dialogues and camera, keeping you observing and thinking. It's a panorama of the medieval Russia in a episodic style. Each story directly or indirectly affects the life of Rublyov. With all the characters not associated in a classical way, its cinematic style is itself a memorable attempt to portray a helpless individual in a historical fate.I wonder whether it is just a coincidence that the great painter in the film and the great director out of the film share the name Andrei. Maybe like what Tarkovsky said in an interview, all the artists share the same fate to go through the unpleasant darkness of the world to create genuine artworks.He told us to learn to enjoy loneliness. I did for long. He loves horses. I'd occasionally stop my footstep, trying to hear a horse running by.I'm not superstitiously worshiping him. I'm just trying to dig some of his feelings --- the inspirations that have enlightened a great director.</fullReview>

The closest analogy I can offer is that watching the film is like viewing fine paintings in an art gallery or savoring the taste and aroma of vintage wines.(SPOILER) Visually the scenes are striking with many panoramic views. The use of black and white (until the very last few minutes of the film) creates a hypnotic, dream-like effect that heightens the mood of the scenes. Some scenes show cruel treatment of animals and barbaric treatment of human beings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films like "Andrei Rubylov" (1969) make you realise why film-making is the most vital art of the 20th. century. A highly demanding and often gruelling film, which does not flinch from the horrors or the intense beauty of Mediaeval Russia. The scenes evolve slowly, in real time, each building on the other to reveal an almost alien world - as strange as the worlds of "Solaris" or "Stalker". Like the great Russian writers such as Gogol, Tolstoy or Dostoievsky; Tarkovsky examines the role of religious faith and belief in a cruel and irrational world. It must be seen (if possible), on the wide screen, in order to appreciate the brilliant black and white cinematography. "Andei Rubylov" is in my top 10 favourite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Consider Steven Speilberg a lucky man- he is one of the few "great visionary" directors who has had a large body of work to his name. Most others, such as Kubrick, only did a handful of films, although each is well remembered. Tarkovsky is one of those who was unfortunate to die early- in his late fifties, I think- and leave behind an impressive resume. This is the best of his seven (circulated) films, and has to be watched more than once to be fully appreciated. The performances, most of which are by highly talented actors who would never be seen in anything else, will be remembered as long as films are shown, and the photography is some of the best black-and-white work that has been done. This could be the best epic of the sixties. Make sure you're concentrating when you watch it- its perfect for a rainy day. Co-scripted by Andrei Konochlavsky, who would later go on to direct "Runaway Train."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Demanding but rewarding movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Rublev is a profoundly difficult but ultimately rewarding movie; good things come to those who wait. The film follows the travails of a monk by the name of Andrei Rublev in 16th century Russia. Andrei and his fellow religious practitioners face every kind of trial and tribulation known to man - sexual temptation, war, sorcery, starvation, and corruption. The film ends, after 3 hours of black and white, in an explosion of color. They are icons, pictures of saints, long outlasting the destructions of sin and despair. The film's last shots are of horses in a field, seen through rain-drenched lens. I don't know what that last shot means, but it's beautiful. The film is suffused with beautiful shot after beautiful shot. Director Tarkovsky was born to make movies (see My Name is Ivan and Stalker). The film also makes no concessions to the viewer; I found that the best way to keep track of what was going on was the follow intently the character of Andre Rublev. Ask what is he doing in that scene, and what is he going through. Overall, a moving, spiritual experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Andrei Rublev - Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the world was immeasurable, when your place was fixed, when a mile was distance, in the rain and mud and when life meant even less than it usually does. When cruelty and lack of any purpose were not just the asset of the most evil of men or, respectively, the discussion of philosophers, but the very routine of each and every day. When knowledge was not much, when there were few ways to go and there was no middle way, no finesse, no considering the options. When disaster was disaster and a calling was a calling. In this setting, also heavily impregnated with religion, art and artist struggle to come of age and fulfill themselves. This is no redefinition of a style, it is not a matter of taste, it's to be or not to be. Can art exist in such a world? Can the artist find a reason to go on and can he find the conditions in which his inner talent will spark and he'll start creating? Nobody seems to need it; nobody seems to want it, not the poor and not the rich or the powerful. Andrei Rublev first and then the young Boris struggle to find reason to all the madness. They don't find, but they create it. One single, but spectacular advantage can be attributed to art in such a context: it is essential; it is the way to set apart man from beast and that it does. Not so convincing for Andrei but very for Boris. But, of course, Andrei fails and Boris doesn't. Boris is the prototype of the artist: desperate, he will go for the prize and gamble all on it, and he will be walking in the dark making gut decision after gut decision all to way to the end. And he will get there, and of course be overwhelmed and feeling really like coming out of a trance. The moment when he cries by the pole and Andrei comes to comfort him, that moment, what he lives there is the single greatest weakness of man and the single greatest feeling on this planet, 5 minutes for which I'd give the rest of my life. But, of course, it is a weakness. This kind of art, this kind of humanization by art, this is not a real thing in the 21st century. None will buy this now. When turning from animal to man, that might have done the trick. We now know in our century that science is really the mother of them all. And art, grand as it might be, it's much more complicated. Even though, each true artist, even today, would give an arm and a leg to be in the place of Boris building his bell. It is not that Boris it's talented at something, he's just a skilled blue collar worker as far as talent is concerned. It's his beauty; his youth; how he believes and how he goes for all or nothing and how out of his vision the final, significant, triumphant, inspiring product comes. It is pure creation. It is not a coincidence that the best scene in the entire movie is him mastering and harnessing his own creational inferno, him almost delirious with concentration and emotion in the middle of the flowing rivers of melted bronze falling to fill the clay mold. The movie is well done but the first part is kind of fragmented and slow paced. Many of the supporting actors do a very poor job of their parts and though not void of merit or even majestic scenes, I'd say that the first 2 hours or so fall into the category of flawed genius. It all picks up and starts to really be spectacular with Boris's story. Of course, this part benefits greatly from the background and the mood set by the first one. More could be said about this great film. Will it convince with its message? No, our world has nothing to do with that. Will it inspire? Yeah, it will make you throw away your TV set and start writing that novel or something. It is not a perfect movie, because of the lesser first part. It is, never the less, a genuine masterpiece.</fullReview>

Imagine Kubrick's formalism harnessed to the emotional impact of Renoir, and you'll get someidea of it's power. I'm not sure that even Kubrick could have pulled off thecrucifixion scene, though - either visually or with as much power.Tarkovsky's movies almost always make me cry - they are that overwhelming.Yes, this is as slow as others have said, and as long, but it could be no different than it is. And the "pagan ritual" scenes, with its glimpses of naked villagers running through the woods carrying torches and jumping fires, may be the most spellbinding sequence ever put on film.Stay with it. Put aside several evenings, and watch it more than once. It's that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Andrei Rublyov is a meditation on the meaning and power of art in dark times. Ultimately does art have any power of it??s own? Is it only a distraction for the powerful or does it have the power to create enduring transcendence?The questions asked by the film also relate to the film??s production. Tarkovsky, the enigmatic and ambitious Russian director wanted to create a film about the spiritual dimension of the creative process. The Russian government of the time only wanted Marxist propaganda. The parallel could not be clearer Andrei a Russian Icon painter wants to create art but is prevented by the political chaos of the fifteenth century. Tarkovsky wants to create authentic cinematic art but is prevented by the communist regime in power in the twentieth century. Both men are dedicated to living in harmony with values outside or the times that they live in.The film is mostly in black and white, but switch to color at the end when we are treated to a splendid display of the paintings that Andrei went on to create despite his hardships. Up until then the film has been little more then a disconnected series of episodes, each with a precise but obscure meaning, the overall point being that Andrei cannot create in a world so full of suffering.In the films final sequence, Andrei encounters a young boy who is trying to get a group of laborers to build a church bell. In this act he is trying to follow in his father??s footsteps. After much bullying and cajoling they build the bell and it works perfectly. The boy breaks down in tears. He confesses that his father in fact did not teach him the secret of building the bell, he was merely ?winging it? out of a shear desperate desire to create.This description, however only scratches the movie??s surface. Lovingly photographed, each frame looks like it could be a painting by itself. There are cold barren Russian landscapes, ecstatic pagan orgies, and elaborate church interiors. This is a film unafraid to deal with big difficult themes. In intellectual content and shear artfulness Andrei Rublyov is unmatched. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I've had problems rating movies before, but I felt really unable to give this movie a rating because it didn't feel like a movie to me. I would say that "it's more like an experience", but that seems too trite and meaningless. It's uncanny.I went ahead and gave it a 9 because Tarkovsky did the same thing he did with Stalker with the ending, and that was give away enough information to lessen the ambiguity a bit... Somehow, I was getting hypnotized by the fact that I was watching a movie about an iconographer in which the icons weren't ever being shown... the ending ruined that a bit.But still... Whereas it's easy to say that this movie is about faith, or devotion, contemplation, or existential dread, or anything like that, it didn't even FEEL that way. When Andrei Rublev is on screen, it feels very self aware and confined. Time stretches out, everything feels over emphasized and weighted. When Rublev isn't on screen, it feels detached, dreamlike, even sometimes absurd. Movements feel light, like clouds, and even warfare and orgies (especially with the score playing) feel like you've been hit by some weird detachment from reality... and it becomes more graceful and gorgeous for it. It all culminates in a weirdly introspective experience... this may be the one film where the movie is more about what you feel while watching it than it is about the character or the director.That said, there's a lot to say about the comparisons between Andrei the director and Andrei the character. The conversations about craft, form, meaning, feeling, faith, and power all seem to apply both to director to character; a lot of the tasks met feel like parables for the film industry, like for instance the conversation about "I've washed paintbrushes for three years... I must build my way up"; even similar things happen, like the fact that both Andrei's had their work burned up a structural fire. I'm not entirely sure those comparisons are intentional (and the burned work definitely wasn't, as Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker was burned AFTER Andrei Rublev came out), but still, the original title was, "The Passion According to Andrei". Some ambiguity was intended, for sure.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview> To me, this movie wasn't really boring at all. Some scenes seemed to misguided, but overall the movie had a pretty good flow. Solaris was boring as hell, with shots that just hang there forever. Why? Rublev has some amazing camera wizardry that kept the story interesting. The disconnected structure was good to paint an overall portrait of an age. The movie brilliantly captures and creates a despairing mural of a time and place that seems to have been amazingly cruel and harsh. This is one of those movies, like the Godfather, that creates its own little universe. We rarely question the authenticity of the settings or characters because it all feels so real. The main charcter could have been explored or externalized a bit more, i thought. There are many scenes where we're not really sure what he's thinking. Not sure why he's doing what he's doing. This gives the movie a kind of floating dreamlike quality that kind of mesmerizes you.  But the film has its share of awesome violence, like during the Tartar raid. How some of these scenes where directed I don't know, but they are amazing examples of Tarkovsky's versatility in handling material. He navigates between thunderous attack and quiet reflection so smoothly the movie is rarely jarring in the usual way. A hollywood movie would be edited for maximum dramatic impact, whereas the terror in these scenes builds up gradually. For me, the singular image of the movie is the young squire being shot in the back with an arrow and slowly collapsing into the stream. That scene is one the most disturbing things i've seen in a movie. It's rendered beautifully, quiet and solemn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Andrei Rublyov" may be one of a kind: a true, no-effort-or-expense-spared epic - in rich black-and-white. But then, Tarkovsky was not inclined to make black-and-white films, or, for that matter, colour ones. He liked to mix the two. (I suspect he especially liked to mix them so much that you can't tell which is which - half of "Stalker" is a sort-of solarised tinted monochrome; one simply doesn't know what to make of it.) So this gorgeous film, as true to the black-and-white ethos as they come, concludes with the glowing colours of its subject's icons. And surprisingly this works. The film, after all, tells of a brutal age, steeped in poverty and starvation, governed by stupidity and violence. Rublyov's icons no more belong to that age no more than they do to our own. The way Tarkovsky visually separates the artworks from the age that produced them, while leaving us in no doubt that no other age could have done so, is breathtaking. Moreover - this is the true miracle - both the colours and the black-and-white shades reinforce each other, each making the other look lovelier.Even at the successful conclusion, though, I found it hard not to think that Tarkovsky was being obscure for the sake of being obscure. What on EARTH was that final colour shot of the horses meant to mean? Surely it was a mistake, whatever it meant - although not a mistake that matters very much, seeing as it follows such an amazing visual crescendo. The story of the casting of the bell (which feels as though it's the bulk of the film, and leads us into the colour images) is fascinating. We watch another artwork arise out of the dirt, this time literally so - even as we think, "All that, for a bell?", we're impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrej Roublev is a compelling masterpiece of Soviet cinema.The filming technique is outstanding and puts Tarkovski on a par with the best directors, the Orson wells, Visconti, Renoir, Kazan, Ozu... Andrei Rublev's symbolic scenes are less abstruse than most of Tarkovski's other movies which certainly contributes to making this wet film the best of his author. Both Andreis have crossed their times as witnesses of a country wracked by pain and misery. The uncertain and tyrannical Middle Ages gave Russia its best iconist and Stalinist CCCP gave the world Tarkovski. the parallel between the two epochs is to evident not to be mentioned. It cost Tarkovski his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent film-making with instances of some of the purest Russian cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's such a bold stroke of cinematic prowess to make a film like Andrei Rublev, let alone at the age of 32, 33 that Andrei Tarkovsky was. This is a film that, while (from my perspective) imperfect, breathes with the freedom and abandon of a cinematic artist paying tribute to art itself. In this case, Andrei Rublev was a real icon painter from 15th century Russia, who witnessed many a strange, amazing scene in his time, and all of which helped make him a better, more confident artist attached to his faith. I saw mostly the end section of the film a year ago, the part titled 'The Bell', as well as the end sequence in color, and was really drawn into the story of a young man obsessed with building an object that might help him in some way, but in the end reveals something rather astonishing. The end sequence itself, too, I might mark as one of the most beautiful, deliberate, and successfully astute scenes of capturing art ever put to film. It's all images of the real iconic paintings, all still around after centuries, put to music that adds such a religious height that even for a non-believer such as myself it was quite moving.This being said, as a non-believer, here and there in part 1 of Andrei Rublev, aka the Passion According to Andrei, a little much religious talk ensues and almost threatens to dull some of the effect of the film. Not without interest, of course, but scenes where characters or Rublev himself start reciting passages from the bible (with one insert even of a simulated quasi-Crucifixion) drag the film's pacing a little bit, which is important in its three hour+ running time. Simply put, it's really, really worth a viewing of the film if you're at all interested in the "art films" of the European 1960s, as it represents a filmmaker's freedom in expressing the subject matter, while still having a deep personal connection with the material. And amid a scene or two that doesn't quite work, there are at least three or four that do fantastically. The sequences of the tragic-comic Jester, the bizarre 'witchcraft' portion with the pagans (quite amazing considering the time it was filmed, very entertaining), the violent, engagingly horrific raid, and the other sequences mentioned earlier, all make up the best scenes in the film. Amid the artistic dilemma that poses for Rublev, he is surrounded by the will, the damnation, the violence, the strength, the equal measures of ignorance and intelligence, and cinematically it all does come together quite well.With cinematography that's top notch (with OK editing), a good, if very large, cast, and a real vision put to the test, this is a thoughtful, faithful kind of epic that is rather daunting to finally see in one sitting. But it goes without saying that there are scenes which could possibly stand alongside those of Eisenstein as the most powerful, emotional, and challenging-to-conventions-of-cinema type moments from Russia, or even Europe for that matter. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedius, Fulfilling- A standard Tarkovski Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most viewers should think twice before trying to watch this film. It is not a story so much as a series of scenes recalled by memory- i.e. fuzzy, disjointed, and sentimentalised while still being personal. To say the film has a plot or story- per se- would be misguiding. Asking what purpose it does have is probably fairly misguided, as well. Like scenes from our own life, the scenes in this film just happen to us and we are the higher intelligence responsible for imposing order and specifying why they have happened or what they signify.Like impressionism in painting, Tarkovski's objective is to create works that directly interact with the human mind's tendency to convert symbols into emotion. The experiences and environment of Andrei Rublev's life is crafted for us by Tarkovski. The cruelty, hardship, and frank confusion of his life is patiently rendered by Tarkovski in his impressionistic style that seems oblique to "conventional" cinematic sensibilities but which is remarkably direct about evoking the desired emotional response. The film is replete with remarkable scenes- the balloon flight that opens the movie and the casting of the great church bell being two of the most memorable. The latter could be construed as either the power of an individual's vision or as what anyone can do when God wills it. Either interpretation would have inspired the creative efforts of any artist.Obviously, some cross-comparison with his other films should be in order. Solyaris (1972), his cult Science Fiction masterpiece is a marginally inferior film that still manages to be, for me, more satisfying because of my sentimental romantic tendencies that allow me to overlook the disjointed plot, poor editing in a few scenes, and the occasionally wooden or otherwise unconvincing dialogue. Andrei Rublev is better in most of these respects and is well photographed on a fairly consistent stock of Black-and-White film. Black and white definitely suit the movie, too- colour would have given the scenes too much "presence" and made them seem more mundane- black and white help preserve a sense of reverie. In both films, there is not great sense of urgency and scenes play out in their own (occasionally tedious) pace. Both films feel much more spontaneous to me than Tarkovski's last work- "Sacrifice" starring the great Erland Josephson and this seeming artlessness gives them a vitality that this last film lacks.In conclusion- this is a fine Tarkovski film. It is as good a film as any of his for introducing new viewers. Viewers should approach it with the proper mindset, however. Their objective should be to experience the film and their reaction to it. Obviously, interest in Russia around the 13th century will probably not hurt appreciation. While the film is, in its totality, different from most films, the individual scenes are not weird- no strange camera work, no sudden introduction of esoteric symbols, just fairly honest attempts to record an individual person's impression of what viewers today might find to be unusual experiences.</fullReview>

This has value for its antiquity, its influence on other film makers, and as a landmark of films. However I do think that this film is tedious, and somewhat outdated, and the cinematography is definitely is not great by the standards today. I mean mere balancing technology, sound design, etc. are just on a completely different level. As what comes to cruelty... I don't know (I'm a vegan for 12 years), people eat meat everyday, and animals do get tested with chemicals, I don't see why would this killing of animals for film be any different? Morality is only for human kind... and it is our debate, and no absolute conclusion will ever be reached.

		<fullReview>A cheap historical reconstruction, trying to fill-up with insignificant details the serious flaws, and vulgarizing an important plot of the 15th century. Commercial, shallow and spectacular. One of the biggest failures is the over-blowing of Andrey Rublyov, a mediocre officer with authority problems who, by a hazard game, came into the limelight for his moment of bungled glory. Here, we see him monstrously bigger than life, in the superficial performance of Solonitsyn - otherwise, a very good actor, when he's used by a director capable to skillfully speculate his humor.Still, the movie is interesting enough - mainly regarding the way it depicts the gregarious mass-psychology of the rats when the ship is sinking. The most important scenes are those regarding the labyrinthine interstices of the multiple conspiracies starting to overlap and collide, around the hypothesis of Vladimir Cathedral's interior murals. Extremely revealing for anyone concerned with the history's backstage. As a Romanian, I forcefully remembered the similar case of December 22, 1989, when many wings of the Securitate, K.G.B., C.I.A. and Free-Masonry were competing to take over the power, after Ceausescu had fled - everything leading to the "terrorist setup" staged by the Iliescu clique. History repeats itself - indeed it does!</fullReview>

(Insert whatever adverb you like here) enough, these are the first and last scenes. I suppose by "scene" I really mean the whole situation or...that's why i called it a scene. I imagine the scene at the monastery comes close as well. it's a brilliant film, really, for the same reason gary mentioned, it can be frustrating. it is very typically "the greatest film of all time". I am wont to say "in a Schindler's List sort of way" but don't hate me, i mean this is an extremely vague sense, and i would never actually say this since it would take away so much of the film's philosophical wonder, something i can't imagine seeing in the other film. so i would have meant it in a merely "greatest film" fashion though perhaps a stipulation would be that i don't think one who thought that of one or the other would think it of both. the icons are amazing. the wonderful comic peasant certainly made it all worth it. there are no other acceptable andrei tarkovsky films. don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Byzantine Delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About the only thing I found interesting in this film was some of the background music, which was beautifully ethereal. Otherwise, "Andrey Rublyov" was quite a chore to sit through. The viewer really needs to have some interest in the Byzantine to appreciate it. And that part of human history prior to about the sixteenth century has never appealed to me.I found it impossible to get interested in any of the characters or their dramas, so remote from us in time. Characters mouth little pearls of wisdom, like: "It's never too late to repent", and "Learn to do good, seek justice, rebuke the oppressor, defend the fatherless, plead for the widow", and "Humanity has already committed every stupidity and baseness, and now it only repeats them". Characters walk in heavy snow. And it rains a lot. The film's overall tone is medieval and somber.The protagonist, Rublyov, a Russian painter, is only intermittently present in the various episodes. As a result, the narrative seems disjointed and fragmented. Evidently, a major theme is that trying to pass along one's experience to others, or to learn from others, is next to impossible. I have no idea on what grounds this apparent theme is based.The B&amp;W visuals are presented in wide screen format. That, together with lots of panoramic shots of Russian landscape, suggests an epic, though the film's episodic structure belies an epic story. I suppose the film is less about Rublyov than about Russian culture prior to the sixteenth century, with its anti-intellectual and highly religious predilections.I don't wish to pass judgment on this film as a result of my lack of interest in the subject matter. My only judgment pertains to the film's run time. The version I watched exceeded three hours. No matter how profound the message, any film that goes on that long may come across to some viewers as pretentious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historic epic as an allegory for the intimidated Russian artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A belatedly feted film, Andrei Rublyov's rewards come as it settles into its narrative. The eight episodes which comprise the film serve as mythical - biblical - chapters in which the titular artist faces poverty, temptation, terrible violence and crises of confidence and faith.I wasn't overwhelmed by any acting during this film apart from the happy opportunity to see Nikolay Burlyaev again (he plays the eponymous Ivan in Tarkovsky's previous film Ivan's Childhood). This brilliant young man is a sorely needed injection of zealous youth in the final, grandiloquent episode of the film in which he blags a ride claiming to be a bell-maker only to be overcome when he discovers that his talent is for real.The real wealth of the film is the director's grip of it. Great ideas abound, consistently paced, and there are all manner of wonderful shots that constitute this inventiveness. There are vertiginous, Slavic versions of David Leanian sweep and he manages to get around the somewhat rudimentary stunts with careful cutting (and, no doubt, brave individuals!). Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov's original score is excellent.It's not quite as concise as, say, Bergman's the Seventh Seal with both it's allegorical and narrative elements in need of mutual sharpening. Yet it does look beautiful on screen and for all it's suitably monastic perambulating finally crowns itself with the denouement that it surely deserves. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excessively murky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Minor spoiler in the last paragraph, though it doesn't really matter for this film).Now, it's clear that a lot of people really love this film. If you find their reasons compelling, then nothing I say should stop you from seeing it. It's a tour de force of film-making. But I will present another viewpoint. ;-) I found both the photography and the development to be excessively murky. Grand scenery at times but you can't see much. (This is watching the DVD on a high-resolution computer monitor. I also saw it in a theater in 1984 and had the same impression.) Apparently to figure out how the parts fit together, you need to delve into Tarkovsky's philosophy of art, and pick up a lot of symbolism, and it helps to have much more than the average American's knowledge of medieval Russia.I don't mind that it's slow, or that it has no clear plot line. Slow? One of my favorite movies is Stranger Than Paradise. I just watched Once Upon A Time In The West, which is almost as long as Andrei Rublev and even slower (and made within a couple of years of AR). AR depends greatly on symbolism, which it seems to substitute for facial expression. Facial expression is almost totally lacking, especially in extended facial shots; I find extended shots of several expressionless faces to be more than a little on the pretentious side. OUATITW also uses extended shots of faces, but the faces reveal their characters through the expressions. OUATITW builds a story with facial expression; AR builds a story with symbols represented by people. The latter fits very well with icon painting and so is another symbol in itself -- a good example of how the film builds on symbolism.(********* minor spoiler follows -- description of the end of the film *********).So if a lot of symbolism appeals to you and you enjoy working out symbolism in a movie, and no realistic human characters or facial expression and a lot of medieval war violence don't bother you, then by all means see Andrei Rublev. Otherwise watch the last 15 minutes or so, the color part, which is a stupendous presentation of one of Rublev's most famous frescoes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm Apparently the Only Tarkovsky Fan with Enough Objectivity to Admit that this Film Sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being tortured with poor Russian film-making for my first three outings ? One Day In the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1970), Night Watch (2004), and Russian Ark (2002) ? I was lucky enough to experience the greatness of Andrei Tarkovsky with four consecutive quality films ? Solaris (1972), Stalker (1979), The Mirror (1975), and Ivan's Childhood (1962) ? the last of which is no less than spectacular. Riding on cloud 9, I popped Andrei Rublev into my DVD player with quiet anticipation as this film is considered by many to be Tarkovsky's greatest film (and one of the best films ever made).Sufficed to say that my excitement subsided slightly after a ridiculous opening air balloon sequence, and dissipated completely within the first hour of mind-numbing boredom. Tarkovsky's trademark atmospherics are nowhere to be found, the dialogue consists of tireless sermonizing, and the scoring is hopelessly over-dramatic. I can't believe that this film was made by the same director of the aforementioned quality films. This outing feels like one of those over-hyped Hollywood "classics" that are moreso exercises in amateurish movie-making that are lucky enough to earn recognition from nostalgic sympathy alone. Overpraised, poorly made tripe like this is why many people refuse to watch older movies.Now, I've read a boatload of positive reviews that point out the various symbols and hidden meanings within this film, so I revisited certain portions with added vigor. To my disappointment, however, the film continued to hold no more interest than an instruction manual. Give me a 150-minute Yasujiro Ozu film any day of the week and I'll eat through it in one sitting. But "Andrei Rublev" is dry, coma-inducing cinema at its worst. I'm sure film students and their kin will love dissecting the various camera angles, but the entertainment value of this film is near zilch. Unlike some of the PETA nutcases here who rate this film a 1/10 due to horse-killings, I dislike "Andrei Rublev" because it's quite simply an incredibly dull film. The running time is about an hour too long. Disregarding the fact that self-congratulatory, pretentious directors like Peter Jackson and Akira Kurosawa would find much to like in an additional 60 minutes of nothingness tacked onto an already stretched out movie, I need to apply my objectivity and point out that "Andrei Rublev" is sheer torture to sit through from beginning to end. Nostalghia (1983) is nearly as torturous, by the way.Overly long, blandly shot, frequently silly, and hopelessly dull, this exercise in over-dramatic fluff proves once and for all that most people have no taste in film whatsoever. There's no valid reason for this pile of horse manure to be considered a better film than the excellent "Ivan's Childhood." I know that fans of "art-house" movies frequently lack the inner strength to criticize a film such as this, but some objectivity would be appreciated for those of us who care more for entertaining cinema than directorial pandering. Every director has some duds in their portfolio. Live with it.One thing that surprises me is how a frankly religious film such as this is uniformly praised by IMDb users. Most of the users I know are raving liberal atheists with a giant stick up their rear-end, so it's interesting to see them pine over this movie like no-brain lemmings. I guess artsy pretentiousness automatically overrides their fanatical hatred for religion, because the superficial preachy ramblings are laid on thick and fast in "Andrei Rublev." How do all of these naturalists reconcile their subconscious thoughts ? which are probably uttering the word "bullsh*t" after every line of dialogue in this movie ? with their snobby lust for art-house trash? I would pay for the research funds if a psychologist wished to perform this study. Incredibly interesting stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its hypocrisy is its downfall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot endorse this film due to its blatant hypocrisy. Here we have director Tarkovsky, moralist extraordinaire, attempting to tell a moral tale of righteousness and spiritual depth. But fans of this movie overlook the disgusting fact that Tarkovsky committed horrible, ghastly crimes in order attain his "righteous vision".Tarkovksy lights a cow on fire. Tarkovsky throws a horse down a flight of stairs. Tarkovsky has that horse speared to death at the bottom. These are not special effects. These are genuine acts of depravity. How, then, can this film POSSIBLY be applauded for its moralism? I much prefer the gratuitous animal killings in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, because at least in that film we're under no premise that the director is sending us a lofty message of spiritual purity. Please, if you are a true art lover (meaning: one who interprets the depths of art to its very core), save yourself the horrible disappointment, and skip this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarkovsky set out to make a landmark expression of cinematic art. Instead this movie will forever be known as "that movie where the director shot a horse and lit a cow on fire".Future filmmakers of the world, let this be a lesson to you. Don't let your arrogance get the best of you to the point that you start committing crimes against life. Josef Mengele, I'm sure, was an intelligent man with a thorough knowledge of medicine. But, like Tarkovsky, he'll forever be known as an arrogant psychopath with a thirst for blood.Suffice it to say that neither I nor any of my enlightened friends enjoyed this movie in the least. If you are intelligent enough to understand the words I have written here, then I guarantee that you will be just as repulsed by this film as we were.</fullReview>
