		<shortDescription>This movie was awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Gridiron Gang at a screening. It was great! The beginning was very violent, depressing, and scary- to the point where my friend and I considered leaving. It got better, though, and the violent beginning actually did a good job of setting up the story of the rival gangs. It was very well-acted, especially by The Rock. I was surprised because this is the first movie I've seen him in that I actually enjoyed. There was a good balance between the football aspect of the movie and the story itself. It wasn't just a "football movie"- it was about how playing on the football team was able to change the kids' lives. The ending was really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good, touching movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, who would have thought that a professional wrestler would become an actor... not just a star, but a real, true to life 'ACTOR'! Dwayne Johnson has done this and he's seamless with his portrayal of Sean Porter to the letter! The end of the movie shows several scenes of a documentary where the real Sean Porter is saying the lines that Johnson was speaking in the movie. The Rock makes those lines seem like his own and I bought into every moment of it! Some characters were from actual kids that were in the L.A. juvie detention center and others were obvious blended characters. Two of the main characters were adversaries at the beginning and they become close... very close friends. This scenario probably has happened in real life, but they are fictionalized blends of probably many. The producers even made the numbers on their jerseys the same, but opposite. One was 13, the other 31... in other words, we are the same, just the sequence is different. I don't know if anyone else caught that, but I found it effective.Overall, a very good movie with solid acting and a good script with a good ending! I recommend it, but the language is rough. No sugar coating the violence either. Not for kids, not even if the parents are sitting right next to them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the cold-hearted critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prepare to hear whining and complaining from movie critics who fall outside the boundaries of this movie's target demographic by a good 15 - 20 years: "This is so predictable!" "What a bunch of clichés!" "We've seen it all before!" You know what? I'm not going to argue with those points. I don't deny that this is a by-the-numbers sports drama. "You can do it" speeches fill the air, inspirational music soars high, and anybody well-versed in this genre can easily call the shots. Come on, did you really doubt that there'd be a jerk opposing player that we'd be forced to hate? Are you naive enough to wonder if he'll get his comeuppance by the movie's end? Gridiron Gang is a movie that understands who its audience is, and it plays them like a fiddle. But you know what else? I don't care. The audience absolutely loved it. Biggest crowd reaction of any movie I've seen so far this year. They cheered when the gang got a touchdown, they grimaced at every painful tackle, and they chanted for Johnny Betts to take his shirt off. Hey, I thought it was a little out of place as well. But who am I to deny my fans? Now I'm not saying this is a movie of the year contender, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not ashamed of that, and I'm not going to apologize for it. I'll even go so far as to admit that there were a couple of scenes during which I got a little choked up - the only time it's happened this year.Yeah, I said it. You got a problem with it? My biker boots (size 11) and I would be more than happy to discuss the issue. If you can turn an indifferent eye to the scene near the end involving Rock's mother then you, my friend, are a cold, cold man. Or woman.What can I say? I'm a sucker for inspirational sports movies, especially when they star an actor I like - and I really like The Rock. His charisma and natural screen presence are undeniable, and he even displays some impressive acting chops here. The man gives us real tears - from BOTH eyes. Take that, Ashley Judd! Not every film has to be a deep, insightful masterpiece of epic proportions with layers and layers of social commentary and "vertiginous fluidity." Some movies are simply made to entertain. What's wrong with giving the audience something to cheer? You know, there are still a few moviegoers out there who want to go home happy and inspired.If you fit into that category then you won't have any problem ignoring the familiarity of Gridiron Gang. The wonderful mixture of humor and drama will suck you in and have you rooting for these kids to overcome the odds.If you've got a "Mr. Potter heart" then do us and George Bailey a favor and stay home. The theater will be more pleasant without your curmudgeonly ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic look at our juvenile justice system</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Synopsis) The movie is based on a true story of a juvenile detention camp probation officer Sean Porter (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson), who is frustrated by the 75% recidivism rate of the teenage felons that he is responsible for at Camp Kilpatrick. Sean Porter, a former college football star, comes up with an idea to form a football team. Porter believes that football will teach the teenage inmates what it takes to be responsible, teammates, and be winners for the first time, not losers. Porter and probation officer, Malcolm Moore (Xzibit) become the coaches, and they only have 4 weeks to get a team together before their first game. The juveniles must give up their gang rivalries on the gridiron to unite as a team.(My Comment) You may think that this is just another football movie, but you would be wrong. This is one intense movie that gives you a realistic look into the lives and attitudes of teenage gang members, and their mindset that life means nothing to them when it comes to being disrespected by other gang members. Coach Porter was able to change their ways and give the young men a second chance, and they were better for it. You may be surprised that the Rock actually did a fine job of acting as Coach Porter. You must stay to the very end during the credits, because they show scenes from the documentary of the actual people. (Columbia Pictures, Run time 2:00, Rated PG-13)(8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give this film a chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of people rag on this film because it has a wrestler in it. First of all lemme say something. This isn't the football movie to end football movies. The Rock actually plays his part really well as well as the other members of the cast. To totally brush this off would be an injustice. I had my doubts as well, not because of The Rock but because there are so many football movies that come out and a lot fail to keep my attention. I loved Varsity Blues and The Program. The Replacements failed to meet expectations and Remember the Titans was just OK. and don't even mention The Longest Yard remake.... This film is definitely above average. The presentation is handled well and The Rock proves he belongs there. He also proves that he excels in drama rather than being the action hero or the comedic role (although i did enjoy The Rundown). So take a chance on the movie and chances are you will enjoy the whole 2 hrs and some change that this movie is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of those, cry at times because you feel the pain, laugh at times and cheer the underdogs. It is very true that people need to adjust their thinking on juvies who make a mistake. After the do the time the crime is paid for and they, as well as adult offenders, deserve a second chance. I am a mother of two good boys who made a bad choice. I hope the movie showed them that the choices made will hinder you. I think the Rock and Exhibit were very good. I am glad my boys wanted to watch this film. There was an excellent message. I would recommend this film to everyone. You really get a chance to see the inner workings of gangs and what they are really like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When A Strong Man Shows Them The Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other than some bad language, I can't see why The Gridiron Gang rated a PG. It's a really nice inspirational story about a man with idea to slow down the rate of recidivism among juvenile offenders.Based on the true story of Sean Porter, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson plays Porter a former college football star who thinks that if he can get some of the kids to organize as a football team in his ward of the Los Angeles Juvenile Detention Center it might keep them from going back to the gangs and returning to jail or winding up dead.The Rock, trading in on the name and image that professional wrestling gave him, maybe for the first time is playing a normal human being albeit a former sports star. No superhero heroics for once in this film, just a man with an idea who inspires a bunch of kids to not think of themselves as losers.Dwayne Johnson dominates the film just as he dominated the ring in his wrestling matches. He's got his own troubles as well, a mother who is dying well he's dealing with the problems of his juvenile charges. But he does persevere and he turns losers to winners.It's a nice film about what can be accomplished when you believe in yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable for hope inspired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For an L.A. native, disgusted with what has happened to a very influential and potentially great city, knowing that there are attempts to show alternate ways of life to the gang-riddled youth is in itself hopeful. The film may seem formula-like, however it presents a true story in the trappings of such formula without the often seriously candy-coated drippings of maudlin ways. There are good performances here, and including but not limited to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who comes close to but never totally dominates what is an ensemble of future stars. This is not only a youths-gone-bad movie and sports as panacea film but a look at how, on occasion, the right intentions can override the wrong pursuits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie with inspiring actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good movie. It is based on a true story about a man named Sean Porter a real live coach for juveniles played by the "THE ROCK." He wants to coach some 16 and 17 year old juvenile delinquents in a detention facility in hopes of making them change their violent and criminal ways. He wants to teach them team work and to take their minds off gangs and to also learn respect. Since a lot of juveniles return back to their gangs or prison again or end up dead. This movie does send a good message to the youth who are incarcerated. That they can become better people if they are given a second chance. The acting done by "THE ROCK" and "XZBIT" were realistic and inspiring. (8/10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean this film outshines Invincible,which is of course is another true story. This film proves to be gritty and real as it gets. Dwayne(The Rock)Johnson gives a terrific performance, he proves to be an awesome actor, and not just an action film star. The film takes place at a juvenile detention center run by Sean Porter(Dwayne Johnson) who feels he is not making a difference with the young hoodlums who come in and out. In hopes to keep them in line, he makes them into a football team, so that most of these young hoodlums that hate each other, will become a team and stand together as one. At times this is not an easy movie to watch, but it is reality, you fell the frustration of these young men. The young cast do well also. I shore hope Dwayne Johnson will get nominated for an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rock does a fine performance in Gridiron Gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched the end credits and saw documentary footage of the real Coach Sean Porter and discovered he had lighter skin than The Rock, I thought, oh well, at least there was no discussion of racism in this movie. Skin color aside, The Rock did a fine performance in the role of a coach who wanted to show his juvenile delinquents what teamwork and discipline are about through football. From their first play with the Panthers to the first playoff game with the same team, this movie makes you cheer or cringe with every move that comes. There's also gritty footage of life in the streets in the beginning and the aftereffects during some games. Overall, though, it's not unlike some other inspirational sports films like the recent Invincible that shows victory in the end. So if you don't mind another feel-good football sports movie, I highly recommend Gridiron Gang!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>breaking the ties that bind you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i feel compelled to give this film a 9 and almost rated it a ten. It isn't original; it isn't award-winning craft or direction. The football scenes weren't that good. I'm not sure The Rock has improved or expanded his range as an actor or not. But this film is based on true events, and inspires a great deal of optimism for the nature of mankind. There is a sincere desire for reform and redemption as a mission here, by a penal institution no less. It is less punitive and more on the side of these kids who end up in the court system. Many of us don't consider ourselves to be "criminals", and yet, by definition, most of us have broken the law at some point in our lives. Perhaps they were for what might be considered minor infractions, such as coasting through a stop sign, or not declaring something at the airport. But they are still crimes. The big difference here, is, most of us don't get caught. And even if we do, many of us can escape a prison term. We are, after all, human. I really appreciated this film for it's compassion; it's desire to build self esteem in a person and give them a real shot at a fulfilling life; to turn their lives around. It went for a sincere attempt at eradicating recidivism and portraying "locked up" kids as complex human beings who want a better life. kudos to Grid Iron for that. Am i a bleeding heart? maybe. And if i am, so what? Better to give someone a chance for redemption than to shut them up and turn your back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So convincing, so real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a professional movie critic by any means, but a movie fanatic, I attend the movies all the time. I also make it a point to see all sports movies, because of my passion for both sports and movies. Let me just say, I have never been more convinced that a movie was true-to-life. During the end credits, they play actual documentary footage of the original Camp Kilpatrick Mustangs and without it the movie would be done an injustice. Although the movie itself was phenomenal, very good football scenes (and not a lack of them like some sports movies) and a very well-developed plot, this documentary footage makes the movie "real". We hear Coach Porter utter the actual words The Rock used in the movie, and know as we leave the theater it wasn't just drama, it was real life drama. Imagine if Remember the Titans had footage of the original team at Gettysburg, imagine if Coach Carter showed bits of a documentary including his lockout. This movie gives you that satisfaction.This movie is Friday Night Lights on the set of Prison Break, and apart from the final game, the racism is not white on black, it is black on black -- like it truly is in South Central Los Angeles. If you want a gritty look inside gang wars, blood loyalty, and the people who want to make a difference, this movie is for you. For a once aspirant football player, Dwayne Johnson, "The Rock", has certainly proved his ability to act. This movie is his coming out party, his first true acting job. Compile his work here with Be Cool and we have a star in the making, and one who could be around for years to come.This piece doesn't look in depth at the kid's acting, but let me tell you, there are some stars among them. You will walk out of the theater unable to believe they aren't gang members themselves. Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie was excellent. The "Rock" surprised me completely. I took him as a hard core/action actor, but he really made this movie his own. The boys were great actors as well. I cannot get over how some of these boys can act. Willie Weathers played the part, as well as the others. It wasn't a movie where in 10 seconds they were best friends or they won the first football game they played....the movie gave you just what it was - of course I am sure some of the real life events were a little different, but towards the end of the movie I couldn't wait until they kicked some butt, or when Willie finally knocked the "private" school brats down on their behinds!!!! That was so exciting! I laughed, cried and my heart was touched. I think this movie will make people see that kids sometimes make the wrong choices, a lot of which is upbringing and some not, but have so much more inside, they are children. This Coach Porter changed a lot of lives!! God Bless Him!</fullReview>

But he showed that he can act with the best of themI had no idea what to expect, now you all understand that it is a football film, being Scottish my knowledge of football is limited to say the least. But this is a film based more on football, it is about the hard life that kids have on the street, and also the struggle that youth workers have to try and keep kids off the streets.What makes it more intense is that it is real, anyone would like this film, just because The Rock is in it doesn't mean anything so guys, believe me when I say, even your girlfriends will enjoy it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gridiron Gang is based on a true story about a juvi detention center that starts a football program to help troubled kids. There's really nothing new here, idle hands are the devil's work. Kids in trouble simply don't have anything to focus on. The story is about an administrator that takes a chance on a coach who almost wrecks the program, but pulls it out with the help of the kids. This is one of those quintessential feel good films about overcoming the odds and succeeding. Some good acting and good directing with the help if some way too tight camera shots help make the film look more realistic. A class A film to make you fell good about the system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just Another 'Team Sports Cure Every Evil' Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like the past few years have seen a run on sports films that demonstrate the power of learning sportsmanship on a team level can alter the lives of the misbegotten youths suffering from the angst of society's perceptions. We've been through soccer, baseball, tennis, dance, track and football: GRIDIRON GANG uses football as the pivotal point, but due to the presence of a fine script by Jeff Maguire who adapted Jac Flanders documentary film, and cohesive poignant direction by Phil Joanou who knows how to move a large cast around and keep it personal, and most of all due to the overpoweringly fine performance by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson this film is so honest and uplifting that it doesn't leave a dry eye in the audience.The story is well known: Probation Officer Sean Porter (Johnson) is frustrated that the boys in his camp for young criminals when released to the streets show 75% returning and a large number dying in gang related violence. He sees this trend as being due to the lack of self-esteem in kids whose lives outside are demeaning and encourage failure. He gathers support from his fellow workers Malcolm Moore (Xzibit), Paul Higa (Leon Rippy) and Ted Dexter (Kevin Dunn) and gradually builds confidence in his project to organize a football team of his inmates. We wisely get to know the background of a few of the more difficult incarcerated boys, a fact that makes the project more full of tension and understanding of the problems to be resolved. Though most of the cast are unknowns, they are fine actors in this film: Jade Yorker, David V. Thomas, Setu Taase, Mo, James Earl, Trever O'Brien, Brandon Mychal Smith, Danny Martinez, Joe Seo, and Joey Lucero.Through the team's growth as a unit they confront and manage to cope with problems and grow into goal-driven, good spirited young men. The presence of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is stunningly underplayed and all the more powerful for it. This is a sensitive performance that places Johnson in an all new category of respect as an actor. The film is overly long (120 minutes) due to repeated games the team plays and for devotees of Football that will be a positive aspect. But far more important than the games is the quiet growing of trust and faith that shows in the faces of this fine cast. Recommended viewing, especially for those who think they have seen too many sports related do-good films! Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I'm a self admitted softie for Football movies. Especially ones based on true stories. I've seen Friday Night Lights and as I left the theater my reaction was "Meh, whatever." I rented Invincible and enjoyed how well the relationships were developed. But it was disappointing. I expected more for some reason.After first, when I saw the preview for Gridiron Gang...I didn't want to see it. It looked awful and corny. But my old man who is a fan of The Rock, talking me into it.Immediately you're shown the harsh life that most never have to face. This movie shows inner turmoil and brotherhood. Rival gang members becoming team members, learning to appreciate one another.The Rock gave one of his best performances, he didn't steal the show as it belonged to 'The Boys' -hands down. He could be intimidating and encouraging at the same time.What's truly sad about this movie though is that one of the original members of the Gridiron Gang was shot and killed in a drive by shooting.This is an actual "Stand up and Cheer" movie. You are disgusted with the acts the boys have committed to wind up where they are, but in the end you feel somewhat proud and amazed at their transformation.GO SEE IT!.</fullReview>

We loved the movie and I would see it again. Our ages ranged from 12 t0 52. The message is inspiring and one to be seen by all. A true home run! The Rock is great and believable as a coach and mentor. Exzibit is funny and, as my daughter said, a better actor than a rapper! The boys in the movie will have you cheering out of your seats and you will feel as if you are watching a real series of football games.

		<fullReview>This was the best movie I have seen this year. The Rock's performance was excellent along with all the cast. Cheers for the casting director. There are lessons about life to be learned from this movie and my praises go out to the people who are making a difference working with gang members in our violent world. We have to remember that gangs are a circle of violence and someone has to step into the "gridiron" and make a difference. This is a film about pain, suffering and the struggles of everyday life but it is also about faith, hope, renewal and the power of change that is in each of us. Movies like this one give me back the hope that our world can change and maybe people will wake up and realize we are all the same, we all have hopes and dreams and a little love and faith can go a long way. Special thanks to the "coach" who started all this, he is the real hero in this story. After reading a few other comments I wanted to add that I do NOT think this movie is full of cliché's, it is full of reality and the hard truth about the lives these young men had lead so far. Playing on a football team was not about playing football, it was for some young men the first time they ever really saw anyone not from their hood as a human being, not just an un-named enemy. It was realistic and touching. Again it shows us to never give up hope and that sometimes all we really need in life is for even just one person to believe in us. I may be a dreamer but I do believe that even small gestures of kindness in everyday life can make a difference in this world. I think this film should win awards, it was well acted and worthy of much praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't say too much about this movie except that it was way better than I expected. Courtney obtained free passes to this film which doesn't actually come out in theatres until September 15th. I can see why...it will be right at the start of fall and thus the start of football season, smart move! This is The Rock's best movie so far, by far. He's totally believable as a football coach, which could be because he played for the University of Miami and in the CFL for a little while before he became a professional wrestler and actor. This movie was based on a true story and I felt it was very authentic, especially when they show clips at the end from the real Gridiron Gang.I expected a PG-rated Disney-type cheesy flick, but this was anything but that. It was PG-13, contained much violence, language and difficult situations. But it also contained a lot of heart, some great acting and even a few laughs along the way.

		<fullReview>Hey! this was probably one of my favorite movies of all time now. I saw it in a screening, and fell in love with it.Not only does it really hit home with the locations and the people, the story is something we hear about, everyday; Gangs, violence, crimes...etc.It wouldn't surprise me at all to see this film nominated several times.I had the pleasure of also meeting two of the actual guys who this film was based on (from the Kilpatrick team). One of the guys was so happy and emotional that his dream about the struggle with being such a bad kid, growing up in a gang, constantly fighting, and then trying to come together to make a football team, will give other kids awareness of the gang situation made him so happy. He cried most of the time. It really touches me to see someone cry from such hard work that paid off. What a wonderful feeling that is.But besides that- The rock was very good, good comic relief. Xzibit didn't say much or do much, but he's awesome no matter what. Lots of comic relief in this film, but not so much where its even close to corny. The cinematography was FANTASTIC, i would be thrilled to see them get an award for breath taking cinematography.Everything just worked very well/ very smooth, in conjunction to the story, and how strongly they stuck to the original documentary. The acting was also extremely amazing. Each character, was fantastic and connected well with the actual people they were portraying.This is definitely not like any football movie you will ever see. Because the violence is probably the closest you will get to seeing the real deal. And the emotions you will feel, is REAL. You will definitely, Laugh, cry, scream with horror, get the chills, and cheer with your soul.If i had more thumbs id give this a definite 10 thumbs up ;)~Brittney</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good as The Titans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gridiron Gang Dwayne "The Rock" JohnsonAs Good as The TitansA detention camp supervisor Sean Porter, (The Rock), comes up with a way to decrease the high percentage of teens returning to a life of crime after they serve their time. He plans to teach them football, and getting this idea past his boss won't be easy. I said this was as good as the Titans and in many ways, better. The action, football and non-football, comes at you at a fast pace and if I didn't know better the non-football action seemed pretty real to me. The football sequences didn't allow anyone to hold anything back. This program is real and works and we get a little taste of it here. Yes, a lot of clichés are thrown about, but they are really needed for this hardened group of criminal teens. They work. A lot of credit needs to go to the real Sean Porter and his staff by making something like this work. How far this program has extended itself outside the boundaries we see in the movie was not mentioned or if it was I missed it.The Rock continues to amaze me. He is pretty good as an actor. All the cast performed in excellent fashion. The editing for the football action sequences was outstanding. The dialogue was downright real and humorous dialogue was abundant. I remember one line that went something like this: I just love sacking quarterbacks. Hard to believe it's legal.All in all a very good movie and keep in mind it's based on a real program in California to help troubled teens. Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Importance of the movie requires viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world where the lines are crossed and the message gets somewhat blurred. This is a movie that kids watching really get engrossed in watching what's going on in the movie. Dedication and devotion to the team aspect and maintaining the story so close that actual storyline and providing the clips at the end of the movie was a nice touch. So many times we stick these kids into work camps as stated in the movie, there is really no other direction for these kids to go. It is a shame that more programs like this exists around the country with more frequency.As for the movie content was somewhat predictable but did provide enough personalized touches with story lines of real characters and actually using some of the current detainees within the camp to use within the movie itself. Additionally I was also impressed that all the football was REAL action. Go through the special features and you will get the action directors integrity to really depicting the game. Enough said the movie is outstanding provides a opportunity for kids to have hope but only when someone is there to pay a little attention to the kids.As for those of you who don't remember Dwayne Johnson the football player you don't know what you missed cause he was a monster and did in fact physically attack using his upper body strength as mentioned in the movie. The man was a human wrecking machine but talent is talent. So I am not so startled that he is bettering his skills in acting on the screen rather than on the mat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Gridiron Gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, hands up all those who think they've seen one too many sports movies, or movies with troubled teens having inspirational teachers motivate them out of their dire straits. Movies like Dangerous Minds, Coach Carter, Hard Ball, and even recent dance movies like Take the Lead, and Step Up, all seem to have come from the same mould.Based on a true story, and on the Emmy award winning documentary of the same name, Gridiron Gang follows the tried and tested formula for movies with juvenile delinquents. The misfits cannot work together, and it is through sports that they learn camaraderie, the value of friendship, and of not giving up hope. To do this, they have to first be instilled with discipline, and here's where the coach cum motivator come into play.Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson joins the list of stars with stints as cinematic teachers/ motivators, just as the likes of Antonio Banderas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Samuel L Jackson have preceded him. And for a movie like this, with attitude and a host of students with menacing street grit, he comes across as totally believable, and looked the role too as a teacher who can command and gain r-e-s-p-e-c-t from the troubled teens. Having starred in mostly action movies in his Hollywood career thus far, Gridiron Gang allowed The Rock some space in dramatic moments to prove his acting chops, so take this opportunity to see if you'll laugh and cry together with him. You can't deny that his charismatic presence (even sans The People's Eyebrow) helped a bit.Despite its 2 hours length, the movie surprisingly never felt like it dragged nor that it needed a lift from its sports action scenes. It balances the dramatic moments and set action pieces well, and this is somehow quite rare for sports movies, which usually excel in one area over the other. The movie's strengths, because of familiarity in themes and structure, lied in its execution, as well as allowing you to feel for some of its key characters. Given that the sport in focus is American Football, there is absolutely no necessity for anyone to be familiar with the sport in order to enjoy the game. Which allowed the movie to potentially reach out to a greater audience not only on the basis of its universal themes, never mind that the sport is relatively unpopular here.And given the enthusiastic response from the audience to its game sequences, I'd say you'll feel for the Mustangs as they grow and develop as a team, and champion through the odds and obstacles along the way. It's somewhat heartening to know that strength in unity holds true in the circumstances presented, and that every "loser" has a chance to make it good. Although many of the characters have committed crimes, some violent, these are almost always never dwelled upon by director Phil Joanou, who seem to want to walk the talk by putting emphasis on the more positive aspects of human character, especially those who are in need of help to get back to the right path in society. This is no yellow-ribbon programme, and gaining acceptance back in society is a constant uphill battle, starting with performance on the football field.There are plenty of ra-ra moments in the movie, and the usual speeches on self-worth, respect, and constant reminders not to throw a young life full of potential away. Life's a journey of constant learning, and that's very true for the boys in the Mustang team, player and coach alike.Stay tuned when the end credits roll to glimpse the documentary on which the movie is based upon, as well as to meet the real Sean Porter and the faces of the real people behind some of the characters in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shines a light on how bad things can get when people give up on "problem kids". Let's see if I got the message... A passionate caregiver, juvenile detention center, " problem kids". Sounds like a recipe for a hit. Unfortunately this movie got a lot of flack from the critics because it was assumed to be another sports movie. That's where the critics went wrong. This movie wasn't about football so much as how it's about the positive influence an organized sports program can have when nothing else seems to work. This is another movie featuring the Rock that was based on a true story. This one actually follows true events and real people. I say this movie rates with Coach Carter. Watch this movie and you'll see why schools need to keep sports!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a Man Makes the Difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Kilpatrick juvenile detention center, the supervisor and former football player Sean Porter (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) sees the lack of discipline, self-esteem, union and perspective in the teenage interns and proposes to prepare a football team to play in one league. He is supported by his superiors and his successful experience changes the lives of many youngsters.While watching "Gridiron Gang", I commented to my wife that I was enjoying the movie in spite of being corny and predictable. However, in the credits there are several footages of a documentary with the real Sean Porter and several interns, and I realized that this movie is not only based on a true story, but many lines of The Rock are exactly the same said by Sean Porter in the documentary. This revelation changed completely my first opinion, and I found this movie a great homage to a man that made the difference. The message about the importance of sports to aggregate men and make them winners in the essence of the word is beautiful and The Rock is amazing, giving credibility to his character in one of his best roles. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Gangue Está em Campo" ("The Gang Is In the Field")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the Gridiron, things were done right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems 'Remember the Titans' caused the levee to break. Every year, there is about five football movies released. Most are the exact same story, played over and over, while others are simply money grabs. This is exactly what I thought 'Gridiron Gang' was going to be.I was wrong.This movie was more than just football. I went deeper into real problems that today's underprivileged families face daily. Gang shootings, trouble at home, all of it was expressed in this movie, with no punches pulled. It had more heart than most movies I've seen all year.The story: a youth detention camp decides to form a football team in order to help teach these kids how to bond, how to respond to authority and how to act as one unit. To forget whatever gangs they were, and to form new friendships, and respect others.Sounds clichéd, and many posters on this site have declared just that. However, I thought it was very very well done. The Rock is no de Niro by any means. Not even close, but he did an excellent job in this as a frustrated youth worker willing to risk his job to help these kids find a purpose.For many, football has helped them accomplish their dreams, has elevated them from the streets and given them a chance to save their families. This movie showed that, and leaves feeling inspired. I loved it, and I hope people give this a chance over that God-awful 'The Black Dahlia'.This was the better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a tonic for the troops.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gridiron Gang stars Dwayne Johnson, Xzibit, L. Scott Caldwell, and Kevin Dunn. It's directed by Phil Joanou and is loosely based on the true story of the Kilpatrick Mustangs during their first season playing Gridiron out of their home, Camp Kilpatrick, a juvenile detention centre for delinquents.Few things in cinema cause as much division as the inspirational sports movie. This type of film has been trundled out yearly since sport in movies became an avenue for studio executives to wander down whilst counting the potential kerching of cash tills. The division comes by way of the clamour for emotional impact from the watching masses. The kind that always exists in the uplifting sports movie; more so when the words " based on a true story" are part of the equation. Divisional thunder is thus, some believe it's essential and worthy to have the emotions teased and pulled from your very being ,it's why they watch such movies in the first place- others feel that it's a well trodden path and is something of an easy option to rely on emotional impact and forgo cranial proddings-impact over substance so to speak.If you be the latter of the equation then run for the hills, get as far away from Gridiron Gang as you can. For this will be a trite, sickly, even banal, viewing for you. Me? Well I loved it because I'm of that other persuasion. I wanted the uplift, the hope springs eternal ticking clock in the background as Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson tries to keep these kids from either coming back to prison, or worse, wind up dead on the streets. I'm British but I love Gridiron Football, so with that at its core, and the theme of multi racial kids and gang enemies coming together in union, hell I was sold pretty early on. But I wouldn't lie to anyone, this film has a couple of problems, Phil Joanou's direction is lazy and he's unable to truly drive home the more dramatic aspects of the story. Yes he relies on the emotional thread to carry it thru, harnessing clichés at every turn. But he's lucky in that he has Johnson to carry the movie on his considerable frame. And he does, showing a nice line in drama acting that augers well for his hopes of breaking away from Arnie/Sly comparisons. The cast outside of Johnson are also a bit too scratchy, there's earthy realism from most of the unknown youths, but others annoy almost as much as it was to see Kevin Dunn's crucial adult part badly under written. But hey daddio, I want to be inspired, and Gridiron Gang, in spite of safe haven formula, does just that. It wears it's heart on its sleeve and for like minded people such as I, well that's just the ticket. Score! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at a screening last week and was pleasantly surprised.The Rock stars as Sean Porter, former college football star and now a correctional officer at Camp Kilpatrick, a juvenile detention center for underage criminals. He gets tired of seeing 75% of the kids leave the camp and either wind up dead or in prison (real statistics). So he comes up with a way to instill pride and teamwork in some of the camp's kids. His idea is for them to play football and learn what it's like to actually earn something instead of simply stealing it. For a lot of them, there is animosity because they are members of rival gangs.Through a lot of hardwork and effort the boys slowly learn to play football and eventually find a league to play in. Slowly but surely, the boys turn into men and they learn plenty of valuable lessons. Toss in plenty of great camera shots of football games and you have a pretty entertaining movie.One of the nicest things about the move is that it's based on a real story and one that continues to this day. During the end credits, there are interviews and clips of the boys who were in the program and what happened to them after their release. The inspirational thing is that many of them avoided the gang trap and went on to become citizens who contribute to society instead of take from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This last week (8-31-06), I was given the opportunity to see an advance screening of this film. Going into it, I was unsure of how good it would be. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has had his share of good movies and bad. Which would this one fall under. From the very beginning, it was intense. It is a realistic look into the lives of teens that have made mistakes and have had to pay the price. The vision of this film is that of you being right in the middle of it. When a teen is killed out on the street, you see it all up close. When a big hit is made on the field, it is shown in all it's glory. The emotions run as high as the adrenaline as Coach Porter strives to give these kids a second chance at being winners and works to overcome his own internal demons. A great story, but not one for the young kids. This is an intense movie that will give you an inside look at the lives and attitudes of young gang members as they change their ways and come out the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie, although if I had been looking for some good drama to go with the football action, I would've been disappointed. Luckily, I am a sports fan, and enjoyed those parts quite a bit. It was a longer-than-average film, running 2 hours, and at least an hour and a half was football. It was this way right from the beginning, which starts with one of the inmates jumping another inmate. Although the film does touch on such issues as racism and gangs, it's not quite as deep as it makes itself out to be. That's not a problem, though, because the action and acting make up for what it lacks in character depth (we only learn about one character and how he got into the camp, and he's a prisoner). Even the main character's background is only hinted at (played by The Rock). Despite this fact, though, Gridiron Gang is a quality film that keeps you engaged for its entire two hours.</fullReview>

Remember the titans was about overcoming racism, Rudy was about persistence and hard work (as was Invincible, another good movie) Gridiron gang focuses on the story of a caring social worker who organizes a football team of delinquents in the hope of filling the void that they have heretofore filled with crime. I thought it was a great movie. The Rock did a great job acting. There were funny parts, sad parts, and uplifting parts. I was unsure if it would be worth my time, but I was not disappointed.

		<fullReview>This isn't one of your overly patriotic movies of how great Americans are. Its all about how a sport such as American football can change people to work together as a team. This can effectively bring bonding amongst a wide array of demographics and individuals (in this case inner city youth with massive egos). This movie had both action and drama and the rock really does look like someone these types of kids would listen to. One thing that I really respected was that racism wasn't really an issue here, which is apparent in usually all of these types of movies. It really had to do with the gang mentality and egos that gets into the minds of youths these days and they effectively showed this aspect. At the end of the day it is a well rounded movie and something I highly recommend people see as a family because it does widen your perception of the issues that face youth most notably as I mentioned the gangs and bad influences that can unfortunately plague societies. It also had an interesting little documentary and epilogue at the rolling of the credits, so no need to leave early ;).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gridiron Gang was better than expected because of the exceptional performances by the cast including Dwayne Johnson and Xzibit. Director Phil Joanou is admirable in making this movie based on a true story because I wasn't sure if I was going to like this one and I ended up enjoying it. Dwayne Johnson turns in a solid performance as Sean Porter a juvenile detention center counselor who changes the lives of many troubled teenagers for the better by getting them to join a football team. Xzibit doesn't have much to do but he still is effective as Malcolm Moore whose Sean's friend and a fellow counselor. The rest of the cast are good in their roles as well. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. I was impressed with Gridiron Gang and if people give it a chance I'm sure they'll enjoy it too. Overall despite some flaws Gridiron Gang is a well made coming of age drama with complex characters, some realistic sports action, and equally impressive performances by the cast especially Johnson who make this movie based on a true story worth the time to watch because it deserves to be told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Good Film That I Will Recommend To All-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start off this comment with a confession. I saw this movie last night and thought a wrestler, a Rapper and a ghetto football team would do little to entertain me. I wasn't expecting a lot, and maybe that helped, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.When the movie ended I wasn't surprised that the movie was based on a real story, to be frank I wouldn't have been surprised if they'd used the real people in the roles because the acting throughout was superb, with none of the characters being given forced lines or plots, and seemingly genuinely involved in this films little world. Chammilionaire and his friend Dwayne were not thrown out of their depth either, with one giving a believable performance as a coach who really cares, and the other as an indifferent friend whose really just their to help.Now don't get me wrong, this film will not be the epiphany for all the moviegoers who can't stand watching wrestlers and musicians attempts at acting, their is nothing in this movie that really stands out and will make you go 'wow'. What this movie is is a return to solid gold story telling. Everything that happens is lifelike, with unpredictable little quirks and outbursts of fate and emotions which shows the depth of the story. All the characters seem to be really struggling through their difficulties, and although there is violence and swearing throughout this movie its message is deeply ingrained. And although I'm not one to be preached to about violence, the film makes you care.I think this film can be summed up by the reactions you get to the situations. When the characters were down you do feel helpless, when someone gets aggressive you feel the adrenalin rush, and when someone is laughing, you will find yourself oddly smiling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reviewing the cast list of Gridiron Gang, you would not expect a blockbuster hit. With wrestler The Rock and rapper Xzibit playing the leads and the overdone plot of an inspirational football movie, I wasn't expecting much. Boy was I wrong I loved this movie! I have to admit I'm a sucker for movies based on a true story, but Gridiron Gang succeeded in surpassing my expectations and creating a bar of excellence for the sports drama genre. Gridiron Gang is based on the streets of Los Angeles, where gang blood runs deep and most kids either end up dead or in jail. The Rock plays Sean Porter, a juvenile probation officer, tired of breaking up fights and idly watching the cycle of release and return. Desperate to make a difference, Sean starts a football team in hopes of creating something positive in these boy's lives. With the help of his co-worker Malcolm Moore, played by Xzibit, Sean will have to turn a group of juvenile delinquents into a team with heart, self discipline, and most importantly the will be something more than just gang bangers. Enemies become brothers and lives will be changed forever. Coach Porter and his makeshift team face insurmountable odds and the biggest challenge of their lives to create this motivational movie that will have you wanting more. The Rock embodied the character of Coach Sean Porter, full of heart and hope for the future. He exuded passion and truly connected with his on screen players. He excelled in the scenes with the most emotion; his passion for the game and the success of these boys radiated through the screen, straight to the hearts of the audience. His on screen relationship with his mother was tragically beautiful, allowing viewers a deeper look into the heart of this tough as nails coach. Xzibit and The Rock have natural chemistry that makes them believable as co-workers and best friends. They play off of each other and provide a lot of comedy that balances well with the more serious plot. The roles of the boys were cast perfectly. Each boy truly embodied his character and created a personal relationship with the audience. I cheered for their success and cried for their failure. I truly fell in love with the boys of the gridiron. Gridiron Gang is full of moments that succeed in walking the thin line of touching versus cheesy. These moments only added to the movie's emotional appeal and made the characters more realistic and relatable. These were real people, with real emotions and that came across the screen beautifully. The movie is concluded perfectly, paying true homage to the characters on which it was based. As the credits roll, so does live footage of the real Coach Sean Porter coaching and mentoring his first set of juvie boys. Here you find out the fate of the characters you fell in love with on screen and get to meet their off screen counterparts. You also discover that much of the dialogue in the movie is taken directly from words Coach Porter spoke to his real team. This gives the movie an air of realism that most "based on a true story" movies cannot achieve. I don't think it does Gridiron gang justice to call it an "inspirational movie." So many films these days are categorized as that. Gridiron Gang is a gem of a movie, perfectly balancing comedy and a storyline and will have viewers following the characters to the very end. It's a beautiful movie that will force you to rethink the power of one person and view the world just a little differently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film Review: Gridiron Gang Cast: The Rock and Xzibit Juvenile delinquents get a second shot at life Gridiron Gang is a factually based film, detailing the heroic antics of a group of inmates at the Kilpatrick detention facility.Gang violence in south central Los Angeles has crippled the African-American and Hispanic communities. With so many rival thugs competing for territory in gangland, very few young men emerge unscathed.When a group of inmates find themselves low on confidence and brooding with contempt, Coach Sean Porter (The Rock) takes them under his wing. He initiates a daring program in the form of a football team.When the criminals learn to forsake their differences and unite as a team ? victory is the only certain outcome.This is a story of heroics, of determination and of hope. The Rock delivers a polished performance alongside another below-par supporting role from rapper Xzibit.The action is intense, the rivalry fiercely competitive and the outcome realistic.This is another product of the sporting genre, but it makes for some enthralling viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another terrific and uplifting football film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is becoming more of an entire genre on it's own then it is a knock off of previous films but Gridiron Gang is yet another entry in the feel good, hard knocks of life football film. But there is good reason that they keep doing them because people who enjoy being uplifted and inspired by a film love them and I am definitely one of those people. Having seen Mark Wahlberg's Invincible this year and was pleasantly taken by it and now Gridiron Gang makes me smile and more power to them. Some critics will say Gridiron Gang is "not plausible" or "rehashed material" or "predictable" but if it fits the mold that they set out to make and it's successful then more power to them. Gridiron Gang is based on a true story of a man named Sean Porter who is tired of seeing kids in detention end up back in trouble again in jail. They quote the statistic that 75% of kids who go through detention end up dead or in jail. He comes up the idea to give them discipline through something he loves...football.Say what you will about Dwayne Johnson but he has made himself a successful career and has had a handful of blockbuster films and I do think he can act and has a powerful presence on screen not unlike other muscle men actors like Stallone, or Schwarzeneggar except Johnson isn't afraid to try drama and go out on a limb rather than continually going into action films. I think he needs to drop the whole "Rock" bit but he still makes a fierce leading man. In this role he is genuinely caring, concerned and hard as nails. You can believe him as a detention center cop with a desire to see these kids succeed. I think this is probably one of the best roles he has done so far and he did great!! Xzibit has to be mentioned because I also believe he can act but you'd never know from this film where he is complete and utter scenery. I wouldn't even call him a supporting actor considering he has few and mostly insignificant lines and just huddles around Johnson. How unfortunate for his acting career to get such a small part that meant little to nothing. As always with this type of film the kids are the really important part, there will always be several of them and different stories overlapping so the actor and director has to make us care about each one of them and I think they did a significant job doing that. Jade Yorker, David V. Thomas, Setu Taase, Mo, Trever O'Brien all do such an incredible job in their roles whether they are significant roles or back seat to some of the others' stories, they all mesh together perfectly. The cast works so well together and everyone plays off each other which really makes the story, however predictable, work!! Also adding to the cast are two terrific character actors Leon Rippy, and Kevin Dunn who play head caretakers in the detention center.Director Phil Joanou who is known for music videos really shows off some impressive abilities in directing this film. He captures the incredibly mean streets where these kids come from with shocking violence and gritty and brutal scenes that catch you up in everything before the film has hardly started and they show you the journey these kids take right up to the football games which are directed with a bit of a harsh violence to them as well but different than what they faced in the streets. If one thing separates Gridiron Gang from other films like it, it's the story of where these kids come from and what made them end up where they are and they're fight to become "winners." Gridiron Gang won't ever likely be considered a "classic" or win any awards but to see it will just make you feel good, give you a tingly feeling and keep you completely entertained and there isn't anything wrong with any of those things. I really, truly enjoyed it and I encourage anyone who loves this type of film to see this one because it's worth it!! 8/10</fullReview>

Better then a lot of football movies out there! there is definitely more then football in this movie and the more then football part is Sentimental. This Has to be a Start of Showing the Rock may be able to act. The Film is loosely Based off of a true Story. it shows with the idea of them coming out with a football program in juvenile detention. it almost sounds like it was meant for a movie. everybody did an amazing job and should be happy with how the film turned out.

		<fullReview>Saw a Special Screening in Philly last night--pretty decent sports movie! And I'm not a High School football nut! Very entertaining and contains a lot of action. The Rock has come a long way since those 'Scorpion' days or whatever it was he played years back. This film actually has a good little story.Long and short of it, the movie takes a very 2006 look at what's going on in the lives of some of America's young, urban, and mixed up youth. I cannot remember another Hollywood sports vehicle that has presented these themes in this fashion in the last 20 years.Not a 2-D, 'I've seen this team before' movie... It wasn't the typical Disney sports flick that sometimes has a 100% rosy view of the world(not that there's anything wrong with that) :). This film does not hold back anything.Just mixed up people, families, and situations---pretty much what happens on the streets today and whats been going on for a long time.Don't know if the film will make it in middle America, but enough people will probably make this movie a success.Good time...go see it for yourself!</fullReview>

The start is full of violence and is quite hard to watch but it gives you a great idea of what these kids go through. The gangs in there were quite scary as well but it helped make the movie more real. The Rock played a great part in this film and it suited him, i can't imagine anyone else doing it as well as he did. This movie also makes you think about what gangs do to people and the affect they have. I cried 6 times in this movie, 2 of them being because something good happened. I gave it a 10/10 because i loved it so much and the football aspect of it is great.</fullReview>

But what a movie.. one of Rock's earlier performances probably his best.. its like.. Remember the Titans meets The Longest Yard.. simply awesome! The characters are real and you get to 'meet' many of them during the end credits. It was shown at the end there is also a documentary that preceded this movie.. I will be sure to check that out as well..

		<fullReview>Based on a real story, Camp Kilpatrick juvenile detention center is a rough place where really troubled kids go to. It's a revolving door of fights, crime, and death where 75% of the kids eventually end up in prison. Supervisors Sean Porter (Dwayne Johnson) and Malcolm Moore (Xzibit) decide to put together a football team to get the teens to work together.I love The Rock in this. He is completely earnest and puts in a terrific performance. The kids aren't cuddly. The violence look real. Like the opening narration says, these kids didn't get locked up for showing up at the prom drunk. These guys are there because somebody got shot in the parking lot. The story is extremely simple. There are no surprises. The movie can be summed up in a couple of lines. It's not one of those jokey sports movies. It takes everything seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Porter (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) works at Kilpatrick Detention Center in Los Angeles. Frustrated at not being able to help the kids get away from their problems in life, such as street gangs and drug dealings, he decides to create a football team so the kids can feel like they're part of something. Porter believes that football will teach the teenage inmates what it takes to be responsible, mature, and winners. He picks out a few kids in the room that he feels will benefit from this program and requires that they practice with him the following day. He states to his new team, the Kilpatrick Mustangs, "You are all losers, But if you stick with the program you could all be winners at the end." Two of the teens do not get along because they are from rival gangs.Based on a true story, "Gridiron Gang" sends out a message that one man can make a difference and the most hopeless kids in our society can change the course of their lives through hard work, commitment and bold leadership The Emmy Award winning documentary Gridiron Gang was aired on television in 1993. However, the film chronicled the Mustang's 1990 Cinderella season, which was the inaugural season for the team. As stated above, an eight man squad had been formed earlier in 1988, but it did not play with a full schedule against other schools.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Heck Of A Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard good things about this movie and saw the commercials for it, as well as the trailers. Even though it came out in 2006, I just saw it last night, September 13, 2013. Why did it take so long, I have no idea. I wish it didn't take so long though, because I greatly enjoyed this movie. Phil Joanou might be a one hit wonder, because all of his other movies are not well known. Don't have that comment not have you not want to see it though, because it was fantastic nonetheless. It was very realistic, the film was, and since it was based on a true story, it kind of needs to be. I should compare this movie to others, so I'll take Coach Carter. These two movies hit it out of the park, and did not disappoint. Oh, if you like sports movies, go see Coach Carter, because it is also a true story, and anything with Samuel L. Jackson in it is almost all the time good. I'm gonna review it later probably, too. Anyway, Gridiron Gang had it all. Great acting, great dialogue, great music, and a great story. What more could you ask for. Dwayne Johnson kept the movie rolling just like he should, and all of the Mustangs kept it interesting, just like they should. I'll fill you in on the setting. Inner city California (uh-oh), gangs all across the city, low income neighborhoods, calling for police cars everywhere. That enough? Yeah, I hoped so. Does anybody know about the true story? I've been meaning to find out but I haven't yet. This movie also teaches a fantastic lesson about respect and responsibility, and shows how far it can get you. Remember that, kids! It's pretty hard to find a movie like that nowadays, because they are meaningless and boring a lot of times. Another reason I recommend this movie. The writer of the film also knew when to add humor into the movie, and made it all the more good of a movie. I should get to the complaints. On the football field, people call out names, and you don't know where they are, because they are in their sports stuff. This only happens on the field though, so it is nothing that ruins the film. Hmmmmm, that's really the only complaint I can think of. I give this movie a substantial rating of 8, because it teaches lessons and is very realistic. Thanks for reading and checkout some of my other reviews, too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing. I was a bit reluctant to continue observing this movie due to the massive violence in the very beginning of the movie, However after 30 minutes of watching the movie, the message in this movie exemplifies the power of over coming adversity. There is so many of our youth out there who are inspired by the wrong influences which leads to there set backs, there disappointments, there jail time and fear to let go of the past. I enjoyed this movie. Even shed a few tears. It will take an enlightened mind to understand this film. Overall, I give it 5 stars. This movie should be dedicated to the millions of youth in our country who needs that sense of encouragement, that taste of passion to know that no matter what, you have the power to overcome anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this films holds something quite special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>our story starts out with young black teen named Roger Weathers in a juvenile detention centre, who immediately rises up out of bed and starts beating another inmate in bed. he is thrown into the block and Dwayne Johnson as Sean Porter, berates him for his choices and tells him if he doesn't change his act, he will end up dead by 21. he is released from prison the next day and sure enough is run over and killed in a drive by shooting. his cousin Willie, under the stress of everything that has happened, shoots his step father who has been abusing his mother. he is sent to the same prison that roger was at. and believe or not, this all happens within the first 15-20 minutes, and its shocking. what i really liked about this film, was its message. its very similar to other inspirational sports films, but Gridiron gang holds that message dearly, never letting go of what its trying to tell you and keeps it strong. it shows that people who've failed at the system can still achieve and be something, learning how to work together with your fellow man, no matter what street of boulevard you're from. it shows gang culture as corruption, taking the potential that people have and throwing it away, while Gridiron gang is giving it back. you really want to see these people succeed and although they lose the championship game, they emerged as winners, which is what they and we wanted. the film also opens with this message: 75% of people who go to prison always end up back in, and Sean Porter wants to change that. and he does. the fact that this is also a true story puts more heart in the message its trying to tell, and never once lets up on that message. it knows what its trying to say and goes beyond that as well, going deep within the characters and their struggles so that when they win, its all the more victorious. i seriously recommend this film, its beautiful in its entirety, wonderful in telling its message and saddening with its losses, go see it if you haven't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful drama that opens eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are always people that take a wrong turn in life. Some turn around by themselves, but many don't because they lack the encouragement and support. Watching Gridiron Gang shows that one person CAN make a difference in the lives of others. If trust, heart and soul are put into another individual, that individual should feel inspired to do something positive with that energy. And that's what happens in this story.Dwayne Johnson plays Sean Porter, a man with a tradition of doing things on his playing ground. What is he? A football coach, and what a great role it is for Johnson too. Johnson's build is perfect for that kind of character, especially since he's a tough character. So who does he coach? Convicts who are originally uninterested about participating in anything Porter offers. Why? Because these convicts belong to their own gangs on the streets. And without their brotherhood, they don't have anything when they're locked up. However, this all turns around when they learn what it's like to belong to a team where they're all in it together AND someone else believes in them. The person who believes in them is Porter. This is what makes this film so great. The character development is so moving, no one will be disappointed when the film ends. The audience will really see the transition between what the characters used to be and how they turn out in the end. It's a gratifying feeling to see such a positive outcome.All the actors in this film give great performances. The protagonists show their eagerness to help, while the antagonists do a good job at portraying their prideful sides. The screenplay is written brilliantly so it shows the problems that still go on in others lives while they try and cope with being locked up. It's all very realistic and it may come close to home for some viewers because every town has its problems.The story is grounded and it'll stick to its goal to get its point across just like the football players in this film. The dramatization is superb and it shows that no matter what, everyone deserves a chance to redeem him or herself if they try hard enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was Sunday and I thought to myself lets watch a movie. And i did. And I am glad I did it.Let me say that I didn't choose to watch the movie deliberately, but it was running on TV.When I started to watch the movie I was a little judge mental because I have seen Dwayne Johnson star in action movies and I thought, well OK, he has a body and the look to play such roles, but as a coach of teenagers who's home streets made them what they are? But I must admit i was wrong, very wrong. He showed that he has something else to offer then just shooting guns. It was refreshing to see him play such a role and in my opinion he did a great job.There are thousand of movies out there who deal with the same problematic, and there are movies about football. In this movie we have both of the kind but packed with a good story line, good character depth and real life emotions. Everyone made me believe that they are who they are playing. Its about forgiving the ones who hurt you, its about to fight for your life and to respect yourself. Maybe its because Dwayne Johnson and x-zibit played these roles and I thought that they haven't got the stuff to play such roles, maybe thats why I was impressed.The bottom line is - I would recommend this flick to anyone who loves watching movies with a touch of real life because it gets under your skin.</fullReview>

It is based on a true story about a detention camp for juveniles who have had a lot of bad things happen to them, have a lot of gangland rivalry and hostility between then. A probation officer who genuinely cares for them. Who wants to do something to make them feel proud of themselves, to bring them closer to their respective families and loved ones and to each other. To give them a sense of achievement, something to want to live for and he does this the best way he knows how, American Football and by tough love.I could never really say that this film is a realistic portrayal because I have never lived in this type of environment but I can say that Gridiron Gang is well worth watching, I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm an Aussie and so I don't know the first thing about American football! This movie didn't make me WANT to know anything about American football. I'd never heard of any of the actors except Dwayne Johnson and that didn't matter either.BUT... what an awesome film! What an inspiration! This film is right up there on MY ratings chart with Freedom Writers and The Great Debaters. I particularly liked the short clips of the real Sean Porter that accompanied the credits - that gave the whole film "realness" for me.Simply because of the obvious main theme of the movie and my own total ignorance of or interest in Grid Iron, I went into this with quite some reticence... but it didn't last long! Another reviewer - Taylor-Braun - has said that the opening sequence is "violent, depressing and scary" and I guess he's probably right about that - except that I don't remember! The rest of the story simply cast those violent, depressing and scary bits into a sort of distant haze. Nevertheless, those scenes were very necessary to establish exactly what sort of characters this film is all about. However, I guess it is worth mentioning that because, like T-B, some viewers might contemplate quitting early and that would be very sad because they could deprive themselves of a truly moving film.There are movies that entertain, movies that educate and then there are movies that truly move their viewers. I can think of lots of Oscar-winning films that fulfill the first without even touching on the other two but this movie certainly fulfills all three and, for that, Phil Joanou is to be congratulated.As to my summary, I have to admit that I'm glad I watched Gridiron Gang on my own at home because there were several times when I had to wipe my eyes! Laugh at that if you like - but then watch the movie and see if you can remain emotionless all the way through! I won't include any spoilers here because you need to see it all for yourselves.It might even change your lives!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>extremely well-done film that is both tough and touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based upon the true story of Sean Porter and his football team, which was composed entirely of juvenile delinquents, many of whom were once members of rivaling gangs that are now being forced to work together and put their pasts behind them. "Gridiron Gang" is a very good film that will suit people who can just get beyond its usage of offensive language and violence. Because it's not just about football. It has the two qualities that are needed in a football player: toughness and heart. The film symbolizes the horrible results that can come upon such young men when they join up with gang members and become associated with violence, drugs, and robberies. Really, it's a film about one man trying to pull all of these young criminals together into a cooperative team and to try and keep less than the average seventy-five percent of them from returning to jail or worse, being put in a graveyard."Gridiron Gang" brings to the screen a very realistic portrayal of gang members and the style of lives they live. Whether they're inside or outside of the jail walls. In the film, we have the style of clothing, the filthy city environments, drive-by shootings, the gangster style lingo, and everything else necessary to convince us that these are real gang members who have lived in poverty all their lives and don't no any other way, until they met Sean Porter at Kilpatric Detention Camp. And to futherly convince us, they're all portrayed by great young actors. And as for the older actors, well-done performances as well. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is very effective as the leading character. And he just has this kind of air to him that makes us feel like he really is in control and that things go, as he would quote it "my way, not your way, my way. Your way got you in here." At the beginning, there are those who oppose to his idea of the football team composed of criminals, but they don't really go so far as to become hated villains. Not even villains at all. Not even anti-heroes. And they go along to become supportive and well-respected characters. Of course the real stars are the young actors playing the delinquents. Jade Yorker was perhaps the most memorable as Willie Weathers, probably because of his character's major involvement throughout the story and that he suffers and changes the most over the course of the film.There is one thing I do not personally care for in "Gridiron Gang". And it has something to do with the cinematography and the way it was handled. I think maybe it was adapted to become too gangster-like, kind of like how I mentioned in my review of the 2004 version of "Man on Fire". I think sometimes it was too bright and the camera was handled too jerkily or zoomed it too quickly to seem authentistic. I just got a bit picky when the camera would zoom quickly out, zoom quickly in, and then back out again for a single shot. I think it would have been better just left still.However, despite this one aspect, "Gridiron Gang" is a very compelling football film, and also pulls through with its symbolism through the well-constructed characters. This is definitely the kind of film suited for Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and I hope to see him in performances very much like this one in the future. Better yet, in films very much like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie...can't get enough of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie. I never knew what a great actor Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was until I saw this film. It had me on the edge of my seat, talking to the TV. I'm usually picky about clichés such as "You can do it" or "Believe in yourself" but the storyline fit the dialogue, and it brought me near tears several times throughout the film. It made me smile to see how Willie and Kelvin, members of rival gangs ended up being friends. It was gut-wrenching to see Kelvin get shot, but I loved how Willie tried to save him. And I actually grew to love Junior's character. I think the best part about this film is how it was erected from a true story, which makes it so much more inspirational, especially with my personal experiences seeing the effects of gang violence in New York. I think that it inspired me and could inspire others. I give it two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A counselor (The Rock) at a facility for juvenile delinquents who have committed primarily violent crimes comes up with an idea to coach them football to teach discipline, respect, pride, teamwork, commitment, and other life lessons. Loosely based on actual facts which occurred in Los Angeles County back in 1990, "Gridiron Gang" is an entertaining and satisfying little film which has a strong message to its viewers. Once again it is shown that sports truly can have long-lasting positive effects in even the darkest parts of the human condition. The movie is full of clichés and typical outcomes, but The Rock is a screen presence who dominates the action and everybody else is good enough to keep the project moving and afloat. An unforgettable voice-over by The Rock at the conclusion of the film is a truly memorable element found within. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first saw this film advertised i naturally assumed it was going to be a Poor mans "Coach Carter", i say that because as enjoyable as "The Rock" is to watch he is never gonna win any Oscars. Having said that i do honestly believe his overall acting credentials have gone up a notch with this performance. Back to the film though, I had no idea this was based on actual events and characters. The film was good enough on its own but when you see the real character footage at the end it sort of left me with a bump in my throat which was quite refreshing. I don't know about the Mustangs stats as a team but i don't care, the fact they took part was enough to see the kids wanted to change within themselves. It was nice to see a sports orientated "Teacher and Students" flick with a difference. Yes, all the usual clichés are there and you find yourself liking the so called "bad guys" and disliking anyone who slates them. All in all i was glued from start to finish. Excellent character development, excellent cast and a truly excellent choice of storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of films in my life and the one thing i noticed is that in a lot of them the people who end up in prison are portrayed as heartless people who are naturally bad, regardless of age. The thing I love about this film is that it examines this from the other side and shows it in a way that makes you feel sorry for the kids and you see that the so called "villians" are really the victims. I also feel that a lot of the impact from this film comes from the fact that this is based on a true story. The actors do a great job, the script is well written, and at the end they show actual footage of the real Mustangs. This is a film that I feel everyone should see, even those who are not football fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this movie 8 years back ,I got a copy from my friend and re-watched it again which made me write this review .I mainly wanted to see the movie only because Dwayne Johnson was in it and oh my god what an inspirational movie it was.Rock became an established actor with movies of these kind. The movie showcases the sad situation of the juveniles who get themselves into the gangs endangering their lives .All the young guys who acted as juveniles deserves a big applause .They all lived the character though some were real life wrongdoers. There are too many elements in the movie which turns us emotional and make us believe that we can be clean if we have the heart to change ourselves. There are some violence and foul language used in the movie but the story demands it and this being a real story I don't have any negatives to point out about that .Don't miss out this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gridiron Gang is a Touchdown!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched the movie Gridiron Gang and I would like to tell you about it. This movie, which is based on a true story, is for the family over 12 years old.Gridiron Gang is taken place at a juvenile detention facility. There is a worker there named Shawn that had an idea to start a football team to make the juvenile boys more responsible and involved. The main characters are Shawn Porter, Willie Weathers, Junior, Calvin, and Roger Weathers. Shawn is the first main character because without Shawn there would be no movie! Shawn was the one who started the football team. The next character is, Willie because he was a member of a gang going into the detention center. Throughout the movie you will see how much he changes and becomes a leader. Next is Junior. Junior is a main character because at first, Shawn didn't want him on the team because he wasn't trustworthy, he would just start fights with everyone. Throughout Gridiron Gang Junior completely changes and I feel he is the glue holding the team together. Following Junior is, Calvin. Calvin is similar to Roger because he also comes into the detention center in a gang, and is ready to fight, or even kill anyone from opposing gangs. After something tragic happens to Calvin he realizes that life is more than just being in a gang. Lastly is Roger, Roger doesn't have a huge role in the movie but he is a main character because Shawn wanted to start the team because he didn't want teen boys to get out of the facility and end up like Roger, or just coming back to the detention center right after getting out.There were many actors in this film that I had never seen before. The best acting by far goes to Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, who played Shawn. I feel as though all of the other actors were sub-par but got better as the movie went along. Junior, or Setu Taase, did a good job I felt like he had heart when he was acting. Leon Rippy as Paul and Kevin Dunn as Ted also did pretty good jobs, because they have had a lot of acting experience before. The other main actors hadn't had a lot of experience and I think that showed.I really loved the story line of the movie, it was a great heartfelt, but action packed tear jerker. I felt myself rooting for the team and feeling sad when the movie was sad. Honestly the only thing I really did not like about the movie is that, in the beginning, there was some really bad acting. I didn't even think I was going to finish watching it because the acting was so distracting. But if you keep watching it gets better, I promise!! I think maybe all of the actors, got more comfortable and really in touch with their characters as the movie played. That was my only complaint.The lesson that the movie teaches is to Believe in yourself. What I learned from watching the movie, is to take risks! Someof the boys didn't even want to be on the team, but doing something that they were uncomfortable with in the beginning, changed their lives! I think others will learn that you are capable of more than you think!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gridiron the review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished this movie and here is what I think it for what it was which was a story about how a juvenile correction worker risks his job for a football program to help the convicts escape gang life. It was a touching movie in its emotional parts and an exciting one in its game sequences. It showed the struggle some have to go through to leave their gangs or even to survive in prison. If you are interested in an underdog story or a good sports movie this wouldn't be a poor choice. The Movie is based in California in the late 1980's to early 1990's in a correctional facility. One of the workers want's to start a football team in order to teach the kids about hard work and teamwork in order for them to have a chance for a future. It starts out looking like the program was going to fail. It currently has a gang return rate of only 8% before the program the return rate was over 68%. Duane Johnson was one of the main characters in the movie and I feel he did one of the best jobs for his character when it focused on his dying mother and his passion for coaching football. Sctu. Taase and his character was one of the key components for the movie as it starts out as him being violent and uncooperative to him changing and becoming a major part of the team. J. Yorker played Willie a gang youth arrested soon after the death of his cousin. David. V. Thomas plays the role of Calvin a rival gang member of Willies. In the more important scenes I didn't like how some of the acting was stiff, such as when Xzibit's character is convincing the christen coach to let them play against their team it seemed so stiff emotionally. I did like however the scenes where you could see the team slowly come together as it showed character progression. I disliked the character "Bug" because I found him annoying but that seemed on purpose. I think the story is about having the will to try and change who you are for the better and that second chances are sometimes what a person needs to succeed. It also warns of the dangers of gang life and the impact it can have of you and your family. I think one of its better lessons was that even if you do not win you are not a loser if you put your heart into it. I would recommend this movie to people who generally like underdog stories and football. I would hesitate to bring children to this film as it contains violence, swearing, and mild racism. If you watch football movies often you might notice some clichés such as the coach going too far and realizing what he did and apologizing to the team for it. All in all I rate this a 4/5. I rated it this because I noticed so many clichés and some scenes were just stiff in the acting but other scenes showed high tension very well. I am a student in the 11th grade at GCCC and who played football for over eight years before I quit after a concussion. They like reading, gaming, and sleeping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have recently watch Gridiron Gang with my class. I thought the movie was pretty good. It told a good amount of information about each character. It was an inspirational movie. This movie could motivate you to do your best at anything.This movie is group of juvenile kids that were all caught doing something bad. From stealing a car to stabbing a old lady for money. There was one person that believe that he could change these kids from nothing to something. He was Sean Porter (Dwayne Johnson), he wanted to start a football program for the juvenile kids. But no high school team wanted to play against their team. But Sean Porter still did it anyways, knowing that a team will eventually play against them. The team's first practice didn't go so well. None of the kids could spell Mustang when they were doing jumping jacks. There were two people on the team that were gang rivals Willie Weathers (Jade Yorker) and Kelvin Owens (David V. Thomas). They could not get along with each other at all. Junior Palatia (Setu Taase) is one of the kids who wanted to play on the team but couldn't because of his bad attitude. Malcolm Moore (Xzibit) is the assistant coach that keeps the team up and together. This football team has to go through hell to figure out who they are and why they are going nowhere in life.The main characters that did a good job acting and had a big part in this movie is Sean Porter (Dwayne Johnson), Willie Weathers (Jade Yorker), Kelvin Owens (David V. Thomas), Junior Palatia (Setu Taase) and Malcolm Moore (Xzibit). Without these characters the movie would not be as great as it is. Sean Porter did a wonderful thing by bringing a group of juvenile kids together and turn them into something and not nothing. I would rate this movie a 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gridiron Gang movie review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly believe this has been the best movie I have seen in my lifetime. It gives you confidence kind of makes you think about life twice as hard. Mr. Porter is a good man he knows the struggle these boys are going thru because he was in the same boat when he was younger. He's rough on them because he don't want them to be back where they was when they first started. The movie took place in Culver city, California a nice hot area. The true story is about a group of teenage delinquents given a second chance to show that they can control themselves while playing football. Mr. Porter is the coach and the juvenile probation officer. His co-worker Mr. Moore is the man who devised a plan to teach discipline and responsibility throughout the season of football. Willy Mayweather is the quarterback who was taught so many different lessons from Mr. Porter and Mr. Moore. Willy Mayweather was one of the main characters in this movie. He was in a gang called "88" until these two gentlemen taught him there's more things in life than violence, crimes, and drugs. I did not like how in the middle of the movie. One of the team players was shot because there was supposed to be guards and officers all around the field they are juvenile delinquents they still need guidance around them. It taught the kids to act right with their attitude's their body language the way they speak to others the way there supposed to work as a team. How they visualize things in a good way instead of violence. I recommend other camps to do this because I think it actually helped a lot of the teenagers that was struggling with a lot of those things. I would not recommend kids to watch this. I rate this movie 5 stars. The reason I rate it 5 stars is because you can learn a lot from this movie I know it helped me get my act right because I wouldn't want to go thru any of that stuff the stress the fear. I'm Shania and I'm in 11th grade which makes me a junior in high school but I go to a career center which can help you with your future plans. I work at Wendy's I started there when I was 16 and I'm about to be 18. I love to make money that is my main motive I know money can change people but me I love to help needy people like the homeless people who need help getting back on their feet. I love to make people happy and I love to see them smile instead of depressed all the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched "Gridiron Gang" and I would have to say this is one of the best movies I have seen. This movie shows a group of people that come from different gangs even backgrounds can overcome so much and achieve a goal together. In "Gridiron Gang" a group of kids locked up for things they shouldn't have done. During the beginning of the movie they never got along and always got into fights The counselor Sean Porter also known as Dwayne Johnson was getting angry how over 70% of kids were going back to jail. Roger Weathers( Michael J. Pagan) was an inmate that Sean Porter saw potential in was released and within 3 days of being released Roger was run down in a drive by and killed. That was when Sean Porter decided he needed to do something different. After Will Weathers(Jade York) Rogers cousin, also was sent to the Juvenile Center SEan Porter know he had a second chance to do something for Roger. So Sean Porter had an idea about creating a football team to teach them teamwork and discipline.Willy and Donald Madlock(James Earl) were rival gang member in Los Angeles which made everything cooler about the movie since "Gridiron Gang" was filmed in LA. For Example Agoura Hills, Camp Kilpatrick, Los Angeles, San Francisco , and also Westlake. This movie was filmed within 92 days(May 23-August 23, 2005). Willy and Madlock were the best inmate actors because they had to show the most hatred towards each other and towards the end the had the most change between characters. Sean Porter(Dwayne Johnson) did the best job showing leadership and getting them to listen to him. You could really tell towards the end of the movie they looked up to him and thanked him the most.This movie was a good movie overall. "Gridiron Gang" had a lot of good aspects such as good camera angles, lighting, scenery, and most of all the story flowed smoothly without skipping around Although like every movie there has to be dislikes. For example all of the unnecessary swearing and cursing throughout.This film is good at teaching a lesson/theme. The movie "Gridiron Gang" teaches young kids with a bad childhood and gives them hope again after they get out. I learned for this movie that everyone comes for different family's, situation, and backgrounds. I hope the readers will learn the same thing I did Even more.If you are wondering if you should watch this movie, and you around 50 and older you may not like this movie. On the other hand if you are a teenager and are into sports you will enjoy this inspirational movie.I would give this film a rating of 4 stars. "Gridiron Gang" wasn't the best movie I have seen , but it was an emotional movie. It also did not jump around like most movies do it had smooth transactions.I am a 17 year old male that is currently a junior at the Greene County Career Center. My major is Automotive Technology and I really enjoy what I do. I am Currently working at Young's Golden Jersey Inn and I have worked there for about three years now. I have played football since 4th grade and only baseball for two years. On my free time I like to skateboard only when it is warm out. On the other hand when it's cold I like to sit inside and play video games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No More Gangs, Gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gridiron Gang was a great movie. In the movie there are a lot of lessons taught by the inmates, as well as the coaches. The kids learn lessons about how to get along with others, how to be respectful, and never give up on what you believe you can do. The movie is amazing because of the message it gives out. In the movie it shows the constant struggle to get better and to overcome adversity. Thats a big lesson in life that everyone should learn, and that's why i love the movie.The story took place in 1988 in California. Sean (Dwayne Johnson) is one of the main characters. He is important because he helps the kids realize that there is more in life than being in jail. Roger weathers (Michael J. Pagan) has trouble getting out of jail as well as getting out of his gang, along with his cousin. Willie Weathers (Jade Yorker) and Kelvin Owens (David Thomas) have trouble throughout the movie. In the end they figure out that being a team is more important than being in a gang.Dwayne Johnson did an amazing job in the movie and is important to the movies success. Sean (the character played by Dwayne) is the guy who makes all of this happen. He sets up the team and makes sure that the kids are successful and are more than likely not to end back up in jail where they started. He is also an important part of making sure that in the end, the kids have something to look forward to. Make sure that they are winners.In the movie I like how all the characters have their own personalities. Each character has a back story and each one knows how hard it is in different areas. One thing i don't like about this movie is that it wasn't as long as i would like it to be. I would want more of a backstory on some little characters.This story teaches some very important lessons. It teaches that no matter what happens with your life that you can always change the bad, and make it good. It also teaches that if you have something to look forward to, a goal, you can work towards it and make life amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No gangs on the Gridiron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the Gridiron Gang, I really enjoyed it. The story revolves around a group of juvenile delinquents that come from all different gangs and places. The man that brings these kids together as one really cared for them and believed in every single one of them, if they could believe in themselves. He shows them they don't have to be losers the rest of their lives.The story took place in California, 1988. Sean, (Dwayne Johnson) is the coordinator of Camp Kilpatrick and decides to give the kids hope and make them feel like their actually part of something other than some gang. Roger Weathers, (Michael J. Pagan) has troubles figuring out what he should do when he's out, rob and steel or start fresh without all his gang members and such. Sean forms a football team to let the kids who want to play prove themselves and to everyone else they can be winners too. Kelvin Owens, (David V. Thomas) and Willie Weathers, (Jade Yorker) both join the team but do not like each other because of the gangs their both in but, have to learn to get along to be on the team. Junior, (Setu Taase) is kind if a trouble starter and isn't even aloud on the team until he proves to Sean he won't start any trouble.Dwayne Johnson was a huge part in the film. If it wasn't for him the football team would have never been started and the kids would still be causing trouble and still be losers. David V. Thomas and Jade Yorker played a big role in showing that it doesn't matter what gang you come from, on the Gridiron there together as one, as a team.All around I enjoyed every part of the movie especially when it went back into time to show how Willie Weathers got in trouble to begin with. Also it showed Roger Weathers after he got out and what he decided to do. I liked how Sean was very hard on the boys just because he cared for them and wanted to push them to the limits.Overall the main idea of the film in my opinion was to show that juvenile delinquents or any troubled kids that they can still be winners as long as they realize what's important and what's not. It doesn't matter what gang or hood your from you can still have a positive relationship with anyone even if they come from a different place. It takes a matter of believing in yourself and others to succeed.All different types of people could like this film. The movie shows a lot of different themes and the actors play very well as their characters. So yes, in my opinion I think many different age groups could like the movie.I would rate the film a 5 star. The reason for this rating is because, myself personally didn't find anything I disliked in the movie at all.My name is Austin Fabian, I am 17 years old and I'm in the eleventh grade. I enjoy playing the guitar and hanging with fiends. I also skateboard and snowboard and love the outdoors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gridiron Gang I just watched the Gridiron Gang and I thought it was a pretty good movie. The story is very well put and I think others would enjoy watching this movie as well. It's based off a true story and it could be a life changing movie for some people, maybe. The story took place at a juvenile help center to help people change their actions and get through life better and just teach them how you need to be to survive in the real world. Some people got caught up in the wrong crowds and needed some punishment and guidance to help them. The main characters were Shawn, Willie, Junior, Calvin and Roger. I think that the coach did a great job and he was one of the most important people in this story, to be honest. He really helped the boys and nothing would have happened if it wasn't for him. Some things I liked about the movie were that it was based off of a true story, people could learn from it and it could be inspiring and life changing to some people. If I was a Juvenile that wasn't acting right and I watched this, I would totally change my ways because I wouldn't want to be put through what those boys had to go through in the movie. I didn't really dislike anything about this movie, it was honestly one of the best movies I have ever watched. I don't really like watching movies because I can't pay attention to something that long but this movie really kept my interest throughout the whole movie.The lesson I learned from this movie was to always respect your parents and people around you. Always be kind to people because you never know whenever your life is about to take a change. You never know when you're going to lose someone that's close you. This movie also taught me to get my act right. I wouldn't want to be put in a situation like they did, but in the end, it truly helped them out a lot and without the guidance they got, they would probably be running the streets and not doing well. I think the people that should mostly watch this movie is people that have had a rough past, kids that misbehave or just anyone that's interested in true stories. Juveniles that are going through a hard time right now may be interested in watching this just to see what could happen if they don't start acting right. Everyone goes through hard time and nobody is perfect though. Some people need help and that's okay. This movie combined people together that all needed help and made each other a lot better in the end. I rate this film a 5 just because it kept my interest the whole time and it was a true story.Nikki is a junior in high school at the Greene County Career Center and she really enjoyed this movie. Nikki loves helping people and would do anything for anybody. This movie was really an inspiration to her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gridiron Gang Will Intercept Your Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched The Gridiron Gang and in my opinion it was a very good movie I liked how it could go from being in a serious position to making the seriousness funny and I thought it did a good job in showing how much the football program changed the teens lives. The movie took place in an all-male juvenile detention center, the main characters include Shawn played by The Rock, Willie Weathers played by Jade Yorker, Junior played by Setu Taase, Roger played by Michael J. Pagan, and Bates played by Trevor O'Brien. The story of The Gridiron Gang is about teens who have all made the worst decisions possible in life from murder to robbery but they all end up together in the detention center hating each other, having family problems, and just completely hating life but the guard who watches them named Shawn (The Rock) forms a football team hoping to change them for the better to keep them alive. I really thought the acting in this movie was close to perfect especially The Rock I thought he killed the part of Shawn the only thing about the acting I didn't like was I thought Willie (Jade Yorker) was kind of out of tone with the character at certain times but overall the acting was near perfect. I think the overall theme of the story was don't judge people by their actions in the past kind of like the saying don't judge a book by it cover, this film taught me to not judge people by their actions in the past and I think it will teach others that to. I think people who don't like sports or drama movies should not watch this movie because they probably won't like it but if you do like sports and dramas then this movie is for you, out of a five star rating I would give this movie a three out of five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie: A chance for a team T.J. Bailey Director: Phil Joanou So I just got done watching the movie Grid Iron Gang, a movie about a correctional facility with a number of different gangs and people trying to survive around each other, although there is always a fight, throughout the movie teamwork prevails and lessons are learned. I have to say I liked the movie even though you can sort of already tell what is going to happen just like other movies involving an inspired football team with issues. I enjoyed the movie the characters and the events kept me interested. Dwayne Johnson playing as Shawn, a guardian of the correctional facility where he also coached and mentored the convicts into a football team. He made the kids work together and dealt with their differences to get them to work as a team. Jade Younker Playing as Willy, did nothing but fight and stay in gang related activities. He learns how to calmly respect others and be a better team player. Exhibit playing as Malcom, the assistant coach helped the team find games to play by talking to other schools and coaches.

		<fullReview>The Gridiron Gang Billy Howard 7th I watched The Gridiron Gang the other day, This is what I thought of it. I like what the story is about, it's about them making football team in jail to keep the kids out. They were having lots of kids come right back to jail but after they made the team it all changed.Sean played by The Rock was the main character he made the team. Willie Weathers played by Jade Yorker ended up in jail and played for the team he changed a lot throw the movie. Malcom played by Exibit was the assistant couch, if it wasn't for him the team would have had no one to face. Jr. played by Setu Taase he was one of the players that helped to keep the team together and kept them from fighting each other. Kelvin played by David V. Thomas him and Willie were from two different gangs and became friends on the team.I liked what the movie was based off of. I like how it was based on a true story. I don't like how they took Jr out till the very last game. I like how Willie was talking about how he was there for the team. I like who Kelvin and Willie were from 2 different gangs and become friends by the end of the movie.The lesson I think people should see from this film is that you should never give up on yourself or anyone else. I learned that just because someone might have messed up in their life before doesn't make them a terrible person. I think others will learn that they should treat everyone the same no matter a person's past.I think this would be great for teens and adults to see. I don't think kids should see this just because of the language at times. This would be a great program to do in jails to keep kids on the right track. The reason I think teens should see it is because teens tend to be the most judging people. This could help them understand what some people have to go throw. I would give this movie a 4 out of 5 the acting was really good but not the best. I am Billy Howard. Billy is a junior in high school. Billy doesn't have a job. Billy likes to play football and basketball. Billy likes to long board, box, go out in to the woods, and to watch scary movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joshua LustreThe Rock And his Gridiron GangI have just watched the movie, the Gridiron Gang. It was a very decent movie and I enjoyed watching it. This movie was about a group of young teenagers locked in a juvenile detention center. One of the supervisors named sean decides that a good way to improve their social and teamwork skills by forming a football team. Many of the kids on the football team improve their lives and leave their criminal live and habits. The football players struggle to get along because many of them are from different neighborhoods and gangs. In the end they become a real cooperative team and learn to get along. The main characters were Sean (Duane Johnson) , Willie (Jade Yorker) ,Junior (Setu Taase) , Kalvin ( David Thomas) and Malcolm ( Alvin Nathaniel). Duane Johnson did a very good job playing the role of Sean the supervisor and coach of the football team. Alvin Nathaniel or (xzibit) Played a decent role as well staring as Malcome another supervisor and also the assistant coach of the football team. David Thomas played an interesting role as well , being the character Kalvin. There were more characters but they did not play very important or noticeable roles. I liked the suspenseful gang violence as well as the video quality of this movie. Im not a huge fan of sports movies , so I was not very interested in watching it. I did not how ever like the racism , for example when an opposing football team member uses the n word to Malcome during a football game. I do how ever understand the importance of displaying the social dynamics and events of the story considering this movie was based on a real football program in California. The main theme or lesson of this movie was that not all criminals are bad people and not all juvenile delinquents are bad people. It showed the importance of giving people a second chance and learning to respect and work together with other people. I think that most football fans and teanagers would appreciate this movie because it shows many aspect of football and teenage struggle. I do not think that older people or people who don't like violence should watch this movie because it shows lots of gang violence and the struggles of young people. I think a good rating for this movie would be pg-13. I would recommend watching itI give this movie a 3 out of five.Josh is a junior in high school and lives in ohio. He loves to play the bass guitar and watch t.v.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching the inspirational movie The Grid Iron Gang. I believe this was a good movie that shows how no matter the background people can learn to get along.This movie was centered on building respect and trust between juvenile delinquents though creating a football team. The juveniles started with no respect just hate and ended up acting as a team through standing up for each other.The most important characters in my eyes are, Dwayne Johnson as Sean Porter, Jade Yorker as Willie Weathers, Setu Taase as Junior Palaita, Michael J. Pagan as Roger Weathers and David V. Thomas as Kelvin Owens. Dwayne was the coach in this movie that made them believe in themselves. I liked how you can see the change of the characters point of view on life as the movie progresses. I personally didn't want to watch this movie at first, because I thought this was just going to be another gang violence move, But after watching it I believe that people can change for the better or worst fast. I would watch it again if I was given the chance. I would recommend this movie to all age groups above 15 years of age. I would rate this movie at 9 stars based on the changes that the kids made during the movie. Cody is a junior in high school that likes to fish, hunt and camp. He doesn't play sports or have a job at the moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a good inspiration.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My names Gang, Grid Iron GangI've just recently seen the movie "Grid Iron Gang", and would like to give my opinion of it. The movie is based on a true story of juvenile delinquents that can't stay out of the detention hall. They all have their own independent personalities that set them apart and bring them together at the same time. To summarize the story, the story is based in California, at a juvenile hall in the year 1988. The hall is having a hard time keeping their incoming numbers low, so Sean the coordinator decides to whip them into shape by forming a football team. In hopes of the rate of boys who come back after being released decreases. One of the main actors for the movie is Dwayne Johnson who plays Sean Porter. Dwayne does an excellent job of playing a no nonsense attitude toward a bunch of egotistical boys. Another of the great actors in this movie is Jade Yorker who plays a boy named Willie Weathers. He does a fantastic job of showing how a kid can go from a troubled gang member to a team player. The third actor is Xzibit who plays as Malcom Moore, who is an assistant coach with some impressive persuasion skills. The second to last actor is Setu Taase who plays Junior, a kid who always fights and thinks he rules the hall. The last but not least actor I'm going to mention is Kelvin who is played by David V. Thomas, he is a very good actor who helps you get a good gist of what the kid is feeling at all times. Some of the things I liked in this movie was how The Rock no matter how hard it got and how tired the boys were he always pushed them to do their best and not to let other people's words get them down. Another like of mine is how they wanted to get the boys to be success full in their lives and to not go back onto the streets to their gangs, but to go out and go to college and make something of themselves. One of my dislikes for this movie is how it took them so long to find a school to play them. Another one of my dislikes is how they shot one of the possible main characters within the first few scenes. The theme I got from the story was that you shouldn't let peoples opinion of you define who you are. I learned that no matter how tough your past was you can always make a better life for yourself. I think other people will pull multiple things from this movie but they will see how showing compassion for someone who has never felt it can help make them see better of themselves. I think the people who should see this film would be teenagers and adults who like to see change in a person, along with being a sports person without minding profanity. The only reason I would not recommend this story is the fact of someone not being a football fan. The rating I would give it is 4.5 stars because I am not much of a football fan. Bre is a junior in High School and likes to do color guard in the marching band. She likes to read and cook in her free time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gridiron gangThe film is about a man, a possible coach, who worked in the prison pear that all inmates who are about to leave reinvent society. The idea of this man is making a football team to reinvent faster without having any problem with the lei, order and society. The biggest problem with this idea is that when gathers the boys needed to form the team, many of them do not get along, or are of different bands. The worst of them is second, because in the film explains that one of the guys who are there, killed a family of another boy what is on the same computer. Seeing that you are together in the same team is trying to kill to defend his honor to the band. The coach takes the view that wrong, grabs and told that if they do not take well to get out of prison, there will never be. At these words the boys try to get along to get out. In any case the film is about this team of football becomes the best teams from all over USA. To me, the film seems to me that wants to represent many of the things that often go between bands, partly symbolizes the respect they have for people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GRIDIRON GANG Cast: Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Xzibit, Leon Rippy, Jade Yorker, Setu Taase, Trevor O'Brien, David Thomas Director: Phil Joanou Review: Phil Joanu makes Gridiron Gang an exciting football movie. This action/drama is based on the true story of Sean Porter. There are a number of shocking twists &amp; turns in this movie. When a teammate has some trouble during a football game with other gang members, Willie faces some growing emotions. Other players face some of their own turning points. There were several stand-out roles for me in this movie. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson portrayed Sean Porter very well. He did a good job acting this role. Jade Yorker as Willie Weathers also did a great job in this role. He showed a lot of different emotions. This movie at 125 minutes long is a reasonably good length. Phil Jonau was right on with the details of this movie. The football was action was realistic. I give Gridiron Gang a 10 star rating. It was a very captivating heart pumping movie. There were many emotional scenes</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I. The gridiron gang was a movie about some kids at a juvenile detention center &amp; 1 or 2 of the staff members there, 1 of the staff members forms a football team.A. The gridiron gang came out in IX/XV/MMVI. B. The name of the director is Phil Joanou. C. The names of the lead actors are; Dwayne Johnson, Xzibit, Kevin Dunn, &amp; Leon Rippy D. The genre of gridiron gang is drama/ crime fiction/ sports. II. I noticed that 1 of the characters shot his dad, or somebody who was being mean to a lady. I have also noticed that he changed in the movie because he tried to help 1 of his 'enemies'.E. Really the only things that stuck out to me were that guy getting shot. The football player getting shot, &amp; the kids pulling those guys into the pool. F. The pattern that I noticed was that the kids kept losing the football games. III. It left the impression of you can't do that at the football shooting scene, like a 'that's not right feeling' G. The movie wasn't slow, maybe not fast, but not that slow. overall it was a good movie, I would say that it is worth some of your time.</fullReview>

He ended up shooting his moms boyfriend. This happened because the guy was going to beat his mom. Then he went to jail. Then while he was in jail they started a football team which would change these kids life. This movie is an action/ family movie. This movie was very entertaining. It was a surprise when the kid got shot and his rival gang member ran by his side to help him. The characters in this movie are roger, Shawn, Jr, Malcom, Willie, Paul, baits, eaves, and bug. The people who play them are very good actors and they had to work hard to be in and get ready for this movie. The movie was long but it was engaging and it keeps you wanting to watch .I rate this movie at an 8. I choose an 8 because it could have been more dramatic put over all it was a great, exciting movie and I thing you should watch it.</fullReview>

Or you're an ignorant white guy who doesn't want to see people on screen who aren't like him. Either way - you stink to high heaven of a very bitter individual. It turns my stomach when I see reviews like his, filled with such hate - and for movies that are clearly better than your average film. And in this case, a lot better. The fact that you kept coming back to make your hateful comments tells me everything.I hope people don't get turned off by reading that guy's comments.

		<fullReview>In 1991,the documentary Gridiron Gang told the story of an employee of the Center of Juvenile Detention of Los Angeles who decided to create a programme of American football to positively canalize the energy of the young prisoners and their own auto esteem.Fifteen years later of that documentary,the Hollywood movie of that true event was made and the result is not a memorable film but at least,it's entertaining.On the main character,we have Dwayne ''The Rock'' Johnson,a wrestler who successfully made the transition to a Hollywood star.He really shows a lot of charisma on Gridiron Gang and he expresses really well some emotions from his character.I really got surprised when I noticed Phil Joanou was the director of this movie.Joanou is known for making complex films (like Final Analysis,State of Grace or Heaven's Prisoners) and I think he did a very good work in Gridiron Gang.Thanks to his solid direction,the movie gets a good level of dramatic weight.But,in the only field he failed was in the sportive scenes and it's easy to note he does not have any practice for directing that kind of scenes.I felt that scenes pretty rigid and,when I was seeing them,I really missed the demential and frenetic scenes Any Given Sunday had.Or,thinking it well,it was maybe Joanou's intention to do them like that because we are not seeing professional competences,but inexpert young people with more enthusiasm than talent for the football.The supporting cast made a good work.Jade Yorker gets a good lovel of emotional deepness and XZibit brings a serious and solid performance.There is not anything memorable in Gridiron Gang but I have to admit I had a good time watching it.I recommend it with the warning that the film is nothing special but it is entertaining.</fullReview>

The sports team movie, where different characters come together to build a team. So you get the clichés here, as they're called, which you've seen in other movies too. Is this a bad thing? That's up to you to decide! Xzibit does a nice supporting role job here, but the real treat/attraction lies in the hands of Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson! He's believable and gritty enough for you to feel for his passion and his goals. Speaking of gritty, the movie is shot in a way that accentuates the whole point of the movie. The point is (as said before), if you can deal with that!</fullReview>

First of all having the Rock in the movie people, including me would have thought that it would have to have some kind of action in it to be good but it had zero action (at least the type the Rock usually does) and mostly drama which, in this case, is a good thing because it was a great movie. Shows the juvenile system and what can be done as a solution to the rates of people going back to prison once their out of juvi. The movie shows the Rock as a great actor, i knew he wasn't a bad actor from before but this movie proved that he was a good actor and that he can do dramas, and do them well in fact. Awesome inspiring movie and there are tearjerker moments too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to drama's based on true story I am always hesitant to watch! Because most of the time it is over dramatic and simplified! "Gridiron Gang" however is none of these things! It touches the melodrama but in this case it helps the movie! First I thought it was to good to be true,but then I saw some footage from the real Sean Porter and it happens to be true! They actually recreated many scenes that is shown in the documentary based on Sean Porter and his work! This is proof that real life is much more dramatic and that Hollywood doesn't need to exaggerate this all the time! The performances were solid! "The Rock" and Xzibit show that they can act! I do think that "The Rock" is capable of more serious acting but that we will have to see in later projects! He does have a presence in this movie that viewers can't ignore! People who liked "Remember the Titants" will also like this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>t's difficult to truly knock Dwayne Johnson--he currently shuns the name that begat his celebrity, The Rock, in favor of his birth name--for taking the pledge of serious actordom. After all, when any highly bankable actor makes such a decision--not to be confused with the comedy-to-drama crossover--isn't it more admirable than the alternative of staying the same, finance-driven course? Alas, however, Gridiron is absolutely not a serious actor's vehicle. Johnson has a few surprisingly tender close-ups, but most scenes feature him from afar, shouting his best chest-bump voice. Xzibit, attempting another kind of crossover (rapping to acting), is in almost every scene yet says almost nothing. Maybe the best performance comes from youngster Jade Yorker, who plays the team's hotheaded star.Yorker's emotional range (and shirtless prancing...for the ladies) makes him one to keep an eye on in the future.</fullReview>

Friday night lights ended badly but then you understood the way the team came together in that movie too. Gridiron Gang is a great story to tell, especially because of the juvenile delinquents involved. Coming from a criminology major in college this shows people that these delinquents are like a lot of others, they can become good people if they are treated the right way.

'The Rock' Dwayne Johnson plays the perfect part in this film as the detention centre officer/coach with addition of Xibit. It shows you different cultures, ethnic minorities and gang members coming together as one, as a team called the Mustangs. This film shows so much hatred between gang members and when you see these young men coming together like a band of brothers it just goes to show what teams sports does for people. If you like coach carter you will certainly like this! This film is based on a true story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this film was well executed from start to finish, and I am glad Dwayne (the Rock) is doing these sort of films now and at 34 years will not be type casted. Xzibit also did very well in this film. You were able to relate well to the characters and even better to the story. After watching your left with a warm feeling inside. Even watching the real life footage at the very end gives you the feeling that sometimes a little change can turn into a raging success with the right time and commitment. Thank you Seen Potter for your life story and I think I'm going to start on my autobiography right now. In closing a big shout out to the Rock for in my opinion being the best wrestler to turn Hollywood ever but I guess its all acting anyway, so maybe it wasn't as big a change as it sounds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>enjoyable movie, excellent performance by The Rock (possible end spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get the most surprising thing out the way first. Yes, The Rock can act. He's completely stole Be Cool from all the major actors, and has shown in movies like The Rundown (Welcome To The Jungle, in the UK) he can be funny too.As for the movie?I'm a sucker for movies like this, where a coach has to put together a team from nobodies, or criminals, or from a gym (Dodgeball!). I like movies like Remember The Titans, Necessary Roughness, Major League, Best Shot (Hoosiers in the US I think). Yes, there are some bad ones in the genre, but on the whole they're not bad.Here it's young offenders, that society has basically written off, given a chance to get out of their old lives by playing American Football. As is the norm in movies like this, there are players who have hidden talents, moments where everything looks like falling apart, tragedy, injuries, last minute heroics, all the clichés you'd expect from this kind of movie.However, all the actors do well, but credit must go to Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. Best known as a wrestler turned actor, he shows here that he can act too. As I said at the start, he easily stole Be Cool a couple of years back, and here, holds the film together. And all credit to him for trying something different, instead of simply doing action movies,which I'm sure he's offered all the time.The director, Phil Joanou, does a good job with the football sequences and a couple of action moments near the start. The writer, Jeff Maguire, although occasionally going for big emotional moments, has written a good script giving enough depth to the major characters.Although I knew before I went in it was based on a true story, I'd never heard of it before (in a similar way to Coach Carter - also good). As such, the final moments of the movie, that reveals the fate of the main characters the movie follows, is touching, and sadly also shows that you can't save everyone from themselves.. or their pasts.Still as a movie it is very enjoyable, with good performances all round, but again special mention to The Rock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie for teens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is one of the best movies that shows no matter what has happened in the past, nothing is impossible.The movie shows what a lot of teens have to endure in a lot of places, the constant struggle of gangs is something that is a problem everywhere, and to show what people can do when they work together and have the discipline to give it all they got and succeed at something, is one of the most powerful messages in the world today.Gridiron Gang is a very good movie in that it shows teens facing some big obstacles while at the same time showing that even the biggest obstacles can't stand in the way of will power and teamwork.I give this movie a 10/10 cause I think it deserves a rating higher than what it has at the time of this comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a mother of a 16 year old boy and former upper elementary school teacher I highly recommend parents of teens to watch this movie with their kids and after it's over sit down and talk with them about the lesson in life that this story is showing us. It teaches us about self disciple, self control, self pride, forgiveness, compassion, and many, many more. I'm not a fan of football and don't even know all the rules of the game but it didn't matter with this movie, it's not just about football. The Rock is awesome, this (I feel) is one of his best performances. I couldn't imagine a better actor for this type of movie. GREAT GREAT LESSON IN LIFE!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The football field builds confidence and self reliance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an uplifting true story about a frustrated juvenile probation officer,Sean Porter(Dwayne"The Rock" Johnson), who believes in second chances. He and his co-worker Malcolm(Xzbit)think that playing football may just be the best chance at helping incarcerated young men find some redemption. Porter desperately wants to teach discipline and responsibility through the game of football. The challenge is getting a team organized and ready to play in just four weeks before the season starts. Then comes frustration in finding high school teams to play. Soon the players become competitive, build character and find respect for each other...no matter what neighborhood or race they belong.I find this one of The Rock's better roles, he actually comes across genuine. Others in the cast: Jade Yorker, Mo, Trevor O'Brien, Jamal Mixon, Jurnee Smollett and Leon Rippy. GRIDIRON GANG is gritty and inspirational.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gridiron Gang (2006) Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Xzibit, L. Scott Caldwell Director: Phil JoanouReview: Phil joanou had done another great movie for all of us and put it on DVD and the big screen for all of us too watch. He used actors to play as real people in the movie as they did in real life. Dwayne Johnson played his role really good and he knows what he is doing because he played football in high school. All though it is all about juveniles that where gang members and turned a lot of them to really good people and changed their lives but some of them did not change. All were really good at football and it helped them take their minds off their gang habits and put their anger on something else and to help them control their anger. They lots of workouts in the hot and burning sun.They have gained a lot of mussels from all the workouts and all the training .And this is also a good movie because it is all based on a true story. I think they did really good playing there parts in the movie. They did their parts really well because they made it look real and amusing and they make it look like it is happing right dead in there. This movie is an action and a drama it is an action because of all the activates and stuff, and it a drama because of the all the fights and death and crying. But at the end they are all there for each other and they start to become friends and give each other some respect. And they started playing as a team and getting along as a family.All and all it was a good movie and I recommend everyone too watch it and learn from it and to do great things with your life that you will enjoy and have fun with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gridiron Gang (2006) Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Xzibit, Jade Yorker, and L. Scott Caldwell Director: Phil Joanou Genre: action and a dramaShawn Porter (Dwayne Johnson) was a guard at a juvenile jail. A lot of people have given up on this group of boys but Shawn has not. He wanted to take them and turn them in to winners. Most of the boys were in gangs and did drugs. Shawn wanted to get them out of the gang life and help them make something out of their lives.I think Jade Yorker did a great job playing Willie Weathers. He was emotional and a great football player. He surprised me when he saved Kalvin's life. Dwayne Johnson was good at playing Shawn Porter the coach, and a guard at the juvenile jail. L. Scott Caldwell was good at playing Shawn Porter's mother. Her character encouraged all the boys to do better. Willie Weathers made his touch down for Shawn's. Mother. Rate: 9 because his mom died and it would have been better if she lived. Length: The film was 125 minutes long but kept my interest the whole time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a must watch movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gridiron Gang is a movie about how to change people's lives. Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) plays as a juvenile officer. The kids in the jail are kids who come from bad history, from killing people to stealing. Dwayne Johnson takes these kids and brings them together as one family all from the simple sport of football. The Gridiron Gang was an action filled movie, but can also go under a family movie.This movie had a lot of twist and turns. It gave you a "don't hit pause" outlook. Once you started you couldn't stop. Dwayne played a big part in showing how much work it was to change your life around. But in the end it would all be worth it.Willie Weathers (Jade Yorker) started out at the beginning in a gang with his cousin getting killed, and him going home and shooting his moms boyfriend. Kelvin Owens (David Thomas) from a different gang as Willie, actually they were worst enemy's at the beginning but by the end they were almost brothers. Junior Palaita (Setu Taase) got hurt at practice one day and they all came together as one to help him and make sure he was okay, and many other wonderful actors all came together as one big winning family at the end of this movie.Hate long boring movies? Good, me to. The Gridiron Gang is a movie full of engaging events. Like I said before once you start this movie you're going to want to finish it. It's not too long and it's not too short, where it keeps you hanging. It has just enough information to get the point across and to leave you in a good action-filled movie.Of course I'll be rating this movie at a 10! I'm going to rate The Gridiron Gang at a 10, because it plays a big role and how to change your life, but how difficult it can and will be. But, with a little support it's possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on true events. A counsellor of a juvenile detention centre, tries to help kids with 'Football' in order to give them a path other than the one that leads them to Prison or the mortuary.This film has been panned by critics, and didn't make much of a splash, but it in my opinion it is more than a 'Feel-ood' movie, its an inspirational story.It's based on true life which makes it even more inspiring...Dwayne Johnson also known as Rock to the millions...provides a satisfactory performance as the coach. I found the sudden 'Drive-by's' quite shocking..That in a place like America, this kind of violence happens....The other supporting actors provide good performances that keep the story going and their unique battles..I loved the scene when Dawnye Johnson inspires his team, by giving them a speech and for a moment I thought...'The Rock is here.'...Otherwise a good solid story..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie fell short of the goal line that is my expectations. I thought this was going to be the perfect pump up movie to watch the night before my own football training camp, but I was mistaken. Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson was okay as Sean Porter, and although I do agree that he took the real Sean Porter's words and seemed to make them his own, He lacked the acting skills needed to give motivational speeches such as one's given in Remember The Titans (Denzel Washington) or Friday Night Lights (Billy Bob Thorton). The actual playing scenes were not too great either, I mean they make High School Football seem much more barbaric than it actually is. With a combination of the added "crash" sound effects and the added grunts, I was not sure whether I was watching A movie about High School Football or The XFL. In the End, I would still recommend this film to someone I knew because although there are bits and pieces missing to make it an excellent overall film, it is still one of the greatest Coming of Age tales of the year</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock was pretty good and believable in this movie. He plays a football coach over a group of young delinquents whom have done everything from stealing cars to killing a man. These are troubled teens and most of them are involved in gang life. This is basically their last chance before doing hard time behind bars. Coach Porter starts a football team to teach the kids discipline and respect for each other. At first, they slack off, but soon they begin to care. The first game turns out disastrous for them. But, they learn to congeal together and soon field a good team. Along the way, they learn to let go of their hate and gang ties. Several kids get center attention as cases Coach Porter really works on.The movie is moving and makes you want to route for the kids. The Rock plays his role well and he does more than just read lines. Plus, the story was just good.FINAL VERDICT: A good movie to watch even if you don't particularly care for sport films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inspirational Film About Overcoming Obstacles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to lie to you. This film is heavily clichéd. Somehow though it still managed to strike some nerve in me. Some parts of it I've felt like I'd seen but others shocked me because of how uncliched and down to earth realistic they were.I think you know the general plot of the movie. Teenagers in a juvenile school/camp get the opportunity to play football because they think it will give them a chance at success after they're released. The man in charge of the team is played by the Rock, and he does a fine job as the coach. I really can't think of anybody, based on this script, that could have done a better job in the role. He brings realism and fun to the character, and just the slightest bit of depth lacking from his previous roles.The film is beautiful to look at despite the shaky-cam. The score however I felt dragged the film down. It's the cliché sports-film music. I think a lot more or at least something different could have been done.Overall this is a pretty good film. Oscars? No way. Box office hit? Eh, debatable. Probably will go down with Invincible. Popular with the general public? I think it will be because even though at times it feels so generic and cliché, after those times it feels real.I give it a 6.7/10 and is probably my favorite Rock movie yet.

The characters made the movie not only serious, but funny. It's so sad that there are really young men and women out there who are into gang violence and commit many crimes. This movie helps the audience see that if in their hearts, anyone can change their ways and make their lives better. What makes it even more interesting is the fact that it is based on a true story of real young men who had attended a juvenile facility where the correctional officers formed a football team and some of the juveniles were able to play. It tells at the end where these young men ended up after being released. It was awesome!!!</fullReview>

The rock was also good; he has come along way from where he started in The Mummy Returns.This movie was very emotional, at some points I was almost crying and then laughing. Some points in the movie I was screaming, sitting straight up in my chair holding my hands over my mouth cause I couldn't believe what had just happened.

		<fullReview>To be fair I would probably have loved this film when I was 6 or 7 years old. However, with the violence and profanity this clearly wasn't intended to be for children, which leads to the depressing conclusion that this pile of drivel was actually supposed to entertain adults. The entire plot is utterly shallow cheese but might have been at least bearable as mindless viewing were it not for the music. Was the composer trying to break the world record for number of "uplifting" crescendoes in a film? They are relentless - if someone makes a cup of tea, there's a massively overblown moving "Saving Private Ryan"-type epic musical motif to accompany it. The composer is either having fun at the plot-writer's expense, or is the worst composer ever to score a film.</fullReview>

Thomas, Setu Taase, Mo McRae, James Earl, Trever O'Brien, Brandon Smith, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Michael J. Pagan, Jamal Mixon. Director: Phil Joanou Synopsis: Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson stars as Sean Porter the head coach of the Mustangs and a Guard at Camp Kirtpatrick. This movie is about Change and that with football and help almost all these kids turned their lives around for good. Review: The Rock brings an element to this film because he played football at Miami in college. So if you ask me he is a perfect fit for the role. The movie is great because first off it is based on a true story. Also the fact that it shows these kids and coaches progress not only as a team but also as people. Willie weathers who was played by Jade Yorker. Jade did an amazing job he made you feel like you honestly knew Willie. The entire cast did an awesome job doing their part in this movie everything from the heartbreaking moments of the game to death of Sean's mother. This film showed much heartbreak weather from losing or from illness to even death. These men struggled their way to the top as they went form losers in jail to winners on the field and off the field. The film showed a lot of football which made a lot sense to me because the movie its self was about a football team. Although the movie was good, it should have showed more of the jail side of things. This movie is an action drama. Action because it was tons of contact but it drawled you in at times almost like you personally knew the kids in the movie. The move never had a boring movie and you never really had a feel for what would happen next. At 125 minutes if you ask me it could have been a lot longer and would not have hurt the movie at all. I would rate this film a 10 out 10 because, the movie made me feel like it was occurring right in front of me as if I was in the stands watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Porter is a man who wants to make a difference. He's the head counselor at Camp Kilpatrick, a youth detention center that houses groups of violent, street-tough miscreants who are victims of their own recidivism. Despite their reputation as outcasts and losers, he believes in their ability and helps them build their self-esteem by playing together as a football team. Can he succeed? Inspired by a true story the subject matter is familiar, but The Rock brings intensity to his role as the incomparable Porter, aided by a strong young cast, and there are occasionally poignant moments that effectively explore the pros and cons of the juvenile justice system. If you think about it, this is really just a hybrid of Dangerous Minds and Remember the Titans, but it's still meaningful for what it is. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many films dealing with American Football, this was one of the better ones but still a few problems existed. First of all the good:The Rock and Xzibit's acting was well done and the 'Rock' gave his all in his role. The story was good and very emotional. For once there was a lot more football shown than we are usually given in a movie like this.The bad: At times the emotional content of the film was overused and combined with the music and acting....on more than one occasion I thought 'The Rock' and Xzibit would say I love you guys...to the team. As usual we never see the final game being played....cmon how many movies like this do we see where they get to the final only for them to lose and we don't see them playing.Overall though better than expected and well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something like Invincible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The spate of "documentary" sports stories in the last couple of years has represented all levels of games from high school (Gridiron Gang, Heart of the Game, Remember the Titans, and Friday Night Lights), to college (Glory Road), to professional (Invincible), to Olympics (Miracle), and even to Paralympics (Murderball). So trying to say something new about the recent Gridiron Gang is as tough as playing that hardscrabble high school football for convicts.The Rock plays Sean Porter, a forgiving but tough counselor/coach for a team of teenage delinquents, one of whom, Willy, has murdered his step-father. Sean's mantra is best expressed in his first speech to the team: "Everybody listen up. The Gridiron is a football field. On the Gridiron, we do it my way, not your way. Your way got you here. Whatever gang you claim, whatever hood you're from, this is your hood now." Well, although I'm not sure it's good to compare an urban war zone to a correctional institute, the speech reveals an overall soft, almost na?ve, view of teenage violence. The hood indeed comes to the institute.It's not that you need to know the outcome for this hostile crew, but you can guess that the Rock is effective, given his inhuman physique and killer smile. If there is a surprise, it's that the going itself is unHollywood difficult, with few victories and much interference from outside gangs, who like to settle scores for their incarcerated members, adding another layer to Rock's responsibilities. In fact, the depiction of gunfights in the hood is realistic enough to compete with the action on the field. In this way, Gridiron is something like Invincible, starring Mark Wahlberg as Vince Papale, in which Papale has no easy time making the Eagles, enduring their vigorous training, or winning games.It's good to emphasize in film the importance of cooperation and heart; recent sports films have done better than most in showing that spirit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A career in corrections is often a thankless job. Dealing with the worst of society's offspring, its no wonder that 75% of juvenile delinquents end up as repeat offenders back in the system. A sobering statistic that inspired juvenile corrections officer Sean Porter to become proactive. His plan was to give focus and dignity to a completely forgotten demographic.Gridiron Gang is based on the true story of Porter's first football team. He wasn't coaching trained athletes, and his players' parents weren't on the sidelines. There were no scholarships at stake or academic probations to worry about. He was coaching gangbangers and murderers in a low security juvenile facility with nothing to lose and everything to gain.If Remember the Titans and The Longest Yard had a baby?it would be Gridiron Gang. The film had the warmth and heart of Titans with the basic premise of the Longest Yard. We all love an underdog story and what's buried deeper than a group of antisocial teenagers playing football for the first time in their lives.Of course films like this have their share of corny scenes?the Rock attempted tears (unsuccessfully) in two of them. But the film will make you cheer and might make you cry.Standout performance by newcomer Jade Yorker. He's a face to watch?he's got something.</fullReview>

A little more of that would have been a good way to bring you into the characters and where their from. I don't think we got to know the characters as much as the movie makers wanted us to.

		<fullReview>Okay, I was forced to watch this movie in order to teach a lesson of respect. Although I admit the movie does have good lessons for respect, you have to torture yourself to get to them.First of all, I'll say that if you are a fan of sappy movies that don't take much thinking, you will probably like this movie.If you are the kind of person who has Citizen Kane as one of your favorite movies, you will hate this movie.This movie pulls out EVERY sports cliché in the book except a soundtrack that included Queen. Of course there's a terrible display of personal struggle. Right away we're thrown into the life of a prison guard (whose name I still don't know) who randomly decides he wants to start a football team. Why does he want to do this? Who knows? We find out his cousin was killed or something, but since we knew his cousin for about 2 seconds, we don't care. He doesn't even seem to be upset about it. That leads us to his cousin's friend, another character who I didn't even bother to learn the name of. This kid is basically a brain-dead gang banger who kills his mother's boyfriend (I'm assuming) because he abuses her. This teen is supposed to be the main character of the movie, next to The Rock, but there are no redeeming qualities about him. He's a rude, gang obsessed, thick-headed jerk who isn't even good at football because he's so weak.This reminds me of my next point. This movie definitely seems like it was going to be about an hour long, but they decided they wanted a two hour movie. They repeat the same subplot of one of the children "not giving up street life" yet. I swear, about 8 times one of the characters freaks out so that The Rock can spend 10 years it seems talking to them. Also, half the movie must be in slow motion. I don't think there was one scene of football playing where literally everything was in slow-mo.In addition, the acting was mediocre at best. The Rock wasn't too bad, considering most of the faults in his lines are in the awful script that I think was written by fictional sports movie writers FROM THE WORLD OF A SPORTS MOVIE. I'd say the best played roles in this film are from the rival gang member in the prison, and the main character's fellow gang member. The main character's performance is so cheesy and obnoxious. Although, I am surprised Xzibit didn't win an Oscar from his fantastic reading of the bible verse to the Christian school coach (/sarcasm).In summary, this movie made me mad, really mad. I admit I wasn't feeling good entering this movie considering our choices were between this and Shawshank Redemption (I'm sure you can guess what movie I picked), but I usually try to give movies a fair chance, and this movie was really disappointing. This movie is incredibly boring, with literally half of it being totally removable, when at the same time, there's hardly any character development. All of the characters could have died in a nuclear explosion and I probably would have been happy, because they're all just annoying. I really don't understand how this movie obtained a 6.8 when every aspect about it just so terrible.Like I said, if you like cheesy sports films, go watch this movie because for every second that wanted to claw my eyes out and use them to clog my ears, you'll probably be holding back tears. Just please, don't come on this website and give it a positive review, we like to keep the site mostly for adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a bad movie but far from nice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can tell you. I thought that the rock was a good actor in this movie but I was appalled by the amount of violence in this movie and the amount of swearing that I heard come out of the mouths these kids and the rock! Xzibit barley spoke through the movie, he was just a tag on for sales but did great for what he was given. I think if we are going to let our 13 year old watch this film it might be a good thing if we told the parents that there kids are about to watch a movie with more swearing than I've heard in a long time. We should warn Christian's everywhere who thought this movie might be a nice movie like the rock has done in the past years. Yes things could been done with a lot less swearing I don't know the writer personally but I can assure you if I did he would have gotten his point across without all the swearing. It just means your actors sound more intelligent than back yard idiots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie, horrible language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will make you want to stand up and cheer, yell and just get excited. The only drawback to it was the language. It was beyond horrible. The actors did a great job of portraying what -I assume- life would be like in a situation like that of the young boys. It did make you realize how hard life can be for a lot of people. This movie will make you laugh, want to cry, and want to adopt the children. Its sad to think of things like this actually happening in life. It definitely needed the PG-13 rating because I don't think younger children should watch it simply because of the language. It is worth your money if you are older than 13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay...But Don't Waste Your Time Or Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gridiron Gang is about a bunch of felons at a juvenile detention center and how their camp officer Sean Porter (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson), and his friend Malcolm Moore (Xzibit) turn the teenage criminals into football players in a matter of weeks. Confronted with gang rivalries between his teammates, Porter attempts to teach the kids self-respect and responsibility. The rock tries really hard to be inspiring, but the fact is, he really isn't that good of an actor, neither is Xzibit, or anyone else in this movie for that matter. There's a good amount of football, shown in the movie, which I enjoyed, but off the field the movie dragged. The 'intense' gang rivalries weren't really that interesting, and seemed all too familiar. There are so many other football movies out there that are much better than this. I recommend watching Remember the Titans or Friday Night Lights. Both of those movies complete the job this movie tried really hard, but didn't succeed to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic Football Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No spoilers her, folks. It's not necessary. If you've seen any football movie, you'll know the exact ending within the first half hour. That's not saying The Rock didn't do a good job. He's a good actor when he's casted correctly. Playing the coach in this fits his personality perfectly. Mean, but loving. Crazy, but funny. It's a good film. The only thing I have against it is I tend to want more out of sports flicks. It seems every sports movie that comes out has the same way of getting through the story. Oh well, I'd say see this movie and form your own opinions. It's worth watching. Reminds me of Remember The Titans or The Longest Yard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie doesn't have much of a point. You've seen the same story countless other times, except this movie has even more than usual annoying glorifying, "we did it" music throughout.Also, the other movies were sort of uplifting. This is how this movie ends."So out of all the people on the team..about 10 have full paying jobs and 4 got to go play football for college! OH yeah, you're favorite little 8 year old character died in a drive by.. and 5 of the main characters went back to jail! That's a lot better than the shocking statistic we gave you in the beginning isn't it!" I will admit this movie had me laughing, but not at the right parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another football movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, all the world needed was another football movie. Especially one that has a story about a group of misfits who come together and become a great family and a great football team. Movies like Remember The Titans were good sports movies, but I think that the populace can take a break with these lame want-to-be-good sports movies. End of story. I repeat: All the world needed was another football movie. Especially one that has a story about a group of misfits who come together and become a great family and a great football team. Movies like Remember The Titans were good sports movies, but I think that the populace can take a break with these lame want-to-be-good sports movies. End of story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is something we hear about, everyday; Gangs, violence, crimes...etc. and there are millions of movies like this, thats why it is nothing special. and that is the problem. i also don't think they get any award for cinematography, its nothing else then in every football movie. u also could predict a lot of stuff, no surprises...and it doesn't get TOO emotional either, "The Longest Yard" for example was a lot better football movie, u had definitely more fun watching it. to be honest, one of the worst Dwayne Johnson movies yet... peace!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Funniest Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this movie on opening night, and I haven't been able to stop laughing since about 15 minutes into the movie. My friends and I were able to guess what was going to happen in this movie based solely on our knowledge of other sports dramas. We even nailed lines of dialog before they came up. The kicker, though, was how one actor would say something, which was then followed by at least three reaction shots and around 10 seconds of silence before somebody would say anything. I suggest seeing this film with a bunch of friends who enjoy laughing at movies that try to make you feel sentimental, it certainly helped my experience.</fullReview>
