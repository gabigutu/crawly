		<fullReview>Harry Potter is growing up! The voice is deepening, the shoulders are broadening and...hurray! You no longer feel like a creep for having a little crush on Daniel Radcliffe...whoops, did I say that out loud? Say what you will, I see him making the jump from child star to adult actor in a way that Haley Joel Osment only dreams of.Appropriately, this third film in the Harry Potter series has matured along with it's young stars. At first glance the storyline itself is relatively simple - Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison and young Harry is on his hit list. But the reality is that this movie is about being a teenager and all the trials and tribulations that go with it. On one level, Harry is like any other kid at school - he puts up with torment from bullies, gets into scrapes with his teachers and hangs out with his friends. But this is not just any school. This is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Harry has a whole OTHER set of problems. Like an escaped madman who may just want to kill him, for example.The plot contains the requisite amounts of twists and turns. The focus is on Harry's past - Sirius Black was his godfather but just may have been in league with he who's name cannot be mentioned. There is the usual game of 'are they or aren't they?' when it comes to deciding which characters are really the baddies. Alan Rickman continues to walk the finest of lines between good and bad with his marvelous performance as Professor Snape. Has there ever been a better match of actor and character? Snape shows again that, while he may take occasional delight in making his students' lives difficult, he does have their best interests at heart - like any good teacher. Other plot quirks worked well - I enjoyed the way the time travel angle was worked in and the map showing the location of everyone in Hogwarts was a delight.Visually, this is a much darker film and it is a sumptuous treat for the eyes. There is so much incredible detail in the sets that it's impossible to absorb it all in one sitting. All the staples from the other films are there - the paintings talk, the staircases move, ghosts roam the halls - watch out for the knights on horseback crashing through windows! The special effects are all top notch. A word of caution for any parents - there are some genuine scares here. The Dementors are particularly nasty, and I would certainly think twice about letting very young children watch this film. This is without even considering it's running time - two and a half hours - which is a very long time to expect some children to sit still.One of the most impressive things about this film is the way that the young cast are more sure of themselves. As Hermione, Emma Watson grated in the first film with her occasional woodenness. Pleasingly, she has grown into herself as an actor and her performance here is much more mature. A leading lady of the future, perhaps? Hermione is growing up and is tired of being taken for an irritating goody-two shoes know it all. Rupert Grint provides comic relief and Daniel Radcliffe gives an outstanding performance, considering the whole film rests on his shoulders. Harry is the hero - the audience needs to identify with him. By the end of this film teenage girls will want to take him home to mother, while their mothers will just want to take him home and adopt him!New cast members acquit themselves well. The role of Sirius Black was tailor made for Gary Oldman - he has a requisite creepiness with just a dose of humanity to bring the character to life. Daniel Thewlis is good as Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts master who takes Harry under his wing. Emma Thompson is amusing as a Divinination professor with bad eyesight. She can see into the future but can't tell which students are falling asleep in her class! Many have criticised Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore. While it's true that he is no Richard Harris, I personally was pleased that he didn't attempt to imitate his predecessor. Gambon is accomplished enough a performer to stay true to the character while at the same time putting his own stamp on it.Take away the magic and monsters, and what you have is a coming of age movie. Harry is forced to grow up and confront both his past and his future, and come to terms with the reality that he is no ordinary wizard. With the spectra of 'you know who' continuing to loom on the horizon, roll on film four!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a movie that captures the books' magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's anything this movie proves, it is the difficulty in separating the series from the demands of fans. This is clear just from hearing some of the comments. "Why didn't they identify the names on the Marauder's Map?" "Why wasn't the second Quidditch game shown?" "Why wasn't there more of Crookshanks the Cat?" By focusing on what the film didn't have, fans fail to look at the film on its own terms. I think this is by far the best Harry Potter movie yet.The only way to satisfy fans would be to include everything from the book, which would require a miniseries. Since that isn't what these films are, the story has to be abridged. The first two films tried to fit everything they could within a reasonable slot of time. The result was a set of films that felt cluttered yet incomplete. Had they continued with this strategy for this movie, based on a much longer book, it would surely have been over three hours long.The virtue of the latest film is that it makes a real attempt to adapt the story, not just marching in lockstep with the book's events. The screenplay is sparing, leaving out or simplifying loads of details not directly relevant to the plot. But it captures much of the book's delight and humor. The first two films fell short in this regard, because they lacked the guts to tinker with the details, even though that was the key to condensing the story while staying true to its spirit.The movie is still faithful to the book, of course. Many of the scenes are exactly as I had imagined them. When it deviates, it does so based on an understanding of the story and characters. This is evident in the way they show, for example, the Knight Bus; Hermione's overstuffed schedule; and the introduction of the Marauder's Map, a scene that captures the twins' mischievous personalities. The changes are clever and funny, and they help compensate for the movie's loss in other areas.Certainly this has something to do with the new director. Columbus's approach was to stick to the books as literally as possible, often draining them of their subtlety. For instance, where the books only hint that Dumbledore can see through the invisibility cloak, the earlier movies make it unmistakable. The new director never condescends to the audience in that way. This is a children's movie, but it is also a fantasy-thriller that we can take seriously, because not everything is spelled out for us. We're given a chance to think.But part of what makes the movie work is the book itself. The story is gripping from start to finish, because the threat looming over the school is established early on. Harry's personal life is sharply intertwined with the plot. We feel for him as we watch his disastrous (but hilarious) attempts to escape his uncle and aunt, and his humiliating reaction to the dementors. The story avoids common devices such as the talking killer or deus ex machina, which the other books have in abundance. The ending is nicely bittersweet and ambiguous. The plot is so complicated, however, that the book spends several chapters explaining it all. The movie wisely includes only very little of this, allowing the plot twists to become understood as the story progresses. I was surprised to see certain events that were in the movie but not the book lend support to an important theory some fans have had about what is to be revealed at the end of the series. Of course, it is well-hidden and won't give anything away for those who aren't looking for the clues.I was so satisfied with the film that it almost seems trivial to mention the flaws, but there are some. The portrayal of Fudge's assistant as the standard hunchbacked dimwit is out of place here, as it would be in anything other than a cartoon or spoof. The most serious misstep, though, is the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Gambon's face seems frozen in a perpetual nonexpression, and his voice lacks resonance. He compares poorly to the late Richard Harris, whose line readings had gravity, and who played the character with a twinkle in his eyes. It is a pure mystery to me why this actor was chosen as a replacement, especially considering the fine performances from other members of the cast. Even the children are in top form here.Those complaints aside, this is the movie I was hoping they would make when the series began. If it doesn't live up to the book, so what? What's important is that it lives up to its potential as a movie. Fans who want a carbon-copy of the book are looking in the wrong place, because they're never going to get it here. This is probably the best example of a Harry Potter movie that we're ever likely to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Harry Potter films so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third Harry Potter film is the best one yet. Director Alphonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien, A Little Princess) has taken over from Chris Columbus and has stuck less slavishly to the original JK Rowling Books.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are back as Harry, Ron and Hermoine, with Hermoine in particular getting to do a lot more. There are less Quidditch matches, and more menace, in keeping with the improved complexity of Rowling's third novel. Hogwarts is not safe, Draco Malfoy is no longer a menace, but just a pain in the ass. And the new CGI-scripted character Buckbeak the Hippogriff (half eagle, half horse) looks fantastic and has personality.The kids are all supposed to be thirteen but look older - hey we'll forgive them. Neville Longbottom has lost so much weight he's almost unrecognisable.Great performances from Emma Thompson hamming it up as the ditsy professor of foretelling, Prof Trelawny, Michael Gambon as the new Professor Dumbledore (not as magical but good), David Thewliss as Prof Lupin, and Gary Oldman as the Prisoner of Azkhaban.Thrilling, complex, menacing, ****/***** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new director who proves equal to the task.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alfonso Cuarón has taken the images conjured by J.K. Rowling's magical words and created from her book, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,' a film rife with visual symbolism and alive with inventive images beyond those established by the first two films in the series. Cuarón, a native of Mexico City and the acclaimed director of the completely compelling, frequently hilarious and sexually explicit coming-of-age film, 'Y tu mamá también,' was seen by many as an odd choice to follow heartland American Chris Columbus into the Harry Potter director's chair. The selection has resulted in a film darker and more mature than its predecessors, just as was the book, but it is also as approachable for young people as Cuarón's other internationally heralded work, 'A Little Princess.'It is late in the summer. Harry (a decidedly more assertive Daniel Radcliffe, making his third appearance in the leading role) is at the Dursleys in Privet Drive, preparing for his third year at Hogwart's, when an obnoxious relative demeans his father's memory, causing Harry to lose his temper. As a result, Harry violates the rules of student witches and wizards, causing the offending aunt to inflate as a dirigible and float away into the night sky on an stream of invectives. It is a delightful opening to a film with far more serious issues to explore and frightening obstacles to overcome. Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), imprisoned at Azkaban for complicity in the murder of Harry's parents, has escaped, and is looking for Harry. The soul-stealing prison guards called 'Dementors' (Latin for mind-removers) are searching for Black everywhere, but when he and Harry meet, there are revelations which change everything.The symbolism in the film is fascinating. Rowling is responsible for a lot of it, but Cuarón has used symbolism as a visual tool to alert the audience to impending danger and to keep tensions high. Traditionally, black-feathered birds such as ravens, crows, and vultures all have negative images associated with them; they are usually used to represent carnage, bloodshed and battle; they are thought of in terms of scavengers, messengers of the dead, and evil. Crows abound in this film, but Cuarón has extended their traditional roles, turning them into symbols of the Dementors, which fly around menacingly in black garments with feather-like hems. Even when the Dementors are out of sight (they are not allowed on the grounds of Hogwart's School) you can feel their presence in the crows.Rowling's most obvious use of symbolism is in the name she gives the escaped prisoner Sirius Black. Sirius is a star in the constellation Canis Majoris (in mythology, Canis Majoris is one of Orion's hunting dogs; the Greater Dog), the brightest star in the sky. So, Sirius is also called the Dog Star, and everyone knows that the dog is distinguished above all other inferior animals for intelligence, docility, and attachment to man. Would she give such a name, with all its implications, to a villainous character? Not likely. But she would give it to a wizard who could change into a dog.Among the new visual images are animal ghosts which wander the halls of Hogwart's Castle and the film's realization of Buckbeak the Hippogriff, like Sirius, falsely accused and condemned. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and all of the established characters return. Led by Harry, all the students have matured considerably, as you would expect of 13-year-olds; they are more independent and self assured, more emotionally developed and far less childlike in their reactions and bearing. Michael Gambon is new and effective as Aldus Dumbledore, following the death of Richard Harris. Emma Thompson is wonderfully wacky as Divination Professor Sybil Treelawney; who leaps from the pages of the book and onto the screen as if Rowling had written the character specifically for Thompson. Also new is Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Remus Lupin (David Thewles), who comes to Harry's aid in ways that might befit his Latin name. Remus was the brother of the founder of Rome. In mythology, he was nursed by a she-wolf; Lupin means wolf-like (wolf is Canis Lupis).The unheralded thread of creative continuity in this marvelous series, as it moves from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuarón to incoming director Mike Newell (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, now in production) is Screenwriter Steve Kloves. He and the producers have been true to Rowling's works and to Harry's fans, in ways that have always enhanced, not diminished, the author's incredible achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Of The Harry Potter Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was excellent....better than the first two Harry Potter movies combined and better than what has followed.. That's my feeling, and I'm still sticking to it.This was just great fun, right from the opening. In fact, the early bus scene is the best in the film. Overall, the movie didn't have as mean an edge to it as the others, although it has a number of scary moments (which might have warranted a PG-13 rating). That was fine with me. I got tired of the dark, nasty and/or annoying characters of the first two films, and especially the irritating blonde wise-guy kid. I give this major points for cutting his role down. Even Alan Rickman's character softens.In other words, there is no despicable villain to hate throughout the film, which I thought was refreshing. Instead, we just go through one adventure after another until the final surprise ending.Along the way are a lot of fun special effects and scenery, some humor (Emma Thompson is a hoot as an eccentric tea-leaf reader) and some fantastic 5.1 surround sound. I wish all the Harry Potter films were like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and Extraordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with previous Potter films, this one is wonderful. The mischievous trio are back in their third year at Hogwarts.Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a slightly different character in this film as the anger inside of him for what happened to his parents has grown over the years. This made, for me, the film much more enjoyable than the first and second.As one would no doubt assume, Gary Oldman's portrayal of the character Sirius Black is nothing less than perfect. However, Sirius Black seams an unlikely roll for the talented Oldman. I enjoyed him more in other films, such as 'The Professional' and 'Immortal Beloved'. Let us hope he has had the chance to 'play it up' a bit more in the much anticipated 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'.The original music of John Williams is more than I could ever hope to hear. It is absolutely splendid, making the film worth a listen even if you do not watch. Williams has created memorable compositions such as the theme music to 'Star Wars', 'Jaws' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.Overall, any age should enjoy this film. The visual effects are not the most spectacular I've seen, but fantastic enough to take your imagination away from the real world for 141 minutes. Even the closing credits are kind of cool.Now, go watch the film. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I love the new direction. The style fits the movie perfectly. I also think the kids acted much better in this one. I really hope they don't get rid of Daniel Radcliff, even if he does get too broad in the shoulders. You can't swap horses mid-stream. Also, did anyone recognize the kid who played Neville at first? The biggest problem that I had was that there were a lot of things the movie didn't explain, such as "Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs." I think that it may have been hard for those who hadn't read the book to understand. It also didn't show that Harry's Patronus was a stag, which I thought was important. And Harry's eyes aren't green (which is mentioned at least once in each book), but that's a minor thing. I felt that the style fits the book well. I go back and read the first book and think "Wow, how young they all are, how naive." The books age, and I think that comes out in this movie. I hope they continue to follow the same path.All in all, I loved the new direction and the movie itself. I can't wait 'till the next one comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abstract and dark themes abound; still the most mature HP entry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuarón's masterful adaptation does the source material immeasurable justice by exploring its underlying concepts in an intelligent manner. Of course, it certainly helps that the aesthetics of the film are incredible, the acting remains stellar (and the trio of young actors handle their roles admirably), and John Williams offers an amazing (and eclectic) score. Character development is superb - Steve Kloves penned a great script.First-time and young viewers will likely enjoy the film for its merits based on plot and 'adventure' alone, but it takes multiple viewings and a critical eye to enjoy the abstract ideas and nuances. Cuarón himself credited the source material as being laden with real-world issues: oppression, racism, loneliness, power, friendship, justice and so forth.This is the Harry Potter film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn't patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. For instance, the ending is bittersweet at best and retains a healthy amount of ambiguity.If you've never read the books or understood the acclaim of the series as a whole, watch Cuarón's 'Prisoner of Azkaban' and you'll understand why this entry is clearly the zenith of the seven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, quirky and utterly gorgeous - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're anti-Potter you owe it to yourself to see this film. Get past the issues you might have with the immense hype around the franchise and sit down for two hours to be captivated by this creepy, quirky and beautiful film. If you're a Potter-fan and you're unhappy with the film, the novel is probably on the table in front of you and you're better off reading it again. This is a wonderful film despite your expectations or opinions as to how it 'should have been done'.This review contains spoilers pertaining to the novel version of The Prisoner of Azkaban; if you haven't read the book, you have been warned.What makes this film work far more than the previous films are three key aspects - the acting, the screenplay, and the production design/cinematography - and all of them I credit directly to Cuaron's new vision. Suppsedly it was Cuaron's work on A Little Princess that won him the gig to direct this film, but I would honestly say that Y Tu Mama Tambien is equally if not more to credit. While he doesn't get the caliber of Tambien's performances in the young Potter stars, Cuaron does far better than his predecessor Chris Columbus. Most importantly, this film features a far more relaxed performance from Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter. His confidence, surely thanks to Cuaron's demonstrated ability to direct young actors, lets him speak and react in a far more genuine manner than we saw in the previous films and helps the film enormously. Hopefully Dan continues to improve with each film.With the more assured Radcliffe able to hold a scene together, Rupert Grint matches him admirably. Having been relieved of the Culkin Syndrome he was afflicted with in the first two films (the fault of Columbus, no doubt), he brings a more entertaining and believable Ron to the screen; both a joker and a noble soul as he is portrayed in the novels. It's wonderful to see that Grint has a genuine sense of comedy about him, and has made Ron more than the one-dimensional, face-pulling joke Columbus would have him. Emma Watson holds her own with the boys, giving a fantastic performance, and importantly bringing a lot of needed emotion to the central characters. Hermione now feels like the glue in the trio rather than the outsider.The new Dumbledore is a little uncomfortable, simply for the fact that he has a very small role in the film, and we don't have enough time to entirely digest this new portrayal. Richard Harris brought a wise kind of grace to the character, but perhaps in his physical state the character did come across as a little too frail. There is nothing wrong with Michael Gambon in this role, and I believe with his increased parts in the next film he will prove to be a satisfying replacement. I was wary of casting for Remus Lupin, one of my favourite characters of the novels, but David Thewlis makes this role his own with a delightful portrayal. Likewise, Oldman is perfectly cast as Black.There are edits and reshuffles with regard to the Azkaban's story compared to the book, both in terms of how the story fits together, and what information from the overall seven novel arc is in the film. I don't see how these changes matter much, the identity of the Marauders will undoubtedly be revealed, and potentially in a fashion that has a greater impact than it did in the novels. The reshuffling improves the pace in a huge way compared to the Columbus films which were quite plodding in parts because of their tenacious grip on remaining accurate to the novels. The dialogue is similar to the previous films. The "sudden" ending is satisfying enough; there really isn't any need for the over-done end of year banquet scenes, and seeing Harry happy at the end of the film is all I think we need.Some have complained that the continuity between the first two films and the third one has been spoiled by changes in the production design. I really can't see the problem here, the look of Hogwarts is far more immersive and emotive in Azkaban than it was in either The Philosopher's Stone or The Chamber of Secrets. Cuaron brings a twisted visual style to the screen and draws on his Mexican heritage to add further layers of interest to the look of the film. He could be called overly indulgent, but rather than being distracting, these additions simply bring more life to the screen, making Azkaban a gorgeously vibrant film. The production design is simply oozing with the filmmaker's obvious delight in creating the creepy magical atmosphere that this darker story requires. If after all that you still can't accept the changes to the production design, think simply of this; "The stairs like to change". If the stairs at Hogwarts like to change, why not the rest of it? It is a magical place, after all.The cinematography though, is what makes the film so beautiful. There's barely a shot in the film which isn't utterly gorgeous. The scenes of the Dementors floating outside Hogwarts are inspired, the moonlight scene after the return from the Shrieking Shack, the flight scenes with Buckbeak, the first Dementor scene on the train; all are captured beautifully and put Columbus with his squeaky clean vanilla take on everything in first two films to shame.This film was one of the highlights out of Hollywood in the last year. It's, dare I say it, compelling and well acted in a beautifully realized and shot fantasy world. You owe it to yourself to see it once; and if you're a fan holding a grudge, maybe you should give it another try.And pray to your Gods that George Lucas never gets his hands on the reigns to a Potter film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film isn't all that I'd hoped it would be, I believe that it was the best of the three 'Harry Potter' films so far, thanks largely due to director Alfonso Cuaron. In 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban', the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry's parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry.The child acting in this film has improved slightly with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint probably faring the best in comparison to their young co-stars. Although he is lumbered with a Ron who has once again been reduced to a comic character, it's a sign of Grint's abilities that he does well without looking embarrassed or too clownish. Dan Radcliffe was still very poor, obviously struggling to portray Harry's darker emotions in a manner that isn't wooden and awkward and and this was very apparent in the scene where he makes an atrocious effort to cry when he finds out his godfather had betrayed his parents to their deaths. while Tom Felton was let down by poor scripting of Draco.The adult cast were excellent. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were perfectly cast. Lupin was soft yet stern when needed and you could feel there was a parental rapport between him and Harry, and I couldn't imagine anyone other than David Thewlis in the role. And Gary Oldman was great in depicting Black's determination, mingled with an hysterical madness due to his incarceration in the hellish wizarding prison Azkaban. As for Michael Gambon, who was recast in the role of Dumbledore, I felt he was an improvement. Richard Harris was a gifted actor but his Dumbledore had a cold, aloofness to him whereas Gambon was able to portray the warm, eccentricity of the character without diminishing the power and wisdom of Dumbledore. And the rest of the regular cast, such as Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith, were perfect although we expect no better from them now!One of the best aspects of this film is how it no longer pandered to kiddies like the previous two films did. There was a darker, moodier edge to the story and the characters. The wizarding world no longer seemed like a perfect haven and the characters had grown beyond being innocent children; this reflected the book itself since many feel PoA was a turning point in the series where it finally felt like Harry Potter- boy and book- were growing up. The Hogwarts' setting differed from the previous films yet not only was it definitely more faithful to the books but finally it felt as if the castle was in Scotland rather than perpetually sunny Disney Land and this enhanced the mood being set in the film. The clock was a nice touch, linking to the theme of time in the actual storyline, as was the bridge in being a place for Harry to mull over his problems. Also, in many ways, this film could have ended up a muddled mess in regards to the ending but Cuaron handled the Time Turner scenes well.However, there were flaws to the film, which let it down. The characters of Hermione and Draco were poorly scripted so they seemed like two completely different characters from the ones we know and love in the books. Although Watson as an actress has improved since CoS, the main problem with the script is that Hermione is being portrayed as being too cool and cocky compared to the bookworm who has no interest in fashion that we know Hermione to be in the books. Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter who admits he's responsible for the change, really needs to learn heroines don't need to be cool Buffy types to be admired; part of why Hermione is so popular as a character in the books is that she appeals to girls who are bookish themselves and easily identify with her. And as for Draco, he comes across as too much of a cowardly, weak girlie-boy rather than an insidious, vicious brat who can be a threat to Harry when he chooses to. Also, there was no telling of what Black did to Snape in school that left him so bitter in his hatred and I wished they'd included the scene where he let slip what Lupin was, especially as this animosity between him, Black and Lupin plays a larger role as the books go on. And speaking of Lupin, the werewolf CGI was atrocious. He looked like an emaciated rat rather than the wolf-like creature who leaves even the more powerful wizards quivering in fear. I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon's face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.At the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn't mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter's friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it's still great viewing. I'd give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Azkaban is an enthralling, often spellbinding adventure. Worth revisiting, again and again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) Harry Potter is having a tough time with his relatives (yet again). He runs away after using magic to inflate Uncle Vernon's sister Marge who was being offensive towards Harry's parents. Initially scared for using magic outside the school, he is pleasantly surprised that he won't be penalized after all. However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile shape-shifters called Dementors are appointed to guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry know that by the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be filled up and he will have a clearer vision of what the future has in store?Azkaban is quite possibly the best Potter entry I've seen so far. As an avid fan of the films, but not a follower of the books (Yet, anyway) It's in serious consideration to the best as far as I'm concerned. Usually with films that are 140 minutes long, I start to get Ancy in my seat due to my ADHD condition. I actually yearned for more after it was over, as the excitement was top-notch. The finale is without a doubt one of the most breathtaking one's I've seen in my entire lifetime. It was just beautifully told, and wonderfully set-up. Azkaban also provides us with three wonderful leads once again, in Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson. Azkaban is quite the ride, and may just be my favorite so far. Performances. Daniel Radcliffe continues to mature as Potter, and gives a wonderful show here. He balances anger, confusion, and vulnerability perfectly, and I was on his side the whole way. Rupert Grint is as funny and charming as ever as Ron. I found myself cracking up half the time he was on screen. Emma Watson is bubbly and easy on the eyes, but credible once again as well. She is also maturing, and Hermione is quickly becoming one of my favorite Potter characters. Gary Oldman is surprisingly effective as Sirius, considering he only did it for the Money. David Thewlis is interesting in his role, and wise, if nothing else. Michael Gambon is classy as ever as Dumbledore. Alan Rickman is sinister once more as Snape, while Maggie Smith is great once again in her role. Robbie Coltrane is pretty good as Hagrid. Tom Felton continues to emerge as a great threat to Potter's fortune, while Emma Thompson is fittingly kooky. Bottom line. This is top-notch excitement at its finest. It's definitely one of the best, if not THE best Potter film in the series. Potter fanatics should be thrilled with the fine quality of this movie. A must see!9 ? /10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Writing in character again --- on Prisoner of Azkaban</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, once more we have another journey into the struggle for the future of Hogwarts. This time, the quest involves the saga of Sirius Black. Who is he? Why is he on the prowl for young Harry? And what, ultimately, is the truth behind the murder of James and Lilly Potter, Harry's parents? The tale opens with yet another killer title sequence, this time bringing the familiar Warner Bros. shield to light in spurts before focusing on Harry's 'homework assignment,' if you will --- the Lumos Maxima spell. After this, we come to the first segment of the story proper. Now aged 13, Harry is angrier, and more unsure of his destiny than in his previous adventures at Hogwarts. His rage against one of the Dursleys' relatives intensifies when he finally decides it's not worth it to remain there ("Anywhere's better than here," he complains to Uncle Vernon).A few moments later --- the Night Bus. What a ride, especially with British veteran comic Lenny Henry contributing the voice of the manic Shrunken Head! The film reaches its most beautiful moment, however, as Hagrid --- newly installed as Professor in Charge of the Care of Magical Creatures --- introduces his class, and us, to Buckbeak the Hippogriff. The haunting flight of Buckbeak, with Harry on his back, is complimented by a new theme from John Williams; and yes, Harry does the 'king-of-the-world' thing a la Leonardo DiCaprio (but that, of course, we can forgive).Director Alfonso Cuaron, who makes here a return to making films from family stories, provides us with as unexpected an ability to play mind games with the Potter legend's staunchest supporters (us, the audience) than even Chris Columbus did, when we discover at last what is really going on. That Sirius Black is Harry Potter's godfather, and would willingly sacrifice himself for Harry's honor, brings more sorrow than joy to our hero's emotional psyche, setting the stage for the major payoff sequence.How horrifying it is to learn that the rat you have loved and cared for for all of 12 years is no less than the traitor who brought Voldemort the means to slay James and Lilly! One can imagine what's going through Ron Weasley's mind as he, Harry, and Hermoine witness these bitter revelations.And finally, we have the theme of expressing freedom, as Harry sees himself, changed into a glowing stag, giving the evil Dementors what for, thus freeing both Sirius and Buckbeak --- two innocents who, like Hagrid himself, have been falsely accused and condemned. Alas, Sirius' destiny, as we know all too well, is to be a short-lived one.So, what did you love about the movie? I hear you asking. Well, aside from the usual smokin' performances from our regulars (and a jolly toast to Michael Gambon who, one hopes, will be given a bigger, cooler beard once Order of the Phoenix goes into principal photography), there is also the delightful spectre of darkness surrounding the story, and a ferocious bid for battling against revenge. And, for the first time, the inclusion of the Marauders' Map is not only emphasized, it also serves as the inspiration --- and literal setting --- for the movie's end-credit sequence.All in all, Prisoner of Azkaban brings the darker Potter power to light in ways one would not dare expect out of screenwriter Steve Kloves. Alas, they're saying that Steve will be leaving the production team after having completed the Goblet of Fire script; if another writer does Order of the Phoenix proper justice, they'll be hard-pressed to take on the search for one. That being the case, I sincerely hope our legions of fans will enjoy our film. Who knows? I may have to do this again three years from now when Half-Blood Prince gets the movie treatment! (Heh-heh!) Faithfully, Albus Dumbledore</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PoA has "magic" but "not magical enough" like the previous 2 ****Spoilers A-Plenty****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(6/10, out of which 4.5 goes to Buckbeak) How I looked forward to this movie cannot be summarized in a paragraph.. and then when I saw it...hmmm...this looked like a regular movie that had some magic but was in "No way Magical enough" as I quite liked the Chris Columbus presentation and his attention to detail in the previous two.. Don't get me wrong, Cuaron does a pretty good job but his style is more 'Artsy'.The first one was just cute.. and curiosity got the better of all of us in 'How is Harry Potter going to be depicted?' on screen.. CoS was more mature. Very occasionally it did seem that the movie's were long (if you have watched the DVD's enough) but they captured the essence of the books and there was a continuity to the scenes even for the non-Harry folk.I guess the length of the previous two movies must have made some kind of impact on the way PoA has been condensed. The pace of PoA was "too fast" compared to the previous two. From the initial scenes, Harry in his room to Aunt Marge to Harry leaving the Duddleys was &lt; 10 minutes (or so it seemed). Magnolia Crescent and the 'black dog' was a trifle slow and then came the triple decker bus which was pretty brisk. The introduction of Sirius Black was not menacing enough by 'Stan' the conductor on the T.D. bus. Gary Oldman definitely deserved more (+5mins)*The entry into Leaky Cauldron and the inn-keeper 'Tom' (who looked like a character from 'Adams Family') swinging Harry off the street to meet 'Cornileus Fudge' (whose name is not even mentioned) was moderately funny. The re-union of Harry, Ron and Hermione lacks any friendship or bonding strength and 'Mr. Weaselys' warning to Harry isn't any more serious than watching 'Saturday Night Live'. I was particularly disappointed that 'AZKABAN' prison is just left to imagination (more like a passing comment) and the crime that Sirius committed, killing 13 with one curse &amp; Pettigrew losing a pinky is NOT even shown in an abstract fashion (like Voldermot killing Harry's mother in HP1(+5mins)*The trip to Hogwarts with the train stranded and the Dementors/Lupins introduction was kinda neat (especially the fading of Harry - the soul screaming etc) but a gifted actor like David Thewlis could have had two more minutes at that point, especially when he explains what a dementor is (+2mins)* Cut, horseless carriages, cut, 'Choir group ? very neat with Something Wicked This Way Comes', cut, 'Welcome Welcome' says DumbleDore, introduces Hagrid and Lupin. THE BEST PART - the Hippogriff and Hagrid's class, Harry's first flight on BUCKBEAK. The special effects team deserves an award for Buckbeak who IMHO was the SAVING GRACE or the HERO of the film, continued to impress me till the very end.Quidditch with the dementors swooping on Harry (very imaginatively handled) who falls and is going to be stopped by Dumbledore (very unimaginative after he starts falling as it fades dark and pop comes the next scene in the Hospital Wing). Divination room was much different than the book without the trap door etc although Emma Thompson was funny. Fat Lady was wasted. Sirius coming to kill Scabbers was cut. The FireBolt and its introduction without Hermione's suspicions looks 'hollow' in the end. Honeydukes (getting there was assumed) and Marauder's Map needed some more time (+5mins)*. Changing 'Three Broomsticks' to 'Hogs Head' was weird. Who is Sirius to Harry (as explained by Mcgonnagal) did not give enough detail (+5mins)*.Lupins class, Harry's scenes with Lupin, his encounter at night with 'Peter Pettigrew' in the courtyard and the last 40 mins with Lupin, Sirius, Snape and the dementors which is the CRUX of the movie was done very well although 'Who exactly is Peter Pettigrew' is not communicated clearly even in the climax. Hermione's Time Turner, which is confusing unless you have read the book could have used additional time (3mins)*All in all this movie would have made a 'magical' impact on me if we could have experienced those extra 30 minutes of detail to bring continuity in the film, but that was not to be. Maybe the DVD will be better.. I sure hope so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully dark, but with holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This work is beautifully dark and lovingly done, but it does leave gaping holes in J. K. Rowling's magical world. The close relationship between Harry and Dumbledore is obliterated, as is Hermione's almost conspiratorial relationship with McGonagal. You are never told who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are (a necessary element). They completely avoid the fact that Snape has knowledge of Harry's Invisibility Cloak, and Harry received the Firebolt at the beginning of this work rather than the end. The whole incident at the Shrieking Shack was changed and lost too much in the translation. Crookshanks was calumniated from a beloved kneazle to a noisome feline who'd be more likely to pee in your shoes than help you, aside of course from his determination to eat Scabbers.Columbus's epic style is notably missing, as is the awe-inspiring score, and the magical feeling inspired by the first two. Hagrid's hut was reinvisioned (more a gripe with Columbus for not having read ahead and determining what was needed to begin with, than a grip with this movie), there is a pumpkin patch which wasn't there last year, and Hogwarts grounds seemed to have sprouted mountains and rocky hills which weren't previously there. And Dumbledore no longer bears the traits of a beloved, serenely all-knowing Headmaster who commands respect from all (the ONLY Wizard of whom He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is afraid), he is now a lesser man who barely commands notice much less great respect. It aggravated me that Columbus never felt it necessary to research his resource materials by reading ahead in order to make a solid determination as to where things were and how they were laid out. Negligance is never a desirable trait among any professional trade, and this single act of laziness could have cost the franchise dearly. Indeed, this attempt took a beating on DVD sales due to the lack of contentment with the finished product over the changes. Lapses in sales like this could adversely affect the studio's decision to make further films!However. Cuarón's style is superior in his use of light and color, and the lack of these elements. He is not afraid to approach the darkness of this work, and shows it as he rivals the power of the script, rifling through each line and page for ways to illuminate the scene through means other than mere lighting. Much has been said concerning the "darker" script, etc. While this work IS darker, so was the literary work from which this was adapted. Even with all the changes (some of them barely noticeable and some of them contemptible) this attempt is the first Harry Potter film which, in my opinion, captured the true spirit and feeling of the novel which it attempts to document.I, for one, am happy to see Chris Columbus move from the director's chair to that of producer. I've wondered though, why he was not Executive Producer of this work, as he was the previous two and the upcoming GOF? Ah well. I must have missed something. His sweeping epic style is beautiful but his works never achieved the level of awe, mystery, and joy present in the first two novels. This third attempt, as I've said, succeeded in capturing all the necessary elements.Hagrid's hut is beautifully done and the audience has a much better feel for the grounds of Hogwarts due to Cuarón's talents. As much as I detested the fact that things had to be changed, I am very satisfied with how things looked and felt on the grounds. It felt much more magical, even with a lack of epic filming (of which I am a huge fan). Cuarón handled the maturing of our three protagonists quite well in that he had just finished a near-porn and, indeed, a nod is given to that work in this movie. If you've seen them both, then you know what I mean. Hermione's Emma Watson is maturing well so far, as are our other favorite Hogwarts students. They do not appear to be maturing so quickly as to warrant their replacement in this series; a situation about which much speculation has been made.This work was incredible in that the characters, creatures, and effects were all impeccably conceived and executed. The legendary hippogryph was incredibly realistic. Some critics have charged J. K. Rowling with making up these animals by "taking one half of one animal and just sticking it onto another." This is laughable, as the hippogryph is a mystical animal of legend, and not a Rowling creation. According to legend, the hippogryph, living far beyond the seas in the Rhiphaean Mountains, is the result of the rare breeding of a male gryphon and a filly. It has the head, wings and front legs of a gryphon, and the back and hind legs of a horse. It is a large powerful creature that can move through the air more swiftly than lightning. It figured in several of the legends of Charlemagne as a mount for some of the knights. And since many types of gryphons exist, including a variation involving an eagle head and forepaws, this rendition of this legendary creature is really quite realistic. I do wish people would research before criticizing.While this movie is far from Oscar-worthy, it is quite entertaining and does its best to follow the main theme of the literary work. While I was a bit put off by the changes, I must acquiesce that Cuarón did a most excellent job in adapting the largest and longest Harry Potter literary alteration so far with the lowest running time of any Harry Potter film yet. Thus far, this is my favorite for film style and maintaining the appropriate atmosphere in accordance with the novel, though I do hope Gambon can pull off the rigors of the next two attempts. A lot will ride on his ability to BE Dumbledore.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of the three so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POA was by far the best of the three Harry Potter films. The actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) have gained more confidence in their abilities. They have become more and more like the characters they play in their own life which has shown in the films.Besides the acting, the film was better shoot than the previous two: In the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the parts picked were sometimes less important than the parts left out. A great deal of the stuff from the books was cut in the other two movies, but this was not the case in this one: It appeared that there were only two scenes out of order from which they happened in the books; Harry receiving the Firebolt (at the end of the film, but early in the book,) and Harry's Patronus (supposed to be a Stag, galloping down the Dementors, but was a dome-shaped shield in film.) Other than those two inconsistencies with the books, the film was virtually flawless; the CG improved a great deal; the Dementors had nearly the same affect as they did in the books ? to the reader/viewer.To most fans, the best part of the movie was by far was the scene where Hermione socked Draco in the nose (another very slight deviation from the books, but perfectly acceptable!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film of the Series; One of the Best Films of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish Alfonso Cuaron would come back to the franchise. I know that he probably won't, but I still hope. After all, as we float through this empty, depressing world, sometimes all we have is hope. He detached this film franchise from its safe-as-a-CIA-file roots and allowed it to grow wings and fly into a silver ether. To anyone who thinks franchise films cannot be art... check out LOTR. But once you are done, check out this film. It is both ironic and darkly appropriate that this is both the lowest grossing Harry Potter film and the one that many film critic types, such as myself, say is the greatest of the octology.The film starts off like do all Harry Potter books and most Harry Potter movies. Potter is at the house of his over-the-top, abusive, Muggle adopted family, getting tormented like he always does. Yes, I know it is explained in detail why he needs to stay with them, but such doesn't make it any less of a poor writing choice. But, when and if I do a full review of the Potter series, I'll go over those kinds of decisions. I only bring this up because it is a base line for these movies and such something I can use to show why this is the best one. In the Columbus films, it is played with a cheerful exaggeration that reminds me of many of his eighties movies. This is not a bad thing, but it is not brimming with greatness either. In the Yates films, it is downplayed as just a backdrop, a facade, if you will, to more serious matters. Cuaron manages to combine these approaches, which is expected, as both this and GOF are the 'transition movies', while adding both sophistication and a level of charged rawness, which is not expected.We get to see Harry's emotional landscape. Fragile but potent, unstable but unyielding, it is a sight to behold, one that belies the simpler character that we got in both the earlier and later movies. If Harry Potter developed along these lines, he might have actually been a great character instead of the flattest one among a crowd of interesting people.The scenes are magical, but not in the try-hard way of the first two films. Around the time that I first saw them, I declared myself a true blue of the series. I haven't looked back since. The shots are magical in a way that is both wispy and intense. This is the tone that these movies should have taken, and if they reboot them, something of I am not in favor but something that is a conceivable possibility in today's Hollywood climate, this is the tone I would like them to try to take. Just the thought of that sends chills down my spine. It might even be able to challenge LOTR for the crown of best fantasy series of all time. After that virtuoso opening, I kept waiting to be let down. I never was. Every new character introduced was interesting and every old character they excluded was not missed. The pacing is the best out of the movies; the first two were too slow and the other five were too fast. The plot was more personal to me than the other movies; this is the one movie in which Voldemort does not appear in some form or another. There is no direct end boss and so the plot has to be more creative. And so it is.Of course, more of the credit for this has to go Mrs. Rowling for writing the book on which this film was based. But the cinematography is all the work of Cuaron's team. And it is the best in the series by far. Not to say that the other movies are poorly shot; this is Britain, after all: things may be bad, but they are never badly done. But while the cinematography of the first few movies would perfectly fit a kid's fantasies, the cinematography of the fourth movie would perfectly fit a high class ball or gala, and the cinematography of the last four movies would perfectly fit a nature doc, the cinematography of this film perfectly fits the franchise. It is artful and well-done, but it is not show like an Oscarbaity period piece. The camera feels alive and coated with magic powder. It is exactly how I imagine the heartbeat of a troubled magic society to feel like. The music helps it out. If you listen to Window to the Past and are not sucked into the world Cuaron made for this film, then you just don't have a soul. It is introspective, ambient, immersive, and coated with the kind of cerebral wonder that I think makes life worth living. It is the best tune in the franchise. But do not think it is the only good tune in the movie. Buckbeak's Flight is a good second.While the characters in the series may never be willing/able to turn back time after this movie for reasons cheap and nonsensical and borderline nonexistent, I hope that you will be wiser. Come back in time with me to 2004. And let the emotional waves of this picture overtake you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expect(o) to be let down by future installments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoner of Azkaban is the only installment of the Harry Potter series to stray from the formula "Voldemort is trying to kill Harry". That's one of the reasons I liked this movie so much. It lacks the sense of impending peril present in "Sorceror's Stone" and "Chamber of Secrets" and the lack of oppressive atmosphere allows for the most complete (as of movie 4) character exploration of the entire series.I think Alfonso Cuarón is the perfect director for this type of material: this movie is so well-handled it makes Chris Columbus' and Mike Newell's efforts look like amateur productions. It is really a shame that he didn't sign on for the fourth movie.This movie also contains some of the finest performances from child actors I have ever seen. I must have watched this movie thirty times by now, and not only because it's picturesque, with wonderfully shot scenes and seamlessly integrated effects; not only because of the enchanting music chosen, which adds tremendously to the sense of immersion in the movie. No, I watch this movie over and over because of the master performances put in by Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Daniel Radcliffe. They're very likable people, and they're charming in every scene, whether they're trying to dodge unfair punishment from Snape or saving themselves from Dementors. They're so charming, you actually feel like you're there with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a mixed review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a "fan film". By this I mean the makers have made the assumption the majority of viewers, the core audience - are fans of the Potter series. As a stand alone film would leave a viewer confused by a fast moving plot devoid of a lot of detail contained in the original book which the film quite closely follows. To fully appreciate the movie, prior knowledge through reading the book would be most beneficial, it would allow you to fill in the many blanks.Concepts, background, and explanations are skipped in the movie, which gives it a rushed, incomplete feeling, even for a Potter fan. Users have commented the movie is darker, this is somewhat true, it definitely has a different feel from the first two films, much of this can be attributed to the new director. He has changed the sets considerably, to the point where they barely resemble the first tmo films. The fine cast of adult stars is under utilized throughout the film. Maggie Smiths role could be considered a cameo for the limited screen time she got.Overall the rest of the film is acceptable. If I didn't previously know the plot I would rate this film lower than I did. Though this IS Harry Potter and he still has the midas touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all these years since it was released, this has become one of my all-time favorite movies. It took a while to grow on me. I appreciate the artistry and detail that Cuaron and Kloves brought to the adaptation of Rowling's book.The opening of the film establishes the importance of light, a visual theme that carries through the whole film. It's a metaphor for Harry's own search for clarity about his past, a search that ends with the ultimate light of the patronus. Harry grows up over the course of the story. He discovers that he must be strong and self-reliant.Another visual theme is the passing of time, which becomes an important plot device. There are repeated shots of the huge clock and its gears in Hogwarts' castle. There are lots of ticking sounds and the deep ringing of the clock bells, ominously signifying the fleeting hours as they slip through Harry's grasp.John Williams created one of his most impressive musical scores for Azkaban. Buckbeak's flight is one of the emotional high points of the film, a soaring exuberant theme that perfectly enhances Harry's feeling of freedom and release. I also really liked the little harpsichord motif that signaled the presence of Peter Pettigrew, a motif that cleverly sneaks back in at the very end of film's credits.All of the actors are in top form. Daniel Radcliffe really came into his own and showed a strong command of his character. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint also grew tremendously as actors. Alan Rickman, as always, showed masterful control of Snape. The only actor that I still am ambivalent toward is Michael Gambon. As others have mentioned, Richard Harris really captured that "twinkle in the eye" that Dumbledore needs. Although I appreciated subtle techniques that Gambon incorporated (a slightly stuffed sound to reflect Dumbledore's broken nose and a slight Irish lilt), I never got that sense of Dumbledore's mischievous nature. Gambon's character certainly looked eccentric, with a bow in his beard and sporting a tam. And there were a few nice moments near the end with Harry and Hermione where he seemed more relaxed. But I wish he had taken that further.I also agree with others who say that to fully capture the nuances of the book, the movie would have had to be a mini-series. Rowling writes with such attention to detail, that a single movie could never capture the beauty of her prose. I think Cuaron and Kloves came as close as they could to maintaining the spirit of the book while creating a unique and beautiful two-and-a-half hour movie. It's one of the few movies I can watch over and over and enjoy even more than the first time I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just the best "Potter" film (to date). It can also hold it's own against the best of fantasy entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is a scene that sums up my feelings about this film, it would probably be where Harry is forced to ride Buckbeak the hippogriff ("Don't pull out his feathers," warns Hagrid, "cause he won't thank yer for that!"). Initially, Harry hangs on for dear life, but as the flight progresses over Hogwarts and its nearby lake, Harry suddenly feels a sense of complete exhilaration.This scene is not only terrifically executed, but makes a great statement about the "Harry Potter" franchise in general. Under Columbus, the series was keen on observing its wondrous world, but not much else. But under Alfonso Cuaron, the series does more than observe. It flies and sails through all of the possibilities. Add to that an improved script from Steven Kloves, better performances from the main trio, and some welcome musical themes from John Williams, and you have what is, to date, the best "Potter" film yet.The "Prisoner of Azkaban" is Sirius Black, a mass murderer who has escaped. A former supporter of Lord Voldemort, Black is reportedly going after Harry to finish off the Dark Lord's work. Harry, of course, would much rather live out his third year at Hogwarts without unpredictable distractions. But more than Sirius Black is concerning Harry now. The guards of Azkaban, the dementors, are snooping around Hogwarts and forcing Harry to rehear his worst memories. The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, is revealing that he had connections with Harry's father. And for all of the security around Hogwarts, how is Black breaching the castle walls and attacking portraits?Steven Kloves has written a far better script this time around, thanks in large part to a greater emotional heft he puts on the story. Harry's parents take on a greater importance this time, and they are the source for some of his motivations in dealing with the Dementors, Remus Lupin, and Sirius Black. In fact, speaking of Lupin, I was quite impressed with how well Kloves wrote all of the interactions between Harry and Lupin. His manner reminded me of some of my favorite teachers from high school, and how they would sometimes care about more than just their students' academia, but their personal lives too.And not only is the script better, but so is the acting. Reportedly, director Cuaron had Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson all had to write essays on their characters before filming began. Smart move. Racliffe, Grint, and Watson all interact with each other like there's real history between them, and don't just look like they're trying to hold their own while reciting lines. Several new casting choices are inspired as well. David Thewlis plays Professor Lupin, and he brings humanity and compassion to the role. Gary Oldman is Sirius Black, and his interactions with Harry are not only credible, but you get a sense that he has truly cared for him for many years now. Emma Thompson is a hoot as Professor Trelawney, Harry's eccentric Divination teacher. Several have criticized Michael Gambon taking over for Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, but I think he's fine for the role. He may not be the Albus Dumbledore of the book, but I bought into his more stern, yet still sensible portrayal of the revered Headmaster.I missed John Williams' film score in "Chamber of Secrets" because I rarely heard it. Here however, Cuaron lets him come back in full force. Time and time again, Williams comes up with other memorable theme, including "Aunt Marge's Waltz," "Buckbeak's Flight," and "Double Trouble" (the song the Hogwarts choir sings). This marked the last time Williams worked with "Harry Potter," so it's good he went out on a high note.I don't know what I can add to the appraisal of Alfonso Cuaron's direction, but I'm going to try anyway. The guy nailed it. For the first thirty minutes, I had this big grin on my face as he took great fun in blowing up Aunt Marge, making Harry's ride on the Knight Bus as wild and face-flattening as possible, and having students eat candies that made them act like monkeys and lions (or in Harry's case, blow steam out of his ears). He employs several clever camera tricks, including gazing into a mirror and having the reflection become the dominant shot, and having the Whomping Willow shake snow off its branches and having the snow hit the camera lens. And he's not afraid to exploit Hogwarts darker side, from the sinister, soul- sucking dementors to Lupin's tense transformation. There are too many "little touches" he adds on for me to mention, but I think my favorite was that when Harry and Hermione travel back in time and attempt to save Buckbeak, Hermione sees herself, and questions, "Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?" You won't find that comment in the book. Not only does that line add humor, but it also shows how Cuaron was willing to separate this film from the book and make it its own entity.Does "The Prisoner of Azkaban" deserve the 10 I bestow on it? Maybe, maybe not; I will not deny, I am a little biased when it comes to "Harry Potter." But I do believe it to be great filmmaking, and great entertainment. Practically all elements from the previous "Potter" pictures have been improved upon. The result is a film that can hold it's own against the best of fantasy entertainment, and it's also one of the rare strong 3rd installments of any given film series.(And one last note: I believe this film gets the award for "weirdest ending to any 'Harry Potter' movie")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This new director did a great job making a movie with a lot of flash and no bang. He did not just CUT things out of the movie but he made HUGE changes to the wizarding world. I will list some of them now. Opening scene Harry is trying to cast a spell under his sheets (a spell that is not even in the books) but DARN in the books its HIGHLY illegal for wizards not of age to be casting spells outside school (let alone in a MUGGLE neighborhood). A huge change that I saw were FLYING dementors, in the books they just hover over the ground...in the movie he has them chasing him like airplanes...zooming all around. In the book they had to list the ways of telling a werewolf from a normal wolf...no where did I hear "Long thin legs", in the books a werewolf looks VERY much like a normal wolf (other then a few things like eyes and snout length). In the books there is only ONE time you will catch a wizard in muggle clothes...and thats when he is in a MUGGLE town. In the movie they almost NEVER wear cloaks or robes and thats after JK Rowling did a GREAT job telling us what each of these wizards normally wear. The first two movies followed the book great, it was like reading every other page. This movie was like a friend reading the third book and then a year later trying to tell you what happened. (huge changes in the plot) I'm a avid fan but this movie hurt more then it helped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had me really excited, as the Prisoner of Azkaban was my favourite book. But in the end I was really, honestly disappointed.Another reviewer claimed that this was the best Harry Potter yet. I claim the exact opposite-- I think it's the worst. It was horribly shortened, and many scenes were altered to fit Hollywood standards. Practically everything was turned into a joke, even the things that really shouldn't have been.I also think that the appointment of this new Dumbledore was a dreadful mistake. While he certainly redeems himself a bit in the fifth movie, in this one, he was the opposite of what I imagined of his character (albeit, it was much worse in the fourth). He was hardly the gentle, soft-spoken, graceful wizard I had envisioned, or that was portrayed in the 1st and 2nd movies, which, in my opinion, were the best.The scene in the Shrieking Shack was summarized sloppily and altogether too quickly. Exemplified in this scene was the worst portrayal of Sirius Black we could have hoped for. Sure, we knew he was fervent, anxious to kill Pettigrew and get revenge, but we didn't think of him as insane. And the scene with Lupin turning into a werewolf--they added and awful bit with Sirius telling Lupin something like "This is who you truly are, this heart, in here!", which is hardly the kind of thing you'd be saying as your best friend transformed into a deadly monster.I eventually just turned the movie off. I couldn't watch it anymore. I was awfully disappointed after the stunning accuracy of the first two films. In those, the casting was spot-on, and the accuracy was impressive; here, the casting left a lot to be desired, as did the acting of those who were decent in both the Sorcerer's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione seemed eerily preppy ("Does my hair really look like that from the back?"), Dumbledore I've already criticised, and Hagrid--quite the perfect match in all of the other movies--seemed to fall apart in this one. Even Malfoy, who was perfect before, was made into a stereotypical bully here, not the deeper character portrayed in the books.All in all, this was the worst Harry Potter to date, and I would only suggest it to hardcore HP fans or those who are entirely un-picky when it comes to accuracy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't like the change of director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My opinion of the recently released Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is that the new director totally changed the mood and feeling of the Harry Potter series. Those of you who watched PoA and read the book saw many things cut out, I am aware that a lot had to be cut out for time reasons but in doing this many things were lost that were important in the storyline. An Example of this is how Heromine was able to attend all her classes this was shown briefly in two scene and could have easily been missed. Another thing that was troubling was why was the scenery of the movie changed. The grounds of Hogwarts were totally different than the first two movies.I believe that the change of director could have turned off many Harry Potter fans from the movies. As for myself I enjoyed the first two films and did not like the third. I do very much though enjoy the books and also I hope that the the next movie will be a little better put together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good and the bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most Harry Potter fans, I found this movie disappointing. I felt that Director Alfonso Cuaron choose style over substance, which is never a good thing in a movie.Some critics say that the previous movies were too stiff in how they stuck close to the book. THAT IS THE POINT!! If I want to see a Harry Potter movie, I want to see the book, the plot, brought to life. I don't want to see the plot changed.However, I must admit, I loved the darker, more Gothic look of the film. The books are taking a turn for the darker and this movie sets that tone.But there was so many plot holes, so much left out. It was hard for this HP fan to ignore. This book, while the smallest of the 5 out there is crucial. This is my main complaint with the movie.It introduces Lupin, Black, and Pettigrew, all of which are important to Harry, as they fill in the gaps of his past. In this book, you discover why Snape hates Harry, Lupin, Black, and James Potter. This is important later. The relationship between Snape and Harry is important to the Order of the Phoenix. Who is Wormtail, Prongs, Moony, and Padfoot? What is and who created The Marauders map. And why is Black an Animagus? The above are all questions that the movie leaves unanswered (but are in the book). I would have sat through another hour to hear the explanations and see the full story. Instead, plot points replaced by unnecessary (but yet funny) cut scenes. Not a good thing.Buckbeak looked great; the CGI was very well done. The time warp effect was also cool. I was disappointed in how Lupin looked as a Werewolf, I thought they were more hairy.The best part of this movie - the acting. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are growing into their roles and as actors. Although Radcliffe could have actually shed some tears during the Hogsmade visit. Tom Felton was great as Draco, who tries to be brash, but is really a coward under it all. He played it excellently.The adults were also fantastic. Maggie Smith was the stern, yet almost motherly Minerva McGonagall. We needed to see more of her; she only had about 2 lines. Robbie Coltrane comes back as Hagrid and he plays the part perfectly. Emma Thompson plays a wonderfully flaky Sybil Trelawney. Michael Gambon had a tough role to fill by following Richard Harris. Gambon brings his own slant to Albus Dumbledore, which in this movie was a bit off-kelter, but I think as we get used to him in this role, it will seem more natural.Alan Rickman.... He is the most underrated actor in this movie. The critics seem to ignore his astounding acting in these films. He is absolutely fantastic in his role as the sharp, harsh, angry, but troubled Severus Snape. Any lesser actor would have made Snape flat, but Rickman gives him life and dimension. Also, he has some of the greatest lines in this movie. "Revenge is very sweet..." Gary Oldman was good as Sirius Black, but we didn't seen enough of him. His confrontation with Rickman was emotion filled and was one of the best parts of the movie. I wish it had gone on longer. Timothy Spall plays a disgusting and revolting Peter Pettigrew. He looked the part and played it well. Remus Lupin was played by David Thewlis. I was not sure what to think at first; I was hoping Anthony Stewart Head (Giles from Buffy) was going to get the part. But Thewlis was excellent, he made Lupin a character you liked and cared about, a feeling you didn't get from the book. But Thewlis makes you feel that for the character. He got a fair amount of screen time, but I wanted more. Fantastic acting. I can't wait to see him come back in the next few films. All in all, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an good movie, as long as you don't compare it to the book or other HP movie. The plot holes really damage the film. The acting and the feel of the movie are great, but still don't quite make up the difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to mention that Alfonso Cuarón has done a great job. The treatment of the movie is totally different from the previous installments. The magical world has not only grown much darker but it has taken for of a thriller. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have grown not only in age but skills as well as they give a great performance.The movie has taken shape of a much more complexity.Its no longer just about the Quidditch matches or the menacing Malfoy but its much more than that. The whole movie has a suspenseful environment and it holds on to it from beginning to end. The climax especially is great and more mature than the previous installments. Overall I think this is the best installment from the three. Totally amazing experience and close to perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>JK And The Film World At Its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film so much, I read as many of the negative reviews as possible. (In an attempt to remain balanced!) Here, JK is at the height of her literary powers. So, I can completely sympathise with the dedicated book fans who shout loudly regarding the curse of film-making... Plot editing and adaptation.Despite the limitations of filming, one has to remember just how successful a writer Jo has become. A quick glance at her book sales will inform you of an astonishing achievement. To date: 400 million copies sold ... We may not be able to turn out a well-appointed table lamp in England anymore, but we sure produce the occasional literary genius.Am I wrong? Let's examine The Prisoner Of Azkaban's gorgeous list of well-drawn characters for a moment. There's the flawed, but caring Remus who takes Harry under his wing. There's the misunderstood, yet poignant outsider, Mr Sirius Black. There's a new, more determined and stronger Harry, a shining model of boyhood in a world where boys often remain maligned, or sidelined. (In this way, JK brilliantly punctures the absurd reverse-sexism that blights society).But let's not forget the girls..! Here, Hermione is redrawn as a courageous, chin-thumping adventurer. She takes the initiative, disseminates common sense with easy candour, makes intelligent decisions while the wizarding world dissembles. And most of all, she's a fierce friend. Every boy's dream? Almost certainly...But back to the film... The plotting here is immaculate. We're on a poignant journey with Harry from the moment he steps aboard that incredible bus. There's humour, there's suspense, there's a feeling of movement (so hard to capture with genuine precision on film). There's the brilliant casting decision to appoint Mr Oldman as Sirius. (He's played difficult parts before, namely his extraordinary portrayal of Lee Harvey Oswald in JFK). In this sense, the casting choice is inspired.Emma Thompson's wonderful Professor Trelawney served as an enjoyable comic counterpoint in a film that was layered with foreboding. Emma is clearly enjoying herself as the bespectacled diviner. A small part for one of our finest English actresses, but By George, she makes the most of it! And let's not forget Timothy Spall. His sudden transformation into the crumbling, scabbed Wormtail lifts the film just at the right moment, due entirely to Spall's notable acting abilities. The other actors suddenly have opportunity aplenty to react and carry the narrative forward.Not only this, but we have the rarest of rare finales. A movie that makes us all feel better. Sirius wins his freedom. The true betrayer is unmasked! The Fab Three have matured and earned their stripes. Harry even has the semblance of a real family once more.Thank you J K Rowling. The fans may be correct that your story was mutilated, the hogwart's crowd may no longer be in uniform, the school and its grounds may have changed beyond all recognition, but these minor elements did nothing to detract from a thrilling, absorbing tale well told.Highlights:Fudge: "Come now Harry, we don't send people to Azkaban for blowing-up their aunts!" (This gem could have a double meaning, if we weren't immersed in the Wizarding World!)Hippogriff: Could you see the pixels? Every feather looked real...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Potter Film to Feel Like a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron picks up the reigns of the blockbuster film franchise from Chris Columbus. The result is the first Harry Potter movie to feel like a movie and have its own cinematic vision.I haven't read any of the Potter books, and those who have claim that Azkaban isn't as faithful to the source material as the first two movies. Whatever. This movie works in a way the first two didn't, and if story is left out, the excising was done very well, because the film has a narrative drive to it that makes it immensely exciting and clear as a bell to follow. One of the film's highlights is the time travel sequence, helped in no end by Cuaron's swooping, active camera and John Williams' ticking stopwatch score.David Thewlis and Gary Oldman are introduced in the large roles of Professor Lupin and Sirius Black, respectively, and the movie belongs to them. Emma Thompson is briefly hilarious in a couple of small scenes as Madame Trelawney the psychic.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is the Harry Potter film we've been waiting for!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Readers,After two incredibly awful and boring movies, I was really not sure I wanted to watch Prisoner of Azkaban. I decided to see it with my Mom one Summer day, expecting it to totally stink. Boy was I wrong. Prisoner of Azkaban ROCKED BIG TIME!!! The characters were extremely fleshed out, particularly Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Michael Gambon was ten times better than Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Alan Rickman was even more slimy as Snape. Emma Thompson was creepy as Professor Trelawny and Robbie Coltrane was perfect as usual as Hagrid. David Thewlis was perfectly cast as Professor Lupin and Gary Oldman was insanely perfect as Sirius Black. John Williams's score was even better than the first two films and Alfonso Cuaron's direction was perfect.Now the plot: Harry is beginning his third year at Hogwarts and discovers the man who betrayed his parents, Sirius Black, has escaped from his life sentence in the Prison of Azkaban and is searching for Harry. As Harry begins to ready himself against Black, he discovers secrets about his family and friends and the chilling night of his parents murder. Along with the problem of Black, Harry has to contend with his classes, a Magical Map, Quidditch, and the mysterious new professor, Remus Lupin, and the fact that Sirius Black is his Godfather!Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Care for tea?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Potter fan, the world is a rather sad place to be hanging around. It's a matter of principle, no more, no less. The refuge one may find in the books is comforting in an enchanting way, but can the films be so as well? After watching HP's one and two, nay was all that I could say. Both films were somewhat played down in quite a few regards and despite differing only in details from the books, they both achieved the tremendous performance of boring me to a paralysis-like state. Surely enough, there were things I liked, but reality and fantasy remained two separate things: you can't get a Harry Potter without taking him from the muggle world and the muggle world simply needs time to learn and to grow up. And they did, all of them, those little brats, all for Harry's sake and under Cuaron's guidance! What makes HP 3 a much more enjoyable ride is the sense of existence with which the characters are finally bestowed. They are leading a life of their own and the kids finally learned how to show that on screen - obviously, with Cuaron's help, who was more than able to reinvent Rowling's universe in a way only a true visionary could've done. Columbus wasn't up to the task, for all that mattered in his case was the frame and not the painting itself! It's very important to be able to guide children and the only real way to do it is by making it feel natural. So Cuaron did.The third book is probably the best one to film due to the plot, mainly. That's one of the reasons why it plays out so well as a movie. But the fact that the kids have started to grasp the basic concepts of acting and the stunning visuals create a new world for us to taste have had an undeniable positive influence upon the end result. This new film is good because it finally shares the spirit of the book: the innocent hope, the complicated issues of life (and death), the reasons which make us tick the way we do. It's a step in discovering who the heck you really are, who the heck Harry is and what he is becoming. The "wise words of Dumbledore" are always powerful and mysterious, in the sense they really should be. And it's good this way, because there so much more behind them and we want to want to be intrigued. That's what Cuaron managed to do, he created a world which leaves enough unanswered questions as there can be. Finally someone who understands the essence of the book. Finally something fresh and exciting. That's the way HP is supposed to be!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, But Not Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers*** and References to The Goblet of Fire. Were to start, it's hard to pinpoint were the movie went wrong because there was so much great material to work with. The Prisoner of Azkaban had many things going for it post production. A great actor lineup, two previously successful installments and of course high anticipation of its release. Nevertheless, it was hard to watch. The movie started of quite strongly, and then the quality took a nose dive only to recover at the end. Although that means that more than half of the movie was good it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth since a little editing could have fixed this problem. A lot of people felt that the movie was too dark, well the book was dark. I think the underlying problem was certain parts were just poorly done and other parts were meant to compensate for them. POA starts out quite solid, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is gutting out another summer with the Dursley's and is provoked by his uncle's sister into using magic. At this time in the movie, I was getting over the initial shock of lack of Christopher Columbus while resisting the new hand held camera techniques applied by Alfonso Cuarón.The Knight Bus and Leaky Cauldron scenes were difficult to swallow and could have been so much better without the introduction of too many shady characters. Cornelius Fudge who supposedly looses it in the fourth book comes of rather nutty and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley who weren't supposed to ever be out of their robes were kind of strange. The dialogue between Mr. Weasley and Harry amidst the pillars was distracting and felt rushed. By the time we get into the swing of things I was sort of cynical about the new director, Alfonso Cuarón who has already proved himself in The Little Princess.The attack on The Hogwart's Express and the arrival at Hogwarts were nicely executed and the choir and floating candles added a nice touch. This was probably the best scene in the movie. I felt that the Dumbledore replacement was actually better but were POA missed out and COS didn't was Ron's comic relief which was scarce to none in this movie. Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) actually seemed depressed! Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) was hardly threatening and seemed a tad out of character. Cuarón used the Womping Willow to mark the change of season and definitely gave Hogwarts a more realistic opposed to whimsical look than the first two. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) started of strong and continued with a solid performance throughout the movie. Good performance by most of the cast and The Dementors were by far the best CGI in the movie and also how I pictured them as described in the book. Not bad but not brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seemed to be a little cut short (mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Review includes some mild spoilers.As before, I have never read any Harry Potter book. Thus I didn't have the faintest idea what "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" would be about until I saw the movie. Perhaps this way is better, as I can focus on following the story and not complaining about details such as the wrong number of hairs on Hagrid's head.As with the previous movies, I went to see this movie with my sister and my brother. My brother had read the book at school and had told me in advance that Sirius Black was related to Harry Potter, but I didn't know any more than that. I didn't even know what it should mean in regard to the plot.The movie felt overall less like an effects show and more character-developing than the previous movies. Of course, there were some excellent special effects, such as the dementors, or flying with the hippogriff, but they seemed to be fewer and less focused-on than in the previous movies.In contrast to that, we got to hear what had happened in Harry Potter's past, and how Sirius Black was supposed to have murdered his parents and wanted revenge on him. The plot didn't develop much until we actually got to meet Sirius Black.When R.J.Lupin arrived in Sirius Black's hideout, I thought he was a villain in disguise, just like professor Quirrel in the first movie. But then when we found out that Sirius Black was on "our side", that meant R.J.Lupin was, too. When they pointed out the real criminal, I think I knew who it was several minutes in advance. Stupid Ron Weasley couldn't have realised it even if it bit him (quite literally).The most clever part of the plot, in my opinion, was the time travel. Overuse of time travel can spoil a series but this was the first time it was used in Harry Potter, and so far it worked out well.My biggest gripe about the movie was that it seemed to be cut short in the middle of the plot. The real killer was still on the loose, but then the movie ended as soon as Harry, Ron and Hermione got back to Hogwarts. I would have wanted to seem him hunted down and brought to justice.Overall, I don't think this movie was much better than the previous one. It is still an excellent movie but I think "The Chamber of Secrets" is the best one so far.PS. Much kudos to the Finnish translators, who went to the trouble of inventing new Finnish-sounding words for the Harry Potter -specific names and terms instead of just using the English versions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter and the Difference of Direction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third Harry Potter film strays from both the lighter Chris Columbus movies and the book it is based on. This means that it sticks out like a sore thumb, but it is a well directed sore thumb. It is by far the most exciting of the three movies. The movie may not be quite as magical as the first two, but it does capture some of the severity of the book. The scene in the shrieking shack is tense. The scene where Harry goes into a hallway after seeing Peter on the Maurauder's Map, while not in the book, is still an effective scene. I think that it was wise to take out the center of the book, because, none of the movies written by Steven Kloves are very faithful except in structure anyway. Why keep the basic story, but slant everything and say "we are faithful"? The removal of the middle made the film easier to make exciting without that all that nasty character development that we hate so much. Fans of the book looking for a straight adaptation will be and have been disappointed. If Mike Newell can combine Columbus's whimsy with Cauron's tension, Goblet of Fire may be magical and exciting. Of course, this is assuming that Steve Kloves will stop doing the Reader's Digest versions of the books in his screenplays. The actors are growing up nicely. There is a stronger Daniel Radcliffe and a Hermonie that is ready for her date with Krum. Unfortunately, Richard Harris, who was a fine Dumbledore, is no longer with us. He is missed. The new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon is very different, but stronger in his portrayal. The music by John Williams is impressive as always. This is a very good movie that must be approached openly, although I would be very open to a version that followed the book more closely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the first two movies, I expected something similar although the tale was maturing with its characters. What I received was an incredible letdown. I realize that a different director meant a different movie, but I at least wanted a clear and understandable movie. The take jumped from scene to scene, often without connecting information. If I hadn't already read the book, I would never have known why characters were acting the way they were. Also, did anyone notice the altitude change of Hagrid's house? It wasn't that low on the mountain before, was it? I gave this movie a 5, and I'm fervently hoping for a better try next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Harry Potter didn't meet expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our family are avid Harry Potter fans, and to say that this installment of the series left us wondering what happened to the Harry Potter style is an understatement. There was so much important information left out of The Prizoner of Azkaban we wondered if it was the same story. Our oldest child who has read all five books several times (even out of order), and our second child who has also read them several times, were telling us what important things were excluded that lead into the fourth installment. For instance,leaving out Cho Chang who has a significant role in the next two books, or changing the location of Hogwarts all of a sudden- what happened to the field outside? And since when do the students dress in their street clothes all the time they're out of class? The pond in the middle of the woods is not there in the book, it is near Hagrid's hut which is not at the bottom of the hill. No hill in the book. Also. What's up with Fred and George knowing about the invisibility cloak---no one knew except Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore (whom might I add would have been better played by Ian McKellen (Gandolph from the Lord of the Rings). Also, when Snape went into the Whomping Willow he wore the invisibility cloak, in the book. Also. The broom was given to Harry for Christmas and was used in several Quiddich games, which were not shown nor were they mentioned, which brings me to wonder why the Quiddich tournament was is not mentioned as is usually is. And most importantly. The dementors do not fly---they glide on the ground; and the patronous is a stag not a shield. We do not appreciate the extreme(in our opinions) detour from the plot of the books. There were many things that should've been in, and many things that shouldn't have been in this installment. If this one does as well it will only be because of the Harry Potter name. Please do not use this director again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cry for help, what happened to emotional connection and tension? (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies are challenging to make, everyone knows that. I offer my criticism as suggestions on how to improve the future films. The movie is visually excellent and the music was great. Unfortunately, the same care or attention was not applied when it came to the direction. Unless, the director did not read the book or maybe just didn't connect with the material.It's understandable that not everything can make it to the screen so let's focus on what did because many opportunities were missed or miss directed. Harry was under so much pressure, yet it was not apparent in the film.Overall, even though it was darker, there was not much sense of danger or true connection with Harry or his feelings. As a director, one must think of what is the emotion that needs to be conveyed and then what's the best action/drama to translate and deliver it. Tension as direction to the actors and editing would have achieved greater connection to the characters and greater intensity.Establishing how miserable Harry was at home without Hedwig or word from his friends was important. Harry wanting to hide / repel Aunt Marge or Uncle Vernon forcing him to be around would have raised the stakes. When he lost it and blew her up he was too one dimensional, there was depth and angst missing.Almost getting run over by the Knight bus would have helped the audience feel his fear. Harry's anxiety and fear of expulsion at the Leaky Cauldron did not read. The scene with the Minister of Magic sucked because to the non-reader it seemed like underage wizardry was no big deal. Harry's confusion about this, totally missed - another tension building moment lost.Harry's shame and feelings about being weak and not telling his friends what was going on in him as to not worry them was important to the character's development and why everyone relates with Harry - completely left out of the film.A story is someone with a problem, that is the beauty of dramatic structure.A character's inner struggles are what drives a film and what connects with the audience. Beyond the magic, J.K. Rowling's ability to illustrate her character's feelings is what makes the books so wonderful, satisfying, and globally accepted. The film conveyed that the patrons charm was easy for Harry - again inner struggle missed.Not dramatizing that Hermione was stressed and overwhelmed lost another chance for tension. The tension between her and Ron - not there. Mentioning that blood was on Ron's bed would have raised the stakes and would have added depth to Ron's emotions.When Snape runs into Harry in the hallway and their exchange about James missed the important fact that Harry has no idea what his Dad was like and Snape calling him on it - just one line of dialog would have added substance to Harry's struggle.Harry being visible at Hogsmeade was dumb and those kids are not. Being seen by Malfoy and his troubles with Snape would have added to the drama.While flying on Buckbeak Harry's line, "that wasn't my father, it was me" - we just saw that! Why use a redundant line that does not add anything to the scene? When a simple word or facial expression here and there would have added so much.At the end, the count down to Sirius Black's kiss of death had no tension or sense of urgency. The presence of the Minister of Magic or anyone else like Filch or Mrs. Norris would have helped.In all that was included in the third film, unfortunately too many opportunities to deepen or understand and connect to Harry were missed. Emotional depth, which is the director's responsibility, has lacked from all the films.To the producers of the next films, PLEASE have your directors focus on performances and emotional translation versus cool effects that could have been discussed in preproduction and that the Effects Department can handle.The material is wonderfully rich and deep, PLEASE do it justice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can this new director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I checked the Goblet of Fire director and thank god it's not Alfonso Cuarón.This movie was a huge disappointment.Bring back Chris Columbus! At least his movies resembled the books, which is why most people went to see the movies in the first place. I don't want some one elses interpretation, I want to see the story that I read and came to enjoy, come to life as in the first two movies. Spare me shots of leaves falling, birds flying into trees, and extended rides on the hippogriff. I'd rather see the second Quidditch match, see Hermione actually start losing her grip, and get the real explanation of how Sirius, Lupin, James Potter, and Wormtail's friendship.That's about all I have the stomach to talk about right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a real Harry Potter movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was so childish and disappointing that I wanted to slap Christopher Columbus for making me watch that crap. I thought that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was an improvement over the first movie, but still not great. Now, I wasn't interested in this movie at first until the reviews started saying that it was a great movie, I decided to give it a look at the movies, and I loved it. All of the problems from the first two movies are fixed, and the characters are given more life in this movie. The acting was better, so was the story, action, special effects, and the whole mood of the movie was dark. Everybody go see this movie, because it will make you into a Harry Potter fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continuity, What Continuity?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban lacked CONTINUITY with the previous Harry Potter Movies. Taking the reigns from Chris Columbus was a huge task and unfortunately Alfonso Cuaron wasn't up to the task. The first thing that you will notice during is that the cinematography is quite different than the previous movies. I know that the third installment of J.K. Rowling's series was darker than the other two books but Alfonso Cuaron actually made the cinematography darker also. It reminded me of the SciFi movie "Pitch Black."Creative differences aside, the Prisoner of Azkaban also lacked the accuracy of the other movies. For example, in the first scene, Harry is reading his text under the sheets using his wand for illumination. Why isn't this a violation of the edict that underage wizards can't use magic outside Hogwarts? Harry's trip on the Knight bus was very good. Harry's arrival at the Leaky Cauldron and meeting with Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic wasn't bad but what happened to Harry's trips to Diagon Alley? It would have been nice to see Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor and Quality Quidditch Supplies and get introduced to the state-of-the-art racing broom, "The Firebolt." The Hogwarts Express coach was downsized so much that getting two people, even underage wizards, into the cramped seats seemed almost impossible. What I missed the most was the splendor of the Great Hall. In this movie, it was downplayed so much that it could have been just another room at the castle. It also took me a while to recognize tiny, white-haired Professor Flitwick because he was transformed into a choir conductor with a Prince Valiant haircut and black hair color. I could go on about the lack of continuity. Such as the relocation of the castle and grounds, change in the location of the Gryffindor common room entrance, A new Fat Lady, lack of any real Quidditch matches even though Quidditch played an important part in the book, and a pitiful whomping willow but you get the picture. One of the best scenes in the movie should have been Harry rescuing Sirius from the Dementors. We expect to see a blinding, silvery Stag that charges across the lake to save Sirius. What we get is a silvery image crossing what appears to be an inlet about the width of a small pond shot from a distance. Yes, the flying scenes with Harry and Buckbeak, the hippogriff were great but took too much scene time from the other significant story threads. Like the introduction of Cedric Diggory who will play an important role in The Goblet of Fire. Last but not least, Harry's Firebolt was introduced in the last scene and it looked like it was fitted with "stirrups!"This was a very disappointing movie. Some critics say that the acting was greatly improved but as fans of Harry Potter I don't think we were expecting performances worthy of "Citizen Kane" or the "Grapes of Wrath." What we expected is a good fantasy adventure that kids and adults and see together that continues the story about a young wizard learning about his heritage and facing very difficult choices in life. The chain of continuity was badly damaged with this installment. Let's hope the Goblet of Fire can restore it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hacked job - a sequence of scenes that tell no story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning, I felt as though I'd come in 5 minutes into the start of the film; as if I'd missed some beginning section, thought I was there from the previews on. This film never got to telling a subset of the story of described in book 3, but rather was a collection of scenes depicting parts of the book, but never evolved into a coherent plot-line that one could follow or feel. I'd read the book; all the books, in fact. That did not help and so I feel those movie goers who had not read, but mearly came for a good film were even more confused and disappointed.Clearly, there was too much material to cover in the 2hours 20-something minutes of the film (does that count the last 10 minutes which is all credits?). As to be expected, some of the story had to be left out for the sake of brevity. However, this, being my favorite of the books, resulted in my least favorite of the films. And its not even related to the new, leather-cap wearing Dumbledore, whom I could get to like, despite the drastic change in appearance that was not necessary. No, its either the direction, but surely the editing or production thats too blame. For one, the scenes didn't seem to flow into a store that brought the viewer in. Then, the look of Hogwarts was totally different than the previous films. Sorry, when you are part of a series, you MUST stick to those things that have been established in previous films. Hagrids house is not down a rocky slope from the school and the whole thing is not on a mountain side as depicted... at least not from the previous films. To that I say BOO! Bad job on all responsible. Thanks for ruining a promising and wonderful world. Get off your high 'my artistic vision' horse and do the damn series the way the fans and the previous films and the books have set it up. No one gives a 'wormtails'-arse what your artistic vision of the story is. Really, we don't.Where did all of these 'standing stones' come from? Nothing of the sort was ever mentioned in the books, neither was Lupin having a mustache. If there had been a mustache - Rowling WOULD have mentioned it. Which, by the way makes me wonder, what the hell was J.K. doing other than making sure the director and producers didn't bugger up the film?In stead of wasting time on a needlessly long bus sequence and pointless whomping willow vs bird encounters, they could have spent more time telling vital story elements. A few mentions of Hermione showing up to class in the middle of it all doesn't cut it for setting the stage to her actions. Snape making 'one' mention about the 'potions' Lupin should have been taking..., if thats it, you chould have left that out since the director/producer didn't bother to develop the whole Snape-Lupin-Potion situation at all. The film felt rushed and cramped. Knowing the story, I barely could follow the events. For those not readers of the book, I feel pity for what is surely total confusion.If there is extra footage on the floor, I pray they do put it into an extended version for DVD ala Lord of the Rings.Learn your lessons and don't fudge up the next film, "Goblet of Fire", which is to already be shot and I'm expecting in the editing process now.If this is the vision of the current director, I say, bring back Chris Columbus as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dissatisfied (some SPOILERS ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparing this movie with the previous two might seem a little ludicrous considering the different director and the general tone of the movie and book, but after seeing this you can't but long for the bustling hubbub of The Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets.I have read all the books, reread the Prisoner of Azkaban most recently, but I'll try to leave off comparisons for now.As a movie itself it was unsatisfactory, and when you've read the book, it makes it that much worse. The scenes were rushed and felt contrived. No sooner where you emotionally in a scene then it hopped to another one with nothing to bridge that emotion. In what appeared to be an attempt to instill the darkness of the third book the director, and everyone else, accidentally left all the emotion behind. I felt no true sympathy for the tense and constant fear of his life that Harry had to go through during that year. It didn't seem at all apparent that he was. Though Rupert, Daniel and Emma have grown physically and as actors their performances felt wasted because of this rushing desperate need to pack as much of the action of the latter part into the book into the movie.I think one the biggest flaws was the movie was not grounded. Since this is the third movie in a series it was a ghastly mistake to introduce so many new sets and change the location of previously fixed items. However beautiful they were, it caused confusion. Very little of the movie was set in familiar scenes. A lot of what should have been crucial dialogue was set in random locations out of doors, which made little sense. With the change in location of the Whomping Willow, Hagrid's hut, the change in actress and location for the Fat Lady, with new courtyards and other new sets, if felt like a whole different place. And when you throw in the abruptness of scene transitions, it gives you a very strong feeling of being lost. There was no "home again" feeling upon returning to Hogwarts. It barely felt like Harry was at a school at all with the time they spent inside the school itself. That was one of my bigger disappointments with the movie.If they had stuck a little more to the castle and tried to instill some of the darkness there I would have felt better about it. Otherwise I was left being confused with the changes and where they were, and trying to keep track of the plot, which was not strung together well or edited. There was also little sense of time. They used the owl and the Whomping Willow to great effect to show this, but it didn't seem to "effect" much else. The whole passage of time was streamlined and gone through with a quickness that boggled the mind and made it impossible to understand where the plot was heading. There were no key ups or downs in the plot since so much was cut out that was present in the book.((SPOILERS))The Dementors, I went into this movie hearing how frightening they were. I was not frightened nor even moved. Dementors can't fly...yet they do in this movie and that steals away much of their looming, glooming, happiness sucking fear. Having something on the ground looming in closer and surrounding you, leaning over you, unable to escape by foot, then yes that would have scared the heck out of me. But having them fly made them comical in my eyes. It also causes changes to the end of the movie. Since the Dementors can fly then Harry's stag patronus has to pulse out light rather than charge them. Which steals a lot from that scene that they could have had if they had stuck a little closer to the book.((End SPOILERs))It seems the moviemakers went out of their way to be different from the first two and thereby stripped it of all the charms the book and the previous two movies had. They added in their own material, and considering the bountiful detail that Rowling instills in her books, leaving out so much original material and adding in so much new was rather inconsiderate to the fans. The more new you add the less time you have for the little things that fans of the book were hoping to get a glimpse of and never did.I've heard Chris Columbus criticized for being so slavish in keeping close to the book, but I see no fault in this. Though not perfect, by no means, he managed to capture Harry Potter in a way that Alfonso Cuarón failed miserably at. I've heard Columbus lost the subtleness of the undercurrents in the books, but now that I look back on it I think that's wrong. By recreating the books so closely those undercurrents were created as a side effect, they were not affected or forced. Cuarón's method seemed to be the opposite and it didn't work. All the whimsy of Rowling's story telling was completely and utterly lost in this new addition. Which is a sad loss for those fans who so looked forward to The Prisoner of Azkaban.The Chamber of Secrets and its themes and events (both book and movie) were dark, much darker than The Prisoner of Azkaban in truth and done to greater effect by Columbus. I think Cuarón and Steven Kloves latched onto the darkness that was present in the book and blew it out of proportion and to the detriment of the film. They also seemed to have forgotten they were making a child's film...and more disturbing yet, that they were making a Harry Potter movie...As a film: 7/10As an adaptation: 5/10As an interpretation: 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Before i saw this movie i said, "after the first 2 movies and a better book to base this one off of, How could they go Wrong??" Famous last words.First, the good. They really captured a few things perfectly if not better than expected. The Book of Monsters and Buckbeak were Awesome!! In Fact, the book of Monsters was even better than what i imagined. Buckbeak, looked REAL!! Nice combination of animatronix and CGI. Pretty impressive there. Besides this, you would be hard pressed to find much more positive about this flick.Direction and costume choices were just that, choices. They totally disregard all mage robes, pointed hats etc. I guess after spending all the money developing Dementors, they decided to cut cost by letting the kids wear jeans and t-shirts. it looked odd. The Direction wasn't all bad but it was far from good. (spoiler)The touching sceen between Black and Harry was about as touching as watching someone fry in the electric chair. And harry even blows it off. "he invited me to move in &lt;wierd expression and shrug&gt;" this is probably the most important part of the books, their relation ship. but i guess who needs story. I think he took a page from the MEn in Black Director. "i don't care what you are doing in the sceen, as long as you are constantly saying your lines" everything was rushed and confusing. OH, and those stupid segways between scenes (whomping tree shaking off snow or eating birds. the kids singing Bubble Bubble Toil and trouble) if you are planning on dropping 75% of the story, why not drop these segways (which had to be 20 minutes of the film)and instead of 75% dropped you might pull off just 50%.NEXT! they left out MAJOR HUGE plot points. &lt;spoilers&gt; 1) who is Padfoot, Prongs, wormtail 2) what was the relation ship with Harry's dad, sirus, lupin and wormtail 3) what the hell was with the glowing stag running across the pond, who btw didn't show up again when they replayed the sceen when they went back in time 4) where the map came from 5) ron's replacement pet 6)never even came close to explaining why and how sirus was framed or even WHAT really happened 7) sirus' innocents......never cleared. the only thing was Lupin saying "Oh, he's a good guy" and no mention of that again.These are the major plot points dropped not to mention dozens of small things/characters that play a major part latter. (when did Dementors start flying?)A) i am happy that this director didn't have time to do the 4th one "I will still be destroying the 3rd film much less have time to ruin another" B) I'm worried if they settled for this for the 3rd what the hell will they look at for the 4th. (Longest of the three books makes the shortest movie.) which is even longer than the 3rd. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who Hasn't read the book....you will be totally lost.How can you let this happen. J.R. can not be happy except she got the huge pay day i guess.On the beer scale, this is a 7 beer movie. you might get lucky and pass out half way through it. This movie is rated PP....Pretty Poor</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a complete disgrace to all Harry Potter fans.It was complete trash.From the bad choice of Dumbledore to the way Ron and Hermione kept touching each other, it was a waste of my time and money.It moved way too fast,not explaining anything to anybody.My family, who are not even big fans of the great HP, were greatly confused by the pace of the movie.The Maurader's Map was not explained very well,and there were many errors in the movie, such as the Whomping Willow being frozen by a spell.And Harry got his Firebolt in the middle of the book, and was taken away from him, not at the end of the movie.The characters all looked far too old,granted that they are all very excellent at their jobs.Perhaps Mrs.Rowling should push the fact that the movies are made too far apart.The choice for Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was wrong.According to the books,Sirius is supposed to be good looking.And the part where Draco dresses up as a dementor to scare Harry during the Qudditch match was left out.The Dementors were highly unoriginal,and reminded me of the Ring Wraiths in LOTR. Let's hope that Mike Newell can do better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first: I took five kids to this. Aged from six to ten. I had been warned it might be too scary for the six year old. At the end they said "so where are we going to eat?". The six year old had barely jumped. This is Not Good. The rest of the audience looked the same. Distinctly underwhelmed. It works like this:* Right, we want it dark. Let's desaturate the colour. [Like everyone who's ever mucked about with Photoshop does on their first batch of pictures, and then grows out of it]* OK, we are going to make a big thing about time at the end. Let's have a HUGE clock with a big sweeping pendulum in the hall all the way through. [If you haven't got the point of the big sweeping pendulum by the third time you see it, you clearly have no central nervous system.]* Hey, the CGI people have done a pretty good job with Buckbeak. Let's expand that bit, and squeeze all the boring story and character interaction out so we can have time for some interesting running around in the forest with CGI monsters instead. [PLEASE can film makers stop being impressed with CGI for the sake of it? I know I have."The special effects are great" is almost a gold seal for a rubbish film these days.]* And while we're at the CGI let's make the Dementors fly around in the air, that'll make them more scary. [It doesn't. For a lesson in how to make things scary six inches off the ground, watch The Gentlemen episode of Buffy.]This really is the level of thinking on which this film operates. The script has been stripped down to the bare minimum to allow the events of the story to progress as fast as possible. This is fifteen minutes shorter than the others. Why?I don't mean stripped in comparison with the book, I mean in comparison with a script that is ABOUT something. This film is about... well, nothing very much. Nothing actually HAPPENS in this movie, events just follow one another breathlessly. Regardless of whether it starts as a screenplay of a book or just a screenplay, any film needs than mere events. This seemed to have been written in shorthand, because all depth of character, all psychological development, all tension and humour have been left somewhere on the cutting room floor, if they were ever in at all. Same scriptwriter, so I hope it was all there and cut and can be put back to a DVD version. PLEASE.... And nobody tell me there was spare, efficient storytelling and it was between the lines. It wasn't. It wasn't anywhere. "So where are we going to eat?" is not the reaction to a good story.And the setting! I can take that they change the castle, filmed things somewhere else (largely on a computer it seems) but they changed the whole tone of the place. Hogwarts WAS a generous building with rolling lawns, a very clearly thriving, well-kept, comfortable, rich institution with some fine mountains around it that could be rather bleak in wintry circumstances. Suddenly it is small, seems to have lost most of its pupils (are extras suddenly costing a lot more?) is permanently miserable and there are WEEDS growing in the TINY main courtyard. Visually, this is a minor, second- or third-rate school on its last legs, not the magical equivalent of Eton. Presumably this is just another clunky shortcut to a dark and threatening atmosphere, but it simply meant that you didn't feel anything good or worthwhile was being threatened: no contrast between the world Harry is supposed to love and the thing menacing it. I gave this a two, almost entirely for the actors, who are doing a brave job with material thinned to the point of non-existence, and couldn't know that they were all going to look so grey and ill in the finished item. I hear there's another director again for the fourth film. Good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such mixed feelings about the movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the theatrical trailer for this movie, I wasn't impressed with it. The trailer was disjointed, it had very odd editing, an odd pacing, it was very short, it showed one scene that I hated the first moment I saw it (Hermione marching down a hill, yelling at Malfoy in the oddest tone, and then punching him... there's just something about that scene that I hate).Now the trailer represents the movie in a way, but the movie was at least well-made as a film. The thing I really didn't like about the movie was that it was so freakin' short! A little over two hours is just tooooooooooo little time to tell the story. It should have been longer. WAAAYYYY longer. I would have liked to see a three+ hour movie. Return of the King length at the least! The big problem of the short running time was that so much got cut out. The pacing is odd, the ending is very abrupt, but the cut parts of the book are the biggest reason that the film should have been longer.They should have taken the time to: 1) set up the Firebolt when Harry is at the Leaky Cauldon/Diagon Alley. It would have taken like 10 seconds, and was pretty important when we get to the end of the movie. 2) show the Quidditch House Cup scene. IMO, this is what made book 3 so great. Without it, the movie doesn't have a perk. Would have been a GREAT scene! 3) Show the proper ending on the train, when Harry gets the letter from Sirius. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WASN'T IN THE MOVIE! 4) Show the proper beginning, when Harry gets all the "Owl Post". They never mention his birthday, they never mention how Ron's family got the money to go to Romania (or was it Egypt? I dunno). And by the way, how did Harry perform the "Lumos" spell under his sheet without the Ministry of Magic noticing it? He's not allowed to do magic outside of school (as we see later), and I'd like to know why he was allowed to perform that spell!5) show the Sir Cadogan scenes. I don't know if these scenes were filmed, and were just deleted, since we do see Sir Cadgogan moving around in the pictures in the scene with the Fat Lady disappearing, and I'd of liked to see him taking over the entrance portrait. Other than that, most of the deletions were justifiable, and acceptable.Now... Things they shouldn't have put in: 1) the freakin' shrunken head in the Knight Bus. Enough said.2) Hermione punching Malfoy. I already mentioned this scene. As great as it is to see her hitting Malfoy, I just seriously dislike this scene. Emma Watson doesn't deliver the "you, foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!" line very well, and the horribly clichéd "That felt good." like afterwards is just so cringe-worthy. I easily could have done without this scene. I'd prefer her slapping Malfoy after he calls her a Mudblood down by the Shrieking Shack. It'd be simple, and more effective. Things that should be changed: 1) Dumbledore. Micheal Gambon is a fine actor, and of course, I never expected anyone would be able to fill Richard Harris' shoes, but... I DID expect better. Micheal Gambon just doesn't have the Dumbledore touch. He doesn't have the proper wise feel that Dumbledore should have.And what was with the bells tied around his beard??? God, I was just itching for those to be gone in at least one scene! Speaking of which, why'd they make his hair so short and cragly? And why is it so gray-looking??? Dumbledore's hair is clearly described in the book as long, straight, flowing SILVER hair!!! Richard Harris' Dumbledore had the absolute perfect hair! And they go and change that too!!! For crying out loud, THIS is the main reason why Micheal Gambon's Dumbledore just didn't look like Dumbledore. His look determines the feel you get from him, and they completely ruined it by changing his hair. I can't express how much I miss Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Of course, there's nothing anybody could do, but they COULD have re-cast better, and they COULD have kept the hair the same. 2) What was with Goyle being re-cast? Anybody know what this is about? I mean, if the original actor didn't want to do it again, fine, but why they bloody hell did they cast a skinny, small guy to play the part??? Goyle is supposed to be huge and brute-like. What the hell was that all about??? When I first saw him, I was like, "Who is that??? Don't tell me that's supposed to be Goyle!". Whoever the casting director was on this movie should be fired.3) what the BLOOODDDDYYYY HELLL was with Hagrid's Hut being re-located??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? It's not only inconsistant with the other movies, but it's wrong in regards to the book as well. Who's stupid decision was that? Same with the Womping Willow, for that matter. And what's with the ugliness??? Both Ron and Draco got way uglier between Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban. Ron looked great in CoS, and Draco looked cute and hot as hell. Then, in this movie, they both look different, they've changed for the worse. Why was Draco's hair changed? His hair was perfect in the first and second movie. Really showed his sly, slick evilness. Now, he looks like his mom cut it with a bowl on his head... what the hell???Daniel Radcliffe looks pretty hot in this movie tho! OK, now that I've gotten all the bad stuff out of the way (I'm pretty sure I got it all...), onto what I liked about the movie: I liked that the movie seemed to be taken more seriously. The dark feeling of the book was captured, and Harry's maturing was shown rather well. Daniel Radcliffe has obviously matured as an actor, and he doesn't say lines like he's reading them from prompt cards anymore. I liked the film-making aspects of the movie as well. The visual effects were very good (although I think they were a little bit better in Chamber of Secrets. Not quite as noticeable.), and I loved the shots where we go THROUGH the clock. Buckbeak was pretty well done (although he should have been a little bit bigger).I liked how they handled the scene with Aunt Marge. Harry reactions to her were pretty good, and the whole blowing up thing was done quite well. Even though it seemed rushed, it was pretty good. Towards the end, the movie just got so great all of a sudden. Right from the scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione sneak out of Hagrid's Hut, up until the end when Harry and Hermione come back into the hospital wing, the movie was great. The Time Turner thing was done well, and the little things that suggested the Time Turner were great too (the rocks (or whatever those were) being thrown into the hut, Hermione seeing something, the Executioner axing something). All handled very well. And the scene in the Shrieking Shack was great. I saw the movie with someone who hadn't read the book, and when Lupin hugs Sirius, she was like, "So predictable. The trusting ones are always evil." She fell to the trap of thinking Lupin was bad too. It was hard for me to resist saying, "No, Sirius is good!!". To be honest, I've never had such mixed feelings about a movie. I don't know whether to hate the movie because it was so different from how it should have been, or to love it because it was so different. To be honest, I'm very, very, very, very, very glad that Alfonso Cuaron is not directing Goblet of Fire. I just don't like his style. I really do wish that Christopher Columbus had kept directing, because the first two movies were great as movies AND adaptations. PoA is great as a movie, but terrible as an adaptation. I just hope this Mike Newell guy sticks more to the Columbus side of things for Goblet of Fire... AND RE-CASTS DUMBLEDORE!!! ...and puts Hagrid's Hut back where it should be! .....and he better keep the "Riddle House" chapter in!.......and the Quidditch World Cup! ..........and make the movie more than 3 hours long. Goblet of Fire better be a long movie! Overall, I'd give Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban a 6/10, because I did enjoy the entertainment side of things!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I looked forward to this film for a long time as it is my favorite book from the Harry Potter franchise. The film is visually beautiful and the cinematography is great and by my standards it is a good Hollywood film that is very enjoyable... HOWEVER... considering this film is the Third part in a series of seven it is a disaster. The simple yet ever important details(important to not only the plot of this movie but the plot of the entire Potter series) that are present in the book yet completely overlooked in the movie leave me completely disgusted with the movie. This movie had amazing potential to be the best movie of the summer season (which doesn't seem too hard) but instead we are left with a movie lacking essential details and leaving me to declare it A FAILURE OF EPIC PROPORTIONS. Have a nice day! P.S. If you haven't read the book... Do yourself a favor, forget the film exists and just READ THE BOOK, you won't regret it... I promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Harry Potter movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the third installment of the HARRY POTTER film series and it is directed by Alfonso Cuaron.HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is considered by critics and fans to be the best installment of the franchise. It is also the best-reviewed film of the series.The story follows Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and wants to murder him.The story definitely follows the book nicely, with a few new things added to it. Since Chris Columbus, director of both "Sorcerer's Stone" and "Chamber of Secrets" decided he would not direct this film, Alfonso Cuaron was chosen as director for the third film.The musical score is composed by John Williams for the last time and this was the last HP film to be rated PG. The script is solid and Steve Kloves did a really great job creating an amazing movie. The direction is very amazing and fantastic and Alfonso Cuaron knows how to make a very entertaining movie.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Bonnie Wright, Rupert Grint and Tom Felton all shine out in this film. The rest of the original cast is amazing and they have good performances in this film. Gary Oldman plays Sirius Black and he did a good job. The rest of the new actors are really good in this film.Since Richard Harris died after the second film was released, a new actor was chosen for the part and Michael Gambon would play the part.The visuals and production values are amazing and spectacular. The costumes in the film are wonderful. The pacing is still slow, but it is amazing as heck. The make-up is really interesting and this film goes down as for having the best make-up in a film in my book.The rest of the production designs are very amazing. Overall, I like HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN and this is the film that transformed this franchise from being a book adaptation franchise into a film franchise and PRISONER OF AZKABAN is a true example of a fantasy movie filmmaking.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully put together film, both in style and substance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well for me at least, having just had my third viewing of this, the third instalment in the Harry Potter franchise, and I'm pleased to report that now I'm finally at peace with how I feel about Alfonso Cuarón's delightful picture. When I first watched this film upon its DVD release, I found myself yearning for the children to be children again, it was as if the magic had gone, for the reason I liked the first two films was because they allowed me to be childlike again, was the franchise losing it's fantastical ability to draw the viewer in and make us feel magically childlike? Thankfully some four years later I'm positively beaming about it's wonderful adult aura, the professionally handled structure, and yes, the delightful magical charm at every turn.The Prisoner Of Azkaban finds Harry aged 13, back at Hogwarts with his friends he finds out that a murderous prisoner has escaped from Azkaban prison, and he's heading straight for Harry.The film suffers from its young stars not quite developing their acting skills to befit the burgeoning onset of their now teenage characters, but it's a minor complaint that's forgiven because the new additions to the adult cast are positively fabulous. One could possibly decry that Gary Oldman &amp; David Thewlis are sadly underused, and to a degree that would be a fair gripe, but both men leave such an indelible impact it helps offset the sad loss of Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Into Dumbledore's big robe comes Michael Gambon, and although he is solid, watchable, and graceful enough, he could never have hoped to achieve the magnificent aura that Harris brought to the role.Directing wise I think it's fair to say that Alfonso Cuarón was blessed with a far better script than Christopher Columbus had for the first two Potter movies, where here we get a gripping denouement and certainly the best finale of the franchise thus far. Certainly this is a darker movie, where threats of death loom large and moody imagery features throughout, but credit has to go to Cuarón for neatly pulling it all together, be it for the snow bound sequences, a Dementor attack, or a sumptuous wide angled shot of the rolling Scottish hills, it's a beautifully crafted piece of work that thrills for adults and kids alike. Stuart Craig's sets are a joy to behold, Michael Seresin's wonderfully mystical cinematography brings the whole locale into your lap, and John Williams naturally scores it with deftness personified. In short it's the technical highlight of the franchise so far and a benchmark that the others will struggle to equal. 9/10RIP Richard Harris.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A darker offering but still as magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that when I first saw the PoA, I didn't receive it as warmly as the previous two outings. However after viewing PoA again at the cinema and subsequently on DVD, I tend to believe it virtually as well done as Chamber of Secrets and hence slightly less than Philosopher's Stone. There are still the little tricks and quirks that make it 'Harry Potter' and all characters returning are great... except one. It was with great sorrow I heard the passing of Richard Harris and therefore I tried to look with respect and allow that Dumbledore is replaced by Michael Gambon and give him the benefit of the doubt. However the shoes of Richard Harris are too big for him to fill. The majesty of Dumbledore is not the same and regardless of good intentions, it detracts from the movie.But the story is interesting and engaging, though sometimes had to be explained to a younger audience. The special effects are fantastic. The kids are growing up and a lot of the silliness is disappearing, but then again (apart from the constant Radcliffe cheesy smiles) was that silliness part of the magical innocence? PoA is another good solid episode for the Harry Potter empire. And I still find it refreshing to escape the Americanised offerings that is usually the norm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meant to update this a long while back. But the movie itself got me so de-motivated, that I didn't even bother to rank it. Some moments in the movie were good - but only thanks to CGI wizardry - nothing original at all in the movie or even the story! Total crap. If I did not care to give regards to the millions of HP-fans, I'd even rank it the lowest 1. The original HP movie was the best in the series, but only because it was new (-sort of) in its genre. All sequels just lack the depth. They only rely on visual tricks to awe the audience. All shine, no ground. This is a plain kids movie - kids who need little to get awed at. I can get equals thrills and probably indulge in more intelligence more whilst watching even Thirteen Ghosts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Give up! Are the only words of support I can lend to the cast and crew. Dreadful translation from book to script and even more so from script to screen. The films get marked down time after time because Daniel Radcliffe makes a meal of it! An absolute travesty. He cannot act, he loves himself and he is so evidentially unable to act. He pulls the film down. He improves with practise and with each film but his performances are always dire. 1- Dreadful 2- Poor and 3- Below Average. 4 was probably- Below Average. By the next film he should be Average. He is improving but the quality and lack of passion in his performance was a dread and a bore, quite frankly so get some acting tips and and use them.The bad aside, the film got 2 points because of the slight hitting, target audiences got and target genre got and because of the likes of Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith and their wonderful performances, I just wish the rest of the cast would jump into line and snap into line quickly or the film will get worse, just see they will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awesome special effects, decent plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think movie wise, this was the best of the Harry Potter films. The story was OK, but of course the books are better because they have so much more detail.The special effects are incredible. At times, it looks realistic. Like when Harry is flying on the half bird/half horse creature. The animal looks like it has depth. Another example is the extremely fast bus Harry catches a ride on at the beginning. It's refreshing to see a film with good effects that don't look like they belong in a video game.The acting by the kids has gotten so much better than in the first film. Too bad some of the teachers aren't featured more like they are in the books.FINAL VERDICT: If you have watched the first two films, then I'm sure you'll be watching this one. But, if you have never read the books are seen the other movies, then you best not start off with the third film because you will be lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an avid reader and I really liked the Harry potter books. I was very very excited when I heard that warner bros. were going to film the movies. The first two were exceptional and lived up to my expectations. But.... the third one was waaaaaay below the standards set by the first two. B/c ,first, the acting was horrible,second, the geography was nothing like the other movies, third, none of the big aspects of the book were explained. People who have not read the book do not know why the stag came in Harry's patronus or what wormttail exactly did. The direction, screenplay, writing and editing were very poor. I give this HP movie a generously kind 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

There is not even an attempt to explain the story to the viewers, its just thrown in their faces. I stil dont know what to think of the silly dementors, and the main story involving Potter's family's murder.And the magic is just misssssinnnnnggg. it's so conscpicuous in its absence, it hurts. You just dont care for the characters, and what happens to them. All you see are snazzy special effects, which is no big deal. I mean even a spy kids movie has that! I truly believe that this director has managed to undo all the good effort of the previous two films. Thankfully he won't be directing the next one, so there might be something to look forward to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but many unnecessary changes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Disclaimer: Minor, non-plot-centered spoilers)I saw the midnight showing of this film, and though I feel Cuarón was successful in capturing the "darker" feel of this story, I think he simply changed too much of what Chris Columbus had set up. Most notably, I saw no reason to change the sets. I was expecting to return to the same old Hogwarts, but instead found Hagrid's house down a rocky hill as opposed to across a green meadow. The familiar courtyards and hallways from the first two films were gone as well, and were replaced with entirely new ones. I agree that using the same sets for seven (if they make them all) different films would get repetitive, but I feel that it would be possible to show a different angle, perhaps showing new areas of the castle that had not previously been shown, while still retaining what existed from earlier films.My girlfriend (who has read all of the books while I have not) pointed out many elements of the story that were just plain left out. Unless I am mistaken, this was the shortest of the first three films, despite being adapted from the longest of the first three books. Does this mean "Goblet of Fire" will be pared down to ninety minutes, and we'll leave the theaters in 2005 wondering what just hit us? After the immense success of the "Lord of the Rings" Trilogy, I feel that audiences have the attention span to sit through three-hour movies. Heck, kids can read these 800-page monstrosities that J. K. Rowling writes, so throw them a bone, Cuarón!One more minor comment: I know Michael Gambon probably wanted to create his own interpretation of Dumbledore, but I still think that he, like the director, could have followed more of what was previously set up. His accent and speech patterns reminded me more of Ian McKellen's Gandalf than Richard Harris' Dumbledore. And they at least could have given him a white beard instead of a gray one!I hope the next director finds a way to maintain a dark feel, but do so without creating a whole new set. I know that the plots necessitate changes, but there's just something comforting about coming back to the same old Hogwarts every year or so.Final rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see the first show today at 10:00 with 3 friends and my sister. During the credits it says "Based on the novel by J.K Rowling." That is dead wrong. It should say "Loosely based on the novel by J.K Rowling." The movie left out about 80 of the most important pages from the book and replaced it with things like the Hogwarts chorus and prolonged Knight Bus and hippogriff scenes. The various parts of the plot don't line up and the casting was awful. David Thewlis looked nothing like J.K Rowling's descriptions of Lupin. The whole movie is completely messed up. When I rated this movie, on a scale of 1 to 10, I gave it a 5. One word sums it all up: dissatisfied. All my friends agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie represents about 25% of the book. Much of it seems to presume that you have read the book. It is a sometimes choppy set of vignettes that barely cover the plot and provides the reader with some visual references for the book. The effects are gorgeous and I was pleasantly surprised by David Thewlis and Gary Oldman who brought Lupin and Black to life. I was also please by the Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, he brought a new strength the for the future.Gone, however, are the sense of community and most of the personal relationships of the book. There obviously wasn't time for them. This book and following books can not be properly contained in 2.5 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MAJOR plot points left out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listen, I understand that to make a movie from a book you have to leave things out. However, I believe that if a movie is going to made from a book, it should stand on its own. Meaning that you should be able to follow the movie if you haven't read the book. I have read the book, but I saw the movie with people who had not. And we got out of the movie and they were thoroughly confused. And I don't blame them, because the movie failed to explain (1) how Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban, (2) how he knew that Pettigrew was Ron's pet and therefore at Hogwarts, and (3) who the 4 Marauders were so it was confusing that Lupin understood what the map was and how it worked. This is just sloppy film making. Add a few lines here and there and it's explained. I can live without the Quiddich and the subplots from the book, but when I have to spend 15 minutes explaining things to people after the movie, the movie is a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My two word summary - "It's Awful"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Each movie in the Harry Potter series (and of course the books they are based upon) is about the experience of Harry Potter and his two closest friends as they attend Hogwarts. His experience is based upon a wonderfully detailed back-story and interaction with dozens of students, staff, and faculty at the school. I think that Alfonso Cuarón missed the whole idea of the experience at Hogwarts when filming this movie. In the end with the way the movie is cut and the story presented the movie is just a bad horror film for teenagers; a number of people compared this movie to the Goonies, which is a lot better movie. I have read that there was a stated goal to produce a two hour long movie rather than three hour long movies of the first two. I have never understood the idea of shortening a good movie, as a fan I would have seen a better movie no matter what its length three or four times in a theater, rather than just once; there are a number of missing scenes in the movie that would go along way to improving this movie. While there is of course an argument on whether you would almost have to start over to improve this incredible awful movie. Alfonso Cuarón (and others involved in production) was in my opinion in love with the stupid special effects during the movie that did not advance the story line; especially with so much of the back-story missing. The transition between the seasons was interesting, but they took too long, and after watching the deleted scenes they could have been longer. The moving pictures in the frames became a distraction, was the giraffe really necessary? The Knight's Bus scene was way to long for the length of this movie, and the talking head was annoying, and the idea that Harry Potter could lie was entirely skipped. I was upset they changed Harry time at the Leaky cauldron, skipped the scene with McGonagell and Hermione, and I could go on and on. Almost all of the foreshadowing in the book was cut from the movie; however J.K. Rowling indicates that two scenes foreshadow later movies. All in all a dismal movie another movie like this could greatly affect the status of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different...but still great. *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an avid Harry Potter fan so naturally I went to see this pretty much the day it came out in Canada. I would say it's different, but still great. Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien) did an excellent job of directing Dan, Emma and Rupert (Harry, Hermione and Ron respectively). Unlike in the previous two movies, Cuaron filmed these three in normal 'Muggle' clothes at times and not just in their robes.The young cast of Dan, Rupert and Emma were joined again by Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) and Devon Murray (Seamus Finnigan), among others. The older cast once again included Dame Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, again among many others. Newcomers this time 'round included Gary Oldman as the escaped criminal and accused murderer Sirius Black. Also new, replacing the late, great Richard Harris, is Michael Gambon, playing Headmaster of Hogwarts, Professor Albus Dumbledore. In my opinion, no one will be able to replace Mr. Harris and no one but Mr. Harris is Dumbledore. This may be just because he is new we will see.The movie was very good if not missing out on a number of things. One thing that disappointed me was the fact they didn't do much on the Shrieking Shack. That is a major plot point.Based on this and the fact that the next movie 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' (2005) has a new director, it will be interesting to see how the next movie goes, if it carries on the great legacy and the legendary boy wizard's greatness that J.K. Rowling's fantasy world is made up of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed with this film. I felt like I was being rushed though the whole movie, and too many crucial parts were left out. The total movie time was approx 2 hours and 12 minutes! I didn't like this new director's interpretation of the book. Everything was changed. I didn't feel any magic (no pun intended), and it seemed as if the movie was filmed in black &amp; white. The golden glow was gone. The teachers only had a cameo, and I didn't feel Dumbledore's presence...not to mention that his beautiful white-silver beard and hair was turned into a muddy grey. Quidditch seemed to be non-existent, and the pitch was stripped of the flowing school banners. I hope the Dementors get Cuaron so he will not mess up any more HP movies.

		<fullReview>Being an avid reader of the books and an admirer of the last two adaptations I was obviously looking forward to this new release. And whilst I realize the genuine impossibility of a literal interpretation of the books events I have some genuine problems with the film. For one, the layout of Hogwarts changed entirely from that of the first two films. The Whomping Willow is in a completely different position, as is Hagrid's hut. Important explanations were also omitted such as the reasons for Lupin and Black transforming in to their animal forms and the relevance of the stag. The short ending also left a lot of things up in the air....including Harry!! Much of this is surely to do with the introduction of a new director. However, surely with the foreknowledge that all seven books will one day be made in to film then some continuity is needed. The film did have some saving graces. The Hippogriff was very good as were the dementors and Harry and Hermiones time travel sequence. Yet all in all I can not help but feel a little let down that such a classic novel has not been done justice.</fullReview>

The scenarios are dark,we have more mystery, more tension and even more surprises during this film than the other Harry Potters.''Harry Potter and The Globet of Fire'' is the best of all Harry Potters movies until now, but 'Prisoner of Azkaban'' comes in second place because it has more adult elements than the other two previous films,making some people see that Harry Potter is not a book only for little kids. We have now Sirius Black and Lupin, two of the best characters that J.K. Rowlling already have created in all of her life. The things I feel sorry about this film are that many good explanations about Harry's family and life, and also many things about the Marauders are not showed. I also hated the actors they chose to be Sirius Black and Lupin: they are not similar to the real characters I imagined to be, and Lupin's transformation to a werewolf was terrible.Ps: This movie is okay, but the book is GREAT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series, and have read all the books several times, up until the sixth, (July 16, 2005) and this movie was for the most part, trash. It left out highly important plot keys like who Moony Wormtail Padfoot and Prongs are, how important it was that Harry's Patronus takes the shape of a Stag. The back story it lacks is highly important to the books, and if they talk about time constraint, then what about that scene where Harry rides Buckbeak the hippogriff for five minutes? The CGI is amazing but I think it would have been a lot better had they kept the back story in. The worst part of this movie is the Shrunken head, who is just down right annoying. He wasn't even in the books but added him for some reason, unknown to us all. So if you want to know what happens to Harry in his third year at Hogwarts, skip the movie, and go buy the book. It costs just as much and is much more worth it.</fullReview>

The most annoying thing was that they changed the location of the filming; Hogwarts, Hagrid's house, and the Whomping Willow were all located in different places from the previous movies and thus looked very different. The credits say it was filmed partly in Scotland, which probably accounts for the change. While the essence of the plot was intact, the pacing was slow. The best part of the movie was the Marauder's Map, which was shown throughout the final credits. While the acting was good and it was well cast, none of the new characters matched Kenneth Branagh's performance in the last film. All in all, this was a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cuaron skipped the backstory and apparently assumed everyone has read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who hasn't yet read the book, you'll do yourself no true service by seeing the movie. Harry's interaction with Dumbledore (the school's headmaster) is overwhelming absent. The parts of the story that are filled in by 3rd party dialog or interaction between Harry and other characters is woefully excised and any character development of Hermione dealing with time, her pet cat or her budding relationship with Ron is completely left out. Cuaron's version seems to be directed at hardcore Potter fans who might not mind the How's of the storyline and simply want the MAJOR plot points to fit between the books and the movie adaptation. Columbus' first two versions were true not only to the basic premise that there exists a miniature magician named Harry Potter and that he's cemented into some life and death struggle with the arch villain, Voldemort; those first two films were true to the nuances of the story. They followed the character development and told the backstory so that if you hadn't read the book (as several adults around me hadn't) you could still see the movie and not miss a beat in discussing Harry's life with your eight-year-old nephew or niece. With this installment you would be left to believe that Dementors are ghostly spirits who migrate with pack mentality and that Harry himself could lift off the whole lot of them from Azkaban just by mastering the Patronus curse (the book leans more towards a few Dementors circling him and some other people rather than 30 Dementors). I'm interested to see based on Cuaron's development (or lack thereof) of the Dementors how a future director will handle Dumbledore's assertion regarding who the Dementors will side with in the coming battle when Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge decides to try and hide that Voldemort has returned to human form in book 5 (Order of the Phoenix). Perhaps they are just Biblical demons and Voldemort is the devil incarnate. I like this story because it provides a whole new universe; a new context for fantasy and myths. Cuaron totally dropped the ball on explaining the Dementors and making them less demonic and more of a new type of creature like the books seem to imply they are.The movie further leaves out any back story regarding the difficulty of becoming an AniMagus (as Harry's father, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew did) so that never is Peter or Sirius Black's mystical ability to change into animal form even commented on other than when Ron says something to the effect of "It's a trap! He's the dog. He's an AniMagus, Harry!" No mention of why Sirius, James and even Peter decided to work so diligently at this magic trick that requires registry with the Ministry of Magic. Cuaron totally missed the opportunity to present a wonderful and engaging story by throwing in his unseasoned transitions such as Hedwig's flight from Autumn out over the lake and into Winter. Neat transition and I liked seeing Harry behind the clock hands but in my opinion Rowling tells a great story and Cuaron should stop screwing with it just to show that he is a "visionary." I saw "Y Tu Mama Tambien" and I liked it. Not something I'd take my nephew to see but it was a decent story with a nice message that it didn't have to smack the viewer in the head with. You got the point at the end. Harry Potter's storyline ain't Cuaron's venue. He's edgy and it works when there is no preconceived ideas or framework into which it needs to fit. Here, in this movie, it blew big chunks of flubberwurms.I liked the acting but the movie got in the way IMO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of the book (and I am an obsessed fan, I admit it) will be horrifically disappointed. The movie was not worth the money it took to make it. Actually, it wasn't even worth the overpriced movie ticket. A blistering failure from beginning to end. (Spoilers lie ahead) OK, a confession first: no one could ever possibly play Professor Lupin to my satisfaction. It's just simply not possible; I'm too emotionally invested in the character to accept any actor's interpretation, especially one who had never read the books. I knew before going into the theatre that I would hate the way they butchered my favorite character. But David Thewlis actually fell below my expectations. Not one thing about him was right, from that awful cheesy mustache to the watery blue eyes, to the cane he sauntered away with?yes, I said a cane. Lupin would NEVER carry a cane. But just when I thought that they had ruined Lupin's physical appearance beyond all possibility, the actor had to open his mouth. Again, everything was wrong: the voice was wrong, the charm was gone, the sweet and patient honesty was nowhere to be found. They made this proud and unflinching noble character into a simpering pile of self-pity and fear. He couldn't even say Voldemort's name, nor make mention of his 'condition' by name. And please tell me why he spends his free time chatting with students in the Forbidden Forest? Meanwhile, I had hoped his appearance would improve after the transformation, but again I was sorely misguided. Considering the exorbitant amount of money they spent on those awful lake scenes and redressing (or should I say destroying) the set, they might have bothered to get an animal trainer. Instead, they created a CGI nightmare with no aesthetic relation to a wolf. But if I spend all my time discussing the way they ruined Lupin, I'll never get on to the rest of the horror. Everyone's favorite falsely accused murderer? Horrifying. Sirius would never have a menorah tattooed to his chest. And he certainly wouldn't spend his time lecturing Harry on the meaning of life when he had the chance to finally be free. After all, Harry would just tell him to stop kidding himself; Sirius has never exactly been the ideal role model. Oh, and why exactly would Padfoot *growl* at Harry? Then there's the cheesy Grim dog, which showed up everywhere without any actual meaning behind it. Or the Quidditch match that should never have been. I was angry about them cutting Quidditch; now I'm angry that they left it in. Michael Gambon was a horrible replacement. With all his acting experience, you'd think the director would bother telling him that Dumbledore has a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, and that he would never say anything straight. Nor would Hermione, the empowered and scholarly (albeit bossy) role model, obsess over her hair, or wear anything preppy, trendy, and teenybopper-esque. But if I get started about Hermione, I'll *never* finish. The plot holes in this disaster were so large that several Mack trucks could be driven through them. Why the director decided that mentioning the authors of the Marauder's Map was a minor detail, I shan't understand. But leaving out the fact that James was an Animagus was just criminal. I won't even get into the ignored Quidditch win. The omission of the Firebolt, until the very end of the movie, and without Pig or the Hogsmeade form, was just stupid. Basically nothing was explained. Beyond that, every one of my favorite scenes was dramatically ruined. The boggart scene was abysmal; the Shrieking Shack was apparently cutting into those wonderful scenes with Buckbeak flying over the lake, so it was rushed and stupid. Oh, and they somehow left the Invisibility cloak out of the entire scene. But once Harry and Hermione went back with the Time Turner, I got fighting mad. It was overt, cheesy, melodramatic, inaccurate, and just plain stupid. Not one character behaved appropriately. Ever, in the length of the film. Well, maybe I should mention the one or two redeeming qualities that kept me from actually asking for my money back. Emma Thompson was surprisingly good, with her airy mysticism and dragonfly-like glasses. Daniel Radcliffe was just hot. And yes, I'm saying this and feeling like a pedophile. The Aunt Marge scene was pretty funny, and the Knight Bus was within the bounds of artistic license. Other than that, I give this film an enthusiastic two thumbs way, way down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked the first two movies, or the books, you won't like this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron was a very bad choice of directors. I just saw this movie today, and it was very bad. I read the book a few years ago, and I thought it was great. But everything that made the book great just seemed to be gone in the movie. I can't even put my finger on it. I think it's because of the change in directors. Alfonso Cuaron seems like a very artistic and gimmicky kind of director to me, and has no sense of story telling. Christopher Columbus told the story better, and made good movies out of it. They didn't omit anything major, and the movies ended up being wonderful. But Alfonso Cuaron cut out some of the best parts of the book, as well as the most important parts (like explaining how Sirius Black knew Peter Pettigrew was at Hogwarts, or even explaining how Sirius Black was wrongfully accused of Peter's murder). One of the worst parts of the movie is the end. It was all wrong. The Firebolt being received was a terrible way to end the movie, and it wasn't even explained who gave it to him. We never get the heartwarming letter from Sirius to tell Harry (and the audience!) that Sirius did indeed make it to safety, and that he wasn't attacked by Dementors (who can fly????) or something on his way to the mountains. There were obviously a lot of omissions from the story, and one must wonder why, when they could have put most of them in, and the movie could have been like 3 hours long, like it should have been. I don't know what they were thinking by making the movie only 2 hours and 15 minutes. The movie seemed so rushed, and incomplete. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a much better movie, and adaptation. I wish Christopher Columbus would direct again, because he really understood the story well, and made good films from it. Alfonso Cuaron seemed like he was too busy trying to make a good movie that he disregarded the importance of the story, and just crammed it all into a rushed and creepy movie that alienates it's audience. Sorry to everybody who liked it, but I thought it could have been done way better if someone else directed. Somehow, I should have figured the director Y Tu Mama Tambien would be wrong for Harry Potter! 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third movie is even less like the book than the second...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did Rowling have to write another "Harry Potter &amp; The Prisoner of Azkaban" for the film? It certainly has some likeness to the book, I'll say that much. In fact, there was some scenes after the werewolf that were what I had imagined it to be from the book, though that's nearly the end of the film. The rest of it, however was comprised of a rewritten story or highlights from parts of the book not shown in the movie. What did they film then? I guess you could say they showed enough highlights in the story that when piecemealed together, made it a movie. But there are some things in the movie that they touched only lightly on that never had any explanation in the film. Who is Messrs Moony Wormtail Padfoot &amp; Prongs? Well okay, I guess if you watch the movie, you just think it's another Rowling name for a group of mischievous wizards. You'd never consider that Moony is Lupin the werewolf, Wormtail is Pettigrew the rat, Padfoot is Black the dog and Prongs is Potter the Pronghorn. Nor would you consider at that point, they were old school chums. What was the big deal about the Firebolt? Well if you just watched the movie, you'd think it was just an equivalent replacement to Harry's splintered nimbus 2000. You'd never hear about it at the beginning of the story and how it might be enchanted with charms or curses when he gets it before the second gryffindor quidditch match and has to ride an old worn-out broom. In fact, you would never know that he got to ride it on the third quidditch match and take home the quidditch cup at the end. At least in the chamber of secrets, the only major cut they made was Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party. But it seemed such a shame that they use such a wonderful actor to play Sir Nicholas only to take away his moment in the story. I am certain that people who have not read the book will find the movie quite interesting, yet somewhat puzzling. For the readers of this story, you may have also found it disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Directing leads to an extremely disappointing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I just saw HP3 and I must say that I am very disappointed. So many plot elements were left out (quidditch cup; moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs remain unexplained) that I had to sit down with a friend who had never read the books for half an hour afterwards to explain pretty much the entire story. Also, I do not get the same feel for Hogwarts and the wizarding world as when Chris Columbus directed. I mean, the kids were wearing common street clothes most of the movie, which was ridiculous. Hardly any actual "wizarding" took place, and the climax scene where Harry produces the patronus was terribly done. During the first two movies I felt like I was taken into the wizarding world, whereas in PoA I felt like I was watching some kids running around trying to solve a mystery while some neat special effects happened. I am extremely disappointed and I'm just glad that the next movie will feature a new director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the first two movies combined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter is back and this time it's more enjoyable than the first two movies. To be honest here, I actually like this movie. I was never a fan of the first two movies because they concentrated on bringing eye gawky teenage girls than actually caring for a story, but the special effects and John Williams' music made things up for me. All the principal actors from the first two movies return; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are back as Harry, Hermione, and Ron in which the story behind the Prisoner of Azkaban is that a killer name Sirus Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the prison of Azkaban in which he is after Harry Potter and wants to kill him. Harry isn't scared, as he is ready to kill the murderer who is after him. With an all-star cast featuring Emma Thompson as a teacher and Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledor, the acting is superb in which not only the three main actors have matured, and the special effects and John Williams' music are ten times better than the first two.If you enjoyed the first two movies, that's fine. But I recommend this for fans and non-fans alike to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This franchise is being managed extremely well, better than any other. The `Lord of the Rings' films were all of a single whole, while these Harry Potter movies are each cognizant of what went before, changing and maturing just as would an adolescent.It has little to do with the story, of course and even less with the insipid monsters and threats. It instead has everything to do with the philosophy of the implied narrator. In the first film, that narrator was without grounding.The second film showed a remarkable (for Hollywood) artistic sensibility in rooting the world of what we see in space. All the important shots were a matter of registration with the buildings around us, mostly the academy. All of a sudden we were aware that someone is actually paying attention to how we see what we see.The jazz in the movie world is now centered on Spanish-speaking fiilmmakers. They alone seem to have a handle on new ways of introspective folding. So the search was on to get the best Hispanic they could. This director was their third choice, but still a good one.In this case, they rooted the narrator in folded time, and here the story helps a bit. The subtle suggestion is that we the viewers are the `dementors,' who hover about and move much like the camera does. (This very same device was also used in `Van Helsing.')Rootless, then space, then time. Wonder where Chris Columbus will take us next?Emily isn't so redheaded this time.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking that bit of magic and sanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed by the changes in this movie. There was unneeded scenes of Hermoine achieving "girl power" as Draco gets beaten up... there's no "magical" feeling and all the wonderful music of the first two movies no longer exists... really lame jokes such as beating Ron's cast were scattered through out. everyone looks more "hip" with modern clothes. If anything, Potter has been dumbed down to standard pre-teen movie jokes. This was mostly the first half of the movie. The first half very much rushed the scenes of importance and jumped around so much that a non-reader would be totally confused. Instead of adding things that were unnecessary the huge plot of book three could have had more time to let each scene be presented. The Shrieking Shack scene was wonderful for the most part... the "married couple" line was exceptionally amusing. Oldman and Thewlis were superb... sadly Snape has little character in this movie at all. The ending on the Firebolt really destroyed the feeling of this being an "epic" sort of story... lack of closure. So, if anything I can rave about Sirius and Remus but otherwise, I found much of the movie ridiculous and unnecessary and lacking. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Gloomy and Several Critical Aspects were missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge HP fan, and I admit I am not his target audience. However, I just have to agree with the previous review about the lacking in this film. I understand that you have to make certain transitions or adjustments between a book and a film. However, there were MANY things about this movie that could have been much better.The film definitely had a much darker feel to it than previous HP films. I understand that the characters are older and the situations are darker than previous books. However, it was so dark, (especially the cinematography) that it just became a dreary movie. For example, any HP fan knows that Harry was very happy to stay at the Leaky Cauldron. However, the set was so morbid and ugly, it makes it difficult to believe he would really feel "at home" there. The same goes for the way Hogwarts appeared in this film. Harry always says he "feels at home" when he's at Hogwarts much more than with the Dursleys. Again, that was pretty hard to believe given how dark and cold and dreary all of the scenery was.Lastly, I think a few critical parts of the plot were left out of this movie. For example, it's pretty important to this and future books that Harry (and the audience) understand the relationship between Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs. NO explanation is given in this movie of who they are or what their history relevant to the map is. Also, although the stag was shown briefly at the end, explaining that he was actually Prongs was also missed. I can appreciate the intensive tone towards the end of the movie with the werewolf, but it isn't true that the werewolf would have tried to kill the black dog. According to the book, they were amicable as animagus(es). Other examples include...how did Snape find them in the shrieking shack? Why did Sirius bark at Harry back on Privet drive ? Lastly, the character development was lacking. It wasn't very believable that Draco Malfoy would go from total arrogance to a whining, sniveling wimp just because Hermione hit him with the wand. There are several other examples but I will stop with those.Overall, I enjoyed the movie somewhat, but I really hope the future releases will not have the same dreary, gloomy tone. Or if they do, they at least need more humor, better character development, and better explanation of critical aspects such as those mentioned above. Personally, I think adding 45-50 more minutes to the movie for the sake of better flow and development, would have been worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disjointed and Lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit to not being a Harry Potter fan but I have seen the other two movies, and found them enjoyable so went to see the new film today.My main problem with the movie is it is so disjointed. It doesn't have a good, steady flow to storyline and jumps around way too much. You never get to see anything in the film play out from beginning to end....you suddenly join the action in progress or jump out of the action right in the middle and are suddenly at the end. I found that extremely annoying and it really hurt the film. Shoe me the whole Quiddich match...don't just join it in progress and stop it when Harry falls without showing how everyone reacted to Harry's fall. Things like this just ruined the flow and made it seem like there were huge plot holes in the film.They also didn't explain things fully in the film. They left out key parts of the book...like why the map was so important...and then would give you a rushed explanation later through character dialogue. If they had explained the map earlier, as well as the adult characters relationships to one another through their history, all the adult characters wouldn't have had to spout, in rapid fire delivery, loads of dialogue to explain their relationships with one another in the Shreiking Shack. Which left many adults in the movie theatre actually saying out loud, "What the hell?" and looking confused. If I hadn't read the book I would have been very confused as well which is a problem, you shouldn't have to read the book to enjoy the film. You should be able to at least get an idea of what is going on so you can enjoy it without prior knowledge of the story. Malfoy got very little screen time this time around and I seem to remember him having a lot more to do with the story in the book. The way that this movie made the relationship to Harry Potter, Ron, and Hermione and Malfoy look pathetic. It truly made it look like the three were bullying Malfoy and not the other way around. This is not a good thing and I really feel it did his character a dis-service. He doesn't seem as menacing now and you actually start to feel a bit sorry for him because he appears so picked on.I did like the way it showed the surroundings of Hogwarts. The hillsides, lakes, and forests were stunning though, I kept expecting to hear the "The King from the Golden Hall", complete with Norwegian fiddle, from the LOTR soundtrack to start playing as the camera swept over the hillsides and forests or orcs to attack them in the forest. I think the director did steal a bit of the countryside idea from LOTR. It was nice to finally see the surroundings of the school because it explained what was so special about it.I also liked the transitions that showed the passing of time. It was done in a really nice way...the owl flying into snowflakes which turn to snow covering the ground....the tree losing one leaf and then suddenly dropping them all. That was well done.The kids playing Potter, Hermione, and Ron are starting to really relax in their roles and grow a little as actors. Especially Daniel Radcliff. I think that they should try to keep the kids in the roles they have as long as they can because it would be a bit jarring to have to recast them. I know that they are quickly growing up so this may be impossible.The Dementors were cool and would appear very scary to small children. The effect of "sucking the soul" out of people that they do would also scare small children a lot so it really surprised me that many adults brought their small children to this film. The Dementors and the werewolf would definitely not be good for small children to watch and may give them nightmares. It will be interesting to see where this series goes and how the, even longer, next book will be brought to film. Hopefully, it will not be as disjointed as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfonso Cuaron should be sacked for his slaughtering of HP&amp;PoA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (HP&amp;PoA) tonight. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed.When I first heard that Alfonso Cuaron would be directing HP&amp;PoA I was nervous because I was afraid he would damage the franchise by putting his own personal "spin" on the movie. Unfortunately, those fears were well-founded.Unlike the first 2 movies, the storyline for HP&amp;PoA jumped around all over the place. Events did not occur in the proper order--example: Harry receiving his Firebolt at the very end of the movie/school year. Worst of all, Cuauron decided to add content to the film that wasn't in the book in the first place--example: the total re-write of how Peter Pettigrew's existence comes to light.Additionally, he did a terrible job of developing the story and plot and left out tons of important information and events, but decided to waste time (film) by including content not in the book (eating candies that make animal sounds, Malfoy passing flying notes, etc.).Also, what gives with making this the shortest movie of the HP series? Book 3 was longer than both books 1 &amp; 2, yet they decided to cut back the time. Given the fact that a movie now costs $10/person, I would rather see a 3 hour movie that does justice to the book than see a shortened movie that does a hack job on the story. (sorry guys, the movie really suffered by how much you left out). I suspect HP&amp;PoA will perform poorly in the theaters compared to the first 2 movies. I sincerely hope JK Rowling puts the Directors, Producers, and Writers feet to the fire and restores the magic for the 4th movie (here's an idea...FOLLOW THE STORY AS SHE ALREADY WROTE IT!!!). Otherwise, I think they should just terminate any future movies. Better to have no movies for books 5-7 than to have crappy ones that only disappoint loyal fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. This movie is the worst of the three. 2. The director decided to create a whole new set for the movie....So Hogwarts changes between year two and year three. 3. The firebolt scene is so cheezy, what is he playing at, this is not some cheap B-rated crap he is filming in Mexico, this is a million dollar production, at least take some filmography classes or something. 4. The filming is horrible, completely like a home-video type thing. The camera was too close to the characters. 5. The director also americanized the movie too much....where are the uniforms....they do not go prancing about the school in casual wear. 6. Who gave the director permission to change such large chunks of the script. Skip some scenes, thats OK....but do not change the damn story. 7. The director also rushed the dialogue. These people are English...and when the English speak (properly that is) they speak slowly so it can be understood....not the rushing that he was telling his actors to do. 8. The Quidditch players do not have numbers on their robes. 9. There is no giant clock that you can look out of at hogwarts. 10. The shrieking shack is not a small castle. 11. The entire story-line has no depth...I don't think he (the director) read the series, he probably read only the third book, and that too he didn't understand half of it. 12. Oliver Wood and Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup is a huge factor in this book. 13. Peter Pettigrew is supposed to be shorter than Harry not taller than Sirius. 14. Padfoot is supposed to be bigger than the werewolf. 15. The dementors do not fly, they glide along the surface. 16. And since when do they suck out the life in turns....Their presence alone make it chilly, but the only time they come in contact is to perform the Kiss. 17. The list goes on and on...At least in the other two movies, Hogwarts did not look so small, and it was definitely better filmography....Also if anything was missing it was an entire scene....unlike this one where the story itself was changed....I think JK Rowling would have something to say if she was present during filming...Here's an idea, have her consult during filming, to check the authenticity of the movie....This one was CRAP - sack the Director, get a new screen-write. Another idea, get someone who has actually been to England, and has learnt their culture to be the director, If you can't find one....pick the best you can find, and station him there for a year before you start filming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the worst movie i've ever seen. It leaves gaping plot holes, is nothing like the book and the only even almost good scene is the time travel in the end.I am a avid reader of the books, and am disappointed in the movie having so little to do with the book. The people in this movie have never read the books, or hated them to do this to the best in the series. If you have read the books, you would know the Mauruders Map and it's makers are pivotal to Harry's discovery of his father's life, and also of his trusting trusting Sirus. Sirius uses these things to get Harry to understand his past and Sirus' innocence. The movies have nothing to do with this, and tell a story of three teens trying to deal with a wizarding high school with enough angst to sicken even the darkest teen. Also, are you sure that's Hogwarts? It looks way different to me.The only good things in this movie were the special effects. As usual of the Harry Potter movies, the effects were real and yet impossible, such as the hippogriff, Buckbeak.PLEASE, WB, GET SOMEBODY WHO HAS READ THE BOOKS TO WRITE THE SCREENPLAY NEXT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S. I have been reading the comments on this site, and a startling number are positive. Who the hell are you kidding? Seriously, have you ever been to see the movie? If you have and liked it, you musn't have read the book, so tell me why Harry trusts Sirus and who created the maruder's map, both of which are piviotal to the series at large.</fullReview>

Cuarón was probably the best director this franchise had and it's a shame that he directed only one movie in the series because he captured the magic perfectly. This one was even darker than the 2nd one and I remember how dementors freaked me out as a kid but it's still nothing compared to sequels. Young actors are much better this time, especially Radcliffe. He really surprised me. Watson and Grint did a really good job too. And there is so much new actors in this movie and ,oh my god, they were brilliant. Emma Thompson was hilarious as prof. Trelawney, Timothy Spall in role I'm not gonna mention because, spoilers, and, man, Gary Oldman did such a brilliant job as Sirius Black. Michael Gambon was really good as Dumbledore but still not as good as Richard Harris (R.I.P.) who really was Dumbledore from the book. The effects also look much more realistic in this one and the flight scene with a hipogriff was spectacular and remains one of my favorite scenes in the entire series. At the end, I must say that this is the best Harry Potter movie and one of my favorite movies ever!</fullReview>

Sirius Black becomes the spoken adversary, but his presence is a bit obvious and we moviegoers are a suspicious lot. The three compadres begin to work together in more productive ways, moving the action rather than being moved by it. Hermione begins to become more flesh and blood here and deports herself well. Harry is now dealing with the horror of the potential end of his life and must make his way, discovering clues along the way, knowing that everything isn't always as it seems. Hagred and his hippogriff are pretty cool in this one and the unraveling of the plot with those spooky wraiths guarding Hogwarts is really captivating. There are a few rules that could bear some explanation. I've not read the books and would probably benefit from an occasional explanation. I'm ready for the fourth installment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rating-8/10Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third instalment of the hugely popular Harry Potter series of adapted films, and what an important one this is. This is a step up not only from the first two in the franchise, but when looking at the series as a whole, this stands as one of the very best. Technically it's beautiful, directed with an air of class and looks sinister yet underneath holds a loving and philosophical tone.This is the kind of movie that many film series just never have, one that stands out and is remembered at times as one with a slightly quirky edge to it. The whole story centres around the escape of convict Sirius Black and basically how frightened all the wizards are because of it, but that's not all this is about. Not including the Quidditch and of course magical lessons, this also contains a kind of heartbreaking story that connects with the main plot to make this an emotional ride, and one that may at times have some reaching for the tissues.Radcliffe and co return better than before, now they aren't quite top quality yet but there are signs here of what is truly to come in future careers. The addition of David Thewlis makes the teaching staff look even better at acting, Alan Rickman as the ever miserable Snape has still got it and cast members such as Robbie Coltrane(Hagrid) make's a much more emotional display. The producers(among them Christopher Columbus who directed the first two) create a cast that is imaginative yet also strangely dark, creating a lovely fresh new look for the movie's.This film cannot be reviewed without mentioning the absolutely magnificent technical achievements coursing though this piece. The cinematography is just amazingly fine, in fact watching this for the camera shots, it is beautiful and the fun ways in which it works makes it stand out to us the viewer too, all credit to Michael Seresin. The sets are well made too, dark yes but it makes this look all together much different from the first two movies, less for the children and more for the growing teenager.Alfonso Cuaron is the real mastermind behind this movie, directing it in a way I don't think anyone could have imagined. He makes it as previously mentioned quirky, and he lets the more serious scenes run their course, letting the comedy also have it's time in the limelight. Cuaron makes this just generally new looking, you'd struggle to find a fantasy film so serious yet so as if it were made to be overly crazy.Is it unique, well yes, is it smart well yes I suppose it is but the main point is emotion, now without ruining the ending it could be said emotions run high(without me saying if they're happy or sad). Harry deals with a lot in the movie, and this Harry Potter as well who lets face it, deals with an over abundance of crazy hijinks on a seemingly daily basis, or maybe that could a yearly basis actually. So overall a new take on a fantasy series that always brings something new to the frontier of movie making, it's a very good piece and one I am sure that will live on in the minds of movie fans and of course Potter fans, for many many years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Harry Potter franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10 Years after it's release, this film remains my favorite of the Harry Potter franchise. The 3 leads (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint) have settled into the characters and the world of movie making and are more than capable of steering these movies. The supporting cast of British acting royalty (Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Robert Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, David Thewliss and Gary Oldman) have a good time playing in this world and the plot is the most interesting of the series.But it is the direction of Alfonso Cuaron that sets this film apart. The first two movies, under the direction of Chris Columbus, the world of Harry Potter was established looking and feeling like a "kids" film. Under Cuaron's direction, it transformed into something much more adult. This is a darker story, so this film was shot very dark, the sets are dark, the costumes are dark and it rains constantly. It sets the mood very, very well.His use of everyday clothes (versus constantly being in their school uniforms) also adds to the realistic feel of this movie.As for the story, time travel plot lines are always tricky, but this movie pulls it off well and fairly.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start off with, when I say this review may contain spoilers, I'm not kidding. It's what makes the film great, I'm talking about it for a quarter of this short review. So be warned! I admit that the actors did well, but it's the spoilers that make this movie. Here we go!This introduces us to a new age of Harry Potter. Harry himself looks older, angrier and sadder (which can happen with age) along with Ron looking even more terrified than usual with his new look. Draco's stopped slicking back his hair, Hermione's getting older too, and Dumbledore's had a complete makeover (mainly because he's being played by Michael Gambon now.) So now we've got the new out of the way, let's see what's returned from the old films.There are still wizards, Hogwarts is still visually stunning, Hermione's still taking far too many classes and being far too clever, Ron's still got his pet rat and Harry's still trying to be killed. So far so good... but wait! What's this? Ron's pet rat is actually a man? Hermione's got a time travel device to get to classes? The murderer on the loose isn't actually a murderer, doesn't want to kill Harry and is his godfather? Played by Gary Oldman? This film certainly changes things up.It's not going crazy on the special effects like later films will, but still has that certain charm about it. It's just what makes a great film because the effects are subtle and not in-your-face. There's also some action involved - Malfoy finally gets punched after three years! It's great to see another one of the three finally making a difference (we're still waiting on Ron doing something other than being terrified of spiders, but hey, it's a start!)Finally, the way the time travel sequence is shown gives you a feeling of just what the Harry Potter films should be like - subtle, but impressive looking back on it. It's what pushes my rating of this film up to a 9. Oh, and Hagrid's here too. That's always a cause for celebration. So what are you waiting for? Buy it, rent it, do anything you can right now to just watch it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Sorcerers Stone, and The Chamber Of Secrets, so I didn't know if I'd like this one as much. But I did, and it's awesome! All of the Harry Potter movies are exactly like the books, which are also amazing. Each Potter movie gets better as they go, Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the best, Sorcerers Stone's the worst. None of them are bad, they're all 10/10 stars, but in comparison they get better as they go. In this Potter movie: Harry runs away after his Uncle Vernon's sister is swollen up to a balloon because of Harry's anger, after Harry leaves he stops after seeing a black dog, then the night bus picks him up, and then drives him to The Leaky Cauldron in London, and he stays there after talking to Cornelius Fudge about doing accidental magic on his uncles sister, which Fudge says is okay, considering it was an accident, and his anger got the best of him. He stays there for a while, then he regroups with the Weasleys and Hermione Granger. Ron's dad, Arthur, tells Harry he's in danger because of Sirius Black, the first person to escape from the wizard prison, Azkaban. Then when they aboard the train, Professor Remus Lupin, Harry, Ron, and Hermione all sit in the same compartment, and then a dementor comes and attacks Harry, a dementor sucks out your soul, it doesn't kill you, but your a empty shell, Harry lives, and is fine, thanks to Professor Remus Lupin casting the dementor away with a spell. And When they get to Hogwarts, even headmaster Dumbledore is worried about Sirius Black.Then the fat lady, one of the many living paintings, says she saw Sirius Black. All of Hogwarts goes into panic, so they put the students in the Great Hall while the teachers search the castle for Sirius Black. Soon after, quidditch comes, and it's Gryffindor against Hufflepuff. During the game, Harry sees the large black dog he saw earlier in the film, shaped like a cloud, then a hoard of dementors attack Harry. He falls off his broom and down to his death, but Dumbledore saves him with a spell, but Harry is still unconscious. When Harry awakes, his friend show him that his broom had crashed into the whomping willow. When the time comes to go to Hogsmeade, Harry is forbidden because he didn't get his permission slip signed, so Fred and George Weasley give him the marauders map, a map that shows anyone, at any time, anywhere in Hogwarts, written by Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. The map also shows a secret passage way in Hogwarts which leads to Hogsmeade, he goes through the passage and meets up with Ron and Hermione, but then he overhears Cornelius Fudge and the Hogwarts teachers talking about how Sirius Black was responsible for Harry's parents death, and another old Hogwarts student, Peter Pettigrew, who Sirius Black killed with a spell that left nothing but a finger. They go through lots of stuff, and it's awesome highly recommend, amazing movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to sing praise and write praise for this movie. I don't even consider myself a fan of the books, but this movie stuck with me over time and made a true long-lasting impression.Cuaron and Harry Potter, it seems, was a match made in heaven, however unlikely that would seem. Cuaron complimented the material and brought it to life; the material lent Cuaron vast space to work his visual trickery in. First and foremost, the camera work is wonderful: always on the move, but not without a purpose. It puts us in the center of the action, right there where it is the most exciting. It's also refreshing how Cuaron almost entirely avoids shooting dialogue in over-the-shoulder angles and rather opts for longer takes that allow the actors to move around the screen and play off each other. It feels fluent and natural.The other thing Cuaron nailed perfectly (and that wasn't present in the books): he added many, many little amusing quirky details to the movie, whether it's a stray umbrella in a stormy sky, camera going "into the mirror" and picking up the image off it (you kind of have to see it to understand what I mean), or a shot of a withering flower as a Dementor flies over it, etc -- it's abundant in small touches that produce a richly detailed picture. It's a great movie, and it's an even greater shame that Cuaron couldn't find a way to continue to work in the franchise. The results could've been glorious, I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfonso Cuaron Should've Directed the Remaining HP Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its quite fair to say that Chris Colombus did a great job with the first two Harry Potter films. I was quite unsure about what Alfonso was able to produce, but he has done it. He finally captures the true brilliance of JK's story and brilliantly puts it into a film. This film seems closest to the books and I thought it was brilliant. Perhaps the best Harry Potter film out of them all.Alfonso was able to create a film by simply following its storyline without adding any extra fancy scenes for no reason. He stuck true to the book and this is why this film is so brilliant.The characters Sirius Black and Remus Lupin make it my favourite out of them all. David Thewlis and Gary Oldman brilliantly portray the wonderful characters from JK Rowling's imagination and end up being exactly how I imagined them. Even Peter Pettigrew's role was played on very nicely.Alfonso Cuaron out did himself with that film. Its fair to say that Alfonso would've done a much better job with Goblet of Fire than the director. Alfonso would've stuck true to the book, and loyal to JK Rowling. Great Work Alfonso</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third and Best Film of All in the Harry Potter Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Cuaron, 2004), the third film in the Harry Potter series still remains my favorite of all. Not only is this movie about good conquering evil, it is also a coming of age movie for Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson). This movie continually shows how Harry, Ron and Hermione have grown and matured into their roles. The film also shows how the friendships and the bonds among the three have strengthened and grown as well. Hermione, in particular has grown into a strong adversary for Harry, not only her knowledge but her skills with magic and her wand have also improved. Above all, she deeply cares for Harry and is as pure and good as he is. Ron continues to offer some comedic relief as he grows and we love watching him. The main plot of the film is that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who was imprisoned for his part in Harry's parent's deaths has escaped Azkaban prison and is coming for Harry. The role of Sirius Black seemed to be made perfectly for Gary Oldman. He portrays Sirius with such tenacity that you find yourself fearing him and at the same time falling for him because you see goodness in him. Ultimately we are cheering for him when we find he was not to blame for Harry's parent's deaths and that he loved them dearly as well as Harry and that he is Harry's Godfather. Harry continues to fight the Dark Lord and his followers throughout the film. Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) continues his role as the nasty and unfathomable character we have grown to despise because of his harsh treatment of Harry and the underlying notion that he is fighting on the side of the Dark Lord (Ralph Fiennes) and betraying Dumbledore (Michael Sambon). The story behind this movie continues to be gripping from beginning to end. It opens with Harry struggling with his family and the struggles only increasing, to Harry struggling with the fear and reality that Sirius is coming for him and ending with Harry struggling over the threat of Voldermort coming after him. I believe what makes this film so intriguing to the fans of Harry Potter is how true it has remained to the novels. J.K. Rowling has done a magnificent job of bringing these characters and the magic to life in her novels and the reward of seeing them as we imagined while reading on screen is phenomenal. The film continues to open up new avenues for our imaginations to expand with the twists and turns. The continual use of images moving in paintings, stair cases moving and ghosts floating around Hogwarts gives the audience the overall illusion that magic truly does exist. Even though we do not see as much of the Dementors, the special lighting used allows the viewer to feel their looming, dark presence overshadowing the school. The special effects used when Harry is using the invisibility cloak and seeing his foot prints on the map help the audience to have a sense of moving along with him quietly and softly. Kudos to J.K. Rowling for writing such a fantastic series of books. The Harry Potter novels and films are truly something I will cherish for years to come. I fell in love with the characters in the books and only hoped that the movies would portray them as I had imagined. In reality, the films were much more than I could have asked for. It was a great experience watching the characters grow, endure and triumph over tragedy and evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Azkaban is better than the other Potters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The producers made their wisest decision in the Potter franchise yet by switching from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuaron in the directing position. Cuaron keeps a firm hold on the magical aspects of the story while going into darker territory. The film has more complexities and challenges the viewer more than the previous two chapters. It successfully and even compellingly exploits the intricacies from Rowling's tale and also keeps the content manageable for their marketed age range. Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban tops the other two films well and sets up the fourth chapter well. A victory for Director Alfonso Cuaron and the great cast of talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) - Expecto Patronum!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chapter 3 of the Harry Potter series, "The Prisoner of Azkaban" takes place where Harry learns about a wizarding criminal named Sirius Black who escaped Azkaban prison, sent his parents to Voldemort, and is actually Harry Potter's godfather. But it turns out that not everything is actually the same as it looks. Actually, Sirius Black was really innocent, and framed by Peter Pettigrew who actually betrayed Harry's parents, and who was in disguise all along as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. Then other stories start to happen like the new teacher is actually a werewolf, and there are these guards of Azkaban who take away souls called Dementors. But enough of the spoilers, and let's start the real review. Now, there were some moments of charming cleverness in the script, and the movie felt new, unique, and smart. There were even funny scenes in the film that included my favorite scene involving the giant Knight Bus with a Shrunken Head in control. Now although those moments were enjoying, this particular movie in the series didn't feel epic, amazing, excellent, or surprising like the first two movies were. But even though the movie wasn't that stunning like I thought it was, the movie was smart with story and characters. But still, the movie was kind of charming and magical just like the first two movies were. "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", in my review, "smart and clever, but nothing epic".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EDITEDAfter directing the first two movies in the Harry Potter franchise, Chris Columbus opted to serve as producer for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and passed the baton to Y Tu Mam Tambi (C)n director Alfonso Cuarn. Though "immensely popular" is an understatement when it comes to Harry Potter, Azkaban is somewhat of a departure from its predecessors, and particularly beloved among fans for its surprise ending. Prisoner of Azkaban also marks the introduction of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who has escaped from the title prison after 12 years of incarceration. Believed to have been the right-hand-man of the dark wizard Voldemort, whom Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) mysteriously rendered powerless during his infancy, some of those closest to Harry suspect Black has returned to exact revenge on the boy who defeated his master. Upon his return to school, however, Harry is relatively unconcerned with Black. Run by Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) -- who is widely regarded as the most powerful wizard of the age -- Hogwarts is renowned for its safety. Harry's nonchalance eventually turns to blind rage after accidentally learning the first of Black's many secrets during a field trip to a neighboring village. Of course, a loose serial killer is only one of the problems plaguing the bespectacled wizard's third year back at school -- the soul-sucking guards of Azkaban prison have been employed at Hogwarts to protect the students, but their mere presence sends Harry into crippling fainting spells. With the help of his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), and Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), Harry struggles to thwart the Dementors, find Sirius Black, and uncover the mysteries of the night that left him orphaned.now this is my most favorite and the only 5 star rated entry in the Harry Potter franchise from me. this movie is something the first two weren't, dark, haunting, mysterious and actually looked like a movie about wizards and witches and sorcerers. The near perfect made movie of this franchise thanks to Alfonso Cuarón who gave us this movie. he directed Y tu mamá también and one of my most favorite movies ever Children Of Men.movies stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis , Michael Gambon , Alan Rickman , Maggie Smith , Robbie Coltrane , Tom Felton , Emma Thompson , Julie Walters , Timothy Spall , Julie Christie , Warwick Davis , Pam Ferris , Dawn French , Jimmy Gardner , Richard Griffiths , Robert Hardy , Lenny Henry , Matthew Lewis , Adrian Rawlins , Fiona Shaw , Geraldine Somerville , John Cleese and others. introduction of Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was so good. this is one of the best children based movie ever. and also one of the most powerful children/teen fantasy adventure in years.Screenplay is just so good, nearly flawless. one of the best written. story was great and plot was breathtaking. editing and cinematography were good. art direction and special effects were excellent. as always great musical score. was nominated for 2 Oscars including Best Original Score and Best Special Effects.this an excellent and mindblowing movie. an unforgettable adventure and quite fun to watch. very scary one too. i love it so much. the last parts were spellbinding for me, one of the best moments in the entire franchise. to me this is the first true Harry Potter movie and this is what it should have looked like afterwards too. it has epicness all over it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: After blowing up his aunt Marge, Harry returns back to Hogwarts to find that mass murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban. Soul sucking beings called dementors are placed all around the school. At first trying to stay away from Sirius as much as possible, Harry soon learns that it was Sirius that sold out his parents location and led to their deaths. Review: Of all the Harry Potter movies, this one is often considered the favorite among most of the viewers. And while I love it, and say it is a rather good adaptation, I still find this to be one of the weaker films in the series. To me, it relies so much on looking nice.Now as a film, this could be the best of all of them, the lighting, direction, acting, and overall production value are amazing. But as an adaptation it falls short, such as the fact that it doesn't explain who the marauders are, and it never explained that Harry dad could turn into a Stag, so when Harry said his dad saved him, it didn't make any sense. So overall it's the best adabtaion we would get for a few more movies, but it needed to explain the back story a little more.This is the first film in the series to get a new director after Columbus, taking over is Alfanso Curon, who definitely knows how to make a film. His style is obvious as the whole way the film looks is definitely darker than the other two. The whole movie is darker as well, with Harry nearly escaping death several times, and finally learning more about how his parents died. This is also the only film in which Voldemort doesn't appear at all. And the first film in which Micheal Gambon plays Dumbledore, replacing the late Richard Harris. A lot of fans hate Gambon as Dumbledore, saying he is too mean and doesn't look the part, but I think he does a pretty good job, just no where near as good as Richard Harris. Granted his beard looked off, but he definitely acted just as quirky as Dumbledore should have.Overall, as a film it's absolutely fantastic, and even as an adaption, it's still pretty good, but it isn't my favorite in the series as others say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Series Darkens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is the third instalment in the Harry Potter series, and marks a new departure for that series in several ways. It was the first in the series to be released in summer; the original idea was for the series to consist of seven films, one of which was to be released at Christmas every year between 2001 and 2007. This schedule proved to be over-ambitious and the third film was released in midsummer 2004 rather than Christmas 2003.The film also saw a new director, Alfonso Cuarón taking over from Chris Columbus who had directed the first two films, and a new actor in the key role of Albus Dumbledore, Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris, who had died in the intervening period.Finally, the film marked a darkening in the tone of the series, something possibly attributable to the change of director but also to the content of the original novel. The "Azkaban" of the title is the prison which holds wizards who have violated the laws of magic, generally by using their powers for evil ends, and the "prisoner" is Sirius Black, a wizard who has succeeded in escaping from the prison. It is assumed that Black is a supporter of Lord Voldemort (the arch-villain of J. K. Rowling's universe) and that his intention is to kill Harry Potter.The perceptible "darkening" in this episode is both literal and metaphorical. In a literal sense the film is bleaker in appearance that its two predecessors, with many scenes being shot at night or in dim light. Cuarón uses a much darker visual palette than did Columbus. (David Yates uses a similar palette in the most recent Potter film, "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"). In the metaphorical sense the film is certainly more scary than anything in the first two films. Although this is the only film in the series in which Voldemort does not appear directly, much of the plot revolves around Rowling's most terrifying creations, the Dementors.Harry, who in the first two episodes was played as a young boy, now emerges as a rather rebellious, truculent teenager, and Daniel Radcliffe does well to suggest the difference. There are good contributions from two newcomers to the series, Gary Oldman as Sirius and David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, the seemingly mild-mannered new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who turns out to be a practising werewolf. (Rowling's names often have some relevance to the character's personality or attributes, Remus being one of the twins in Roman mythology who were raised by a she-wolf). There is another good contribution from an established cast member, Robbie Coltrane, as the genial West Country giant Rubeus Hagrid, now promoted to Teacher of Care of Magical Creatures. Gambon, however, does not yet seem quite at home with the difficult task of taking over a role first created by another actor. (He was to improve in subsequent episodes).Overall, I did not enjoy the film quite as much as the first two, possibly because by 2004 the concept no longer seemed as fresh and new as it had done in 2001. There is, however, a lot to enjoy; scenes I found particularly memorable include the journey through the streets of London on that triple-decker bus and Harry's ride on the Hippogriff Buckbeak. This was also the first film which revealed that Harry's parents were named James and Lily; as my name is James and my wife is Lily we have decided that should we have a son we will name him Harry. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is easily the best of the Harry Potter films, and there is one simple reason for that: Alfonso Cuarón! After two films done by the capable, but workmanlike Chris Columbus, Warner Brothers realised their needed a stronger storyteller for when the Harry Potter films started to turn darker, and an excellent Mexican director stepped into the frame.Set during Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts a murdered named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) escapes from Azkaban prison. Sirius was believed to be a follower of Lord Voldemort and its believed wants to kill Harry. The Minstry of Magic use a creature called Dementors to protect Hogwarts from Sirius. The Dementors can suck out happiness and the live out of people, which has a really powerful affect on Harry considering his past. Harry asks for help from the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) to help him defend himself against the Dementors. Harry overhears that not only does Sirius want to kill him, but that he used to be a friend of his parents. Sirius betrayed them, telling Voldemort where they were hiding, and kills their other best friend Peter Pettigrew. Harry swears he will kill Sirius for what he did.Cuaron has such visual flair to directing which Columbus lacked. He knows action and where the camera should be based or follow, such as the fight scenes and the scene involving the Whomping Willow. He got the pacing right, making the film shorter then the previous two, and he focused on a characters and the story. He also offered some very stylist shots, worked well with the special effects (using both CGI and traditional techniques) and got the best out of his actors. He builds the relationships between the characters, especially Harry growing anger and need for a father figure. Cuaron also shows that he is much better at handling the darker elements of the story, whilst still having time for some physical humour. The main three actors, Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all improve a lot from the first films. Radcliffe and Grint show that they have good potential in the acting world after the Harry Potter series, whilst this is Emma Watson's best performance in the film. Adding Gary Oldman into the cast is always a good way to improve film straight away, and David Thewlis is a fine addition to the film. Michael Gambon is a good replace for Richard Harris who sadly died in 2002 and Alan Rickman has a lot more to do in this film then in The Chamber of Secrets. In novel terms, Prisoner of Azkaban was when the Harry Potter started to improve and look at darker themes. It is also the only novel/film where Voldemort doesn't show up as the main protagonist in some form. J.K. Rowling, screenwriter Steve Kloves and Cuaron all hand the third act involving time travelling with real talent and tie-up all the sub-plot which was needed.Best of the Potter films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the three way tie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THe first two Harry Potter films were good. But The third film, THe Prisoner of Azkaban, was the best. The Prisoner of Azkaban is in the three way tie for best Potter film. I liked The Half-Blood Prince and The Goblet of Fire just as much. The first two films weren't as good because in the first film, the three kids were annoying. In the second film, they grew up a little bit. But by the third film, they were all grown up. Daniel Radcliffe was fifteen, Rupert Grint was sixteen, and Emma Watson was fourteen. THey had matured also. They're acting improved also. They got rid of director Chris Columbus and the stupid one liners. They gave it to Alfonso Cuaron, a way better director. The Prisoner of Azkaban was a change to the series. Things got darker and more interesting. They're are tons of new people, including Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson. THe third film is more awesome than the first two also. Introducing things like the dementors, and Animagus's. THe prisoner of Azkaban is far from a disappointment. It actually "Will broaden your mind into the future"! Emma Thompson's character says in the films. It will broaden your minds into the future of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought I hated it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...turns out I love it!For a very long time this movie was my absolute least favorite of all the HP films. It has largely to do with the fact that the cinematography changed massively from the first two to this one and I had trouble adapting to this new cinematic style.However, after a recent HP marathon I came to the conclusion that Alfonso Cuarón was able to capture the darker mood of the book much better than Chris Columbus ever would have been able to, and in fact seems to have a better grip on the universe than the following directors (read David Yates). In Columbus' movies the childlike innocence worked as Harry hasn't begun to fathom the elements of his life and his parents death, but he would not have been able to turn this book into the great movie it is. Although Cuarón changed a lot of the ways Hogwarts looks it actually is better as in this way the wildness of the Scotish mountainside really becomes much more profound.The elements of the book that were significant for understanding the story were well explained and as a coherent story it works very well. The actors all did a really good job and Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Tom Felton all showed that they have grown since the first two films and particularly Emma Watson was allowed to show her qualities as an actress (a feat she has been so incredibly denied since David Yates took over).The new characters introduced were also great casted David Thewliss as the soft spoken, haunted Remus Lupin quite simply stole every scene he had on screen with his underplaying. He fitted the part perfectly and he really conveyed the love he had for Harry's parents as well as the affection he has for Harry with exceptional artistic quality. As for the rugged and insane Sirius Black, no one else could have played the part as well as Gary Oldman. Unfortnately he isn't on screen much, but in the few scenes he has he really nails the essence of his character. Now Michael Gambon had some pretty big shoes to fill, and I feel that he never completely steps out of the shadow of Harris (which also is felt in the sequels) however I must say that he is far more like the Rowling Dumbledore in this one than in the next three films. Also Timothy Spall shows his quality as the loathsome, pitiful Peter Pettigrew and you feel that the casting director had the best luck in the world with these positions (which I generally feel as not one single character within the entire HP universe could have been played by others than those who play them). All in all Harry Potter and Prizoner of Azkaban is probably my favorite so far, tied maybe with Goblet of Fire, and I (unlike previously) would have liked to see Alfonso Cuarón finish the series as I think he would have done a far better job than David Yates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, full of magic and excitement but sort of lost the essence of Harry Potter ***spoilers***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Harry Potter Series pulled off to a great start, with two amazing adaptations created by our very own, Chris Columbus. Then I heard about this film and I was quite excited to see it and also very keen that this instalment is going to be better than the two movies I've already seen... after watching this film, I thought it was absolutely brilliant, but it could have been better. Many scenes were just too solid and dark. The new Dumbledore could have been casted better. His weirdness took hold off his warmth and calmness, which didn't give me a good impression on him.However, on the upper side, the action, adventure and magic scored points for this movie. It was a whole new side for Harry Potter, it was very unique and exceeded my expectations. The performances were top-notch, Oldman portrayed Black's character most splendidly and the talents just keep coming from Dan, Rup and Em!On the other hand, compared to the book, many significant parts were just torn off, which was a displeasure, such as Ron meeting with Black in the dormitory. And questions popped up as well (how did Sirius Black escape from Azkaban, why/how did Lupin end up as a werewolf, what happened to Pettigrew????? ) Though in summary, a fantastic movie, but sort of lost the feeling and essence of Harry Potter. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is still Number 1 and I would strongly admit that if Columbus was directing this, it would have been better.******/**********(6/10 stars)~Kalendra</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the best Harry Potter film yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a while I still had not come around to the idea that "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" was as good as some critics have said. I think I was even left a little cold by this third entry in the series when I first saw it. I still really liked the film, considering it with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" as the one of the strongest in the franchise so far. I never quite agreed that Chris Columbus's two Harry Potter films, which I loved were as weak as some critics believe but last night I found myself really coming around to the idea that "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" may be the best entry in the franchise; and even if it isn't it still a terrific movie. The director of this film is Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron, director of "Y tu mama tambien," which I have yet to see, and also the excellent "Children of Men." Even though I loved the first two Columbus films I think Cuaron is probably the best director to direct a film in the franchise. He has a keener visual sense than Columbus, meaning that Cuaron is able to make a CGI sequence like the train sequence when the Dementors first appear into a sequence that owes just as much to the way it is shot and lit as it is to the CGI artistry present. He even makes CGI-less scenes and shots very interesting. The whole movie is visually alive in a way that the first two, as great as they were, were not.As always, the actors are very good. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are the perfect actors to portray Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger. They capture the qualities in the characters that make them lovable. The adult actors like Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane are also perfectly cast as Hagrid and Professor Snape. Michael Gambon replaces Richard Harris as Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and does a wonderful job despite limited screen time.There are also new characters in this film, and new actors as well: Remus Lupin as played by David Thewlis. Lupin is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardy; and also a friend of Harry's deceased parents, Lily and James. This movie, is very much about delving into the past, as many of the Harry Potter stories are, and this story is very poignant since it is about the past of Harry Potter's parents, which involves the fact that Sirius Black, a wizard who has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban, is possibly then man who betrayed Harry's parents to Lord Voldemort.This movie is about Harry's continuing growth as a wizard, which includes learning how to defend himself from Dementors. The movie is in short, simply wonderful. I am sad that Alfonso Cuaron will not be back as director for any of the upcoming films but am glad that he got to direct a film in this wonderful franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A valiant effort bringing a truly complex book to screen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly darker than the first two instalments, and not as funny. But based upon a truly excellent but complex book, it is a very good film nonetheless. In my reviews on the first two films, I forgot to mention the music by John Williams. In all three movies, it is very good, but not Williams's best work. His scores to Star Wars, ET and Home Alone are better. The only real quibble i had with the movie was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Richard Harris, the first and better Dumbledore, had died, and although Gambon was good, Harris suited the character a lot more in terms of looks and sincerity. The three leads are still likable, and they are given solid support by Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane. The real treat lies in the newcomers though, namely David Thewlis as Lupin, Emma Thompson as Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius. Timothy Spall I felt was a little odd for Wormtail. The Dementors I felt quite terrifying, a lot more chilling than they were in the book. All in all, very good. 8/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Potter Film, But Not The Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a fabulous movie for entertainment but a teeny disappointment for avid HP book readers like myself. This time around, Harry enters his third year and he must deal with an escaped convict who is seemingly after Harry. The acting in this film is better than the first two. As the main actors(Radcliffe, Grint,and Watson)grow up, their abilities seem to improve. The supporting actors were good, but they needed a bit more screen time. Also, it's nice to see normal clothing instead of robes. The new director, Cuaron did a good job. He added a different style into this film. The music by the famous John Williams is different, but good. Finally, some sub-plots were cut out. I wished to see Harry and his win of the Quidditch cup. Other than that, this movie is pretty good. I rate this film a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read The Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the only reason to watch any of the Harry Potter movies is to be able to hold on to that Potter "magic" a little longer and to be able to see the perfect casting that was done on all the films. The perfect cast only falls short on one occasion and that was the Dumbledore replacement. I just never believed he embodied the humor and deep strength required for that role.Anyway, that said, I saw this film before I read any of the books and walked away not having a clue of what it was about. I saw it twice and still couldn't figure out what it was about. After I finally got around to reading the books and saw it again, I was able to make some sense of it. The problem was, by then I saw how much they left out and so it was unsatisfying for that reason too. Of course, it looks great but that's as far as it goes, particularly if you've read the book.I cannot understand why, when these books and films are so enormously popular worldwide as they are, why the film makers are not willing to turn each book into 2 separate films? There is SO much material, so much that is vital to the story and then to cut it out just to keep the film around 2 hours in length is criminal. Given that the cast is so strong, I can't imagine a remake in years to come ever being better than this one. My fondest wish is that they will at least do this for the last 2 books. Make 4 films please!!! People will go and love them and the film makers will make tons of money. What's wrong with that?! Think "Lord Of The Rings" and all the Oscars they received..... Oh, I hope they do Harry justice in at least the last two books!</fullReview>

Hermione's Hair, The Leacky Cauldron, Knight Bus etc etc etc. I saw Harry Potter World on the Screen, each detail of it, like chairs in The Leacky Cauldon or a knight walkin' from picture to picture on the background. Yes, i didn't see Harry Potter's 3rd book on 100%. I didn't see a story about animages, and Gambon as Dumbledore not so "dumbledored", but i see life in his eyes(sorry about Harris, but i need to say that). If u red "Albus Dumbledore's Big Game" - huge Russian theory about Harry Potter books, u will see that Gambon is those "gamer". Also, i saw atmosphere of HP. Movie - is not a book. I think it's stupid to read a book on the screen. I can read it in my armchair with cup of tea. I want to see a World. I want to see all, what i can only imagine by reading. And i saw it only in Cuaron's film. And it's cool. Thank you Alfonso, for realism and perfect book ADAPTATION.P.S. Sorry for my English. I'm Russian :P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film, but fairly badly adapted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely LOVE this film, but as a Harry Potter book fan I was slightly disappointed in how it had been adapted from the book.I saw the film before reading the book, and thought that this film was great, although there were parts that confused me, like there was no explanation why Harry's patronus was a stag, and not much explanation about the Marauders and the marauders map. Whilst this film was great cinematically, it was not very well adapted from the book. I thought this was disappointing as the film was the shortest out of all the movies released up until at least the 4th film. I think reorganising the events in the book was not very good.The film also had a bit too much 'cheese' for my liking. I did not like the end bit of Harry on the Firebolt and parts of the Whomping Willow scene.All in all, the film was really great entertainment, I was disappointed with the way it was adapted, but Alfonso Cuarón was an excellent director and this film deserves a high rating.***** Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>liked the first two better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see that I am not the only one to feel that this movie was a let down compared to the first two. Even though the first two movies may have been more child like, the movies where close in context to the book. Like Nara from Japan, I agree that the move seemed rushed and confusing, even to those who have read the books. I went with many people who had never read the books and they where not excited but still commented it was good. I wish the producers/director would have not changed the setting as much and not have changed how the children where represented (the students wore "muggle clothes" instead of wizards clothes and other details that made it what makes the book so great). Overall the more I watched the movie the more I understood it but I have read the book and listened to it on audio tape. The darkness topic just goes with the theme, as evil gets stronger, the darker the books are going to get until evil is defeated. As the Potter gang gets older and so do the subjects. It will then be according to the parents of the children watching the movie to determine if the children are mature enough/ understand enough to be watching the movie. That is why parents should supervise their children when they watch movies. The books are by far 20xs better and I would recommend reading them to your kids before watching the movie so your kids won't be so surprised about the theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While still a good movie, it's the worst of the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the worst film in the series, because too much of the style has been changed. Chris Coloumbus set a standard for how the Harry Potter universe should look. He had everything done a certain way, and it was perfect to the Harry Potter mythos. Now, a new director has come aboard with a completely different vision, and he did it his way.The story and the settings are dark, which is accurate to J.K. Rowling's book, but the style of everything seems off. In the first two movies, they wear their wizard robes through the whole film. In this, they wear their normal clothes. There's no reason given, and this isn't from the book. The story seems to rushed because the director cut so much out of the book, and then didn't come up with a way to connect everything that's in the movie. This movie just isn't as enjoyable as a Harry Potter film. It still provides a fun time of course, but it just doesn't feel the same.As always, the performances are top notch. Gary Oldman is perfect as always in the role of the wicked Sirius Black. David Thewlis is great as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher with a dark secret.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor special effects spoilt the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that once again, I am one of the few to criticise Harry Potter films (3/10 for Goblet of Fire). What spoilt this film largely for me was the special effects. The Dementors were a huge disappointment - they looked like men with pieces of black cloth over their heads. As with the Goblet of Fire, not enough time was spent on small but important details. Harry does not meet Cho in this movie, which provokes an unlikely glance at a random Ravenclaw in the fourth movie as Harry's basis for falling in love. Where was the quidditch? Where was Diggory?Sirius Black and Remus Lupin are poor caricatures of deep characters. Black is not involved enough, he just hovers at the edge of the film at all times. Lupin does not look shabby with a neatly trimmed moustache and combed hair - he looks like a Muggle businessman. The scenery also changes inconsistently with a great whoppin' bridge appearing out of nowhere and gosh, Hagrid's hut has relocated.Another detail which I forgot is the Boggart scene with the class and Lupin. As Harry steps forward, the Boggart clearly takes the shape of a Dementor, yet later on, Lupin claims he thought it would turn into Voldemort.The only redeeming feature of this film was that the actors (with the exception of Black and Lupin who weren't provided with adequate script and just didn't look like the part respectively) did well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but too much is skipped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third Harry Potter movie is a good movie. Compared to the first and second one it is different and I think that the first two movies were better. But with a new director is it normal that everything is different, and that doesn't mind a lot. There also a lot of things better, like the clothes. The Trio wears actually nice clothes and that is way better.A lot is skipped though, like Cho Chang. She appears in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, but in the book, she is there in POA. Gryffindor wins the Quidditch Cup for the first time, since Harry joined the team. I think that's very important. And at the so-called finale, in the Shrieking Shrack, Sirius and Remus are supposed to tell Harry a lot of important stuff about his parents and their past, but they don't. At the end Harry was supposed to get a note from Sirius that he was allowed to go to Hogsmeade in the future and then Ron gets his owl because it was Sirius' fault that he has rat was gone. The movie is 141 minutes, that 20 minutes shorter than Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, while the third book has more pages! The things that happen were not the same with the book either. With Christmas Harry gets a broom from Sirius, in the movie he gets it at the end. Ron and Hermione are not allowed to go into the Three Broomsticks, but in the book they're hearing too that Sirius is Harry's godfather. And so there more things that are wrong or missing.The new cast is casted well, like David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew. The animations are very good, like buck beak, Hagrid's monster book for his classes, the dementors etc. I really loved the scene when Harry flies on Buckbeak. They filmed that so well.Of course, the third book is hard to film, because there happen a lot of things and the scenes that Harry and Hermione are going back in time are very good too, but little thins are missing, that did happen in the first movies. And who knows, the fourth movie is in theaters now, and maybe that one is the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The least cartoon-like of the three films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, an installment in the Harry Potter series that has a serious amount of intelligence. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is probably the most film-like of the three movies, and definitely the least cartoon-like. It looks like Warner Brothers made a smart move by replacing the director with a professional: Alfonso Cuaron (the new director) sure gives the impression that he knows what he's doing, unlike Chris Columbus' clumsy work on the first two Harry Potter movies. Then again, Cuaron directed some great films, such as "A Little Princess" and "Y tu mama tambien", while Chris Colombus' major credits are Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire. It is quite understandable (and obvious) that Cuaron is the more professional of the two.One of the things that annoyed me the most about the first two films is how pastoral the world looked, especially the Hogwarts grounds. I always thought that the Quiddich sequences in the first two films looked abnormally fake, and they were my least favorite parts of both films. I'm not sure why I thought they looked so fake, but it was probably a combination of the shiny, spotless witness stands, the smooth, bright green grass and the perfect blue sky, and a very "fake" filming style. Cuaron changes all this. His most obvious addition to the series is just how dark he managed to make the Harry Potter world. Quiddich never looked so real. Then again, in Prisoner of Azkaban you never really see the Quiddich field, as it's raining cats and dogs (not literally). The filming style of the Quiddich came, though, is so much better than that of the Quiddich games in the first two films. Also, the Hogwarts grounds are no longer so green and perfect: they are now very muddy, with ugly, pale weeds growing all over the place, and the entire place is littered with gray rocks and boulders. It just looks so much more real than the flawless, bright green grass in the first two films. Also, there is almost never a blue sky: it's always cloudy and very murky. This was a great touch, and it was a great decision to change the pastoral look of Hogwarts to a gloomier appearance.Another thing I must praise Cuaron for is the acting he managed to squeeze out of his actors: Daniel Radcliffe's (Harry) performance in the first two films always annoyed me, but Cuaron really managed to turn him into a pretty good actor. He does a great job in expressing Harry's emotions in this film, which was very important since this is when they really start getting turbulent. Rupert Grint (Ron) doesn't really have much to do except whine and look terrified, and Emma Watson's (Hermione) acting never really bothered me. But, as usual, the actors that really shine are the adults. Alan Rickman, as usual, is stunning in his role as Snape: he truly was the perfect choice. The three newcomers were also great. David Thewlis was good as Lupin, although I always imagined Lupin's character as a much more sympathetic one, but then again his condition probably really agitates him, so his attitude in some scenes is probably appropriate for his character. Gary Oldman, as usual, is excellent in his role as Sirius Black. While we're supposed to sympathize his character, at the end of the film he still looks ruddy, dirty and slightly crazy. And last but not least, Emma Thomson was excellent in her somewhat small role as Professor Trelawney: the filmmakers made her exactly how I imagined her to be.The main problem with the film is some bad storytelling at some points. For someone who read the books, watching the movie is really no problem, because they can fill in the gaps themselves according to what was in the book and not featured in the movie, but for people who haven't read the book, the movie looked to me as very difficult to understand. There were quite a few points that something wasn't explained on screen that made somewhat of a difference in the scene, and some cases in which I wouldn't have been able to understand what was going on unless I'd have read the book (which, as I mentioned before, I did). Bottom line is, it might be a bit difficult to see this film unless you know what's going on.To sum it all up, Alfonso Cuaron, the new director, certainly proved himself as someone who knows what he's doing. He's managed to improve this film from the first two in almost every aspect: acting, mood, production design, cinematography, visual effects, and of course, direction. It's really too bad that Cuaron's not directing the fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire (this is due to the fact that filming on Goblet of Fire began while Prisoner of Azkaban was still in post-production), and I really hope that the new director will take a few leafs out of Alfonso Cuaron's book. The great thing about this film is that he's so much of a professional, movie buffs (like me, for instance) who enjoy watching "artsy" movies, will probably like this one as well, for its artistic merits (check out some great use of time as an artistic tool near the end of the movie, mostly usage of the giant clock installed in the school in some shots I described before). But, a few things that bugged me about this movie lower its value a bit. Also, the fact that I just don't like J.K. Rowling lowered its value a bit. Final evaluation: definitely worth seeing, but it might be too complex (and quite scary, at times) for the younger ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Show me the Magic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film dealing with wizardry and witchery this film is totally lacking in any kind of magic. Instead the screen is filled busy busy busy with twitching, flying, and whirring CGI gimmicks and whizbangs The whole movie is layered so deep, and cluttered up with special effects that there is precious room for anything else.The camera never stops moving too. Nearly every shot in this flick the camera is dollying, tilting, or on a crane, or on a steady cam. The only time the camera stops whanging around all over the place is when our hero faints - which he does with monotonous regularity.For all the effort that went into this film (and technically it is very impressive) I doubt if I will remember a single frame of it in a weeks time. There wasn't a single arresting image, line, or bit of business in the whole 7 hours.A mechanical, soulless bit of movie making which requires no imaginative input from the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting take on the third installment in the Harry Potter saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite of the books so far but right off the bat, I have some mixed feelings about the movie. There are some huge differences between this film and the previous installments and that's not necessarily for the best. Let's begin...Azkaban is considerably darker and more mature than the other two films. Every scene in this film is morbid and dreary with little or no humour. Rupurt Grint, normally the oddball comedian in the films, rarely gives the audience a chuckle. Not even the Great Hall gives off that warm light that normally shines during Harry, Ron, and Hermione's dinners. And judging from this, I think the box office numbers reflect that. The target audience for the Potter books is getting to that weird gangly age where they begin to lose interest in things (thankfully, I was well off the puberty train many moons ago). If the the HP crew want to keep the boulder moving, they need less talking and more action.But there are also some good things here. All the actor's voices have cracked (thank God) after passing that hunch of 13. There are fewer childish moments than in the previous films (that damn shrunken head still bothered me) but the maturity of the plot and cast keep this film afloat. The FX are not spectacular but are still quite good. But probably the best and least celebrated element of this film is the music. John William's goose-bump infused score, to me at least, is gorgeous. The music in the final scene with Sirius was actually quite beautiful. In some other thoughtful moments between Lupin and Harry, the film provides some lovely Celtic music. With myself having quite a strong Welsh background, the music actually made my day more enjoyable.All in all, if I had to compare, I'd be forced to say that "Chamber of Secrets" is the best so far out of the series. Azkaban tries hard to be good but the slow pace and morbid tone keep the score at a worthy 7. It's still worth checking out but probably not worth buying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know many people think that Prisoner of Azkaban was a great film and I agree that it was visually stunning, well directed, and much more mature than either of the previous films. There's more to a movie than that, though, especially this movie. Prisoner of Azkaban is an adaption of a book, part of a larger series, and ,most importantly, already extremely popular and well known. It is also the favorite of the series (so far) among the majority of those I have asked. There were many important issues to consider when making this movie.I think that too much of the story was sacrificed for the sake of the artistic vision in this movie. If you haven't read the book and never plan on reading the series, but do watch the movies, I'm sorry. You'll never understand how much depth Rowling put into this story, she really went to a whole new level in the Prisoner of Azkaban. There's a depth to the story and details that are weaved together in unexpected ways and you miss the majority of it by just seeing the movies. Its not that I expect every detail of the book to be in the movie, I'm a filmmaker myself, I know that there are limits to what can be done due to movie length, budget, etc. I also realize that a different director is going to have a different vision for the stories, I think that most of what Cuaron did for the film was fantastic. Even the inconsistencies that were introduced by Cuaron I could easily overlook if more of the story had remained in the movie, but its not there and its a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the books.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want the Harry Potter action, read the books. Out of all the movies so far, the Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the worst. It's not just that they had to pack so much into a few short hours, but that they completely ruined everything J. K. Rowling wrote. Rowling wrote in perfect detail how everything and everybody looked and acted, but the director ignored it all. In my mind, everything from the werewolf's appearance to the fact that the students never wore their uniforms was simply wrong. Also, if you've never read the books (like my sister), the Peter Pettigrew scene looks like a practical joke. You have no idea what's happening. A few other disappointing parts were the Patronus charms and the dementors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know a lot of parents have gotten involved in what their children are reading these days as well as their friends, myself as well. When my middle daughter took an interest in the Harry Potter Book series we made it a family project. and to the author "J.K. Rowling" you've done a great job the first five stories are great. Now back to the movies the first being "The Sorceror's Stone" was pretty close to the book and very enjoyable. the second "The Chamber of Secrets" also enjoyable and close to the book. This last movie "Prisoner of Azkaban", really disappointing. There are so many quality scenes that were over looked by the screen writers and directors I think the next movie will be hard pressed to tie all the missing points together. To put it plainly the screen writers and the director should be passed by for any further work on the Harry Potter stories.</fullReview>

I know these are trivial issues...but that glowing deer thing!!! What is going on there?the Film is very good though, I think Michael Gambon should have studied Richard Harris' Dumbledore a bit more.....Talked a bit slower and had a calm demeanor....Don't get me wrong, He is a wonderful actor...it was just tough to think of him as the same character.Overall a very good film and am looking forward to the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoever hired this director should be smacked hard. That was about the worst choice they could have possibly made for Director. He needlessly changed so much. Why change the whole look of the school? It was wonderfully magical in the first two movies. In this one it looked totally different, and to no purpose. The costumes also were terrible. Dumbledore looked more like a homeless person than a headmaster of Hogwarts. I realize you were working with a different actor, but you could at least stay true to the character from the book. And what was the deal with the kids' costumes? They were always wearing street clothes when the books made it clear they only wore clothes like that when they were in the Muggle world. Effects were okay, although I agree with a lot of other people that the werewolf stunk. It looked like he somehow stopped transforming half way through. Finally, the look, the tone of the film was all wrong. In the first two movies the muggle world was all gray and flat, reflecting Harry's view of that world. Then the wizard world at Hogwarts was colorful and vibrant because that was where Harry really came alive. This movie, though, has the wizard world all flat and gray and dingy. Why? To what purpose? I know the kids are growing up and becoming more adult, but Hogwarts shouldn't change. We could get a perfectly good picture of the kids growing up without changing the school from a vibrant magical world to a dreary awful place. I was horribly disappointed in this movie. Whoever hired this director for this movie must have been drunk to think he could pull it off. One final thing: the imdb trivia mentions that the fountain at the school has eagles eating snakes because it is the symbol on the Mexican flag where the director comes from. What rubbish! It is perfectly fine and appropriate for him to put imagery like that into a movie about Mexico. But this is a British film about a British school in Great Britain, for pity's sake! Get over yourself already and don't put pointless extra stuff in that doesn't fit in the story. Sheesh!</fullReview>

The good things were the special effects, but even then, I was more impressed with the effects in "The chamber of secrets". I thought the movie was too grey/dark in it's setup, and it did not even scratch the surface of the book.

		<fullReview>I was really disappointed w/the third movie. The new director really screwed up some key things. I hated the fact that he changed the scenery. I hated how he left things out and rearranged the storyline. From what I heard about the film, the director was trying to make this installment more "real" and a little darker than the previous two movies. He wanted to show that the kids were growing up. That's fine. However, these stories aren't based on anything "real". They're fantasy. I liked the magical quality of the first two movies. I liked seeing all the neat magical gadgets that I'd read about in the books. And I definitely appreciated the first director's efforts to stick to the books as much as possible. All the little details that make Harry Potter so special were totally discarded for the third movie. If I was JK Rowling, I would never have approved this screenplay. When the third book is longer than both of the first two, and the third movie is NOT as long as either of the first two movies, that is a dead giveaway that the story has been totally cut up and screwed up. VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED! I hope that the next director will do a better job w/#4.</fullReview>

He left out a lot of important parts. For example, why was there a deer next to harry across the lake, he didn't mention that and yet he still put the deer in the movie. I am very glad there will be a new director for the 4th installment. The actors did a great job in this movie though. The end freeze frame was also very lame and cheesy. He tried too hard to focus on being comical than being true to the book. I understand that it is a long book and you have to cut things out but he cut out too many important things in place of not so important things. He also left out the whole cute story about how his dad was one of the guys that made that map he was using, just things like that which made book so good and heart warming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A much more mature movie compared to the other ones before it. This one lacks all the special effects of the two before it, however it was really good and I found that the lack 'whiz bang' effects were a welcome change. The storyline was much easier to follow because of it and the characters were more mature with just a hint of romance - and about time. A much more individual performance was given by each actor bringing each one into their own. Harry is finally more confident and his co-stars are less like groupies to him. Nice to see more than one character get the on screen attention. I love the twist of time storyline and the surprise about the prisoner. Who would have guessed! This movie is really worth seeing as the actors have really settled into the whole amazing life a Hogwarts giving them more time to personally find their own strengths. I can't wait to see the next one (but one year is too long) so I can again see the next development stage of these characters and their talent for tricks and mischief.</fullReview>

For example I've never seen worse acting in a series of movies before. Yeah I can understand that it is hard to find good 12-year-old actors, but I want to puke every time I see Daniel Radcliffe try and throw out a punch line. In the first two films it was a treat to see one real actor in Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, but their replacement is a different story. Maybe I am being too hard on these sad movies because the books were so good, but could they have done no better? Maybe they couldn't afford any better, I mean how much has the three films grossed?

But when we saw this film, we were greatly disappointed! They took out A LOT, and added A LOT. There was a shrunken head on the night bus. They took out the quidditch cup, they took out Crookshanks' involvement with Sirius Black. They did not explain the whole "protection spell" Dumbledore used on Harry and his parents. And what was with changing Hogwarts so much?! Dememtors flying?! Sirius NOT slashing Ron's drapes with a knife?! This film being shorter than BOTH of the previous films?! That new director RUINED my second favorite Harry Potter novel! They deleted AT LEAST a hundred and fifty pages of the book, and added TOO MUCH new (and stupid) material. There was some dumb hunchback, and Harry behaved too much like a hero. The novel is 435 pages, and the fourth novel is 734 pages. I shudder to think how much they'll butcher the fourth film.

		<fullReview>Being an avid fan of all of the Harry Potter line of books I was positively salivating in the queue to see the latest installment of the movie. And quite honestly I was a bit disappointed. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry James Potter), Emma Watson(Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint(Ronald Weasley) all gave their wonderful performances but there were moments in the movie that I did not care for. My main problem was the extra footage that did not belong or add to the storyline i.e. The Frog Chorus, the shrunken head on the Knight Bus. These items were fluff and was not part of the original storyline. I believe that these two parts should have been omitted and their monies used to make Lupin a more realistic werewolf. I am sure that Alfonso Cuarón is a wonderful director but he did not capture the vision as did Chris Colombus had in the previous Potter movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No longer for little kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Over the past three years, whenever I heard someone mentioning Harry Potter and LOTR in the same breath, I got rather annoyed. Must admit though that I quite enjoyed HP 1, mainly for the novelty, although I would never have the empathy felt by someone who has experienced the British boarding school. I dozed off through part of HP 2, due as much to the dark tone as to the fact that the novelty had gone. The Prisoner of Azkaban, however, is a delightful surprise. At one time convinced that nothing would ever induce me to pick up Rowling's books, I'm now considering giving it a try, before I go to re-read LOTR the fifth time or any of Guy Gavriel Kay's novels the second or third time. But has I have not done it yet, my comments will confine entirely to the movie.Whether your thought association is with H.G. Wells, Isaac Asimov or Stephen Hawking, you will have to admit that bringing another dimension (both figuratively and literally) into the story of HP 3 is a winning move. In a way, it's marrying science fiction with fantasy, although many bookstores put them in the same section anyway. No matter how you look at it, the temporal paradox elevates HP 3 to a level considerably above the two previous ones.Even more interesting is the blurring of the line between good and evil. Sirius Black is an optical illusion that turns from evil to good. Professor Lupin is a double optical illusion that turns from good to evil, then to good again. If, however, these two are optical illusions, the Dementors will make you stop and think. Absolutely in the name of the RIGHT, this army of keeper of order turns out to the most terrifying embodiment of evil. (Does that remind you of a certain army, today, at a certain part of the world?) Also, these Dementors are far too frightening for little kids, making the PG rating somewhat incomprehensible. Some may argue that the APPEARANCE is not really that frightening, but it's the oppressive dark mood that conjures up images in an atmosphere akin to Mussorgski's Night on the Bald Mountain.While becoming less suitable for little kids, HP 3 has considerably more to offer to the adult and young adult audience population. The three principles have grown gracefully into their teenage persona. The addition of heavyweights like Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson is a further attraction. If I have a compliant, it would be that the same old opening sequence is getting rather tedious. But things start to go uphill with the appearance of the absolutely darling Shrunken Head (`Why the long faces?') in the delightful triple-deck bus ride.</fullReview>

David Thewlis did an exceptional performance as Prof. Lupin, but I did have a problem with a bald-headed werewolf.

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was made for those who haven't read the books. If it were a stand alone movie instead of one in the middle of a series it might not be so bad. Unfortunately for Harry Potter fans it is one from the middle of the series. When the series is done and you sit down to watch them one after the other this one will be a jarring note. Hogwarts has been changed inside and out. Even poor professor Flitwick doesn't look like himself.Even as a stand alone movie it has problems. The first half of the movie flies by and the poor actors have to react to situations in ways that make no sense. For example, Harry &amp; Hermione both fly off the handle with little provocation. There is absolutely no build up to give you any idea why they are reacting the way they do. Even new characters do things that make no sense - Lupin taking Harry for a walk in the Forbidden Forest (off limits to students) after he scolds Harry for walking around the inside of the school at night. Go see the movie just because you're a fan but expect to be disappointed. Here's to hoping the next director is more concerned with the total picture (the series) than his piece of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the Harry Potter books got longer I wondered how they were going to be able to transfer all of them to film. This third film starts to show us how, and to book fans it's a little painful to watch.The greatly speeded-up pace of the movie resulted in a choppiness that is almost comic book like. If you haven't seen the first two films or read the books, you haven't got enough time or information to figure out the depths of the movie's main characters.Obviously the book had to be shortened for the film, but there were simple things unnecessarily changed in the film that would have worked just fine in its original form. It was merely puzzling not entertaining.The actor who played Lupin simply did not fit the sensitive character of the book. This is probably the last film of the series I'll see.</fullReview>

Azkaban definitely included the story, but some of it was out of order (the Firebolt) and much of it did not happen at all.I'm certain it's difficult for the director to make a movie of reasonable length and include all the points of the story. A previous writer mentioned the bits left out, such explaining the behavior of Lupin and Black toward each other. This is told in the book, but barely even mentioned in the movie. The involvement of Hermione's cat was also left out, although it's not vitally important.The movie itself was okay, but I would have been more satisfied with a complete story.

		<fullReview>I recently saw a behind the scenes on t.v and heard director Alfonso Cuaron say that when he knew he was to direct he went and read the book through, I'd just like to know what book he was reading because it certainly wasn't the one I'd read several times over. If you haven't read the books then enjoy the film, if you have read the book then go to the cinema with the idea of watching an original version of what you haven't read. All the settings and characters we have enjoyed meeting in the first 2 films are totally turfed out for a darker more depressing feel, gone is Hagrid's cabin across the lawns it now can be found halfway down a mountain, Gone is the fatherly Dumbledore instead he's more like a music hall comedy magician. J.K. Rowling if you have any sympathy for your legions of book fans,oust this director from film 4 before you lose your audience. Of course I will have to buy the films on DVD otherwise you have an incomplete set, which is a very shrewd move on Warners behalf.Go see this at your peril.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I watched the film last night. If I were to describe it in a word or perhaps two, they would be "Scrappily Random". Granted, the first may not be an actual word... but I think it fits the bill quite merrily.First of all, I'd like to say that the building, the Shrieking Shack was amazing. Although the tunnel leading up to it was a little high... if one read the books, one would know.Moving on...OK, where were the arguments with Ron and Hermione? Yes, there was a few but come on! And the fact that all three of them, Harry, Hermione and Ron all promised to aid Hagrid in the appeal for Buckbeat... that was cut out.Harry's Firebolt wasn't delivered until the end of the film, and when it WAS delivered, it was without the letter! Just a bloody feather!Quidditch wasn't a major area either, and when Padfoot came to watch Harry's game (well, in the book he did), I'd kind of imagined him actually there, stood by the stands, watching... So why was he portrayed as a bloody cloud!That reminds me! The Dementors. Good lord what happened to them? I think one of the Ringwraiths from 'Lord of the Rings' would make a better Dementor than the actual Dementors of the film. And in what reality did Dementor's fly? I was under the distinct impression that they glide not far from the ground... not fly hundreds of feet in the air. From one computer generated disaster to another... What in the nine rings of hell happened with Moony? I was expecting something... something that had actually fur... and I see an anorexic Alsatian that's had all its fur shaved and that has developed the amazing ability to stand on its hind legs. The only thing remotely good about that "thing", was it's bloody HOWL!Talking of my second favourite character, why did he step in front of Mr Potter in the DADA class? "Because I was afraid it might turn into Voldemort." THE DEMENTOR WAS ALREADY Visible!!!!One more thing, at the beginning of the film... Harry was doing a Lumos spell. WHY was he doing a spell? Did his uncle not mention not 15 minutes after that particular scene that he wasn't allowed to do magic out of school!-groans-I don't know whether or not to curse the director, or curse JK Rowling for allowing it to happen.Please, anyone, someone please don't let the next directed screw up Goblet of Fire. Some silly sod destroyed my favourite book; don't let another silly sod destroy my second favourite one.Regards,C.V.Quinn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanfiction at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the net flooded with Harry Potter fanfiction I can honestly say that the stories Rowling writes seem like nothing BUT fan-fiction. (Perhaps she plays too much fluffy dungeons and dragons) Harry Potter and the Plot of Holes perhaps. A couple neat innovations and the filmmaking was good but the story and characters are barely watchable with the exception of David Thewlis who absolutely shines as Lupis. He seemd to be the only one given any meaty acting things to do. But when he's not there, there's little else of interest apart from the CGI creatures. (The Grim is probably the best of these)There's so much deus ex machina in the stories however because everything is solved by these really powerful magic items that these kids just "happen" to find or be given. Now I can accept that I suppose, but the thing I still can't buy is the illogic that hese young wizards, in all the history of Hogwart's, acquire these really powerful items yet all the adults who are all really powerful wizards and witches not only don't have any of these kinds of things but they are absolutely oblivious to items such as this and that the kids are using them. This is impossible to swallow. Since the entire plot is based on magical gadgets solving all the kids' problems, obviously there isn't much to see except special effects.Save your money and go see Shrek 2 again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would prefer Chris Columbus to direct the next Harry Potter installment. I found this installment slow and plodding. Everyone says that this installment is darker - well - Duh! - the third book is darker. I found the actors less like they are making new discoveries about themselves as budding wizards and more like bored old pros. Because of this shift, the devil-may-care feel of the first 2 seems to be lost.What seem to be a balance in the first 2 movies between what appealed to adults and to younger viewers was skewed in this movie toward adults.I found myself several times bored and falling asleep during this movie. I look forward to the next episode of Harry Potter - Hope Chris is back.Andy Smith</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first two installments were so in-line with the book, but Azkaban left out so many critical and interesting points that the story suffers for it. This movies run time was too short and while the bird flying into the Whomping Willow was cute, there were too many redundant scenes and if these were cut, there would have been more time for the important dialogue in the Shreiking Shack. The school choir was another example of this, interesting, but not in the book. Also it was disappointing that this movie did not begin with Harry's birthday and end as the first two ended. But, the dementors were absolutely fantastic, as was the Maruaders map!! Stay until the end credits are over for a small bonus; besides that the Map is worth watching the complete credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty disappointing and hard to follow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was highly anticipating this film ever since "Sorcerer's Stone", but really feel that I have been let down. I am a hardcore Harry Potter fan, and I feel that Alfonso Cuaron has left out much of the detail found in the books and the first two movies. This movie felt as if you could never follow the story unless you have already read the books. And this movie doesn't seem to fall into place with the rest of the in-progress series.The most striking change from the first films to this one is probably the set. The school of young sorcerers, Hogwarts, looks absolutely nothing like it did before. The Great Hall has apparently shrunk, the Whomping Willow is now standing right there in the middle of the lawn, and a clock tower has emerged from the building that's pendulum can easily clip students trying to enter the village of Hogsmeade. Hagrid's Hut has moved about a mile downhill, and the Fat Lady has received a change of address and an extreme makeover. Basically Hogwarts is no longer the warm, cheery, magical, welcoming castle from before, but now not much more than a haunted mansion. While this dark forebodingness goes with the dark foreboding plot of the story, it really destroys the feel of the school.The plot is choppy, jumpy. There is only the inflation of Aunt Marge - a funny little scene, by the way - of the little skirmishes and annoyances of life with the Dursleys. There is absolutely no attention on Quidditch except for that one match, the one where the dementors knock Harry out. There is not much explanation about Hogsmeade, particularly the Shrieking Shack - although Hogsmeade, the candy store, is very well done. The appearance of the Patronus is questionable, and the stag, Prongs, Harry's Patronus and the form of his father, only appears once. And could we please explain the Marauder's Map and its creators?Characters? Well, the students are adolescents now, and it really shows in Harry and Hermione. (Punching Malfoy was, well, brilliant!) But Ron is just this little arachnophobic redhead freckle-face who makes about two jokes and has a talent for whimpering. The enmity between Harry and Co. against Malfoy and Co. is displayed only occasionally. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was a poor choice, and we don't hear any of his confusing magic lectures. (Which is a bad thing.) And Lupin's werewolf form just didn't look right. It's called a wereWOLF for a reason....Still, a nice stab at the Harry Potter Hollywoodization Project, although it could have been better. Can't argue with the soundtrack... it is John Williams, people. If you have kids who think they love or at least enjoyed the first movies, make absolutely no move to resist, although remind them that it could be disappointing. If you enjoyed Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, sure, go if you'd like, but prepare to be disappointed. If you are on a strictly J.K. Rowling diet, obviously don't go. If you just wanna start the summer movies with this, then you might want to make a visit to your public library to prepare. Just don't complain if you don't and can't follow the story. Overall Rating: 6/10. Book-to-Movie Adaptation: 5/10. Casting: 7/10. Setting: 3/10. Plot: 6/10. Scripting: 5/10. Music: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brave adaptation of HP3, but not enough depth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read somewhere that Cuaron did not read Harry Potter 3 before commencing work on the movie. I was therefore NOT expecting too much when I viewed the film on opening day. (Don't expect too much and you are often pleasantly surprised) Mostly, I was disappointed in the length, and depth. The length of the film is relatively short, BUT why? There is so much from the book that was left out, you always expect that. But surely the film could be longer to fit more in. I found myself staring at the screen credits searching for more (I never do that).It was intense, and that is great, but it seemed like Harry was only at school for 2 weeks. I've never produced a movie myself, but surely some more scene repetition could be used to give the sense of depth I felt it lacked.Great use of humor! (almost "Python" like) The fat lady even surpassed the book.The movie was predicted as being "dark". That it was, but not as I would have expected. I expected a dark mood, but was more taken by the dark (or bleary) scenes. It looked cold and uninviting. Hogwarts looked derelict and unimpressive. Quiddich reminded me of a home movie of a wet day at an air show. And dementors flying? Visually they were OK, but they were too sterile. They are supposed to be vile, but came across as shrouded ghosts.Essential characters were left out. No Cho, Cedric, Percy, or Woods. There are loads of scenes just not there, too many to mention. Some are vitally important (if not essential) to this story as well as to what is to come next.That aside, it is a tremendous story, and even though I only average 3-4 films per year, I will be going to see this one again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could be construed as having minor spoilers. I found the latest of the Harry Potter films to be very unsatisfying. While the acting was good, the story line was very episodic with no flow that told a coherent story. Too many things were left out such as the winning of the Quidditch cup and the identity of the creators of the Marauder's Map. Nothing was said about Sirius giving Harry permission to visit Hogsmeade. Not enough was made of Percy making Head Boy. Other unnecessary scenes were added, The chorus singing near the beginning of the movie was cute, but not pertinent to the story or even derived from the book. The Knight bus scene was too long and some characters changed. I don't remember a hunchback at the Leaky Cauldron. The film quality looked very bad. I guess the director was trying to make a statement but it looked more like something that had been videotaped. The colors were muddy and many scenes almost appeared subtly out-of-focus.Hogwarts looked like it had fallen on bad times and they had been evicted to shabbier quarters. The books talk of a sloping lawn, not an extremely steep hillside, I thought the landscape changes were largely unnecessary and not well done. The addition of the giant clock was totally out of character with the non-mechanical world of the wizarding community in the Harry Potter books. Having the giant pendulum swinging dangerously through the hall bordered on stupidity. Clearly the director was trying to put his 'mark' on the films. He succeeded in making the film much less entertaining and less true to the author's world. The movie suffered from an attention to detail and had a very shallow feeling. There were confusing and unnecessary changes in plot and how characters acted. The shrunken heads and spinal column candlesticks should be sent back to Knockturn Alley where they belong and the director should be sent packing. If he had been responsible for the first two films I doubt they would have been nearly the success that they were.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*possible spoiler, no detail though, spoiler ends at end, where it say s "***end spoiler***"*Much like every sequel this one was by far inferior to its prequels. The movie started out with Harry using a wand in the middle of summer and continued by uncle Vernon telling him about five minutes later that he's not allowed to. Then the movie continues it's wonderful streak of mess-ups by making it clear that they're skipping out the first few chapters and condensing everything before the eventful dinner into less than two minutes. After that when Harry gets on the night bus it doesn't make objects jump out of the way, it just goes out of the way itself, through aids of time-warping magic. Shortly after harry has a Quidditch game in GOGGLES, where a few people are hit by thunder during which dementors come FLYING in. They mess up the order of all of the events, cutting out many completely and at times inserting ones that were never there. The scene with Lupin turning into a werewolf was completely ruined, along with the imitation of the werewolf. ***end spoiler*** This brings me to the few final and most crucial points, not only was Lupins werewolf self completely ruined, so was his human being. In the movie, he has completely brown hair, with no white streaks, an overly large nose, no wrinkles and a decent wardrobe. He furthermore doesn't seem to radiate energy and acts like what Sirius is supposed to in the fourth book. The rest of the actors aren't any better and all of their acting looks like a skit one would prepare in school. Even as sequels go, this one is at an all-time low, it's worse than the memorable T3 and Matrix: Revolutions. Much as it hurts me to say this as a Harry Potter fan, because of this movie I probably won't see the Goblet of Fire unless I hear some very good recommendations from some VERY reliable sources. For all of the reasons mentioned above I give this movie an undeserved 5/10 simply on the principle that it's part of the Harry Potter series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not of what i expected. The character development was absent and many important parts of the plot were missing. The direction was taken to a new level. I understand the 3rd book was a little more intense and "horror" like, but the movie presented itself in a almost "creepy" way. Also, there was minimal transitions from the 2nd movie to the 3rd movie, and left little doors open for the next movie. It almost seemed like the series could of ended with the 3rd book. The replacement of dumbledore was disappointing as well. Although no one can live up to Richard Harris's role as the famous Headmaster, the new actor could have tried to fit the role. So i hope with the new direction of the 4th movie, it will be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what movie others were viewing but the Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban I saw was a badly disjointed cinematic effort which left my date totally confused. Those who have not read the books or at least seen the previous two movies had no chance to follow the storyline, if indeed there was a storyline. The seemingly endless movie was more of a series of out-of-context skits strung together for over two hours. The misery ended for me and I sincerely hope other Harry Potter fans avoid this one as a true stinker. Defects included a failure to fully introduce two central characters, Herminone and Ron; failed to introduce other key characters like the Weasley twins and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Weasly and why these characters are important to Harry. Professor McGonagal, a key figure in ALL of the Potter novels, is almost left out of the movie and the animosity and its back story between Malfoy and Harry is never explained. The new broom from Sirius was given midway through in the book and included a delightful side story but it was a toss away scene at the end of the movie. The director didn't even bother to explain the cloak of invincibility that was used in large parts of the movie, what it was and who it first belonged to and how Harry came into possession of it. The endless failure of the director to clue in newcomers to the Potter saga makes me wonder if he ever read the book himself.If you must see this movie, Please, read the books first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst of the Harry Potter Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Columbus where are you?! Unlike the first two Harry Potter films this film was made only for those who have read the book. It is close to impossible to understand exactly what the heck is going on if you have not previously read the book. There are so many important plot pieces left open that it's mind boggling! The movie does a POOR job at explaining them and a poor job telling it to the audience which is the main goal of any movie.How does Sirius Black, Professor Lupin and Peter Pettigrew fit in with Harry's parents? The films says they were friends, but does not convey the true closeness of the group. Nor does it explain why Snape hates Harry so much. How does Professor Lupin and Sirius Black know about the use of the map and who were Wormtail, Prongs, Padfoot, and Mooney? If you read the book you'll know the answer but you'll never get it seeing this film. Why does Harry see a deer when he summons his spell? With the exception of the three main characters the rest of this talented cast is either under used or misused. Michael Gambon does not hold a lighted wand to Richard Harris's Dumbledore and is a lot less believable as the senior wizard. Over all this a great book that has been transfigured into a horrible movie. We can only hope that Mike Newell, the director of the next Harry Potter film (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), reclaims the magic that was lost on this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, the latest installment in the Harry Potter series is a bit of a disappointment, primarily due to the many changes. Not only the unavoidable replacement of the late Richard Harris with Michael Gambon, but the alterations in architecture, landscaping and costuming. It just seemed more like a retelling than a continuation of the first two movies, with the familiar Hogwarts we had got to know from the first two movies replaced with a new vision. More darkness, not as much wonder.On the positive side, the animation of Buckbeak was top-notch, and seeing Emma Thompson as the very weird Professor Trelawney was a hoot. Also the two lads playing the Weasley twins seem to be getting better actors, and their characters have lost their teenage gawkiness to be replaced with teenage cool.Personally, I hope Chris Columbus comes back and puts things back to the way they were in the first two movies he helmed personally.</fullReview>

The characters were not fleshed out at all, none of the child actors can act (They should have been replaced for this movie...children that can kind of act when they're young do not always mature into great actors in their teens), and it seemed to me that if the viewer came in with no prior knowledge of the Harry Potter, they would be lost, and what's more, I doubt they would care.

		<fullReview>I'm not sure if my expectations were just too high for the film, but when I left the theater I was left with the "that's it" feeling in my stomach. I was so excited to go, I had been waiting for what seemed an eternity to see the third installment of Harry Potter and it just wasn't as good as it could have been. By far the third book is my favorite in the series but the movie cuts out a lot of the personal interaction of the characters (especially Ron and Hermione). The movie just feels like it's moving too fast. One of my friends with whom I saw the movie, had seen both of the other two movies but had not read the books, by the end of the movie he was actually asking us to explain what in the world had happened, he had got entirely lost. This begin said, This movie was be far not the worst movie that I've seen lately. Some of my other friends actually thought that it was really good (although they were disappointed that there was not more Quidditch). I did think that it had superb special effects (as always). I just think that I liked the directing of Christopher Columbus better. Apparently, the fourth movie is going to have still another director so I'm hoping that the it will be better. I'm not going to let this disappointment turn me off of Harry Potter I am eagerly awaiting the fourth film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Effects are amazing, it's a fun spectacle.That being said: Yes, it's a freaking huge book, and there's absolutely no way to get the whole thing into the movie. But the choices they made... Fans of the book will be disappointed by the crucial plot elements that get left out, and people who've never read the book will have no idea what the hell is going on. But if the critics are any indication, people who like auteur directors apaprently will not care that this movie has plot holes you could drive the Hogwarts Express through.For example, if you haven't read the book and you've seen this, you might be asking:How does Lupin recognize the map? Who are Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs? What the hell was that stag thing I saw for 2 seconds? What just happened?Obviously, I'm a dork fan of the book, but when I see a movie adaptation I don't expect the book. I expect a movie that can stand alone, have a coherent plot and fleshed-out characters. I'd rather they cut out even more plot elements from the book, which became meaningless in the jumble of events here anyway, and devoted more time to developing the few things that were left, like the characters and relationships. And that freeze frame -- just... don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was disappointed in this film for a few reasons. I think the choice of director was poor. His darker style didn't bother me but I think the performances he achieved from his cast were stilted in many cases.I was also not impressed with the actor chosen to play Dumbledore. While Michael Gambon appears to be a very good actor, he was not suitable for the role. His portrayal of Dumbledore was not refined enough. While Dumbledore has an excellent sense of humour, he is also extremely distinguished. Gambon tried to be too much the clown.Finally, I do not think the screenplay was very faithful to the book.

		<fullReview>I mildly enjoyed it, but all this fuss about it being better than the first two is not true.If you have not seen the movie or read the book, I recommend seeing the movie first and then letting the book fill in the gaps for you.The movie's breakneck pace is too fast - you never have time to properly understand or savor anything. It's always "on to the next thing, quick!". Most of the characters besides Harry, Ron, Hermione and Lupin are cameos, including Dumbledore, McGonnagall and Snape. There is no depth.Questions answered in the book are not answered here. Why does Lupin know about the Marauder's Map? Who created the map? Why is the Patronus a stag?How does Harry trust Sirius after, oh about thirty seconds, without an adequate explanation? What potion does Lupin take and why? What is Snape's connection to Lupin? Why and how are there so many Animagi? Who is that crazy knight cavorting around the paintings? The list goes on and on. The film is good but the book is a far richer experience.There were other items I found irritating. Harry can't use magic at home, but the movie opens with him practicing a spell. X! The Whomping Willow is smaller now, in a different location and is a breeze to sneak past. XX! Crabbe and Goyle are both in the film, but Malfoy ends up most of the time hanging around with Crabbe and some other kid?? XXX!Bottom Line: I was not sure before, but now I agree that Goblet of Fire should be two movies or it will be an even more hurried affair than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really disappointed with this outing, though I realize I may be prejudiced because this was my favorite book of the series. I knew that having a new director would give a different look, I just don't think it was necessarily a good thing. There were some major things left out that could be confusing to anyone not familiar with the books. For instance in regards to the marauders map...they never explain just who Prongs, Wormtail, Padfoot or Mooney are. There may be something wrong that I know this at my age without having to reference the book...but I love these stories and its disappointing to see them tweeked on the big screen. There is also Harry's patronis taking the shape of a stag...that is never explained either. Further they didn't explain a lot about what an animagious is. Like I said, I know the books so well...maybe that is why I didn't care as much about this rendition. See the movie......but please....read the books! They are so much fun!!!!!! And if tackling a long book keeps you from wanting to read it, then get the audio books. A English actor, Jim Dale, reads them with voice inflections for each character...they are wonderful!</fullReview>

Why Sirius is innocent or who the hell is Peter? was the major questions rising in many heads and will have to be answered by Mike Newell in the fourth film , poor Mike!!Alfonso Cauron did a better job of directing in some places but we can understand easily that he doesn't really give a damn about the story. The same goes to the scriptwriters too , shame on you!!

		<fullReview>Could it be? This is so far from the source material that you must ask yourself what happened. Someone in the long order of crewpeople involved with this film must've gotten something terribly wrong for it to turn into this. Sure the main plot and all the most important scenes are there, but the end product here feels like a film where they've taken parts from one half of the book, placed it in the wrong order and then thrown in a little action from the other half of the book. I'm sure most of you agree with this? At least those of you that read the book. Some short 20 minutes or so into the film we're already more than halfway through the book and many key scenes have been dropped. And what's with the ending? Are they serious? This is from the middle of the book if I don't remember something completely wrong here, and the fact that they actually skipped almost everything quidditch, which is one of the most beloved ingredients of the Harry Potter books puzzles me. This is something that will disappoint a lot of children during the week.Don't get me wrong. I DO understand that sometimes drastic measures has to be taken in order for the film version of a book to not be overly long. I also understand that some scenes that are less important has to be thrown out and other scenes altered or sized up. However, it has been done far better before, and I just can't help that the disappointment feels more bitter that ever before. I sure hope Columbus is back for the next one. I want the MAGIC!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WITHOUT considering the book(s), POA is probably the best of the Potter movies so far. It looks and feels more real than either of the first two, thanks in large part to improved special effects and striking scenery changes. Somehow, the spirit of Potter's world is more believable than before. It kept me engaged, excited, and talking to the screen, which is pretty remarkable, considering that I'm 41.BUT YOU CAN'T CONSDER THIS MOVIE WITHOUT THE BOOK(S)! Throughout the film, vital plot and character information is sacrificed at the expense not only of this story, but of all Potter stories to come. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!The most glaring omission is the failure to identify Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. All are major characters who will play important parts in the rest of the Potter saga. Why and how they came to make The Maurauders' Map touches on a key element of their personalities, as well as their relationships to Harry and among themselves. As it stands, viewers could easily believe Lupin when he tells Snape that the map is just a Zonko's product.The POA book also sheds some light on why Snape hates Harry, Sirius, and Lupin so much...we need to know this! It is critical to future character interactions, and it adds depth and motiviation to Snape himself.More illuminating points that are omitted: How did Sirius (A) stay sane in Azakaban; (B) escape from Azkaban; and (C) know where Wormtail was? We see the newspaper clipping of the Weasley family, complete with Scabbers, in Egypt. That clipping has ONE purpose...to answer the above questions. But after a fleeting glimpse, we never see or hear about it again, and the questions remain unanswered. Padfoot: The movie creation is far too menacing and utterly unlike the shaggy, boisterous Padfoot of the books. Next movie, Padfoot must survive on hand-outs as "a lovable stray." The creature we see in PoA would inspire even a dog-lover to get the gun, not the left-over roast beef! And again, considering who Padfoot is, his animagus form should not be monstrous.Harry's Patronus: Beautifully executed on-screen, but tell us why it is a stag! In that answer lies a wealth of character expansion and emotional attachment for Harry, Daniel Radcliffe, and the viewers! Something that should be wonderfully moving is just superficially pretty.All this leads to one huge question: WHERE WAS J.K. ROWLING WHEN THE SCREENWRITER AND DIRECTOR WERE BUTCHERING HER BOOK? Has she given up all creative control? If she doesn't step in before Goblet of Fire is released, lovers of Potter's wizarding world may riot at the box office, and the gloomiest predictions Professor Trelawney can dish out will be warranted!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Joke.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After waiting an extra week to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban so I didn't have to see it with screaming children I came out of the cinema feeling deeply disappointed. *spoilers onwards*The film seems to throw the book into the bin and follow up by throwing a burning stick in there after it. The opening sequence was pathetic, Harry is practising magic at the beginning of the film, anyone who has read the books knows that underage wizards are not allowed to do this. The film even wants to point this out to us, as five minutes later we are told that Harry is not allowed to magic outside of school by his uncle... but wait? What had he just been doing?we are then suddenly greeted by Aunt Marge, this could of been a lot more subtle with this, instead they dived in two footed (soccer/football reference) and threw dialoge about that made no sense, in the book Harry and his Uncle get into a little spat before Aunt Marge arrives, and Harry is very cocky knowing he has the upper hand in the argument to get his permission slip to go into hogsmeade signed, however he suddenly brings this slip out, hands it to his Uncle and asks him to sign it, and he is told if he is good his uncle with sign it. This would never happen. and then as his uncle walks away Harry makes a remark that in the book is in struggle to get the permission slip signed.Skipping on a bit, Harry is meant to be in Magnolia cresent, where Sirius first appears, in the book Harry feels he is being watched, spins round and sees nothing, same thing happens and he sees the outline of a great big black dog. In the film, the wind picks up, the swings start to move, the lights go out, and he sees the dog, who starts Barking at him, this dog is meant to be Sirius, and why would Sirius bark at his God-son? again it makes no sense. Harry doesn't signal for the knight bus but it came anyway.With the knight bus I felt they added the shrunken head just to give Lenny Henry a part. There was no need for it, Ernnie the driver speaks for himself in the book, why not in the film. The bus in my view looked great. But didn't act how it was portrayed in the book, in the book things jumped out of its path, in this it stopped things.Only one thing annoyed me on the train is where Lupin didn't say any incarnation to produce the patronus.We get to school and apart from the song which added nothing to the film, but the feast was generally well done, the Fat Lady portrait had moved, and if the screen play writer or director even bothered to look at the book, or even the two previous films, it was located at the top of a staircase (not very well hidden is it?)we have quite a good time here until the first Quidditch match, where they play Hufflepuff with the most stupid looking goggles in the world. Hermione is meant to put a spell on Harry's glasses to repel water, which comes up in Order of the Pheonix. Then we completely forget about Quidditch from here, we don't even find out who won! (if you're still wondering but haven't read the book, it was Hufflepuff)The Maurders map was well done although, the whole seeing Peter Pedittgrew on the map by Harry kinda ruins the surprise that he is still alive and kind takes momentum away from the ending.The complete absence of Hagrids trial was a joke, the Buckbeak/Malfoy incident is a big sub-plot in the book and the film manages to sum it all up (badly) in one scene in which Hagrid is skipping stones across the lake.Christmas doesn't happen this year at Hogwarts, where Ron and Hermione's feud really starts to kick off, Harry doesn't receive the firebolt and the enquire isn't made as to whether Sirius black sent it.Guess what... No end of year exams at Hogwarts this year, The end of year exams is when the Prophecy was meant to be made, but no, this is made when Hermione storms out, and Harry not liking his divination teacher at all finds it in the goodness of his heart to return the crystal ball which has fallen down numerous flights of stairs and off of a table without smashing to the teacher where she gives Harry her prophecy.The end, harry receives a Firebolt? From who exactly? Sirius? Surely then it would be checked out, as only Dumbledore, Lupin, Ron, Hermione and Harry know Sirius is innocent it kinda ruins it again, and the train ride home, Where Harry receives a letter from Sirius with a signed Permission slip so he can go into hogsmeade next year, and Ron who gets the owl that brought the letter, is left out. Which means the next film (Goblet of Fire) will have to cover this and point out that Sirius gave Ron the Owl and Harry permission to go to Hogsmeade, so we Goblet of Fire start on the train back home from Hogwarts?Overall the film was a huge let down, and I suggest you don't read the book before watching it, and don't let the special effects fool you, it's a very mediocre film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HORRIBLE!!! (contains spoilers!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been looking forward to this movie for a very long time. i am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. when i went and sat down in the movie theater i was expecting a movie true to the book and story line. what i got got was nothing of the sort. I understand that things need to be cut in order for the length but critical things in the story were disregarded and never even mentioned. such as the origins of the mauredars map, why harry's patronomus is a stag, Cho, Cedric, and many more things that i don't have room to mention. I was very disappointed in the overall tone of the movie as well. The setting was completely different, Hogwarts looked gloomy and creepy. Lupin came of as kind of sleazy, (and i don't recall werewolves looking like skinny little chiuauas!). i hated every second of it and i hope that they choose a different director for the next movie. this movie put one of the best books in the series to shame! (What was with the chorus and the singing frogs in the beginning?!) Doesn't the director understand that wizards and witches don't wear muggle clothes?! they wear cloaks! everything about the movie was wrong. the three main actors did well for what poorly written script they had to deal with but snape and mcgonogal werent in it enough and the new dumbledore was a poor choice. i walked out of the theater thoroughly upset and disappointed! if you are a harry potter fan, save your time and money. i wish i had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed at this movie. As the book is my favorite so far, I expected much more. The casting wasn't great at all, and they missed too many important things, including the explanation of the map. I thought Emma Watson's acting has improved greatly, compared to the annoyance that it was in the first and second movies. The set of Hogwarts, to me, was much better than before. The scenes with Aunt Marge were so much better than I'd expected, and the humor of it was fantastic. I think the change in directors really improved the movie, but the screenplay shouldn't have been like it was. They should not have deleted so much stuff from the book. I thought that some parts should have been changed, but the special effects were better than Columbus' special effects. Overall, it could have been better if Rupert Grint hadn't been so whiny, and the screenplay had been different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent direction can't turn this movie into anything but a big game of Clue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being one of the hoards of pre-teen Harry Potter fans wanting to jump back into Hogwarts for another round of magic and mayhem, I was probably one of the few who went to see what acclaimed director Alfonso Cuaron of "Y Tu Mama Tambien" fame had done with the story. Would Harry and Ron take Hermione on a fun filled road trip to the beach having various erotic encounters along the way? Not likely.What I found was more of the same from the other pictures. If you are a fan and have read everything about the young wizard, you are sure to find a treat in seeing it play out on the big screen. However as just another muggle with a penchant for movie watching, the story line can be a bit boring and dare I say soap operish at times. As with the end of the last film, I felt like we were in the middle of a big game of Clue, with the Prisoner of Azkaban in the cabin with the candlestick as one of the many possible scenarios.Visually stunning and special effect full, this latest entry was a pleasure to enjoy. The camera shots are far superior to the work from the first two and you couldn't ask for better back drops for Harry and friends to fly, run, fight, and frolic as we wind down another chapter in Who Dun It mystery theater.Like Chinese food it's a fun ride but at the end a little unfulfilling. How this film avoided PG-13 for scare and violence is beyond me. 6/10 Maddis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, but uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this with my family on Saturday. We all enjoyed the first two movies, and have read the book. The movie was enjoyable, parts of it were excellent, but there was certainly a feeling of deflation when leaving.First for the best part of the movie, the new cast members, David Thewlis, as Lupin, Emma Thompson as Trelawney and Micheal Gambon as Dumbledore. Thewlis was excellent, showing a great empathy and friendship for Harry. The scene of Lupin and Harry on the bridge was perfect. Emma Thompson was spot-on as Trelawney, a role that had to be fun to play. Michael Gambon took over the role of Dumbledore seamlessly. Except for his first appearance, when I was specifically looking for the change, throughout the movie he was simply Dumbledore. Dawn French as the Fat Lady, was also fun especially for Brit-com fans.The pacing of the movie seemed odd, and there did not seem to be the attention to detail that there was in the previous movies. Previous movies had you looking in the nooks and crannies for things you might miss, this one seemed more barren. The movie leaped from introduction to conclusion in a jarringly short time. It felt like it should have been about 30 minutes longer. I don't expect every detail from the books to be included, especially in light of Rowlings increasingly bloated prose, as the series has progressed, but we got very little "life in Hogwarts" and almost no real look at Hogsmeade.The biggest losers in this rush to the finish line were two of the best cast characters though this series, Maggie Smith's Minerva McGonagall is almost completely absent, and Alan Rickman's Snape is only shown when absolutely necessary to the plot.In the end, we gave the movie a 7, but it was much closer to sliding to a 6 than it was to an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as fun as reading the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter 3 is really a good time at the movies, but just not as great as reading the book. Saying that, I did love the special effects, and the Dementors were just as I pictured in my imagination. The Griffin was REALLY well done but the flying scenes on him were a little 'The Neverending Story' for me and lasted too long. There has been talk that this movie is "darker" and that it may be too scary for kids, but I don't really find that is the case. None of the little kids in my theatre seemed to be upset over the scenes, and there really isn't "jump-at-you" moments that would make small children cry. Even Snape, one of my favorite characters, isn't that scary at all in this installment. There is plenty of silliness to appeal to kids, and I think they would love all the creatures and characters just as much as in the book. It is weird to see all the actors growing up though, with deeper voices and teenage bodies (complete with acne!) and that made a lot of people chatter at the beginning of the movie ("Listen to his voice!""Ron looks so grown up"). Something though was just missing for me. I just feel like I didn't totally feel the magic like I had in the very first HP movie. I would say see it, but please read the book too - it is so much more rich, vibrant, and magical than the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read all 5 Harry Potter books that are out at the time and so far, number 3 is my favorite. You can imagine my excitement in wanting to see this movie. The first one was okay and the second one was much better. Learning a new director was behind this one thrilled me even more, thinking 'Excellent, it'll appear new and be the best movie too'. Wrong. Very wrong. *May contain Spoilers after here* Okay, what enraged me the most was the sudden handgrabbing with Hermione and Ron. That was never even thought of in the book because they fought through almost the entire thing! How dare the stupid movie makers/writers even try to give people that haven't read the book that idea! Another quality I disliked was that they rarely showed teachers from previous movies, it showed not one Charms, Transfiguration, or Potions class. Find that alittle odd? You see Professor McGonagal and Dumbledore maybe three times throughout the film. Next, I must be angry with the wardrobers! Why were they in normal clothing almost throughout the entire thing! We even saw before that outside of classes they still had to wear uniforms! Another thing is the explanation of things. The pace of this movie was too fast and they never explained that Moony was Remus Lupin, Wormtail was Peter Pettigrew, Padfoot was Sirius Black, and Prongs was James Potter. They also didn't explain how Sirius escaped from Azkaban. Other various things were left out. The ending, which usually has Harry leaving the train was left out completely(I mean, all the books ended that way, the movie should've too). Instead we get a shot of Harry trying out his Firebolt...Overall, this movie was worse than the first two but, thankfully, the idiot director will not be returning for the fourth, they've gotten someone else.There were some good things in the movie but not enough to save it overall. Buckbeak was cute and real looking which gave the film a bonus of noncrappy special effects. The dementors were awesome even though I never pictured them flying but that made it scarier. As usual, the use of magic was good and the acting improved.I give the film a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*spoilers*I have no idea what the secrets of a great cinematic adaptation of revered-or not so revered-literature are. Often when the inevitable adaptation of a successful book comes along it turns out to not to be a translation of the books contents to cinematic terms but a soulless reenactment of that content that depends upon the audience's recognition of the story and characters. It must be said that this is often the result of writers/directors who are incapable of translating to cinema the particular soul of a book. It must also be said that this too can often be the result of the fact that the book in question may be very hard to adapt. Whatever the case, Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban is not as good an adaptation as its predecessors.Let us talk about Christopher Columbus and why after seeing Azkaban I realized that some of us might have been unfair to him. His direction of the first films, while in some spots pedestrian, was overall fairly competent and effective. The first film I felt to be a bit unimaginative and a bit-just a bit-soulless but otherwise a decent adaptation. The second film though delivered a stronger plot, a better mystery and an intensely focused and stronger narrative. The screenwriter and director were able to tap into the spirit of the Potter stories and deliver an actual movie that was enthralling despite the fact that I knew what the resolution and major events was going to be. I can't help but roll my eyes when I read critics declaring the third potter film to be the most cinematic of them all. Were they paying attention in the second one? Despite the triumphs of this film (the 'way' Harry communicated with the snake, the flashback to the early days of Hogwarts, Kenneth Branagh's and Luscious Malfoy's performances, the climatic confrontation between Harry and the main villain) I was ready to forget it in anticipation of the third installment-an installment which was supposedly more 'darker', supposedly more 'cinematic' and supposedly 'better' then the first two; Disappointing that it's none of those.This is a by the numbers adaptation that is merely a reenactment of the book but delivers neither its heart nor its charm. Almost every scene feels like it could've been handled with more imagination and cinematic know-how. Consider for instance the first major conflict that gets the film rolling: The bitchy aunt who incessantly abuses Harry to the point where he lashes out at her using magic. That momentary act of vengeance was supposed to be pleasing-the aunt was suppose to annoy Harry to the point where we in the audience wanted to see him take revenge upon her, but the whole scene is ineffective, dull and tame because the film is in a profound hurry to get Harry to Hogwarts; The film is replete with such perfunctory moments that seem flat and tame because our darling Cuaron doesn't seem to be interested in investing the necessary buildup essential for a payoff to work.After Harry runs away from home in anger he is picked up by one of those funky double decker buses. From a cinematic perspective nothing is entertaining by this bus ride. In the book it is funny, bizarre and mysterious-here it is just bizarre. It doesn't work, nor does the scene that ensues in the bar where Harry is mysteriously informed by a certain Minister that he is in danger. Once again, Cuaron doesn't let our sense of mystery and curiosity develop enough to the point that we care about the information Harry learns. The scene is brisk and not too memorable, and it seemed that Cuaron didn't realize that the crucial buds of a mystery was supposed to be developed by this scene-it would've been more appropriate if the minister was more agitated and nervous, if he sat down and we observed these traits and make us wonder just what it was he was hiding. But the film is just too much of a hurry to let such a thing happen and it rushes along.We learn that Sirius Black has escaped from the awful prison of Azkaban and is likely to be coming after Harry because he (Harry, that is) stands in the way of the return of Voldemort--who Black is allegedly a supporter of. So far so good, but they don't include the most crucial detail that would've made the audience anticipate Mr. Black more and fear for Mr. Potter: In the novel didn't he allegedly kill a score of innocent humans before he was caught? That's crucial detail of the plot suggested this guy really could be an insane ****. In making the film faster paced and more shorter than the previous two, discarded were the plot details that would've made one care about the larger narrative. As we have it there is a 'supposedly' villainous figure coming after Potter and, while this has repercussions in terms of plot, there is hardly any suspense or tension. Stuff sort of just happens. Is it a surprise then why the major confrontation in the tree house-and the revelations that occur there--feel exceedingly perfunctory?The second film had three juicy villains-Gilroy Lockheart, Malfoy Sr., and Voldermort Jr. Each and every one of them was effective and enthralling and finely acted. This third installment has the Dementors-who are only a bit creepy; the Rat-who, because he seemingly comes out of nowhere (though there is a bit of foreshadowing in the film indicating his presence-the fact that Ron had a Rat should've been more stressed) seems almost useless as a villain; and, lastly, the mysterious character of Sirius Black who, as explained earlier, is also ineffective (and he isn't really a villain after all!). And regarding Gary Oldman: What a waste. I expected him to do for this film what Kenneth Branagh did for Chamber Of Secrets, but Oldman's performance here is so under whelming, so unimpressive that I'm wondering why they didn't simply go with an unknown actor or someone less famous considering the fact that his real presence on the screen seems so minimal. My theory: They wanted to stress the possible villainy of the Black character and hoped the 'wanted' photo (we see it like thirty six times-more of it then real Oldman in the film) to generate anticipation. It doesn't work because a mere photo and lackluster buildup to do not generate anticipation.Regarding Cuaron: He handles a few of the scenes well. Certainly the film's better moments include the manner in which the Dementors descend upon the castle Hogwarts in the moonlight-we get two of these shots and they each last a couple of seconds, but they're effective and a bit haunting. Other than that though his direction is totally unremarkable, though a bit more kinetic than Columbus's. However, when it comes to these Potter films, Columbus is his superior because, despite his pedestrian handling of the camera, he had a sense of story that worked well for the series. He could also fashion scenes well and would've let the Aunt scene develop naturally rather than rushing through it. In the end though I'm amused by the fact that the installment promised to be the most radically different and cinematic turned out to be the most mediocre!**.5/****Regarding family movies released within the last years, two films reign supreme: Holes is utterly delightful, captivating and demanding, well acted and well plotted. The other one is Peter Pan because of its superlative direction and ceaseless lyrical and literary charm. They are both better than Chamber Of Secrets, which in my opinion is the best Potter film.Reader, I know the hype will make you go see Potter 3, but on your way back home pick up these films, and a good film-goer be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family saw this movie...my husband and two young children. There were scary parts of this movie that my toddler did not like atall, so first off be wary of taking very young children to this movie. My 8 year old loved the movie. We've seen the first two moviesprobably 40 times each [no joke]...we are huge fans of the booksand movies. This movie was really hyped by critics who didn't like the firstmovies. Frankly, I was hyped myself to see the third installment,as I had hoped for an edgier film. It is an edgier film. But most ofthe camera angles left me feeling as if I'd just watched a homemovie...you know how you get that feeling of vertigo? Sort ofmotion sickness? That's what I came away with, and found outlater that my eldest child and husband came away that way too. So, be forewarned. If you are a "slave to the story" the way Rowling wrote it, you will bedisappointed. There are scenes in it that are completely rewritingthe book. Many things were cut out. And I can respect that, due tothe sheer length of Rowling's recent HP books. Understandableindeed. However, it seems that a little too much trimming tookplace, and part of the joy of watching the characters interact waslost. And I suppose in a sad way that's how it will continue giventhe length of the following HP books. If they are to be adapted tothe screen, cutting will have to be done. Also, did it strike anyone else as odd that the characters,especially "Harry Potter" himself Daniel Radcliffe, grew so quickly? His physical growth was really representative of the othercharacters quick physical growth as well....many actors grewconsiderably from a physical standpoint. And then it hit me...thiswhole series will be over so quickly...and then they will be nomore. What will we ever do without Harry Potter and that wonderfulworld that Rowling created. Frankly, she is a master at characterdevelopment, and I'll miss that when she writes her last on thisseries. All the things you read/hear about this movie are true: The movieis edgier, darker, more mature in nature, and downright scarier foryounger children. Something wicked this way comes....and I wish it would havestayed around a little longer. I gave it a 6 out of 10. The filming left something to be desired. Alittle too much liberty taken with the actual story. Not enoughcharacter development where you actually cared for the charactersthis time around. And the background renderings left you wantingto hurl at particular points. Go and see it. Just leave yourexpectations lower than before with the other two. And let's praythat they don't fire the younger actors for looking too "old."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How difficult is to transform a 435-page book into a truly brilliant 2 1/2 hour movie? In "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," the real conflict and problem in the movie is just this -- the adaptation could've been better. Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed the movie now that a fresh and new director has taken the helm. It's an extremely visual feature that puts the entire series on a darker, more sinister path and saves it by giving it a completely different look, a change I found to be terrific and much better than the previous movies. "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is brimming with pure delight and fascinating eye candy, and the presence of Alfonso Cuaron truly shines.First, let me address my only gripe about this movie. The story felt rushed and underdeveloped, and the only reason I understood it was because I had read the book. Your children may have a high degree of difficulty as the story sweeps past fast, but sometimes I felt this is just what the series of movies needed -- a faster pace. The first two dwelled on things I felt irrelevant or unnecessary, but this movie gets right to the very dark heart of things and becomes a more streamlined and thrilling movie. Overall, the adaptation was okay, but the movie needed to explain things a bit more and throughly explore the characters' situations; now I wonder how The Goblet of Fire will be like adapted *gulps*...The acting was alright, but somehow I felt Harry to be the weakest actor of all the three (he's still great and fits the part perfectly, of course). His scene when he found Sirius to be his parents' killers didn't affect me as I thought it would, and I found that to be one of the most critical scenes in the entire movie. Emma and Rupert are developing actors here too, but Daniel could use a bit more help if he wants to play this critical role to its full potential. The other shining performances I felt really proved terrific was Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, and David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Exactly as I imagined in the book...truly brilliant, and as for the new Dumbledore...some people are heavily disappointed because he's different, and his persona is not like the late Richard Harris, but he does a good job replacing him and proving himself to be a good Dumbledore; I still think Richard Harris did a better job.Yet the real reason why "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" proves to be the best in the acclaimed series is the excellent visuals. Alfonso Cuaron's vision is so much more creative than that of Chris Columbus, and paired with some breathtaking special effects and sweeping camera angles the movie has taken on a darker feel that spectacularly delivered. I really like the way he uses the environment to add to the scene and putting the characters and setting in a way as to encourage a certain feeling. It's beautifully dark. I wish he could direct another Potter film because he captures what I believe the Harry Potter series embodies -- darkness (not that darkness is everything in Harry Potter, but I find it more interesting."Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is great, but not perfect; small flaws in the pacing and action that outshine the story hinder it, but the visuals save it.

		<shortDescription>I have to admit, as an AVID READER, this movie was not that great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, there were some cool scenes, but the director altered it SO MUCH, not only from the book, but from the other freaking films. I mean, the landscape of Hogwarts looks like the result of a devastating mudslide based on how much it has changed. It really is noticeable. There are also so many minor alterations from the book that seemed out of place. For example, what the heck was with the talking head on the Knight Bus? That was just dumb. Also, the pace of the entire time they were at school seemed like it went all too quickly and it was rushed. The pace was really off and they never really had an ending to the SCHOOL, just an ending of Harry's adventure/quest. But, there were some good things about the movie, like the Bogart scene for example. Also, Gary Oldman did an excellent job in the small role he had. BUT FINALLY, and most importantly, the feud between Malfoy and Potter has just gone too goddamn far. I mean it is so cheesy, and so corny to a point of feeling uncomfortable watching it. Every time they meet it is like a showdown. They throw out some insults, Malfoy's friends chuckling at his "clever" remarks, and Harry's friends stick up for him. In the book it doesn't nearly seem that ridiculous, possibly (and probably) because it is written, not acted out. But I do cut the scene some slack, for two reasons. The first reason is the director is working with inexperienced kid actors. The second reason is that I myself can't imagine them doing it any better ON SCREEN (perhaps they could tone it down and make it more discreet, that is about it). Now, all in all, it was about a 6.5 out of 10. I liked the movie, but from a movie-making point of view, it wasn't that great. The reason, after all of this criticism and negative remarks about the film, that I gave it a high score (in terms of ratings) was that these flaws didn't bother me that much, but they were evident. Now, I can see why someone who is bothered by these flaws and inconsistencies would despise the movie, and I can see why someone who isn't bothered by these flaws and inconsistencies would adore this movie. This was a fun review to write.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Diversion from Author's Storyline &amp; Detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am disappointed that it appears the humble but talented work of Chris Columbus in providing an accurate big screen rendition of J.K. Rawlings inspired writings has come to an abrupt end.Whether it is the lack of humility of the director or the languishing attention of the screen writer, author and producer due to assumed unlimited success, this film was a let down for my whole family.We have been incredibly impressed prior with the uncanny ability for the film team to render such gifted story telling, with so much vivid detail, onto a medium which leaves much less to our imagination but still succeeded to inspire a sense of magic. This new film's lack of consistency with it predecessors and written source seems to be a combination of introducing someone who thought their own creative view was more important than those of the author or the loyalty of the viewing public. More disturbing yet is that the new director for HP4 is said to be planning to follow the path of HP3... a second let down?With the potential of creating an unparalleled creative franchise, I think those with the most to lose financially should rethink their new strategy. Since it seems WB cares little for its image with regard to entertainment genius (as set forth in the first two movies and sent to a demise in the third) perhaps the public need rebel at the box office to send a message that we won't pay our due for those who deliver a lower quality product to cash in on momentum alone. You have an incredible opportunity to produce movie history and thrill millions ? don't blow it!A saving grace for this movie is the acting of the traditional cast and the new comers, who, although more screen time needs to be devoted to dialog and less to the whomping willow scenery, did a great job of maintaining the story's attitude despite other short comings in direction.I do hope HP4 and follow-ons return to the masterful quality provided under Chris Columbus' direction and that follow-on films are not used as a method for directors to add block buster titles to their resume of film projects.If HP4 is delivered at the level of HP3... perhaps I'll wait for the rental...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exhilarating to the last shot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" ("PoA") is a story identical in structure to the first two books/films. Harry makes a narrow escape to Hogwarts, where he is soon at the center of a complicated mystery. With the help of best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he resolves to unravel the perplexity, which leads to a dramatic and mesmerizing final act."PoA" is in a unique and tricky position for a literary sequel because not only will it be inevitably compared with the book, but because of a directorial change, the film will be more heavily contrasted with its predecessors. Fortunately Alfonso Cuaron (best known for Y Tu Mama Tambien, pardon the lack of accent marks) has helmed the best film of the series, even though it is the least similar to the source material.While Chris Columbus turned in workmanlike efforts in the first two movies, his primary error was in remaining too faithful to the text, resulting in too much content that slowed down the pacing. Conversely Cuaron has chiseled away at the third book (which is longer than the first two, although the film is shorter) to create his own handiwork that is faithful to the spirit of Rowling's writing, while clearly featuring his own artistic style.That style is what makes "PoA" so enjoyable to watch, even if, perhaps especially if you've read the book, as I have. Instead of simply waiting to see how the director's vision matched up with my own, I found myself eagerly anticipating not only the what but the how, as Cuaron's transitions, shots, and camera movements injected new life into the series. The Mexican featured wider and longer shots than most American directors, endowing Hogwarts with a different feeling, one more open and less ominous. His transitions also stood out, in contrast to Columbus' straightforward manner. Many vignettes opened or closed with stylish scene-setting shots, whether it be a freezing flower or a bird veering too close to the Whomping Willow. These transitions meshed with a more subdued color palette to give the film more of a human feel, reflecting the tumultuous times that the main characters were enduring. They also allowed the drama to build, which was important in a film that contained so many vignettes that could easily have felt much more unrelated. The humane aspect of "PoA" may be the core enhancement to the series. Cuaron's technical alterations aid this development, as does the maturation of the three children, both as characters and actors. Being clearly older, Harry, Hermione, and Ron have grown past the cute child actor stage and reached the teenage plateau, which for makes them easier to relate with for most of the audience. Additionally the trio is outfitted in normal clothes, rather than their school uniforms, much more often. Not everyone remembers what it was like being a preppy little kid, but everyone recalls life as a jeans-wearing teenager. The physical aspects would possibly be enough, but also the script contains more and better emotions, the three actors are better at portraying them, and the director is better at displaying them. That's a Murderer's Row of improvements that is impossible to overlook.Consistent with the first two films, the adult actors are stellar once more. &gt;From Alan Rickman's permanent sneer as Snape to Maggie Smith's world-weary wisdom as Professor McGonagall to Robbie Coltrane's now-promoted-to-faculty Hagrid, all of the returnees slide effortlessly back into their parts. They are complemented by an equally talented group of newcomers. Michael Gambon performs admirably with the impossible task of replicating Richard Harris' gravitas, combining Harris' established character with his own interpretations. As the latter titular character, a frenetic Gary Oldman is deliriously watchable once he finally makes an appearance. Last but definitely not least is David Thewlis as R.J. Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He expertly works with Harry to supply several tender exposition scenes that don't slow down the movie. All in all, the adult cast shines as they relish their roles without chewing scenery.Special effects were at the center of the first two films, but in "PoA" they largely take a backseat to traditional dialogue scenes. That allows the fewer primary visual effects (not to be confused with the numerous background paintings, etc.) to range from solid to superb. Buckbeak looks perfect, while the Dementors quality tattered look will suffer from comparisons to the superior Ringwraiths of "LOTR". But due to sheer originality, the Knight Bus tops them all in an early thrill ride. Good stuff as usual from Industrial Light &amp; Magic. Speaking of reliable technicians, John Williams has composed yet another excellent score. With the choral song Something Wicked This Way Comes, Williams has added another lingering tune to his already familiar work, allowing him to weave both themes throughout the film. The guy's a machine, and while he does occasionally produce some melodramatic scores, this is not one of them. Its tinges of darkness and minor keys (?) accurately mirror the action, soaring and subsiding as needed. Lest you think the movie was the greatest film ever, I should point out that because Cuaron trimmed so much from the book, the numerous scenes sometimes feel rushed and truncated, as though we are dashing through a museum in an effort to see everything as quickly as possible. The truncation did not bother me because I knew the omitted information, but the pace was too choppy over the middle portion of the film. I could also argue that if you haven't seen the others or read the books, then you won't fully understand everything, as characters and skills aren't entirely explained. But that's a minor complaint, because will anyone actually see this one who hasn't seen or read the others? Like it or not, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is clearly the most cinematic of the first three movies. Rather than simply churn out a live-action version of the book, director Alfonso Cuaron utilized tools like telescopic fades, zooms through clock towers, and additional character development as he adapted the book to fit the big screen. The result is a emotionally darker film with more humanity than the first two combined.Bottom Line: "PoA" was the best film I've seen so far this year. Thoroughly enjoyable to the last shot. A high 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book is better...Spoiler...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third book was definitely more exciting than the first two. However the movie did not do it justice. The actors did a superb job with their characters and the movie was well made, but important and exciting parts of the book were left out. Here's the spoiler: Harry never got presents from his friends, there was no visit for Harry to Diagon Alley, no second Quidditch game for the Cup, the chapter on the Firebolt was left out only to be thrown in at the very end, the movie didn't explain why Lupin and Black were Animagus, they also left out the part where Black tries to attack Ron in the Gryffindor tower, Ron doesn't get his new owl nor does Harry get permission to visit Hogsmeade, and Crookshanks was hardly included and you kind of needed him to be. Hopefully they will and try and include that in the beginning of the next movie And there are more. I understand that the book was long and they couldn't include it all but I think fans of the book will be disappointed. Another thing that has me worried is that if they cut out all of that from this book cause it was so long, what will the leave out of the next two which are longer than this one, especially The Order of the Phoenix? I'm sure there's more they left out that I forgot. Like I said, the movie was made well and the actors did a great job, but I just felt a little cheated. Glad as I was to see it, I think I prefer the book more. So that's my thinking on the movie. I understand that nothing can be perfect but some things just shouldn't be messed with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film is the Knight Bus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed with this film. Caught up in the Potter excitement, I stayed up to watch the 12:01 am premier, only to find that the whole feeling of the movie was like the Knight's Bus. That is - the movie moved swiftly, allowing for brief passing glimpses of the story, all in order to get to the destination (the scene with Sirius, Pettigrew, Lupin, et. al). While I think the visuals were MUCH better than the previous two, I don't see how anyone who hasn't read the novels could even begin to comprehend the story. I understand that Cuarón felt he didn't need to explain things as it was in the first two movies, I felt no connection with Lupin or Sirius, and felt that the other well established characters were caricatures, not developing individuals. This is not to say that the acting was bad. I think everyone did a fine job, there was just too much emphasis on hitting certain plot points along the way to the climax. My husband described it as picking certain pages from the book and throwing them on the screen, with no previous or following pages to help you understand the significance. Perhaps fewer individual scenes would have been appropriate in order to develop the storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great in places but a jerky, 2D adaption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have really been looking forward to this film for a long time since I thought the first two films were excellent and this was a MUCH better book/story. The previous films had worked very well even though they left quite large parts of the books out, there was a continuity and a flow that was true to the spirit of the books. Unfortunately this can not be said of this film, and for this I am grateful that the Director is not making the next film in the series.So what is good about the movie ? Well the special effects are great and there are some really good moments when the main characters really do get you involved. However the cuts have been so savage that the character development of the supporting roles has been trashed and the extra scenes added actually made the film worse.Do you know the film Scrooged with Bill Murray and how he butchered Dickens ? Well when I left the theatre, that was how I felt that this movie had turned out. A lot of the characters had their development removed and were nothing more than cardboard cut outs, Hermione is now turning into a typical Hollywood lady (holding hands through chase scenes etc.) and what happened to Mrs Weasleys development into a Mother figure with an edge. No linkages into the next book such as Quidditch World Cup, Sirius Black's letter, threatening the Dursley's to take Potter back (would you after he'd blown your sister up ?) just took the shine off the whole book.I really hope they get back to basics and follow the book more faithfully for the next film. If they do that then we are in for a real treat, if not then they will lose many millions of pounds/dollars/euros in lost sales and will probably damage the reputation of the remaining films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sad that there was so little of the classic Hogwarts theme. The last two films had me almost in tears at parts, this one didn't at all. There was no battles between houses in fact the house names didn't even get mentioned once! Alfonso Cuarón has done some good stuff in the past, but I can't say that I am happy with his choices in Prisoner of Azkaban. There were a few really well done scenes, I like the werewolf animation, but overall I am rather disappointed in this film. I am worried about Goblet because if this is as much as we can get in Prisoner then how in the world will they be able to fit in even half of Goblet. Why not make it into two films, one of the quiddich world cup and the other of the triwizard tourny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well well well - what can i say - it is a great movie - well done - visually it is a treat. it starts with the usual drama of how harry is being treated badly and his dose of sweet revenge - perhaps a bit overdone and it is beginning to look dated. the bus to the leaky cauldron is terrific. superb editing and a nice tension mixed with some comic elements - not kiddish at all. the main reason this movie falls below the second one is because the plot is not well developed by the director. i don't feel the angst for the escaped prisoner and i keep asking myself what has he done - of course, of course, he has been involved in the murder of his parents you dumbo - that qualifies for him to be hated so much, to be imprisoned for 12 years......wish the director had some visualisation of the murder of Harry's parents or about Azkaban and its horrific nature etc. or simply about Siruis himself...the movie almost starts with the character in it and goes no further to create that tension to dislike him....i did'nt develop strong feelings for Sirius black and there the plot feel a few notches compared to the previous movie the chamber of secrets i felt here the story line is a bit weak. the chamber of secrets had a great ending with the fight sequence with voldermot et al. the ending here - the tim e travel etc is lever but not so engaging and feels a bit affected...the dementors have been conceived very well...the cold, dark, menace they are comes across superbly. hermione's character is well developed while Rons's roles is too shallow. Harry of course is the hero and has done a great job. some predictable elements like poor malfoy getting bashed up etc...and i wonder whether it was at all necessary to have the divination teacher ( emma thompson)...felt very flaky and purposeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I apologize for my English, I'm a French girl so be kind..The Prisoner of Azkaban was a GREAT DECEPTION when I saw it.Yes, this tome is darker than the others, but I didn't really find the book's "magical atmosphere". Sure, the movie takes place in the magical world, but the little thing that would make the atmosphere similar to the book, that I found in the two first movies, is not here. It felt empty.There are several parallel stories in the book, the film follow one and when an element is needed which is part of another, it's put there, just for the spectator to understand the one story, and who does care with the chronological order ? I'm sorry, but I do !And did Lupin really have to chase Harry and Hermione for so long, when he has transformed ? He doesn't even see them in the book !! I agree that the book is too long to tell all the story in the film but where is the need to add that ? Why do not take those 5-6 minutes to, for example, take the time to explain the "Fidelitas charm" rather than "Sirius knew where James &amp; Lily were hiding and he went tell Voldemort"... for someone who have read the book, it's an infamy !I spend all the movie thinking "no it's not like that", and i heard a little girl besides me saying more than once "but mum, it's not like that in the book"... I soo enjoyed the two others and this once was so different !!I hope the next ones will be more close to the books.... !!!</fullReview>

As a huge fan of the "Harry Potter" series and having read all the books i feel this film left out a bit to much of the fun material associated with Harry Potter. Instead the film had a very rigid storyline and without the fun most of us love in these films lost my attention very soon. Of course this opinion is as a HP lover and is compared to the other 2 films. In all it is a Very very good film but not one that reminds me very much of the Harry Potter saga.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****possible spoilers****I will admit beforehand that I have not seen the other 2 films, or read any of the books. Also, I went into the cinema fulling expecting not to like this film at all (but then again I thought that with Lord of the Rings and ended up loving it.) However, having just got back from watching the film, my over-riding emotion is one of confusion.Even my friend who's read the books agreed that the film made no sense. One moment Black is an evil scheming baddie, the next he's a hero. Eh? What was the point in that glowing horse? How did Black manage to escape and remain undetected in the first place? Does that bully actually have anything useful to do? If you've read the book then you'll know the answers. If you haven't, you'll sit there wondering just what the hell is going on.My main gripe against the film is that nothing ever actually happens. A few under-developed plot strings amble on towards the (anti) climax, with an especially lame werewolf making its not-so-scary appearance towards the end. Put simply, the film goes nowhere and has nothing to say - characters are barely developed at all. By the way, its blatantly obvious who the werewolf is - just listen out for the characters surnames.Being boring is perhaps the worst crime any film can commit, especially one that is aimed at kids. Yes I know I'm a 21 year old male and hence not in the films target demographics. But the secret of good kids movies is that they are enjoyable to all ages (for example Finding Nemo or Ice Age). Harry Potter is just plain dull. Poorly scripted, poorly acted (apart from Alan Rickman - who is always brilliant per se) and poorly edited. If you're a 10 year old Harry Potter fanatic I guess you might enjoy it a bit more, but then again you'll see the movie regardless of what anyone says. I wish I could've spent my money seeing Troy or the Day After Tomorrow again. I'm sure Harry Potter and it's inevitable sequels will do just fine at the box office though. Now, where did I leave my Return of the King DVD........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film if you have not read the book, a let down if you have</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking this film on its own, not as the third film in the series or as an adaptation of a book this would be excellent. It has a good story, though as mentioned later it is full of holes, great acting and some good set pieces. But as an adaptation and a third film it is very disappointing.Let me explain why. Firstly I know it is a magical place Hogwarts, but who decided they could completely rebuild the place and move everything around. In the first two films Hagrids hut was just out side the main gate, now it seems to be over a bridge through a church yard and down a very steep hill. Also the Whomping Willow now seems to be in the middle of nowhere rather than in the main courtyard where it was in the last film. Now I know they made Hogwarts bigger in the last film but they did not start moving buildings around.Secondly as many people have noted very important sections of the book are missed out and the story is left with a lot of holes if you have never read the books. I saw the first film and then read the books using the film as a way into the series, this one would make you think the books were not worth reading as the plot is so full of holes.Thirdly why do we have to have so many shots of things floating and flying. Every cut scene has at least one flying object in it, be a feather, a leaf, a bat or a dementor. This started to make me laugh as I tried to guess what would come up next.Fourthly, Dumbledore. I know this is the first time we have been without Richard Harris, but that is who I now imagine as Dumbledore whenever I read the books, it will take some time to get used to the new meaner sounding Dumbledore, but hopefully this will happen.Finally, it is just over much to quickly. You never get time to settle down with the characters. It is always rush rush to the next bit on and on. Hogwarts is a place that no one really minds how long they stay and take in because everyone wants to be there. I know we don't want a 4 hour movie, but a little more time spent in the company of friends would be appreciated.I am not saying it is a terrible film it is just flawed in a number of ways that make the experience less enjoyable than previous outings. Lets hope the next one brings us back to the Harry Potter we love to see on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BRING BACK COLUMBUS (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>----SPOILERS ALERT-----I was lucky enough to catch a sneak peek of HP&amp;TPOA. And I was disappointed. It didn't come close to doing the book justice. Things start off okay, but get progressively worse. The reason for this is the new director, Cuaron. Things are rushed. Very rushed. Lines from the book that explain things are never spoken. Some things are out of order, Harry receives his Thunderbolt in the end of the movie, not the middle as it should be, for example. Other sequences are off too. The characters from the other movies are underused, Dumbledore (now played by someone else) only appears in 5 or 6 scenes, tops. Mcgonagall barely appears at all. The only teachers we really see are Snape and Lupine (who is played pretty well by David Thewlis). The evil (or is he?) Sirius Black is played so-so by Gary Oldman, who is a bit too much of a madman for the part if you ask me. The big redeemer in this is the special effects. Yes, o yes, the special effects. From a lady becoming a balloon to a eagle/horse hybrid. The special effects are great. Sadly, the Quidditch scene is very short, had it gone on even 5 minutes longer, this movie would've probably gotten a 7.5 instead of a 7. Final Verdict: Go if you like the books or previous movies, but keep your expectations at a bit lower standard. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, finished the third installment of the Harry Potter series and still doing fine, lol. I have to say that this was a great installment into the series, I still haven't read the books, so I cannot judge on those, only the films. So the Prisoner of Azkaban I must say had a much more dark side of the story, the kids are now a little more grown up and facing much more terrifying things as the head on to become great sorcerers. The cast is still doing great things together, same as the other films with a great addition of Gary Oldman. The story seemed also a bit stronger than the other Harry Potter films.After having trouble at home once again with Harry Potter's adoptive family, he runs away sick of being called a freak and wanting to be with his own. Only now entering his third year at Hogwart, he is about to face a great enemy, Sirus Black, a murderer who would like to see Harry dead to avenge the sorcerers. Not to mention his constant feud with his schoolmate, Draco, won't stop, but he has his friends to help him lead on into a world where Harry will live and become a great sorcerer.The Prisoner of Azkaban was extremely entertaining and kept my total attention. I loved watching him having to learn how to control and use the bird like creature in his first class and just seeing finally Draco getting his. I would very much recommend The Prisoner of Azkaban, it was a great installment and I cannot wait for the Goblet of Fire, from the rating, I'm extremely excited to see what that is about.8/10</fullReview>

Things get challenging for Harry in this movie, he finds out that Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come for him. As Harry is in Hogwarts School with his fellow friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermonie (Emma Watson)he faces new classes such as approaching Buckbeak, the Hippogriff and learning about shape shifting Boggarts and how to transform them in to something hilarious. Then Harry's worries of Sirus Black are getting deeper, when he founds out that he is lurking around the Hogwarts grounds to find Harry.Also soul-sucking deadly dementours are also lurking outside the castle walls...Harry has a lot of mysteries to face in his third year of Hogwarts...Especially Peter Petingrove...Daniel Racliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and the cast all deserve an Oscar for all their hard work and achievements. Also, I understand the crew spended millions of money to make this magical movie for us, so they should all deserve an Oscar for that as well. I would recommend this movie to people ages 7+ despite the lack of fantasy. So grab your popcorn and snuggle up in the sofa and watch it.</fullReview>

Harry looked schizophrenic after they didn't include the explanation as to how Pettigrew was actually responsible for Harry's parents' deaths, instead of Black. Also, they cut the Quidditch matches from that year, except for the one between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff when the dementors arrived. Also, one other thing: the book clearly describes Patronuses as being able to move, so why weren't the ones in the movie? Honestly, the best parts of this horrible film were when the birds would fly too close to the whomping willow and turned into a shower of feathers.</fullReview>

The plot is vague, the pace is slow, and the film wanders about in a floundering sort of way. Characters are thrown in at the last minute (eg: Peter Pettigrew) who are immensely important to Harry Potter's life, but about whom the movie manages to make us care just about zero. "Azkaban" touches on much but delves into little, including feeble and fleeting flirtations with Hermioine's maturing sense of sexuality (Who's hand is she holding now? Is that HIS neck she's hugging? Why is she wearing that undersized sweatshirt instead of the Hogwarts robe?).The truth is the movie does have some fairish moments. The special effects are fine, especially the bit with the hippogriff, but not exactly breathtaking. Some plot developments are never really explained and, worse, some are utterly unnecessary (to wit a certain professor's alter ego). "Azkaban" is unfortunately too sluggish, uninteresting, and globally incoherent to be much fun. We'll probably see "Goblet of Fire" but not because of this regrettably forgettable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total disgrace to the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 5 stars are purely for the director's "effort" to give this movie a more "personal" feeling. Although much of that effort turned out badly, but it is still a Harry Potter movie and has its magic... I guess a single star is a little too harsh.I was so disappointed after watching this movie, because it left out important scenes from the book that were crucial to the overall plot, and instead added some pointless scenes that the director created. I understand that the movie can't have everything that the book has, but Cuaron seems to lack the ability to pick up the more IMPORTANT scenes. I Frankly have no idea where the director got all his crazy ideas.I might be repeating all the errors that other review have pointed out, but this is my opinion as well, so here it goes...If the director had seen the second movie, let alone the books(it seems pretty obvious that he didn't read the books, not even 3rd book), he would know that Harry can't use magic in summer. Yet, Harry practically yells out, "Lumos Maxima!" like how many times? then there's the creepy weird man in Leaky Cauldron... Sirius was really disappointing because he looked like a crazy old man. That whole scene in the Shrieking Shack was not explained enough; if I didn't read the book before watching, I'm sure I would have got lost. Also, up till that scene, the movie dragged a little and actually made Harry Potter boring! How can that be? POA book had tons of thrilling, even shocking parts and was filled with unexpected secrets! A lot of people name POA as their favorite Harry Potter book, yet the movie is the worst so far. (well, I haven't seen GOF because I was so disappointed at this movie that I didn't want the same thing to happen again.) ahh, now the dementors. First of all, Cuaron decided to ignore Rowling again; his dementor is a totally different creature from Rowling's. His dementor's face deviates from Rowling's one. Dementors are supposed to GLIDE, which is quite important in the beginning of book 5, yet in this movie they always fly around like the book wasn't even there. And when they perform the kiss, the human soul doesn't come out of his or her mouth in the form of a tiny ball... what a cheapo scene... there's a reason why that action is called the KISS. The ACTORS/CHARACTERS!! New Dumbledore is plain weird and looks like a fraud, when he's supposed to be the world's most powerful, wisest wizard. The actors for Lupin and Sirius look WAAAY too older than they're supposed to be... especially Sirius, who's supposed to be a very handsome man, just covered in filth and 12 years of misery/hunger. He simply looks mad in the movie. But then, Trelawney can partner him for looking ridiculous. Yes, she's a fraud most of the times, but not this fake... Sirius the werewolf was just so strikingly fake that i actually laughed. where did the "looks almost identical to wolves except for a few differences" werewolf go? it also looked hairless, for some reason. The DVD. well, what is there to say about the DVD when the movie itself sucks?? it lacks of special features. Now THIS is a complete waste of money. DO NOT BUY!!! sorry WB, but you gotta do a better job to satisfy hard-core HP fans. the book fans, that is.The magic of Harry Potter comes from the sense of a fantasy world that works like any other society, in my opinion. I wish movies 4,5,6,7 do a better job in following the book's storyline, because just doing that would make a huge improvement. and directors, PLEASE READ the books if you're gonna make a movie about them!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have never cringed more in my life than in the hours I spent watching this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult for me to comment on this movie in an unbiased fashion, since I am an avid fan of the books. However, I am not the kind of person who automatically thinks that any change of the story from the book is a bad thing.This is an enjoyable enough film for people who have never read the book, even if they will probably not understand some of the plot. This movie completely ignored some of the key sub-plots that I was really looking forward to seeing. Ron's character is still portrayed as a wimpy, cowardly moron just like in the previous movie. They add many stupid annoying lines and objects that are obviously supposed to be funny but just made me cringe. The storyline has been so re-arranged and edited that it barely feels like a Harry Potter movie. Hogwarts is suddenly in a different location, as is Hagrid's hut, the interior of the castle is different, etc. I'll admit I did like the changes to the grounds but not to the interior of the castle or the location of Hagrid's hut. Many of the characters are portrayed differently than they are in the book (not only Ron).The ending feels rushed and incomplete. If you have never read the book, you will most likely be lost. The lower your expectations are when you are about to see this movie, the less disappointed you will be. I recommend all people avoid watching the last couple minutes of the movie. If you have already seen it, you know why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good performances, but bad replacements. The better Potter movie to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After finding that the second movie was much better then the first and then seeing the trailers for the third, I was really under the impression that the third would outshine the first two. The comments were that it was much darker and adult, and that was backed up by the trailer.Oh sure it was better than the Philosophers Stone, but better than Chamber of Secrets? Surely, with the more adult storyline and the darker mood, surely it was better. The Director had even been changed, and that could make it go either way.Well I wasn't so much disappointed as not excited enough. Yes, it was darker and much more for an adult audiences taste with an extremely clever plot, but there were still some problems with it all.Firstly, the eighty minutes of scene setting and build up, in that time we hardly see anything that's really concerned with the final part of the movie. Just the usual character settings and plot explanations.Then there are the standard plot deviations to explain something new about the Potter universe, and once complete we pop back into the story. This is fine, but in this movie I felt there was too much of that.Yet again, as with the other two films, there is the ending and the many unanswered questions. For example, why doesn't Professor Snipes say anything about Harry blasting him, what happens to the Dementors and why were they after Harry in the first place on the train? There are lots of these and mostly popping up nearer the end of the movie.There's also one of the major plot twists just happening with the wet fanfare of a single trumpeter. In fact the turn happens so quickly and without notice you do suddenly wonder why and what the hell just went on.Unfortunately, I do think Michael Gambon is a great actor, but not as Dumbledore, not as a replacement for the late Richard Harris. His acting and mannerisms are totally wrong for the part and present more of a bungling old man rather than the wise and all knowing character that Harris portrayed.Still, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson are very good in their roles. Also the effects were excellent in this movie, in particular the Dementors, the Hypocrate creature and once again the spider! The story overall is much more enjoyable and more representative of a movie plot line than the other two. The darkness and maturity also provide for a much stronger and watchable movie, however the shortcomings are still too much for me to overlook and really be taken into the film and the world of Harry Potter.I think it will now become very interesting as to how the stories progress with such obviously ageing actors in the lead roles and a new Director for the next movie and a new Screenwriter onboard after that. For me, I would like these changes to be for the better, although sticking with Alfonso Cuarón for another movie might have been a wise move.We can but wait and see. As for the DVD, the same issues are in this DVD as before, the extras are difficult to get to and you never really know what each menu option is for. However, it does have a very cool style to the navigation, but still no audio commentary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The darkest film yet, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a wonderful film. As a big fan of all Harry Potter related things, I loved this film but, only because it was Harry Potter related. As almost all films, it has its disadvantages as well as its advantages. I must say, that the director this time outdid himself, as the visual effects are no less than fantastic. The dementors, the scenery in general and the outside ambiance, especially Hagrid's hut are really fascinating. The village of Hogsemead is really cute and just as I expected it to be. What really disappointed me, probably disappointed most who are big fans of J.K Rowling's books. The film gave great importance to visual effects (if i might add fascinating ones, especially the computer animated hippogriff, Buckbeak) but almost ignored the whole story and its essence. Certain funny comments and situations were eliminated from the film, such as the Dementor/Malfoy situation in the Quidditch Game and Harry's crush on Cho Chang. The Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book was really emotional and although, true Harry Potter fans did find their eyes watering at the some point in the film, I must say that I almost tore the book's pages with my crying. The whole story of the Maurauder's map is almost deleted entirely and that, in my opinion is not good, as it is a very special part in the book. I really must say that the previous two films were more faithful to the story. But, who am I to comment on such things? After all, J.K Rowling did work entirely with the screen writer, so she, of all people, should know what is important and what's not relevant to future films. Still, I think that certain special moments mean the world to Harry Potter fans, who probably, have lost count of the number of times they had seen the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now straight away I want to tell you I am not a big Harry Potter fan. I have not read any of the books and I tried in vain to dismiss the phenomenon as a flash in the pan. I sat through the first two movies and found them OK but in large I remained indifferent to them.BUT THIS MOVIE RULES!!!!!! It's hard to say what exactly I enjoyed about the movie. Quirky, offbeat characters brilliantly portrayed by the whole cast and a darker (but not too much) atmosphere about it along with great creatures (Do you know what a Hippogriff is? Neither did I!) and a clever story (one of the best time travel sequences I can remember, up there with BILL &amp; TED) all contribute to a highly watchable, entertaining movie which I would highly recommend to anyone!!! To all the other Harry Potter dodgers: take a chance on this film, you won't regret it! MISCHIEF MANAGED!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my God, it was horrible! First, this man (Cuaron) is a professional director?! I could've done better than that! And it was way to "artsy"! Like the leaf falling from the tree and the rest of the crap! What's with that!? I wanted to see a Harry Potter movie, not some crazy movie on Sundance about a Goth chick finding love (or whatever).Moving on. . . The cheesy lines! What the-!? Lupin going on and on about Lily's eyes, what the heck is that? That was not just unnecessary, but annoying! If Rowling wanted to say that Lupin used to like her, why didn't she in one of the books? And like Hermione's line "Does my hair really look like that in the back?" I wanted to hurl! Hermione would never say that! They changed her so much in this film! She's not a girly-girl, she a beautiful smart girl. And one my favorite characters on top of that. And all the forced Hermione and Ron stuff. I am a Ron/Hermione shipper, but that stuff wasn't in the book, so it's meaningless.Did they change Dean Thomas' actor to Keenan from Keenan and Kel?! Or who was the fat kid that played him? 'Cause it wasn't the same guy. And while we're on that, what was with his cheesy line about catching Sirius? "It's like catching smoke. . . it's like catching smoke with your bare hands. . ." I laughed aloud! Don't even get me started about how they left out who the Marauders are! That's just wrong! And the stupid way the camera zoomed in and out so much was so lame. Since when can Dementors fly, by the way? And when did Hogwarts grounds get so hilly? Hagrid got an addition added to his hut? McGonagall didn't get to tease Trelawney? Lupin was tough on Harry? Sirius was all touchy-feely with Harry? Why!? What possessed him to change all that? It drove me crazy! I never would've thought that I'd be this disappointed. I knew it sucked, but I didn't know that it did this bad. I can't say I didn't laugh though, some of it was enjoyable. But I wouldn't've payed money to see it. I really hope the next director is better than this. I wish Columbus would've done PoA. . .The only HP fan that truly says that they loved this movie and that it's the best, is merely a movie fan, not a book fan, and that's pathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love the book, disappointed in the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book, like all the others, is a great read, but this film version is a disappointment, compared to the first two. The pace of the film is too slow, in that we do feel empathy with the characters as much because of the frequent use of the cut rather than the fade (as with the first 2 films). I understand that this book was longer, so to produce a film that told a credible story , some parts had to be left out, but really...Also the obvious change in some of the settings- Hagrid's cottage was now down a steep hill, out of sight of Hogwarts, rather than a slow decline from the school is not how I pictured it from the book. As a total experience, I did not enjoy this film anywhere near as much as the first two, even given the fact that it dealt with a darker period in Harry's life. The Dementors, though, were a suitably scary sight.</fullReview>

There were so many things that were changed, unfortunately, for the worse. not that I'm not gonna buy th DVD or anything, its just, when i saw it in theaters....# 1? the scenery. it was the same in the first 2 movies, so it would have been so much better in this one if it had stayed the same. i know that replacing dumbledore had to happen, poor richard harris, but the new one coulda at least tried to sound a little raspier like the old one so that people who didn't know harris had died would find it harder to tell this was a new cast member. and the prophecy... i know they have to cut things out of th story and all, but there is supposed to bee like a month or 2 difference from the day hermione leaves divination til the prophecy. certain things just shouldn't be changed, and certain things must be made with real timing. oh, and peter pedigrew!!! he was fat!!! peter pedigrew is supposed to be a thin and frail, tiny man. yeah, the guy looked like a rat, but he definitely wasn't thin!!!!!and the whole movie just seemed so much darker.... the others had a realistic coloring, this one was just like it was always dark, when thats not the case...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to the spirit of the book, though not to the letter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this third installment of the HP series is remarkable in that, with a consistent and contagious dark atmosphere, it brings out the psychological dimension of Harry's adventure, and illustrates that his struggle in his own psyche is as fierce as that on conventional battlegrounds.Cuaron??s rather idiosyncratic vision as a director has instilled this movie with a memorable artistic identity, hereby making it something considerably deeper than an ordinary kid??s adventure flick. Surely the action sequences are eye-catching, but what I've enjoyed more is the in this film is its suggestive cinematography, and the drama tension among the characters. Ron and Hermione's bickering is more naturalistic, and gives just the right amount of hint for an impending romance.I would hope that Tom Felton kept his hair glued, but, well, he is still the definitive Draco Malfoy. Daniel Radcliff has progressed a lot as an actor---in fact, I think he has a more difficult task since Harry is in many aspect a more interiorized character in the book, and I hope that Daniel may stand up to the challenge when Harry gradually comes to recognize the dangers lurking in his inner abyss in the fourth and fifth book. Alan Rickman's performance as Snape is simply divine. I am also very excited at the addition of two superb actors in the Potter series---David Thewlis as Lupin and Gary Oldman as Sirius. I'm refraining from giving away too much here,but how breathtaking when extremely intense scenes involving Snape, Lupin, and Sirius are delivered by these impeccable performers!The visuals of this movie are stunning as usual. I particularly like the Wimping Willows seasonal change scenes, and Buckbeak's flight. I am also glad that Williams has made a new set of music for the movie, more haunting,dark,suspenseful,yet at the same times grotesquely humorous---exactly the right colors of the magical world that Rowling created. Of course, this movie also has serious flaws---yes, I'm talking about the failure to fully introduce the Marauders. I think it would only take five minutes more to integrate this necessary background story, without which non-readers are left very confused about the plot, and fans of the books are severely disappointed.There are also some glaringly tacky and out-of-character moments, such as Ron echoing Snape in calling Hermione an insufferable know-it-all. I hope in future movies Ron, Harry's best friend, can stop being a mere comic relief, and present a more in-depth character revealing his loyalty, kind heart,and,even more interestingly, momentary jealousy toward Harry. Despite the flaws, I still enjoyed the movie tremendously. It is true to the spirit of the book, though not to the letter.I only hope that the forth and fifth films would be even better---for, hey, Rowling's books deserve that.</fullReview>

The film is excellent, of course, but there is one major problem with it, well, actually two: David Thewlis and Gary Oldman. These two excellent actors stole the whole film. No sooner than Remus J Lupin teaches his class to tackle the Boggart, I was aching to see more of his antics ( as we obviously do in the book ). But when Sirius and Remus take the stage together - my God what chemistry. It could have gone on forever and would have if the scene hadn't been reduced so much ( which I'm angry about by the way &gt;: ). And of course throw Alan Rickman into the mix and it actually becomes heaven. Roll on Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix. I want the talented Gary and David back on screen! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2 days ago, I lived my worst disappointment in my whole life! I was sooo excited to watch the new Potter movie, which I awaited for more that one year. And when I was leaving the movies, I still didn't believe that it wasn't a bad joke what I saw. After two first movies, which I really liked came this one, absolutely different and absolutely strange. Something wicked this way comes... Now I understand what did It mean in the slogan. U know, its nice to see a pathetic picture of an angry willow as it kills a little bird, or a joke for 5year-olds when Neville gets attacked by the Monsters book of monsters, but I would rather like to see an explanation who actually Black is, who Lupin is, what and who created the marauders map, why Harrys Patronus takes the form of a deer or why Sirius and Snape hate each other so much. On the other hand, there are things I definitely didn't wanna see and despite that I did - Willow beating up Harry and Hermione (they would definitely get some broken ribs or bruises, if not getting killed), a grimm in the sky during the quiddich game ( he was supposed to see Sirius and not a grimm! This is a really big error), Hermione talking to Lupin when he transformed, Lupin telling Harry how Lilly helped him through in the rough times when he discovered he was a werewolf (Lilly started to date James and so to know the other boys in the 5. year, so she didn't even know him then).....and many other things, I could go on for hours. and the main question is - where the hell was the damn music??? NO MUSIC! Only one good theme - when Harry was flying on hypogrif. What bout all the other scenes? The music COULD fix some broken parts, but it wasn't there.Was mr. Williams drinking coffee in his trailer in that moment or what? And in some scenes, the music was absolutely not suitable, example the scene when Marge changed to a balloon...the scene was underlined with a light funny theme, but it was supposed to be scary, for harry and also dursleys. So mr. Cuaron maybe amused some small kids,but for sure not the older audience. And what bout the cut? The scene that was supposed to be touching, when harry is crying bout the fact that black is the reason his parents are dead, could get to her end and leave a feeling in the viewer, cos it was immediately cut by smt else - there was no time for the viewer to sing into harrys feeling. And what bout the shedule of scenes - all school lessons were together in one peace - lupin,hagrid,trylawney,snape...and then nothing else any more - the selected order of scenes was could be much more dynamic and imaginative. The only one who made the movie watchable was Dan Radcliffe, who was absolutelly astonishing and showed a gorgeous performance by his own. Also Emma Thompson and Michael Gambon were great. But all this couldn't help the screenplay that has such holes that even 20 houseelfs couldn't sew it together. And here it comes the one big question - HOW COULD J.K.ROWLING AGREE WITH THIS??? Total humitation of her universe and Columbus' work, who did his best to make the first two movies as great as they were.It was the biggest disappointment and I would like to asdk all the ppl who like it - could u pls (!!!) explain to me WHAT so so great bout it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I have read all of the books and own the first two movies on DVD. We recently went to see the Prisoner of Azkaban and were both greatly disappointed in what we saw. Granted you can't make a movie with every scene from the book but there were too many scenes left out that make you understand a little more about the characters. The softer, darker environment is not as inviting to the viewer as the first movies. It had a too real quality to it where this has always been a fantasy world. The Hogwarts grounds look nothing like what we saw in the first movies, which makes you feel they have changed locations and didn't tell anyone. This director did a terrible job with this movie and I hope they don't allow him to do another. My only suggestion is for them to hurry up and finish the movies before they have to change main actors because of them being too old. We can't wait for the next two books. But, what will we do when it's all over?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly dramatic, the latest Potter flick fails because of direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the get-go, it's clear that the latest Harry Potter film was directed by someone else. Unlike the first two, which do their damnedest to mimic Rawling's magical and slightly whimsical portrayal of the world she creates, Cuaron's interpretation focuses on a much darker element that is barely evident in the story. Aside from a few forced jokes, there is very little whimsy in his take on the book, which is a travesty.One of the clearest problems in Cuaron's direction is the overly fluid way in which he moves the film. There are no stepping stones or key events which really stick with the viewer. Instead, he spends a good chunk of the movie showing the passage of time, which is just downright silly. This changes a bit in the last twenty minutes, but by that point I just wanted the film to end already...it had run its course. I didn't care about the characters because, apart from a few choice lines by Emma Watson, there was very little depth to the characters -- they were devices to move a simplified plot.Apart from pacing, Cuaron also flops in his misunderstanding of the material he has to work with. Though he may have taken the song from Macbeth, I have a feeling Cuaron felt he was dealing with something more akin to Bradbury's "Something Wicked This Way Comes". This is just not the case. The Harry Potter books, even as the story becomes darker, just do not have that dark, haunting tone. Between the music (say it isn't so, John Williams!), the darkened visuals, and the over-use of the grim reaper characters, he tries to infuse Rawling's tale with something that just isn't there, turning a story which is very clearly made for kids into something that is clearly not aimed at children but far beneath what any adult moviegoer would have any desire to see. It's an unnecessary seriousness that just doesn't work. If you've seen Y Tu Mama Tambien, however, you shouldn't really be all that surprised, for there, too, he tried to make something out of nothing (or rather, too much out of not much, since he had three separate themes that diluted each other).Hopefully the return of a less serious director (Mike Newell) will set the Harry Potter series back on course. As much as J.K. Rawling would like to take herself seriously, these are still just kids books -- Cuaron should have recognized that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie aware of the fact that the 3rd book was a bit darker and different than the first two, but I still came out disappointed. (And FYI, I haven't read any of the books, so please excuse my inability to compare.)As such, I had no qualms with the movie being a bit darker, for that was a welcome change and a way to take the series to a new level. But my first overwhelming thought was that the movie seemed very choppy, like a segment would start and I'd think it would be building to something and then it'd jump somewhere else, and I kept thinking, 'when is something significant going to happen?' It also seemed as if it was dumbed down a notch, almost as if several subplots were left out so as not to confuse us. But nonetheless, I still wound up being confusing with the whole 'Serious Black isn't actually the bad guy' reversal. It was so abrupt, if you blinked, you'd miss it. And personally, while the back-in-time thing was well-written, I felt it was a bit beneath the intelligence of the series (and yes, I realize it was in the book, so I don't suppose one can fault the movie for that).On the whole, there was nothing really extraordinary in the film. Sure, it had it's moments, such as the seasons changing as the owl's flying and I really liked the Hippogriff, but to me the CG looked a bit different and on the whole it had a very different feel, and while I'm sure that can be contributed to the new director having a different style, it didn't seem to encompass that lasting quality that the first two had.I think the biggest disappointed to me was that I was kinda glad when the movie was over. There weren't any parts that I particularly enjoyed, nothing that stood out. I think my biggest enjoyment was seeing the characters older and the young actors growing in their abilities. Ultimately, I went into the movie not expecting much and came out feeling like I'd done little more than see the characters two years older.6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Director = bad story telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been one of those people. You know the "Oh that movie didn't do the book justice" people. Yes, THOSE people. However, in watching Prisoner of Azkaban, they leave out so many important points in not only the book, but in the big picture of the story which is Harry Potter. First of all, let's get this out of the way, PoA, the book, is not a very good story. Yes, it does advance the plot, but let's face it, there's not Voldomort and the only point is to introduce new characters, in particular, Sirius Black. So granted, the movie doesn't have a lot to work with (compared to the other stories), but it could have at least done a better job in capturing the story telling aspect.Instead of using foreshadowing, continuity, and other aspects of story telling, they focused more on the cinematography. I could just picture a director's commentary "yeah, this part of the plot was important, but we had to take it out, because it was such a BEAUTIFUL special effect." And just to prove I'm not ranting incoherently, here are a few examples of this: Harry was never spotted at Hogsmeade, very little quidditch mentioned, nothing about winning the quidditch cup, nothing about the house cup (only 5 points were deducted the whole movie), Ron never spotted Sirius in the dorm, no mention of Snape delivering the potion to Lupin as his reason for finding them at the shack, no mention of who Padfot, Prongs, Wormtail, and Mooney were (or better yet, that they wrote the bloody map!!!), and perhaps worst of all, Wormtail transfigured into a fully clothed human, but when transfiguring back into the animagus, his clothes were left behind.Though much of this was probably because the general muggle viewing public is incapable of following too complex of a plot, they wanted to simplify the plot. I respect that, and I came to expect as much. However, as I stated earlier, the case turned out that they wanted to show off their special effects and "movie making" ability, even if they had to sacrifice some of the plot. An example would be with the Wormtail transfiguration. I'm probably with the 99.9999999% of the movie public, and we don't want to see a naked Wormtail appear as a human, so it is perfectly acceptable to have him appear fully clothed. However, when he turned back into a rat, his clothes fell tot he ground, and the rat scurried away out of the pile of clothing. Now of course, the director thought it would be such a "cool shot" to have the rat run away as the clothes fell, thus sacrificing continuity, for a good camera shot. I find that highly unacceptable.The bottom line is this. If you are a film student, or someone who is into good camera shots, special effects, and scenery in movies, than Potter 3 will send you home very happy. But if you're like me, and enjoy good stories, consistent plots that challenge the viewers to think what will happen next, and reward those who remember little things to make the story deeper and very interesting, then you will leave this movie feeling unfulfilled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very much looking forward to seeing this movie because, although I haven't liked any of the movies as much as the books, they were still pretty good. However, this one left out too many important details from the book. I sat in the theater, bored and rolling my eyes. They focused too much on things that weren't important to the book and didn't stick to the story enough. Some key elements of the story aren't included in the movie, which was aggravating. I am aware that some things needed to be cut for time purposes, but there were things in the movie that weren't in the book. They could easily have left those things out and gotten the story right. It was pretty disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a HUGE fan of both the Harry Potter books and the films. Prisoner is still my favourite book yet, and consequently I was very much looking forward to the third movie. However, I was thoroughly disappointed. Although I agree that Alfonso Cuarón introduced a much needed darker side of the story of Harry Potter, I found the movie to be lacking in several important aspects introduced in the books. For example the explanation of the Maurders Map, I feel that it was important to explain the connection between the map, James Potter and Harry, which in turn would explain the patronus that Harry produces (in addition the seen with the patronus by the lake could and should have been better). Also, the very short explanation of what occurred between Sirius and Peter should have been longer, it eliminated the character building of Peter, Lupin and Sirius, and did not give the watcher the chance to understand why Harry forgave Sirius so quickly. Also, many of the events were out of order or completely missing, of course the firebolt, the letter of permission for Harry to go to Hogsmede the next year, and the introduction of "Pig" Ron's new pet. While the story line of the Prisoner of Azkaban was, in my opinion, completely destroyed, I feel the worst part of the entire movie was the portrayal of Albus Dumbledore by Michael Gambon. Although Michael Gambon is a very good actor, Dumbledore is NOT the role for him. His portrayal of Albus Dumbledore, I felt, was that of a cold, bumbling, fearful wizard, instead of the caring, all knowing wizard we have all thought Dumbledore to be, example: at the end Dumbledore is patting Ron's hurt leg with a kind of harsh manner ... NOT the Dumbledore we know. Basically, Dumbledore is a father figure to the Hogwart's students, especially to Harry, who is not surprised by events; he is in short a charismatic character who lost his charisma through Michael Gambon.However, on a good note, I was thoroughly impressed by the portrayal of Sirius Black by Gary Oldman. When I first herd he was playing Black I was disappointed, Gary Oldman was NOT how I pictured Black, but he surprised me and did a fantastic job at brining Black to life.In short I am still a fan of Harry Potter, and I was glad to see a more dark portrayal of Harry's world, but I can not account the Prisoner of Azkaban among my favourite movies. I remain a very disappointed Harry Potter fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what you might expect from the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One should never judge a book by its movie or vice versa, this makes rating "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" very difficult. Having read books one to five and being somewhat of a fan of the series, the movies naturally are always worse than the books. Rowling brings so many details, so many sidelines to the story which later reappear or converge to the final act. This and the sheer size of the books make the adaption for the cinema very difficult (perhaps a four-to-eight-hours-miniseries per book would be more effective).PoA is no different, and being the book I liked the most, I was not sure what to expect. The first two movies tried to show as much as possible (with an incredible pace in the second movie which ruined a lot of moments - like the shown winter's day which was over in a few seconds), but the third one tried to steamline the story and rewrite it at some points. They even brought in new scenes which were not part of the book (where did they find the time for that - well, they've cut a lot of other scenes). So, the third movie is ... difficult to describe. There are some surprising scenes, but most of the story stays the same, so it is very predictable if you know the books but perhaps incomprehensible if you don't.Overall it is visually stunning (especially the Dementors and the Hyppogriff), so it's worth for that, the actors however ... for Hermione and Snape they were brilliant, for Harry and Ron they were ok, for Dumbledore not as good as the old one, but I was disappointed with Lupin. One of the effects of the books was, that you build up an image of a character. Lupin always seemed to me as a good-hearted person, which was forced by circumstances outside of his control to live a life of an outsider, thus being forced to be very poor although he is capable of so much more, which he can rarely show - but even with this burden he always seems to look on the positive side, never giving up. The Lupin in the movie just didn't have this battered but fighting style. At the moment I am not sure if I want to see the next movies. Seeing one and two was like reading the books a page per second, seeing the third was like reading the story retold by a stranger (recognizable, same plot, but different), and I wonder how the next one turns out.I suppose I'll stay with the books and let the story play in my head, using some of the actors of the first movies to flash it out (nope, not Lupin), but without the cuts or funny but meaningless additions of the movies. So, if you do not know the books, shame on you but you'll probably enjoy the movie, if you know the books and liked them, be wary, the movie might not be what you would have expected from the book.All in all, I would only give the movie a 2/10 - sorry, but if you know the source it was not a good adaption (although perhaps no good adaption is possible).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible Mild Spoilers . . .Warner Brothers and the new director seem to have messed up with this one. Don't believe the hype, it lacks depth and is just the usual 'CGI v Humanity' battle and the CGI boringly wins. If you like computer games you'll love it but if you like films with real characters of depth and soul then forget it. The previous 'Chamber of Secrets' was a really good film with just the right amount of CGI and humour (Dobbie!) with the characters developed substantially from the scene setting first film. Essentially, many of the well crafted layers of the second film have now gone ..The director has missed a real opportunity to look into the (much hyped)teenage angst of the main characters; there being very few facial close-ups or teenage flare-ups. He seems (director) to have just padded the whole thing out with CGI on a big scale which has in fact just diluted some amazing talent there ie. the eagle/horse hybrid and the hilarious ballooning aunt.The mid quarter of the film is very, very boring with a re-run of the first section by time travel! All alittle complex for kids and ultimately very unrewarding.I would give this film 5/10; first film (Philosophers Stone) 6/10 and the second [and best]film (Chamber of Secrets) 8/10</fullReview>

Cuaron made a remarkable job and is very different in many aspects to the other movies. Its even watchable by itself, without the previous ones, and you will find a decent movie with fantastic elements and deep atmosphere, dark , with beauty and enjoyable. By the way , in this one there is a REAL and good taste example of how to mix fantasy with something "else" , I'm referring to the magic lessons. In previous movies the magic lessons are just empty fireworks to attract kids with a stupid concept about "what should be a movie with magic and fantasy".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third Time Lucky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know the saying: third time lucky! Well this film is living proof of that.Prisoner of Azkaban comes the closest to depicting the story of the book so far. Azkaban seems to really go that level further than COS or PS in so many ways (special effects, mood, narrative style, performance from the actors and storyline in general) and it seems in this case the book was definitely suited to the director (Alfonso Cuaron).This film has such a richness to it, and it's easy to see that this book is easily the most cinematic from the series. POA flows so much more smoothly than PS and COS, which seem to have more of a repetitive structure to them. POA has a freer structure and style, which is really symbolic of the characters, whom are now teenagers.Which brings me to the actors. Well, they all seem to be maturing not only physically but in their performances too. Danile Radcliffe is transforming into quite the spunk; his transition from a child to a young adult is truly amazing to watch. He brings a more nuanced performance to this film, exploring more emotional territories.Rupert Grint gives his best performance to date, playing an awkward and comical Ronald Weasley. He has good on screen chemistry with Watson and we see the first pangs of romance between Ron and Hermione kick in. It doesn't help that Grint is becoming more handsome...Full marks also to Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. Watson has proved herself more than capable once again to display the real human emotion in these films. She is maturing into quite a beauty and has excellent screen presence. I especially liked her performance in the Time-Turner sequence. She led and dominated the scenes with such procession and style while still being true to the clever Hermoine. She brings insecurity to the character, while delivering a rather gutsy performance. As always, the adult cast of Harry Potter deserve a huge mention. Gary Oldman was a perfect choice as Sirius Black, David Thewlis as Professor Lupin gave a sensitive performance as a father figure to Harry. The rest of the cast (Sir Micheal Gambon, Dame Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and Emma Thompson)all step up to the mark as the films are heading in a more mature direction.The thing I really loved about this film and that I feel separates it from it's predecessors was the Gothic style visuals that Cuaron brought to the film. The dramatic and beautiful landscape of Scotland, with it's mountains and valleys, really symbolize the emotions you feel when you are 13 years old. This stunning cinematography makes the characters, events and all of the quirks and emotions felt by all in the Potter world leap off of the screen. These dark and eerie sights are matched with humour and the occasional romantic emphasis between the trio. Cuaron has a true sense of humour and infuses a slight sexual tension between the main characters into the story.While the three are obviously maturing, Hermione as the only girl, is usually caught in the middle of all of this sexual tension. (And when I say sexual tension I mean it's very subtle and you can read into it any way you want, but it is in no way inappropriate). Cleverly with Watson though, Cuaron makes the wise play of acknowledging her development without drawing perverse attention to it.There's the obvious signs like an awkward glance here and there, a consoling hug that lasts a little too long, the awkward flouncing around of Watson and her co-stars in the action parts of the film, in which they are usually bent awkwardly and breathing heavily as they try to escape/set things right, the odd hand grabbing and odd touch or unaware brush, just small things like that.Cuaron uses tight framing in these shots to suggest intimacy (the scene where the trio hug when Buckbeak is slaughtered, the quick close up of Harry reaching his arm around Hermione's behind to take her wand out of her pocket, the awkward moment when Hermione grabs Ron's hand when Harry is trying to tame Buckbeak, when Harry is conveniently behind Hermione when they are riding Buckbeak to save Sirius, etc).As I said before, Cuaron tries not to draw perverse attention to it, by deliberately (I would say accentuating) the awkward moments so as to not draw bad attention to the young stars's obvious maturity.On a different note, the special effects are really something in this film. There's the beautiful Buckbeak, the frightening and splendidly eerie Dementors, the hilarious Knight Bus sequence, all of the special effects have really improved. Everything looks so realistic yet still retains an old-school magical look and feeling.Another thing I have to mention is the Hogwarts castle and the musical score. All of the things in the castle, the props (especially the divination room) has such a beautiful but old-style look to it; it's really a visual feast for your eyes. The musical score infuses a little 40's big-band pizazz (think the Knight Bus scene and the Boggart scene) and the general score is very grandiose old-school but with a modern sound. It somehow seems to retain earthiness at the same time. One special piece of music that deserves recognition is the Irish style music (think medieval pan flutes and strings) that plays over some of the really touching and heartbreaking moments in Azkaban.Azkaban is essentially a coming of age story, that really has such a mature look and feel to it that it will attract a larger Potter audience. It really is just one big exhilarating adventure with highs and lows and I truly believe that no other director but Cuaron could have mastered this.</fullReview>

Singing such an unoriginal song "Something wicked this way comes"??? What was the point? Again, taking precious minutes of footage for something that had nothing to do with the book. I don't get it.On the positive side, the filming location was exquisite. But it didn't justify changing all the surroundings from the first two movies.

It's as if the director decided he'd film every 20th page in the book, so great were the flying leaps over whole sections of plot. Not a lick-and-a-promise, but rather ignoring the in-between material entirely, as if it didn't matter to the story. Several VERY important scenes from the book that were vital to understanding the plot - such as the explanation of how Sirius, James and Peter had become animagi while still at Hogwarts - were apparently not deemed necessary for the movie. Before seeing this movie I would have thought it inconceivable that I could walk out of a Harry Potter film wanting my money back, but it happened.

		<shortDescription>Less a Harry Potter movie than an homage to Alfonso Cuarón</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the only HP movie to come out so far that I actually disliked. The biggest problem are the many unnecessary changes that Cuaron makes only becuase he wants to. If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out the Trivia section here at IMDB. There are two items listed as being "In honor of Alfonos Cuaron's Mexican Heritage" and not one but TWO director's cameos. More than anything that shows that Cuaron was more interested in himself than the work at hand.There are major changes not only from the book but from the previous films. Many of the changes alter the overall "feel" of the movie. The sense of wonder that is maintained and fostered by the first two movies and all the books is replaced by one of foreboding and dread. Overall, the film just falls flat because the director failed to understand the soul of the work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Onward and upward! Lets hope the next one is better: Dumbledore is whiter, the Quiddich World Cup hasn't been cancelled, Hagrid's hut hasn't slid down the mountain side, Sirius has become an aristocrat and Ron gets a few lines (amongst other things).And why are the special effects so patchy? Dobby and Buckbeak are superb but Remus's werewolf is - well - words fail me! Sirius's dog wasn't brilliant either.On the plus side, something few people mention - John William's music. Without Hedwig's Theme all the Harry Potter films would be infinitely poorer (it peels merrily from my mobile phone!). His music brings a 'shivery' magical quality to every scene. Two particular scenes which leap to mind are the very first scene in the Philosopher's (Sorcerer's) Stone and also the giant Chess scene in the same film. Thank you, sir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to be one of those stubborn people who wasn't going to read the Harry Potter series books. However, after seeing the first movie (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), I was hooked! I read everything Harry Potter I could get my hands on. At that time, only four books had been released and the third (Prisoner of Azkaban) was my hands-down favorite. It had so much intrigue and plot development, I couldn't wait to see it portrayed on screen!For me, reading the first two books and seeing the first two movies are essentially the same experience. There are some things that are better in the books and others that are more enjoyable visually. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the third movie. So many details are excluded and so much is inconsistent with the first two films that I am now turned off to Harry Potter movies altogether. I realize that with a new director there will always be change, but I don't think this director does the book justice.Do yourself a favor -- skip the movie and re-read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expectations for one of the most exciting story lines in this series is just overwhelming and this movie does not come close. I thought third time lucky would mean another chance at an objective analysis of this movie. No way. Such an ordinary feel for this magical series. I felt imprisoned to watch it with buckbeak providing much needed relief from time to time. One thing that HAS to be mentioned is the evolution of these kid actors. They have almost become adults but so much more could have been done with their talent.Chris Columbus - WHERE ARE YOU?? You left them at a time when they were just beginning to become more interesting. Darn, he would have cracked this story line and made this a $400+ domestic grosser in the US.Another given in this series that is cemented - Hermione will be Ron's gal (especially the scene where she leans on him instead of Harry). Unless JKR has conjured Luna Lovegood to lead Ron another way and Harry to be Hermoine's intellectual, platonic counterpart in HBP there is no chance for a young potter-granger romance.Six words for Harry Fans - This is just not good enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as charming as the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the Harry Potter books and so far I've liked the Potter films. The casting's been excellent, the realizing of the world has been deftly done, and the movies by and large have retained the flavor of the books while being enjoyable in their own right. When Chris Columbus announced he wouldn't be helming the third one (or exhaustion would have killed him), I was concerned because more or less I felt he was the primary factor in why these films so readily translated the magic of the novels. And while he's still involved with the new film, you can definitely tell someone else is doing the driving.There would have been more changes between this one and the last one at any rate; the cast no longer looks twelve, they look like they belong on The O.C. Richard Harris died, so you have a new Dumbledore, who is such a key player in the saga. And the third story is where things stop completely revolving around Harry and Hogwarts and we start to see the larger wizardly world. So Azkaban was going to feel different from its predecessors no matter what.But unlike the rest of the world, apparently, I'm not utterly thrilled with how different this movie is. Hogwarts has been completely rearranged; the kids only barely wear their uniforms, and only barely go to school; and characters who had been well handled up until now become doddering dunces.Which is not to say Azkaban is a bad film, because it's not; there is some excellent material in there. It's more to say Azkaban is a joyless film, one with little warmth or heart or humor. That's fine if you set out to make a movie like, say, Underworld, but it seems oddly out of place in the world of Hogwarts.The three leads are all fine, even if they look sixteen or seventeen now (save Watson, she looks a tad younger). No adult character should ever refer to their age in the script again, though; these kids can no more sell thirteen than Luke Perry could sell himself as a high schooler in 90210. I actually prefer the new Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) who seems more like the sly old wizard in the books. Most of the supporting professors are given short shrift: Emma Thompson is fun but wasted in what amounts to little more than a cameo as Madame Trelawney, Maggie Smith gets her one scene to cluck at Harry and his pals, and even Alan Rickman's Snape seems to lack his usual menace. Newcomer Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) is perfunctory, never bad but never great. He lacks any sort of strong screen presence and does little more than fill his role ably. Compare any of these characters to the knockout showing by Ken Branagh last time as Lockhart and you come away woefully lacking.Director Alfonso Cuaron seems not to understand what makes these movies special; the whole point of Harry Potter is that it takes place in a world like ours but wonderfully removed from it. I was initially pleased that our time with the Dursleys was glossed over briefly (you can never leave Privet Drive too quickly, even in the books), but when the Weasley family was similarly relegated to the 'three minutes and out' rule after dad gets his obligatory expository scene, I began to worry. We return to a Hogwarts that looks and feels different from the one in the first two films, none of the kids wear their uniforms for more than a moment or two, and even the balance between the main trio is upset. Ron is reduced to a punchline, a moron who babbles 'brilliant' every other scene but is given little else to do. Draco Malfoy, so wonderful last time around, is there only to sneer and be spit upon. Harry is given proper treatment, and Hermione is so boosted up that her name should be in the title too. But nearly everyone else is poorly handled (other than Dumbledore), and most of the movie I felt like I was watching a clumsy amateur attempt at making a Harry Potter film than an actual part of the franchise.There are moments of magic in this movie, though. When Harry soars on the hippogriff, Cuaron allows us to feel some of the magic that should have infused the whole film. Harry's realization at the end about his own abilities is a nice moment as well, and the very few scenes with Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) are all extremely well done. The first scene ? and only the first scene ? with the dementor is extremely effective. And so on; little bits of sunshine in an otherwise murky effort.I won't belabor you with the details of everything I thought done poorly (though the quidditch match was a disappointment of Lucasian propriotions), because I didn't think this was an awful film (my words above notwithstanding), I just felt it lacked that certain special warmth and attraction that every Potter book and movie before it had in abundance. Honestly, I feel like this film is a shining example of 'it wasn't broken and you didn't need to fix it.' That doesn't make it a bad film, but it certainly pales in comparison to the first two. I would suggest a little more care but put into casting and staffing next time if Warner's wants to make sure the franchise lasts out the full seven books. Another downer like this one (and the fourth book will be a troublesome adaptation in any case) and people might not want to come back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing ... (think of 'Batman and Robin')</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see the film with five small children (ages 6 to 9) ... while they all quite enjoyed it, none of them enthused about it, which is pretty damning given the huge success of the first two films.My immediate impression at the start of the film was one of poor photography, with all the color knocked back. This was presumably intended to create a gloomy impression, but just made things look less realistic and, because the colour/lighting was the same throughout, any chance of using these to emphasis mood where appropriate was lost.Consistency of settings was poor, in that the settings around Hogwarts used in this film differ quite markedly from the first two films, and seem less faithful to the books. There appears to have been a failed attempt to create the sense of oppression (called for in the story) by making the settings shabby/grim rather than attempting to demonstrate it through the dialogue/acting.The acting generally was fine (I particularly liked professor Trelawny, but Sirius Black was also good, even if a more haggard appearance would have helped) ... but the actors were not given much of a script to work with, character and tension building conversations being omitted in favour of quick jumps between action sequences, leaving the audience uninvolved/unmoved by the special effects. This omission of psychological depth in the scripting in favour of action, to the point where the action becomes meaningless, is the reason that the awful 'Batman and Robin' film springs to mind. The attempts to show the psychology of the story were generally heavy handed and perfunctory and thus counterproductive. Some elements made no sense unless you had read the book (in which case they served as reminders to threads of the plot left out of the file), while others were actually wrong (eg. Harry seeing the Grim in the clouds) in that they created a different impression from that in the book.After the reviews I had read/heard, this film was very disappointing. The impression most reviews give is that the film is dark and scary, but the darkness is just in the photography, not the atmosphere, and the uninvolving nature of the script/production prevents even good special effects being at all scary ... the kids watched it pretty impassively ... no jumps or clenching of tightly held hands etc.</fullReview>

If by any chance you are a ferret lover - don't even come close to the advertisement for Harry Potter 3. What you will see at some point is at least a dozen of dead ferrets hanging over from the Hagrid's shoulder, and Hermione feeding a Hipogriff with those. Amaizing!!! Ferrets are the third most popular pet in the world after dogs and cats. Why not showing about a dozen of dead cats bodies??? It's in a way a horror movie. I wouldn't even recommend to watch it with children. Especially if you have a pet ferret in your household. As for the story: unfortunately - there is none :((( So, if you havn't read the book in advance - you'd have no clue on what's going on on the screen. But if you have read the book - you'll be very disappointed...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delight for Harry Potter Fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All Harry Potter Fans are sure to be delighted with this movie which was by far the best one yet. The first two movies were good but not that good. The change of director has brought only good things and also the Prisoner of Azkaban book was more exciting than the first two.This movie has a lot more action, a lot more suspense and, of course, a lot more action magic. The already grown up Harry Potter and Co., are in their third year at Hogwarts and the real challenges are just starting to appear.Having already done the first two movies, the "old" actors were at their best mostly because they managed to understand J.K. Rowlings characters and they made the whole thing more enjoyable and even believable( if I may say so). The special effects were very good and even the Dementors, which I am sure we all wanted to see after reading the books, were just as they were supposed to be, not to mention all the creatures which were just perfect.All we can do now is hope that the improvement seen will continue with the next movie, although I am not sure if they'll be able to do it "by the book", and let's not forget about the sixth book launched in July 2005(I can't wait).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much, too fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter goes to Hollywood ... this movie is a two-hour-rush full of "special" effects. Large parts of it have the tempo of advertising or music videos. Alas, Harry Potter III lacks the charm of the books, it lacks the wonderful atmosphere of Old England so beautifully captured in the first two movies -- it lacks everything that made the previous films of the series something special, lovely. I would not recommend this movie to a 12- or 13-year-old, not only because of the many horror scenes (don't know what they watch on children TV today, but I think this is way too much for a child) but also because I wonder how many of the young watchers who are so keen on Harry Potter get the story right (if they didn't read the book which should not be a prerequisite for watching the film) -- e.g. the side-story of Harry not being allowed to go to the village and getting the map as a help.My conclusion: the director was not interested in the story, not in the characters, not in the atmosphere. All he tried is to make you shed as much adrenaline as possible. I hope they will make a more old-fashioned movie next time. It would suit Harry Potter much better.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third installment in the Harry Potter series sees a significant progression from the cinematic style established in the first two films. Not only is the overall storyline much more dark and sinister, but Alfonso Cuaron, who has replaced Chris Columbus as director for the third film, has revamped the entire Harry Potter ambiance and presentation style.Cuaron's intensely emotional, visually-oriented, darkly humorous style gives lends the production the air of an adult film; it could not be further divorced from Columbus' perky, energetic, vapidly funny touch that moulded the first two installments as family movies. Understandably, this will upset many fans of the first two, but what has really thrown the viewer base is that Cuaron is not afraid to play fast and loose with the plot in order to better synthesise the film's overall image, continuity and message, which, while it makes for a better film, alienates fans of the novels looking for a flawless adaption.I personally believe, however, that to truly appreciate the movie, one needs to simply forget the book that inspired it, and attempt to enjoy the show. Cuaron's direction, despite his disregard for the traditional adaption style, is superb, with brilliantly atmospheric cinematography, mise-en-scene, emotion, and subtle humour. The talented cast rises splendidly to the challenge of the film's new style (with the exception of Michael Gambon, who is woefully unconvincing as Dumbledore), with great performances from Emma Thompson, Rupert Grint and Gary Oldman. It's disappointing as an adaption of the book - but, as a stand-alone film, it shines. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cauron should have read the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best book in the series, and I really think that Cauron was a very bad choice to direct it. He ruined it. He said he wanted to make the movie dark and sinister, just like the book. But I can't help but notice that the later half of the movie is so 'dark' it is hard to even see it. I guess what Cauron failed to understand was that to make the movie dark like the book did not require him to veil the camera lens. He failed to understand that the book was dark because of the story and situations itself. Compare Cauron's movie with the earlier two ones directed by Chris Columbus, and it comes out looking even worse. Chris also took liberties with the plot and the look in the movies but it was a pleasure to watch them.I don't say that Cauron is a bad director, but he was a bad choice for this movie. Some of the scenes, in this movie too were brilliantly contrived. The water on the window freezing, the dementors, the bird flying out of the castle and knocking itself on the Willow, Harry's flight on Buckbeak, and best of all, Dumbledore lighting the candle with a wave of his arm, were the scenes that really call attention to the creativity of the director. But Cauron lost out on the parts that were really important to the story line. Throughout the movie, there is not one instance where Sirius Black is established as dark, villainous, psychopathic, brute; except until the very end; while what was required was Sirirus Black as an ever present fearful shadow. Cauron attempted this, using posters in every scene in the movie. Boggart in the wardrobe sequence was not tenth as enjoyable as in the book. But worst of all was the characterization of Remus Lupin. One of my favourite part in the book is Lupin telling off Harry for going to the village. What makes Lupin's words most effective is that he doesn't raise his voice or let his disappointment show on his face. Lupin, as a good teacher has a way with students and knows that at Harry's age accusations will give back arguments, but will not make Harry realize his mistake. Lupin merely tells Harry that risking his life to go to the village was a bad way of repaying his parents, who gave their lives to save his. Cauron's juvenile attempt at this turned the scene into one in which Thewlis yells at Harry and sends him to his dorm. These are but a few inconsistencies in the movie, which I couldn't help but notice. Cauron's movie got lost in the animatronics and computer imagery, and lost out it's best part- it's story.However Cauron was lucky to get some of the best artists in the industry. Sir Michael Gambon brought new life to Dumbledore. Emma Thompson was marvelous as Trelawny. Though he only got one real scene to perform in, Gary Oldman brought Sirius Black's character to life. Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane were great as always. Daniel, Rupert and Emma were good too. But best of all was John Williams. His background score really saved Cauron's movie. This was the best score out of all the three movies; the previous two were actually quite similar to each other. I expect John Williams to get an Oscar for this one.My rating: 2/10 (basically for the background score only)This movie can hope for an Oscar nomination for its background score only. I personally would want John Williams to win.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Azka-BAN this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some spoilers) If this HP movie has to be reviewed in one word that would be 'PITIFUL'. I think I was very soft the first time around giving it a 6/10. How the heck this is acclaimed the best of the 3 is just undigestable.This style of movie making just does not fit the brilliance of a powerful story line, especially with the introduction of TWO of the best characters in the series SIRIUS BLACK and REMUS LUPIN. To top it off great actors like OLDMAN and THEWLIS (atleast he gets a better deal than Gary) are grossly underplayed. Although the movie is supposed to be all about Black (the prisoner of Azkaban) and the very thought of him sending a shiver down powerful wizards/witches, his screen presence and introduction is downright ridiculous. Almost ZERO impact. The brilliance or build-up of an unseen fear without seeing it till the very end, is totally missing. Then its an anti-climax in the end, bah, is this it? This is SIRIUS and now we know (or do we?) why he escaped from Azkaban where most feared wizards (gone bad) are kept?The concept of the foursome during school, the friendship between Harry's father James, Sirius, Lupin and Pettigrew is just not explored or even mentioned properly. Why did Pettigrew betray James and expose their location to the you-know-who Voldermot is not at all explained! One thing for sure this movie warrants a different type of BAN. Ban it from your hearts, don't waste your money and pray for the next one to be half as exciting as the story line. Its quite surprising when people say I'm looking forward to HP4 (Goblet of Fire). Mind you, its not because HP3 was good but because you want to be associated with better film making.</fullReview>

Ron saved Hermione from that Troll without her dictating to him how to use it from under the sink in the first movie - HE was the one that didn't freak out and lose it when that plant was strangling them and same for Chamber of Secrets Hermione had no idea what a MudBlood was.

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Fantasies on Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not crazy about the first film, and while the second film was better it still wasn't the be all and end all. This film is damn near close to being the be all and end all.Granted the acting is at times off by the two male leads,and Malfoy is too much of a wimp but for the most part this is everything that the first two films should have been but weren't. I have to credit the fact that this film was not directed by Chris Columbus, who is too light weight a director and was too faithful to the material. That is not the case here...Here the hero is director Alfonso Cuarón, who made great dark fantasy by handling the material the way that it should have been handled. He made changes in the source, but kept everything focused on characters and plot. Best of all he made a movie that seems real, no matter how fantastic it gets, something that never happened in the first two films.I want to recommend this film to everyone, but I'm pretty certain you'll be best off if you watch one of the first two films to bring you up speed. It's worth it, trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie, with the knowledge that I had seen the first two and liked both of them. They weren't my favorites, but I did really like them. When I went to see this movie I was very disappointed. I felt like the director didn't stay true to the book the way Chris Columbus had. A lot of the main plot scenes, were either cut out, rushed, or completely changed.I know that there were at least two points in the movie where it would have taken just as much time to keep the plot the way it was supposed to be, as it did to change the plot. He also added a lot of things that weren't in the book, and added in the sense that they were good and did give you a chance to relax, but I felt like they were put in at the expense of the plot, and could have been taken out and instead given to a lot of the plot scenes that really needed the extra time. The actors did develop and gave better acting, but it was wasted on the lack of good videotaping or camera management, and mood music, which I noticed a lack of on more then one occasion. All in all, it was not worth seeing, and if you want to keep your good images, from the book, I suggest that you don't see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you think that Cuaron actually read the book?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because I'm willing to cut the guy some slack if his decision to make Hogwarts and Hogsmeade look like "prisons" if it was all just a huge misunderstanding ... i.e. maybe Alfonso Cuaron thought that he was designing sets for Azkaban rather than Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or maybe Cuaron got all confused and thought that HARRY was the prisoner of Azkaban, thus designed a bleak setting for the young wizard.This was a bad movie ... poorly acted, characters not "right," choppy editing, no flow at all, and the entire main plot was missing. If I hear one more comment about how this movie was a "coming of age" flick for Harry, I'm going to scream. PoA is all about James Potter and his school days ... it's about Harry finding out more about his parents. It is not about adolescent angst. Again, I ask, did Cuaron or even Steve Kloves (screenwriter) for that matter READ THE BOOK?And honestly, who would care whether or not their parents signed permission slips for them to visit Hogsmeade if Hogsmeade actually resembled that awful place Cuaron gave us in PoA? The only place kids could go was the candy shoppe. What was up with making The Three Broomsticks a bar where underage people could not go?Of course Jo Rowling is out there spouting the company line --- "best of the three" blah, blah, blah. What can she say other than that? They've allowed her to "consult" on the films out of courtesy only, she's already sold the rights ... Warner Bros. could do whatever they wanted with the material now.They should have waited until all seven books were completed to make these movies for several reasons. 1.) A real Harry Potter fan may have grown up and taken on the project with a loving treatment of the material (ala Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh for Lord of the Rings) 2.) It wouldn't be so bad cutting parts out if they actually knew where the story was headed and how it was going to end. It would be a lot easier on fans to watch it then. 3.) Poor Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint would not have been foisted upon us. Those kids need to rethink their career choices ... they stink.</fullReview>

The first two movies followed the books from start to finish and gave such background on everything that even if a viewer hadn't read the books, the plot could be easily followed. In watching Prisoner of Azkaban, I really felt if I had not read the books some things were not given as much weight, or were not totally understandable. For instance, the significance of Harry being able to conjure a stag! The book expressed what a powerful wizard Harry was to do that and he's only 13!In the movie, it just happened. Overall this 3rd movie was a little disappointing as compared with #1 and #2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WORST OF THE THREE, AND THATS SAYING SOMETHING.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was disgraceful to the great work of JK Rowling. There were countless errors not to mention key parts of the plot were missing. The acting was at best decent, though if the film had one up side it was Hermione (Emma Watson) she really was very good. I left the theater laughing at this horrible attempt at a movie. Next time please stay more loyal to the book. By far this movie was the worst of the three and I didn't think the first two were very good. The special effects were alright but I spent so much time distracted by the mistakes I couldn't enjoy this movie.Don't see this movie it is a waste of time, just read the book it is 1000's of times better</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some sensationalist reviews here that believe the hype that everything Harry Potter is great and give the movie five stars regardless (the book of Azkaban was definitely a 5 starrer) but this movie ain't so great I'm afraid.Prisoner of Azkaban is my fave Harry Potter book so far (and was more than welcome after the weak Chamber of Secrets) but the translation from book to film loses 90% of JK Rowling's story.Every single second, every frame of this film is utterly devoted to being nothing but pure exposition for a plot that has no mystery intrigue. If you have read the book then there isn't much point in seeing this as you'll already know the twist. But I didn't want this to bias my opinion so I gave it a go anyway.As I have said, there are no subplots. Everything focuses on the Sirius Black story. Character development and mystery are non-existent. It almost feels as if Harry, Ron and Hermione are the only students at Hogwarts because no one else gets a mention and Draco Malfoy is reduced to wimpy, comic-relief. The strangest change of all is the presence of Dudley (a funny character) with NO dialogue at all.I liked Professor Lupin in the book, he was a rebel, renegade teacher who broke the rules and was one of the best mentors Harry has ever had. In the movie he doesn't do much and the character never really comes through. Same goes for Snape (a character I am liking more and more), he barely has two lines to say. Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore is cool and naturally authoritative but he's got nowt to do either. Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawny has five minutes of screen time and Hagrid has two scenes.The relationship between every character and situation is very much defined in the book. In the film all of that is stripped away in order to tell the Sirius Black story as quickly as possible. Which would be fine if the Sirius Black story could make the film stand on its own but it doesn't.Alfonso Cuaron may bring a new look to the film and a more modern edge but I blame him and Steven Kloves for the hasty rearranging and muddling of JK Rowling's story. Sure, some sacrifices had to be made in adaptation but they've diluted the story to the point of obscurity.There were rumors of Goblet of Fire being released as two separate parts (ala Kill Bill) but Mike Newell got overambitious and stripped about 90% of the story out of that one too. At this rate, Order of the Pheonix, will be the worst yet.For a much more atmospheric and exciting mystery try Young Sherlock Holmes. A film with many alarming similarities to the Harry Potter world. This movie may look good with a new director doing a fresh take on the Harry Potter universe but there are so many restrictions weighing this franchise down and it's REALLY beginning to show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darker and thus better than the first two but still far too baggy and slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its Harry's third year at Hogswarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry and he returns there in a rush having accidentally used magic at home. Forgiven for this by an understanding Ministry, Harry learns that the murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and is supposedly coming to finish his killing spree by murdering Harry. With the cruel and ruthless Dementors circling Hogswarts looking for Black, Harry resides in fear until he learns the truth about Black and longs for to find him and extract his own revenge.Meanwhile many other secrets await exposure within the hallowed walls.I was able to see the first two films of the HP series on video at a friend's house for free, which was fortunate because I certainly hadn't been interested enough to pay to see them in the cinema. However, having seen the first two and enjoying them more than I expected, I decided to go and see this one; before I talk about the film let me rant for a minute. First, how very cynical (but unsurprising) that this film has the longest run of adverts (not even trailers) I've ever seen at the cinema ? all during them I could hear children bothering parents that they 'want that' ? it just confirms that many studios see these sort of films as big seller rather than films. Secondly, this is a dark film with a plot ? if you have a group of children who are all younger than 5 then this may not be the film for them; you know that, so why bring them ? just say no! Third, if you do bring them then try to control them ? chances are they will not be able to sit still for 2+ hours so bring them a colouring book or a soft toy ? don't just let them run up and down the stairs. Anyway, as you may have guessed my viewing experience was made more difficult by children who shouldn't have been there but I stayed calm and remembered it wasn't their fault.The film itself is darker and therefore I enjoyed it more ? the change of director has made a great difference in that regard. The plot is also more interesting and is based more on characters and tension that the other films. However this is not to say it is great; because it isn't. No, the film has all the flaws of the earlier films and it is far too baggy and long for one thing. I know fans of the book will cry that it should have been 4 hours long to fit everything in and I wouldn't mind any running time if the film can support it; sadly this film cannot even support two and a half hours and it feels like it is dragging at times. The plot is good but it's delivery could have been tightened up a great deal just by minor snips and the further simplifying of the story ? it is meant to be entertainment and, if the long running time takes away from the 'fun' it delivers then it has failed and needs to be trimmed further. The effects are better used here and the darker tone is delivered well in many ways; I enjoyed the shadows and the crueller characters even if some of the aforementioned children clearly didn't want to be in the cinema for much of it!The cast suffer from the same problem as they did in the other two films ? being too heavy in names who are mainly underused. Radcliffe is better again and seems to be taking the film with him as he matures. Watson has less to do than in the other two films and I didn't think the film served her well; Grint is comic relief and pretty much that's all he does. Oldman needed the work and has said that in interviews but I still thought he did a good job even if his performance is too much one way then the other (as the plot requires him to be). Thewlis is a temporary addition and it is obvious to even those of us who have never read any of the books that he will be a key part of the film ? but his performance is mostly good. The rest of the cast is cluttered and mostly not really used very well, although the impact of this is minimised by them being in a series rather than just being underused in one film. Rickman has almost nothing to do, Gambon is a poor man's Dumbledore, Smith barely says a line, Coltrane just does his usual stuff, Emma Thompson is funny and hams it up a fair bit but Spall is poor and it is annoying to think he is a key character. The rest of the cast features well known faces in (deliberately) small roles including Lenny Henry (doing his usual rubbish accent thing), Dawn French, Paul Whitehouse, Mark Williams (who looks like he'll say 'which was nice' at any moment) and special mention to Ingleby who will be loved by all Spaced fans as the thug who doesn't know where 'it's too orangey for crows' comes from in the funniest episode of that great sitcom!Overall this is an OK film but no more than that. I enjoyed it and felt that the darker tone made it a more interesting film even if it chickens out from going very dark in terms of content and feel. The plot is too rambling and the whole film needed to lose another 20 minutes or so to be a tighter more enjoyable film but I can forgive it that, even if I was bored at times. The cast are mostly wasted again and the film is more a product that an actual film but I was still glad I saw it and will watch the next in the series with the ongoing hope that they will improve. Not great but maybe worth watching once and certainly an improvement over the first two in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever.... This movie is so terrible it made me cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a devout fan of the Harry Potter series, however, when I saw the Prisoner of Azkaban, needless to say, I was utterly disappointed.I was offended with the way the director decided to portray the Dementor's Kiss. Dementors do NOT suck out the happy thoughts, and so causing the soul to come out of the mouth. This movie was a disgrace to the Harry Potter movies and I hope the director burns in Hell.Secondly, what the hell happened to the Quidditch Final?! Gryffindor winning that match is a major plot point and cannot be cut then filled with some stupid choir singing a rip-off of Shakespeare.Although not a main character, it was indeed a shame to lose Sir Cadogan. I appreciate that certain characters and scenes need to be cut from the final edit, but to totally disregard the main plot and replace it was some cheap imitation is unforgivable.Also, I was disgusted the way the director 'Americanised' this movie by making the students run around in non-uniform. Perhaps it would be a better idea to get someone who knows the British culture and ask him/her to direct instead.This movie is a total disgrace and should be remade by someone a lot better than Alfonso Cuarón.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen all the TV reviews of Harry Potter and I was anxious to see the movie. Don't go. Save your money! It is the worst film of the three that have been released. The worst movie I have seen this year. It left so much of the book out. Some of the great scenes were left out. One scene ended and when the next scene started you were like...uh? It started off OK but went downhill from there. It contained none of the humor or interaction between the characters that makes the books so poplar. I was like so what..who cares what happens to these people in this film. It left me cold. The Prisoner of Azkaban was one of my favorite of all the Potter books and it was just ruined in the movie. I hope that the guy that wrote this screenplay and the guy that directed it will not be involved in the fourth movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter, the new rage of the century and turning new generations onto reading. Recently this beloved books have been transformed into motion pictures. Other than simple nitpicks the first films, depicting the first two novels in the series were tolerable. They are outlines of the plot and it is understandable why many things were cut and changed so as not to make a PG movie three hours long. Yesterday the new film reflecting the events of the third novel in the series was released and I must say that reviews from the Times to Newsweek are praising it, so it must be better than the satisfactory first two. This assumption is terribly wrong. The turning point of the series the Prisoner of Azkaban is, however unlikely, worse than its sister films. Somewhere at sometime they must've tossed the book out the window and started from scratch. Critical events to the plot were butchered and glazed over and some key points that are important in the future Harry Potter books are not even mentioned. The film went far too fast paced to give the viewer the same satisfaction given when reading the book itself. If you are planning on enjoying this film then I recommend not being a fan of the books or having read them at all. The only ones people who could sit down and watch this film without being purely disappointed are those who have never read the books and aren't planning on it soon. I must say this is absolutely the worst movie adaption and I plan on never seeing this movie ever again, for it has ruined one of the best books in the series. I can only pray that the same writing staff is not hired for the future movies, especially the Order of the Phoenix (e-mail me if you wish me to elaborate or discuss the subject)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Let-Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The following views are told by the views of a disappointed person who had their hopes and imaginations crushed by the terrible ideas in the recent movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; but the DVD features had also contributed to the strenuous amounts of disappointment to the true, literal fans of Harry Potter and this movie had caused confusion to the non-fans as well, I hope that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will not sink as low as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, These are a few things that caused PoA to be terrible. 1. Harry used a lumos spell in his bedroom at the Dursleys house in Privet Drive, you are not supposed to use magic unless it was an emergency in front of muggles (it was not even in the book). 2. Aunt Marge floated out the door, when in the books, Aunt Marge was supposed to float towards the ceiling (talk about over acting). 3. The Knight Bus contained a shrunken head which was quite annoying, even in the DVD. Dobby was annoying too, but it was needed for the story to continue. Ernie Prang looks like someone's blind grandfather and Stan Shunpike looked like a hobo or a bum living on the streets, the new hunchback Tom, the innkeeper looks like someone from the Addams' family. 4. Harry was supposed to receive The Monsters Book of Monsters from Hagrid at the Dursleys, but instead he got it in The Leaky Cauldron. 5. Lupin looks like an old man from the 1940's with a very aggravating mustache. 6. The Sneakeoscope was not even shown in the movie, not even Pigwidgeon, or the owls that came to the Dursleys. 7. Dementors are not supposed to fly, they are supposed to glide and water is not supposed to freeze when they come near. They are not supposed to chase Harry in the air during the Quidditch game. 8. The new Dumbledore and Trelawney looks like drugged-up hippies from the 1960's and Flitwick looks like a monk from the Dark Ages, what happened to our dear old Flitwick. Cornelius Fudge's new look reminds me of a character from the Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits. 9. New characters that do not even appear in the book suddenly appear in the movie with a much bigger role. 10. Buckbeak looks like a fake chicken and too much time was spent on Buckbeak's Flight, when Harry screamed out with his hands out, it reminded me of Titanic, "I'm King of the World.". 11. Things are pronounced incorrectly, like Expecto Patronum! and Boggart and Sir Cadogan. 12. The new Fat Lady was more obnoxious and so out of character, she was not supposed to sing. I miss the old Fat Lady from the 1st film, Sir Cadogan barely even had a role in this movie. 13. Students barely wore their robes, the robes made it feel more magical. Instead they wear crappy clothes, this is not a Gap commercial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hope you have read the book because the movie plot is so full of holes it is very hard to figure out what is going on. Don't get me wrong, I liked some of it. But as a whole the movie sucked. It was like taking the book and slicing it into 1/4. The movie didn't explain enough and left out a lot of powerful, interesting scenes and information. Seriously, that was how long the movie seemed. Actually within the first three minutes I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I left angry. I can understand people saying that one must always expect things to be left out of the book when making a movie, why then stick in a whole bunch of slapstick instead of major plot points?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my personal favorite Harry Potter movie, for me I just feel like the perfect combination of Harry's journey through life, the magic, the capabilities of Rowling's imagination and overall just some of the best acting I've ever seen in the a book to film adaptation from some of the finest actors to have ever lived and everything in between just makes for one amazing movie. This film not only carries the franchise on perfectly by maintaining the magical sense and the narrative of the book's transitioned plot, but It also introduces a host of new characters which ultimately steel the film, and that for me is the selling part of this movie. Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Timothy Spall are ... extraordinary in this film, their performances excel in every way, especially whilst they're on screen with the likes of Alan Rickman and the debut of Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. And with that, the music, the effects, the cinematography and of course the performances from Radcliffe, Grint and Watson. Prisoner of Azkaban rules.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the third year, and Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts with his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. However, a new defense against the dark arts teacher has been hired, Professor Lupin, played by David Thewlis.Things would seem suspicious when the third year in a row, the school needs yet again, a new defense against the dark arts teacher. Seeing that the first two years that Harry Potter has attended, both former teachers have been linked or involved with Voldemort.This year, however, there is a new problem at hand, an escapee from Azkaban named Sirius Black (played by Gary Oldman). He had been imprisoned for the heinous murders of Harry's parents, and authorities believe Harry is in great danger.The turn of events in this film will surprise you, if you've never seen it before. And you may begin questioning authority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Harry Potter film series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third HARRY POTTER film (still gotta get round to reading the books) and definitely a step in a different direction, with more unpredictable narrative ? thank god Harry doesn't have to fight a clichéd monster at the end ? and better direction by Mexican Alfonso Cuaron, who makes it look darker, gloomier and more magical. It's just as great as the last two (if not better ? I think this is my favourite of the three) and despite the over-lengthy running time, the interest doesn't let up. Things I noticed in this film were improved acting all around and plenty more humour than in the last two, but thankfully the humour is actually funny for a change. Hats off to Rupert Grint's Ron, the most hilarious character on screen and a wonderful acting performance. Seeing how the kids have grown up is a little alarming, however! Things are pretty unpredictable, with Harry fighting off the monstrous (and excellent CGI-animated) Dementors, wraith-like ghosts which literally suck your face off. Meanwhile there are all sorts of new and weird things happening, like Pam Ferris turning into a balloon and books that bite your fingers off, pretty much like the Luggage from Pratchett's DISCWORLD series. Added in for good measure are some excellent bonding scenes, tons of humour, a little romance here and there, and some wonderful new creatures animated by computer. The hippogriff and the werewolf, in particular, are fine. The returning actors are fantastic as ever and newcomers Gary Oldman and David Thewlis are very good indeed, although the former a little underused. Thewlis puts in his best turn yet I reckon. Enough action, hijinks, cool effects, and twists (including a little time travel thrown in for good measure) to last any film fan. Here's looking forward to the next one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good darker take on these films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have now seen the third film in the harry potter franchise the prisoner of Azkaban and this is another pretty good film. The premise sees harry back at Hogwarts when an old ally of he who should not be named escapes the prison of Azkaban looking for harry. Daniel Radcliffe seems to really mature into the role of harry potter in this film and I really thought he did a great job in this film. His character really develops allot in this film and you really grow to care about him in this series so far. Ron and Hermione aren't as important in this film in my opinion but they both are fun characters and the three wizards chemistry is great. Gary oldman plays Sirius black and he does a good job in this film I just wish his character had more time to be developed because he wasn't in the film that much. David thewlis plays the new professor of defence against the dark arts lupin and I really liked his relationship with harry throughout this film. Alan rickman has slightly more to do as snape and I like his interesting character and think he can do more in these films. Michael gambon is the new Dumbledore and I thought he did a really good job in the film. The story has harry looking into the darker parts of magic and I found his development as a character was great. However, I feel like this film takes too long to get to it's most interesting story. Also the film takes some cheap ways to solve some of its problems. The script has some good drama in it especially with Harry's situation. The humour is better in this film, however, the conflicting tone of the dialogue comes across as messy. The style has a much darker tone to it and I liked it quite allot especially the addition of the dementers. However, like the previous two films I just feel the pacing of the film is messy. These films seem to want to include everything from the books and it comes across as overly bloated. Overall I think this is a decent film and it is a worthy addition to the franchise.</fullReview>

The scene with an inflated Aunt Marge floating across Privet Drive is hilarious. the scene where Harry realizes Sirius Black is his godfather is very moving. It gives Harry something close to a loving relative, which he never had with the Dursleys.When Sirius Black has to go back in to hiding it adds to the feeling of sadness. Harry Came so close to having a loving home but it was taken away.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint improved greatly as actors in this film.

		<shortDescription>Mischief has finally been managed with this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban is a stunning shift for the franchise's structure and longevity. While The Chamber Of Secrets kept the aesthetic of the first but improved upon it with additions to the aesthetic, the Prisoner of Azkaban decided to make the successfully prestigious choice of continuing that trend but on a more extreme level and in a way that has since lasted with each installment after in the franchise, most definitely for the better.This shift in aesthetic is simple: only keep the new parts of the aesthetic of the previous entry and add more. Chamber barely did this, keeping the adventurous tone of the previous entry but raising the stakes and featuring more of the Wizarding World's involvement as a whole. Thus, keeping the new parts, Azkaban features the Wizarding World as a whole and the high stakes, but adds the menace and frightful tone of the enemies. This starts the trend of making each film a hybrid of the film before it and the film after it, which works to make each film transition the series further away from the lighthearted start and closer to the dark, Gothic ending without the shift feeling too abrupt.Most notably, this film feels like the first film where we truly see the Wizarding World as a whole, something that was missing from the earlier two films. Yes, the magic was introduced and magic as a whole was explained and explored, but not this world it existed in or the culture around it very much. The early films were very isolated to just Hogwartz and some alley, not showing us very much of the Wizarding World in the scheme of things. This movie is the best at enriching the fictional universe without a doubt, really accomplishing some great world-building while not suffering from the flaw of the first film which had the world-building so present it overshadowed the main plot of the film.In fact, this is one of the most compelling of the narratives that plague Harry each year. We feel so much genuine suspense and tension, something that was distinctly not present at all in the threat of the first film, again as it hardly paid any attention to its main plot, and was not really ever accomplished with the second film because every time the villain tried to do something sinister he was thwarted in doing so, never able to impress his power upon the audience as a result. Here, Sirius is built up perfectly. Mentioning actual things he did, rather than just being told he's bad and so we should be afraid of him. There was no terror in this series so great as being told that all that was left of the man he destroyed was a finger.This series has been imprisoned by its own lack of confidence until this entry and thus it played it safe, giving us two good films. But now we have a great one, and thus the prisoner that is this franchise has finally escaped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's a great third installment for the franchise, while a third film is normally when they start to fall flat, this loses no creative energy and clearly has much more story left to tell, and we are in no way sick of these characters yet either. Though I mostly find it to be a delightful entry in to the series, I did feel that it was a bit too dark, there wasn't really any gradual increase in the tone of storytelling that is light and simple in the Chamber of Secrets, to being much more sinister and severe here, I just felt the transition could have been more natural. The cast continues to delight as they deliver more dramatic and intense performances than the previous two movies, regulars such as Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are all outstanding, and newcomers Gary Oldman, Timothy Spall, Emma Thompson and Michael Gambon, who is terrific in his first portrayal of Dumbledore after the death of the great Richard Harris, they all add that extra depth that make these movies so much fun. A darker story that will have you at the edge of your seat, I would recommend Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to anyone looking for a good adventure or family film. In Harry's third year at Hogwarts, he becomes confronted with new problems as an escaped criminal is after him. Best Performance: Daniel Radcliffe</fullReview>

In the winter scenes you can feel the chill and in the flying scenes you get airsick.And the story includes a "time loop" twist which is handled so perfectly that you want to see the film a second or third time to make sure you got it all.Wow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All those giddy memories of, 'The Chamber-pot of Dirty Little Secrets' are almost gone now; making room for the infusion of a new and improved escapade of one Harry Potter (or as my fellow movie-critic-wanna-be-snobs would say, H.P.) It has been a long two years since that very forgettable ending of 'Secrets' transpired. As mind-scrubbing as 'Chamber' might have been, we must not forget all the trials and tribulations of our telestic trio. I sense it is now time to return to that mystical land of glue-eating-tinkle-sprinkles and slobbering dog-birds. So come with me - one and all ? and let's sneak a peek into that hap-hap-happy land of Her-Very-Very-Winey Granger and her two bestest and most emasculated buds of all time?Ron "The Weasel" Weasley and Scary Harry Potter. Help me flip open that first movie-page, we will notice that those itsy-bitsy ankle biting-curtain-climbers have all eerily vanished, spookily replaced by older versions of each. Is this witchcraft? Is this some kind of mad wizardry? Whatever this may be?do not tell me this is this nature. Anyways ? let's see how happy these pre-adults are ? shall we. At first glance, nothing seems amiss. To the person, each student has a 'smiley face' spattered across his or her kisser, gleefully assailing one-another with irreversible spells. Oh the fun, the joy. Disgusting! This is way too happy (and boring)?something better be wrong and soon. Thankfully the sickening gladness is squashed by the sudden announcement that the most notoriously spiteful, and evil, and terrible, and unsportsmanlike Sirius Jack Black has escaped from that horrifically, horrible place, we all know as Ask-a-bang-bang Prison. I don't know about the rest of you?but shivers are running up and down my spine. Uh oh, there they go again. This whole movie is a roller-coaster of activity with tailor-made spells and new, made-up words. We have 'The Demanders' who eat souls and make Scary Harry feint. We also find out that 'The Weasel's' hamster is actually a tubby evil, ugly, overweight, mean, scoundrel (who happens to be really bad). Such a snorting wobbler-type should be eviscerated and decapitated - all at the same time. Not really, I am just adding that for effect. Another aspect of the movie is the Walloping Willow Tree and it's spasmodically waving branches. 'Spoiler Alert' 'Spoiler Alert' Anyone else would have stayed away from this obviously dangerous shrub, but not H.P. No way. Like an idiot Potter flies head-on into the tree and - alas - gets smacked in the head and feints - once again. Do you want more? Not to worry, there is way more and very exciting. For me, this is a movie I can watch once and return in three or four months and watch again. Not only did I enjoy it, but I can enjoy it again and again. This is not Numba 1 in the series nor is it Numba 2 but it is a strong Numba 3. Very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things are getting pretty dark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first Harry Potter film that is not directed by Chris Columbus. The film is directed by Alfonso Cuarón and it really shows. This film no longer has that magical feeling throughout that the first two had. Instead, the characters are not always surprised and shocked when something magical happens and instead they act a lot like teenagers. The movie is dark, and it really shows how the characters begin to grow up as that magical feeling no longer exists. This is a good thing, in my opinion and this movie is superior than the first two as well. The story is deeper and we get to know some pretty cool characters, it is very dark and very well constructed. But what makes this the best Harry Potter entry so far is the cinematography and directing by Alfonso Cuarón. Every shot looks beautiful, raw and phenomenal. The special effects also get much better in this one and it's just a better movie overall. The pacing is great and the acting is very good as well. This is a great fantasy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004): Dir: Alfonso Cuaron / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis: Creative third film in the Harry Potter series and every bit as creative and detailed. Its imprisonment has to do with letting go. In this case the prisoner of Azkaban is rumored to be responsible for the death of Harry's parents and he has escaped. Alfonso Cuaron takes over directing after Chris Columbus successfully translated the first two. Cuaron previously made such films as Great Expectations and A Little Princess. Daniel Radcliffe plays Potter who learns the secret of his parents' death but also faces other fears. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are marvelous as his teenage companions who assist him in his quest. Gary Oldman steals scenes as the escape prisoner who not only has a secret regarding Harry's family, but also a specific power of his own. David Thewlis is also a great addition as a new professor who has a secret of his own. Exquisite special effects include a monstrous tree, werewolves, a griffin, a creature that is half horse and half eagle, and a trip back in time that serves different perspectives. Solid entertainment may be too dark for young viewers. Some parents may wish to use discernment with regard to the light-hearted use of witchcraft but the film is magical and adventurous at any rate.

		<fullReview>PG(Supernatural Themes, Some Violence|142MINS|Adventure, Family, Fantasy Users need to know that this third installment in the Harry Potter series is growing up with the Hogwarts crew; the themes are darker, the peril is more intense, and the images of fantasy creatures are grotesque and frightening. For a great percentage of the school year, Harry believes he is marked for death and hunted by an escaped prisoner. He also battles a creature of kids' worst nightmare: the Dementors are black-cloaked floating beings that suck out happiness and feed on your worst fears, which is why Harry hears the sound of his mother's last scream when he sees them. While this can be frightening for young and sensitive viewers, the bright side is the Boggart lesson in Defence Against The Dark Arks. Boggarts can turn into a person's worst fears, but the children learn to yell 'Ridiculous!' and turn their fears into something humorous.Themes | 6/10 | (Moderate) Dark/Supernatural Themes (souls, murders, wizarding elements, serial killers, immortality, fantasy creatures)Violence | 5/10 | (Moderate) Frightening scenes for a PG-film. Chilren are in peril, mostly by fantasy creatures: Dementors (black-cloaked floating beings that suck the happiness out of you)attack Harry and other characters, making Harry hear the sound of his mother's last scream as he passes out; the beings almost administer 'the kiss of death', extracting a character's soul through its mouth. A Hippogriff (eagle/horse cross-breed) is provoked and attacks a student, the same creature is decapitated by a hatchet (off screen). A boggart in a class demonstration changes shape to match what a student is most afraid of (and children learn to fight their fears with laughter). A vicious dog breaks Ronald's leg.

		<shortDescription>The best of the Harry Potter movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the third installment of the HARRY POTTER film series and it is directed by Alfonso Cuaron.HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is considered by critics and fans to be the best installment of the franchise. It is also the best-reviewed film of the series.The story follows Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and wants to murder him.The story definitely follows the book nicely, with a few new things added to it. Since Chris Columbus, director of both "Sorcerer's Stone" and "Chamber of Secrets" decided he would not direct this film, Alfonso Cuaron was chosen as director for the third film.The musical score is composed by John Williams for the last time and this was the last HP film to be rated PG. The script is solid and Steve Kloves did a really great job creating an amazing movie. The direction is very amazing and fantastic and Alfonso Cuaron knows how to make a very entertaining movie.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Bonnie Wright, Rupert Grint and Tom Felton all shine out in this film. The rest of the original cast is amazing and they have good performances in this film. Gary Oldman plays Sirius Black and he did a good job. The rest of the new actors are really good in this film.Since Richard Harris died after the second film was released, a new actor was chosen for the part and Michael Gambon would play the part.The visuals and production values are amazing and spectacular. The costumes in the film are wonderful. The pacing is still slow, but it is amazing as heck. The make-up is really interesting and this film goes down as for having the best make-up in a film in my book.The rest of the production designs are very amazing. Overall, I like HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN and this is the film that transformed this franchise from being a book adaptation franchise into a film franchise and PRISONER OF AZKABAN is a true example of a fantasy movie filmmaking.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't one of my favorite Harry Potter movies, but it's still pretty good.In this movie, it's Harry's third year at Hogwarts and so much is happening. He has a new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher, and convicted murder, Sirius Black has escaped from the wizards' world version of Alcatraz, Azkaban. And he's coming after Harry. But why? Well, spoiler alert, it turns out that Sirius isn't a murderer after all, in fact, he's Harry's uncle. Yes, he finally has an uncle who isn't a child-endangering douche. Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something wicked this way comes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the third Harry Potter film, director Chris Columbus was replaced with Mexican Alfonso Cuarón, recently a double Academy Award winner for "Gravity". The film scored nominations for its score and visual effects with the Academy, but lost out as all the other Potter movies did. Personally, I would say that Azkaban is better than the second installment and worse than the first, but easily one of the three best movies from the whole series. It is also one of the most successful films at the box office from 2004. It starts again at Potter's home as a mean relative comes to visit his aunt and uncle, insults his parents and promptly gets turned into a balloon by Potter. The knight bus (nice wordplay) arrives right in time to save the boy from his raging relatives.The action moves to Hogwarts and we find out that Hermione manages to visit courses simultaneously thanks to some time magic which becomes a crucial part of the film later on. Buckbeak and Hagrid make a nice couple as well, one of the highlights of the film. Malfoy gets into trouble as always and Harry ends up as the big hero again, sometimes a bit too heroic for my taste. Same can be said about the next movie afterward. The film has some humor again as do most of the other. We see Severus Snape in a Grandma's dress at one occasion. Looks like the new Defense-against-the-Dark-Arts (played by David Thewlis) teacher is quite a joker. I was not too impressed by the first hour of the film, but things get better quickly afterward. Also the snow at Hogwarts (snowball fight) and paper plane parts are nicely done. Trelawney (Emma Thompson), another teacher at Hogwarts, is really creepy during one scene, almost reminded me of a horror sequence from "The Exorcist". One of the sad highlight of the movie is Buckbeak's killing although it gets reversed and we don't even see it.There were a couple negative points too, however. One would be how Harry all of a sudden uses magic against Snape when he encounters Oldman's character, who Harry thought would want to kill him. I found that whole scene pretty cringeworthy and illogical. And as I said earlier, I had some problems with the way Potter is always displayed like some huge powerful superhero. Radcliffe's mediocre acting doesn't help much. Michael Gambon takes over from hereon as Dumbledore for Richard Harris, who died before this was made. The film's biggest strength is possibly the ending. The last hour of the film is among the best the Potter franchise has to offer and all the little details about Harry and Hermione reliving the actual events are done with so much precision that I applaud the makers of this event, for example how he did see himself and not his dad. Only question I asked myself is why would he want to live with Oldman's character if he saw his dad who was supposedly alive (again)? But no more spoilers now. Just watch it yourself. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe how good this film is. I have always thought Goblet of Fire was the best of the series. But today that title has officially gone to Prisoner of Azkaban.A kid as I was almost a decade ago could never understand how this film is well-plotted and masterly directed. It is a long movie and requires a long attention span, a good long term memory, and a profound knowledge of the world of Hogwarts to understand the brilliance of this movie. To look at it, it's about being better than the you a few hours ago. Nothing could be more inspirational than that. It's about seeing truth and making friend. Rowling's writing has always been about magic and love, but this particular episode is the last of the three thin books, and it reserved all the magical and mysterious sparks that defined "Harry Potter". There are a huge amount of lovely details in this movie, the tree playing with four seasons, the fact that walking through a ghost makes you chilly and uncomfortable... This movie reminds me of the pure pleasure of reading Ms. Rowling's books when I was in elementary school.Surprising, after 10 years, this time I recognized the director of the movie in end credit. Last year when I saw Mr. Cuarón receiving Oscar on live TV I didn't realize he was the one who realized my childhood dream. The Patronus Charm and Dementor visual is extremely well done that it exceeds almost all other attempts at dreamy scenes. Professor Lupin's office setting, the look of the map, the music accompanying Lupin's teaching... The magic is in every dot of detail and Cuarón's magic reacted in every right way to Ms. Rowling's. I love Harry Potter. But I just realized I would never loved it so much if it were not for this movie. It's magic to experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't able to capture the book's power, but technically remarkable Potter film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid reader of the Harry Potter series, I'm a bit disappointed the very first time I saw it. At first, I find the minimalist approach rather awkward given the "loud" first two films. When compared to the experience I had with the book, it lacked the powerful drive of the story. It was also disappointing to find out that they excluded many twists and other amusing details that were found in the book. I thought that the film brought injustice to an avid reader, but I also thought that it was also unjust to undermine the film's quality. The visuals were impressive, and the unique storytelling was a breakthrough in the series. It was certainly better than the first two because it was a sublime Potter movie, a film that may be enjoyed both by children and adults alike. It's quality is close to the films that you see in a critic's top ten of the year; and yes, it can be a critic's fave.I watched the film for the second time, no longer as an avid reader; thereby watching the film just the way it was, as a standalone film without any comparison to the book. The experience was much better this time. Disappointment transformed into amusement and even admiration. There were lots of humor "bits" in it and most of them were not easily noticed (some were rather dry actually). They could be found even in scenes where they were least expected. Just let the director take you, and you may find amusement in many of its details. I think that Harry Potter was at last given a chance to show its magnificent and competitive side in this adaptation.Relative to the performances in the first two films, the acting has improved. Harry, Ron, and Hermione owned their characters more. The new Dumbledore was energetic, and I thought he was fascinating although he wasn't able to get the mysterious and gentle side of the late Richard Harris' Dumbledore. Not all acting were very convincing for me, but at least it was much better this time. The direction was great. Alfonso Cuaron gave a sophisticated approach to the film; it was also a film that adults may enjoy too. The musical score was minimalist, and it had many "little" tunes in it. Additional themes were composed by John Williams, and I could remember best the music during Buckbeak's flight and the theme during the time when Harry and Lupin were talking about Harry's parents. What I find lacking in the score, however, was a unifying theme given a more varied landscape of music. Speaking of the effects, Buckbeak, the Whooping Willow, and the dementors were the most impressive creations. The downside, however, happened during the werewolf scene. Other than that, the scenes looked vibrant, and they were colored such that they looked less monotonous, as opposed to the palette of the first two films. Hogwarts and the surroundings looked better in this film. The third film improved many things about a Potter movie. It was not close to the book's power but it managed to capture its essence. As a film, it was a bit short to be called a masterpiece, but the production quality was already remarkable for a Potter movie. It could disappoint as many fans as it could, but I think it was generally a good movie to watch. To the avid readers, may a modified viewing approach work on you; but I think this movie will work best on those who have not yet read the book but who have seen the first two films already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cuaron puts the vision of a great director in the Harry Potter world, and the result is the most enjoyable film of the saga. The photography and design of the wizarding world is a big plus point of the film: simple but with great meaning and substance. However, the transition of the trio to his teenage version seen somewhat forced, botched. Especially in the dialogues and some situations that seem obvious for this purpose. Yet, some scenes featuring the boys have an interesting force. The acting is not the strong point of the film, as many want to believe, but the cadence and the visual art. Cuaron manages to, however, succeed and provide the most interesting film in the series (even for non-fans)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfonso Cuaron Works That Potter Magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that this is the only entry in the series that doesn't revolve around Lord Voldemort (As much). "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", is the turning point. Introducing more talent, more characters and more thorough stories that will happen to effect Harry's life for the rest of the series.The story follows Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts, as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban prison and wants to murder him. This leads to a series of ghouls known as "Dementors" (Azkaban's guards) patrolling the school, whilst everyone remains unaware that Black has more involvement in Harry past than everybody seems to lead on.Finally, we get to see those exterior shots of Hogwarts re-imagined, a great enjoyment to see as I was never much a fan of the look from the first two movies. The introduction of Remus Lupin who is played brilliantly by David Thewlis, and stunning debut from Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore (R.I.P Richard Harris). But unsurprisingly, the character who ultimately steals the show is Sirius Black, played with charisma and desperation from Gary Oldman.Again, it's the first time we are introduced to a new kind of evil. That comes in the form of the shrieking shack, escaped convicts and somehow it even manages to include a sub-plot on a court case about a magical animals fate that coincides with the main narrative. All that's left to say is that great performances come from Daniel, Rupert &amp; Emma. As the characters are becoming more fleshed out and definitely more vulnerable to all these dangers.Final Verdict: Alfonso Cuaron really adds a great style and edge to the franchise. Those who are fans of the books do not want to miss this very likable entry in the series. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfonso is the right man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chamber of Secrets and Philosopher Stone has been done back to back. After the amazing work Chris Columbus did for the Potter movies he was Physically and emotionally exhausted, there was no way he could do another Harry Potter film. Beside this fact I think the Potter universe also needed some changes. Because in the books from book 3 it is going to change something. We get some darker themes and I think it was the right thing to bring on a new director. 1 and 2 were true childish films and you could see that on the look of the film. Hogwarts is going to be darker. So the third one needed a new Director. The choice that Chris remained on in the crew to guide the new film crew onto the Post Chris era was really good.I understand that in first place there was some hesitation about having Alfonso Cuarón as the new director as there were so many other possibilities. But choosing Alfonso as Director was truly the best decision they could make for this film. Alfonso found the right balance in this film of darkness and emotion and children themes. Although 3th hasn't much children themes anymore. Cuarón decision to film in Scotland was one of those changes and I really liked that choice because he really seemed to understand the story and really had his own vision. I immediately became a fan of him. And the main reason was his way of filming. He takes the audience really into story like you really walk through the corridors of Hogwarts. And that was something I loved.Looking at casting he did a very good job. Gary Oldman and David Thewlis are just made for their character. Gary can do anything , every role. He just brings this role over on screen on such an professional way, he became my #1 actor of all time. Now I've seen 17 movies of him. Because the death of Richard Harris there also needed to be a new Dumbledore and that was something really scary. Sir Michael Gambon did the role on his own way, and he had a very hard job because he could never do it better than Harris. So they could have asked Peter O'Toole or McKellen or Christopher Lee but it wouldn't matter. Harris played the role of Dumbledore on such a beautiful way. When I read about Dumbledore I keep seeing Richard. So at the casting I think Alfonso brought some international names into it. Looking at the movie as a whole Alfonso did an fantastic job with the right balance in the film. He brought the story over so well. There are certain moments in the film which he focused on. Emotional moments between Gary and Daniel and David and Daniel. Which are maybe the most beautiful moments of the whole series. And Alfonso can bring this over so beautifully that it really hits you.The acting in the film was amazing. Daniel Emma and Rupert really get better.I give this film 10/10 An amazing sequel to the start of Chris!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is easily my favourite of the three Harry Potter films so far. The real magic of this film is that, simply put, it is the first in the series to really make optimal use of the medium of film to look at some different aspects of the world of Harry Potter.In the movie, we see things that were not in the book, but could have been. From a simple and quick scene of the boys in Gryffindor trying candies that make them sound like different animals, to the very vocal shrunken heads that show up on the Knight Bus and in the town of Hogsmeade, and to the subtle (and not-so-subtle) changes made to Hogwarts itself, we get little glimpses into this world that we haven't seen before, even if we've read all of the books cover to cover and back again.With that in mind, "Azkaban" is remarkably faithful to the book. The core of the story is there, and the characters really come to life. Some of the details are glossed over, and one of our family's favourite minor characters, Sir Cadogan, is given short shrift (take heart, he does show up in the deleted scenes). Nevertheless, the humour of the book and the essential nature of the characters and the story are captured in this film almost perfectly.Running heavily throughout this film is the theme of time. Anyone who's read the book already knows why this is, but from the moment the students get to Hogwarts one can't help but notice the gigantic pendulum swinging back and forth in the entrance hall, or the massive gears of a clock, always moving, in the big window at the front of the school. The change of seasons is also handled in a very clever visual motif. In the last 20 minutes or so of the film time is an even stronger presence, as even the music takes on a steady rhythm, like the ticking of the clock. Time, its passage and its usage, is a very important theme to this story, and the film makes good use of it.In terms of the technical aspects, "Azkaban" also makes a standout impression. The visual effects really do the story justice, and are seamless rather than a distraction. Even more than that, the design of the film really captures both the wonders and the horrors of Harry Potter's world. The changes made to the look of Hogwarts work to its benefit, and the design of Trelawney's classroom fits her personality perfectly. The design of the Dementors, on the other hand, is absolutely blood-chilling -- even more frightening than I had imagined them. The acting, particularly that of the kids, has undergone vast improvements, and the addition of talents like Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black certainly didn't hurt. Perhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise was David Thewlis, who portrayed Professor Lupin perfectly.I've been pretty harshly critical about John Williams' music for the previous two Potter films, as I felt that his work for them was bland and unremarkable, and the series deserved better. Finally, for the third film, we got it. Williams' music for "Azkaban" is rich and adds depth to the story. At times he adopts a classical, almost baroque style in the music, while at others he allows it to be more whimsically modern. The music for the last twenty minutes or so, with the aforementioned theme of time worked into it, is one of the best pieces I've heard from Williams in a long time. My hat is off to John Williams for finally giving Harry Potter the music he deserves.Alfonso Cuaron, who takes the directing helm for "Azkaban," has really done something amazing. Throughout the film he walks the fine line between the scary aspects of the story (very scary indeed) and the humorous ones (very funny indeed), so that neither seems out of place, even when they're happening in the same scene. His attention to detail is outstanding, and the result is that we see in "Azkaban" many complex scenes with multiple events happening at once. The main characters may be having a discussion, while in the same room we see ghosts chasing one another in the Headless Hunt, or chairs putting themselves on a table, and remarkably it never gets confusing or overwhelming. These things add to the effect I mentioned earlier, of exploring the world of Harry Potter more fully while still telling the story. For the first time in this film one really gets a feeling for the richness and breadth of that world, as we have already seen in the books.My family and I enjoyed the first two Harry Potter films immensely, but for me, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is the first movie in the series that I felt truly lived up to the book, not only because it stayed true to the essentials of the story, but also because it felt free to explore new aspects of the world of Harry Potter. Part of the magic of the books is that they give us new wonders to enjoy, and finally we have a film that weaves the very same spell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a good movie. Really accentuates the friendship between Harry, Hermione, Ron. And it also shows how much Harry dislikes his Aunt and Uncle. To me it is probably the best HP movie because it's the only one that doesn't focus on the crap between Harry and Voldemort but focus's on how Harry finds family in the most unexpected person. I also like how it shows where the teenagers hang out on the weekends other than just the castle grounds. It also shows more insight into the Weasley family and just ho much they love Harry like family. It adds in another feature of the wizarding world: The Knight Bus which is freaking cool. If you like Lord of the Rings Harry Potter is a good movie series to watch. Same thing with Harry Potter lovers LOTR is a good movie to watch.10 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

Breaking from the monotony of the previous 2 chapters, Harry Potter &amp; the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first time we get a genuine taste of how magical, enchanting &amp; mystifying the world of Harry Potter really is and the film as a whole is, in my opinion, the best installment of the Harry Potter franchise.Based on J.K. Rowling's 3rd novel &amp; covering Potter's adventure during his 3rd year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry, Harry Potter &amp; the Prisoner of Azkaban is a fresh overhaul &amp; re- evaluation of every single thing that we've seen in the series, so far, and the changes are apparent in the smallest of details this time. And now for the plot summary, Harry Potter is in danger yet again as the convicted murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban (Wizard's prison) &amp; is coming after Harry with all he's got.Chris Columbus directed the first 2 chapters of the franchise &amp; even though his adaptations followed the respective novels pretty closely, there is no denying that both films felt somewhat dull, boring &amp; flavourless along with low repeat value. For this film, Alfonso Cuarón takes the director's helm and succeeds immensely in providing a refreshing outlook to the whole film with quality narration &amp; expert execution of its technical aspects. The film deviates from the novel by a great deal but it all eventually ends up working in the film's favour.Coming to the technical aspects, its vivid cinematography is absolutely dazzling for it adds a magical vibe to the entire film &amp; makes terrific use of colour palette. Even something as small as transition from one scene to another or the sound made by the wand when a spell is cast ends up adding flavours of its own to the whole film &amp; enriches the cinematic experience. Thanks to its tight editing, not a single scene feels irrelevant to the plot &amp; even costumes get to play a major role this time.Also, this is the final time we have John Williams composing for a Harry Potter film and although the signature theme of the franchise stays in tact, the rest of the film's score is brought from the ground up to go with its much revamped look. And from start to finish, Williams' soundtrack here provides a sense of warmth &amp; feelings of various emotions that flows in harmony from one scene to the next. And just like the film, the soundtrack of Harry Potter &amp; the Prisoner of Azkaban is the finest in the series &amp; also ranks as one of Williams' finest compositions.Coming to the performances, the young cast has matured greatly &amp; one can see that in the excellent performances each one of them delivers this time. Amongst the recurring cast, Alan Rickman as Snape once again steals the show but the improvement in the performances of Radcliffe, Grint, Watson &amp; Felton is worth mentioning. Michael Gambon takes over the role of Dumbledore from Richard Harris &amp; chips in with an energetic performance. As for the new additions, it's Gary Oldman &amp; David Thewlis who shine in their roles of Sirius Black &amp; Prof. Lupin, respectively.On an overall scale, Alfonso Cuarón's Harry Potter &amp; the Prisoner of Azkaban does everything right from start to finish. It manages to find the right balance between its drama, adventure &amp; action elements and takes a remarkably fresh approach in adapting the novel on the film canvas. Brilliantly directed, cleverly narrated, deftly scripted, nicely performed, exquisitely photographed, elegantly edited &amp; wonderfully scored, this wicked adventure is arguably the best chapter of its series, one of the best films of its year &amp; one of the finest works of its genre as well. Delightfully recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The franchise can finally be taken seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Chris Columbus abdicating at the sight of dark material, the Harry Potter was gratefully gobbled up by Alfonso Cuaron, a director having only at that point turned heads with the incredibly sexy Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001). This is a vastly different Potter to that which came before. When his dead parents are insulted by an obnoxious aunt (Pam Ferris), Harry blows her out of the window, kicking his bedroom cupboard in a rage. There's no plinky-plonky music or pie-in-the-face sight gags, and when Harry steps outside of his house, the streets are grey and grim, not a cosy suburban horror show.After fleeing another run-in with the Dursleys, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) hops on the Knight Bus, which takes him to the Leaky Cauldron where he is to learn his fate having used magic outside of Hogwarts. Best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are there waiting for him, when they all learn that convicted serial killer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from notorious prison Azkaban, possibly with Harry in his sights. With the ghostly guardians of Azkaban, the Dementors, surrounding Hogwarts in search of Black, Harry finds his own life in danger, and seeks help from new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and friend of his parents, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis).With Columbus's kid-friendly approach ditched and Cuaron's more focused direction, the franchise at this point could finally be taken seriously, with real threats finally entering Harry's life, and the trio's characters hitting puberty and becoming more feisty in the process. Cuaron also wisely adapted the book, rather than simply filming the pages, and this is noticeably shorter than it's predecessors despite being the biggest book at this point. Hermione is less precocious, Ron is less gurny, and Daniel Radcliffe finally puts in a decent performance. He isn't perfect, but there's a delightful eccentricity to the actor's mannerisms which make him endearing to watch.Apart from a climax that makes as little sense as it does in the novel, the story is also more gripping. We finally see Harry's past intertwine with his present, with revelations coming out of the woodwork, and Harry finally starting to learn more about his parents. There's also some genuinely frightening scenes, including the Dementors - hooded, faceless ghouls - and a scene involving a certain character's dangerous affliction. In Cuaron's hands, Harry Potter is genuinely magic, funny when it should be, dark when it needs to be, and it's rather disappointing he didn't go on to direct more of them.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GOOD Harry Potter film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay with that above statement I might get a few negative responses but this is all opinion based and in my opinion I didn't like the first two. I liked the fantasy world and some of the actors to play their parts do really good jobs but all in all I wasn't really THAT invested in the stories and the pacing (ESPECIALLY for Chamber Of Secrets) well... I was really bored with them. I decided to stay on with the series because I watched them as a kid and this was the one to change the tone.The plot is that after Harry accidentally inflates his aunt he goes to Hogwarts but the latest news shows that a convicted murderer, known for betraying Harry's parents named Sirius Black is the first person to escape from Askaban Prison. While this is going on creatures called Dementors who feed on happy memories are guarding Hogwarts so he can't go in the grounds.Okay, first of all the stuff I have to complain about. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore (and for that matter Dawn French as the Fat Lady). I don't think I'm alone in saying this but I really preferred Richard Harris' take on the character. He doesn't do anything spectacularly bad it's just that it's like watching a different character than it is watching someone reprise someone else's role and Dawn French as the Fat Lady... No comment, I just found her scenes more cringe-worthy then they were actually funny (which is the route they were going for!).Then there was Emma Thompson's character... She wasn't in the others so I'm just going to call her "Emma Thompson's character" It's exactly the same as Dawn French as the Fat Lady in the sense that they were meant to be funny but aren't. I mean she just plays her part a little too goofy for me, enough to almost fast forward the scenes with her in it. I really hope she isn't in any of the others or at least she is downplayed.Aside from that this isn't a bad movie. The pacing is enough to keep me interested, all the actors do a good job and the Special effects look much more polished than some of the stuff in the other two movies. The actors aside from the three I mentioned (Apologies to any fans of these actors reading this) all do very good jobs. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is a very good addition and the actors we already know hold their own in this movie. The writing has improved the characters a bit (like making Malfoy more of a run-of-the-mill jerk than the stereotype we've seen in the first 2 and in about 50,000 other movies).So would I recommend this after the five hours of sitting through the first two. I'd say if you don't like them to stay and check this one out because this does change the tone of the series and it is a much more interesting watch than the other two movies. If you liked the first two then I will recommend this one. It's not perfect but if you're looking for a little fun then this is worth it, provided you've seen the first two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another magical sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the book Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, this is the third film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story about Harry Potter In his third year at Hogwarts, where he discovers the convicted mass murderer, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. Black is known as Lord Voldemort's most devoted follower, and he's after Harry to avenge Voldemort. But, Harry soon discovers that there is a bigger culprit behind the conviction and that there is a strong connection between Harry and Sirius.While there are some light-hearted scenes like the previous two films, this movie has more suspense, drama and action as it delves upon more elements of the Dark Lord and Harry's past. I think the actors did a more dramatic and compelling performance in this one, and witches Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and the school's all-powerful headmaster, Albus Dumbledore (Gamdon) return in this sequel, providing another mystical performance. The plot is good and is more exciting, and the special effects were decent. Overall, it's a good sequel and I think is one of the best in the series altogether.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is the third movie of the Harry Potter series and in this one we have Harry Potter who is in his third year at Hogwarts and he is hunted by a dangerous prisoner who has escaped from the Wizards Prison.This third movie it has more suspense than the second and I can compared it with the first one which was simply magnificent. I think that in this movie we see some other things and not only magic. We see the passion for success by Harry and the passion for revenge for the death of his parents.I liked this movie more than the second movie of this series and I liked the interpretations of Daniel Radcliffe and Gary Oldman who plays really well as Sirius Black.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually the best and generally one of the best of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a less than passable second film, the Harry Potter series got back to greatness as Alfonso Cuarón took place in the director's chair for Prisoner of Azkaban and gave Hogwarts a whole new style I very much enjoyed. Not all gone is the ludicrousness of the second film and book with some scenes like the bloating Aunt Marge or Emma Thompson's failed portrayal of Hogwarts' divination teacher Sybil Trelawney decreasing the Spaniard's serious approach to the source material. However, Cuarón makes up for such flaws with a lovable style and new ways of story- telling his directorial predecessor Chris Columbus didn't venture. I personally adored the cinematography of Michael Seresin, especially the establishing shots of season and location that were used in an almost Arthaus-fashion in Prisoner of Azkaban. Not only that, but Cuarón also fully succeeded (at least in my opinion) in making what is likely the most difficult story of all seven novels understandable. I had some issues with the obvious way he depicted Hermione's time-travelling (if you didn't get it by the fifth time Ron stated "Hermione, you weren't there when we came into this class" then your intelligence might be sub- par), but he excelled himself in other parts, i.e. in the subject of Sirius Black. Cue Sirius Black, with Gary Oldman the director got a fantastic actor to work with and the Englishman established one of the most likable characters in the series with an excellent performance. Three other wonderful English thespians joined the ever-growing HP cast, namely David Thewlis, Timothy Spall, and Michael Gambon, with the latter actually giving a better (and more philosophical) Dumbledore than the late Richard Harris. And despite a lot of problems I had in the first two films, the three main child actors got significantly better with Cuarón to direct them, which indicated for the first time that Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are in fact talented actors. Altogether, I greatly enjoyed Prisoner of Azkaban, which turned out to be a humorous while still serious approach to J.K. Rowling's novel and impressed me through outstanding visual (and aural ? John Williams did another splendid score) work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film of the Series So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third instalment of the impressive Harry Potter series. This blows the first two films out of the water. I can't believe it was the least successful Potter movie! Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic as Harry Potter, finally getting used to being the talk of the planet. Rupert Grint again is wonderful as Ron Weasley. Emma Watson is great as clever Hermione Granger, who has mysteriously turned into a spunky character.The appearances of several other cast members are also a delight. Gary Oldman steals the show as escaped prisoner and Harry Potter's godfather Sirius Black. David Thewlis is good as troubled teacher Professor Lupin, who turns out to be a werewolf. Emma Thompson as loopy Divination teacher Professor Trelawney is also a delight.Even though this film is a bit long, it didn't bother me one bit. I enjoyed watching this film more than the first two. It does get darker, and spookier, but the twists and shocks just kept me watching.Overall, the best film in the series yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkest and best one yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third movie in the franchise, and it's the darkest one yet. We're introduced to Dementors, vile creatures who are tasked to guard the prison of Azkaban. When Voldemort disciple Sirius Black escapes, Dementors are assigned to guard Hogwarts putting Harry and his friends in danger.The introduction of Dementors ushers in a new darker chapter in the franchise. These CGI creatures look every bit the evil creatures they're suppose to be. Accomplished director Alfonso Cuarón shows his great skills in creating tension and atmosphere. Even the darken corridors of Hogwarts are more foreboding. Without spoilers, I also must praise Hermione's part of the plot. The story loops created are usually fraught with problems. This one is done with care, and works great. Looking back, the change in tone is what drew me into the Harry Potter franchise. It is the first great Harry Potter movie and in my opinion, the best of the lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third Time's The Charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello fellow readers, today we'll be looking at the third Harry Potter film, The Prisoner of Azkaban. This is my favorite of the whole series for a lot of reasons. Gary Oldman plays a wicked Serious Black and Daniel Radcliffe gets very used to his important role as Harry Potter. The film is a lot darker than the first two seeing that a new director steps in. The film has exciting moments and even beats my liking for my second favorite Harry Potter film, The Chamber of Secrets. Anyway this is the film where the three friends grow older and thus begins the rise of Voldemort in the next film. Also, this is the film where Draco Malfloy gets his hair down unlike in the previous two films where it is pulled back. All of this triggers milestones in the world surrounding Harry Potter and his friends which makes this film an important one. This triumphant film is my favorite of the Harry Potter series and that won't change any time soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goof? In Prof. Lupin's class, after Lupin turns the make believe Dementor into a full moon, the scar on Harry's forehead appears on the left side of his forehead, instead of the right side. I question this mistake because it not only is all too obvious, it is also a mistake that is hard to believe it was made! This film stands with all the others and being top drawer, and will remain a classic for all of those living in centuries to come, provided there are centuries to come! 2015? I fear that I shall live long enough to witness the end of life as we know it to be.As for The Harry Potter series of movies ... they stand tall with other such serial movies like "Pirates Of The Caribbean", The Thin Man", and those films that Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy appeared in together! All of which I shall continue to watch over and over again. True, its all background noise to me ... but I do look up now and again, and I'm always happy with what I see when it comes to these movies that were perfectly cast, perfectly written, and exceptionally directed.Now, when it comes to a favorite character in the Harry Potter movies, I lean more towards Moaning Myrtle! She should have been used more in the films! Three cheers for Shirley Henderson ... perfectly cast for sure! She was a total delight! However, I do tend to pick the underdog as a favorite character, I guess. My favorite character in "Bambi" was Flower, the skunk!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely Different Style Than The First Two, But Still Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly Chris Columbus stopped with the directing of the "Harry Potter" movies after "The Chamber of Secrets". In my opinion, he was by far the best director of the saga. He was replaced by Alfonso Cuarón, who, I think so, wasn't a well known director at that point. What you can say from the first seconds on is that his style of adaptating "The Prisoner of Azkaban" is completely different than Columbus did it.Even though it seems like another "Harry Potter" series, it's still great. The story is very dark, and Cuarón captures it wonderfully. The look of Hogwarts Castle is also a lot different - sadly I don't like it very much. Even the kids look a lot different. In this case it's a great idea to change it, because they look like they have a lot more freedom. They don't wear the Hogwarts cloaks in their free time anymore, but normal clothing.The story itself is fantastic and one of the best of "Harry Potter". Overall it's an amazing movie, it's sad that Cuarón only produced one. So, nine out of ten points!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually excellent book adaptation; a darker turn for the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third film of the 'Harry Potter' franchise, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is a very good fantasy film dealing with wizardry (though, if you are to watch this, you already know what 'Harry Potter' is about). With the change in direction, this film marks a deviation from the more childish style of Chris Columbus first two films, with a darker, more sinister tone employed by Alfonso Cuaron.Following their tradition, however, HP3 is visually terrific and has excellent special effects; in addition to Hogwarts enchanting visage, we now also have the Hogsmeade village to thank for the good photography. Also, much more of Hogwarts is explored now too; even in the books it feels as if we know very little of the place, despite all that happens.The creatures, like Buckbeak and the wraith-like Dementors, bring an eerie brilliance to the screen whenever they appear. Some of their appearances late in the film are great to watch; actually, most of the late portion of the film is excellent.The adult cast is excellent. Michael Gambon respectfully stands to the task of substituting Richard Harris, and both David Thewlis and Gary Oldman (excellent casting choices, by the way) shine in their scenes. The returners from the first two (Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Richard Griffiths and Robbie Coltrane, among others) also bring good performances again. Alan Rickman, in special, is excellent; his interactions with Thewlis are some of the movie's best. Emma Thompson is also present now, though she adds little (her character was one of the least interesting to me, and her acting was rather uneventful).The younger cast is the same as before, though admittedly more mature (keeping to the tone of the film). Emma Watson is excellent as a more serious Hermione, a truly promising actress; Rupert Grint is likable and funny, truly capturing the book's image of Ron; and Tom Felton does a good job as Draco (the character's flaws are the same as the books, nothing he could correct).I am not as sure of Daniel Radcliffe, though. He is more mature, and by now it's difficult to think of Harry without thinking of him as the character, but he still lacks a lot in the acting department. There are many good moments that end up lacking in the emotional aspect thanks to his weak acting; he never makes it work on sad, emotional scenes (when he is supposed to be crying, for example), and his facial expressions are often too overdone to the point of hilarity.'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is a remarkable screen adaptation that knows how to play the book's strengths while keeping true to its source (though unfortunately also keeping the book's weaknesses). Knowledge of the first two films/books of the franchise is needed, yes, but that is no problem as the franchise is a very enjoyable one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Improves Upon The First Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two entertaining and likable films starring the students of Hogwarts, we have the first truly great Harry Potter film. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban takes everything that made the first two films great, and expands upon them, making this easily the best Potter film so far.Harry Potter and friends are once again studying at Hogwarts, though the escape of an insane murderer named Sirius Black threatens the lives of everyone at Hogwarts, namely Harry.The characters are as lovable as ever, music is great, acting is (mostly) solid, etc. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban avoids many of the pitfalls of the first two films, and manages to bring a whole lot of new magic to the series.The story, while seemingly simple at first, becomes more and more complex as the story unwinds. The plots for the original was relatively simple, and while the sequel's plot was a large improvement, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban takes things a step further.The visual effects are significantly better in this film than the previous two. Magical spells and creatures come to life in a more real and convincing way than the previous two films ever managed.Despite a nearly 2 and a half hour length, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is entertaining from start to finish, with few moments of exception. There are loads of memorable scenes packed into this film, from suspenseful action scenes, amusing spell and magic displays, and some very polished use of time travel at the end.The acting is good, but as is expected of child actors, some more emotional scenes are performed quite poorly (and dare I say it; laughably). I'm specifically referring to Daniel Radcliffe, who's acting as Harry Potter is good, but he simply cannot convey the emotional complexity his character is demanding. The other actors are good (including Michael Gambon who replaces Richard Harris as Dumbledore), though Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney steals every scene she's in (though admittedly, she's not in many).The score, composed by John Williams, features a diversity that's not evident in the previous two scores. Moments of fun and intense action are scored pitch perfect by the master composer. This is the last Potter film that Williams scored for, but it seems that Williams really brought his A-game for his last outing at Hogwarts.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is funnier, smarter, and more exciting than anything witnessed in the previous two films. Massively entertaining, and certainly magical, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a superb fantasy film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Harry Potter Movie that isn't Just an Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first Harry Potter movie that isn't just an adaptation, it's also a good movie on its own. Not that the first two were bad, but they felt more like adaptations than they do films. Why is this one better? Let's take a look, shall we?First of all, the technicals are far superior in this film than they were on both The Philosopher's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets. The cinematography has a lot more style going on here than they did in the first two. Alfonso Cuaron is a very Gothic director and it shows here because there's so much more grey and darkness in the cinematography this time around and it looks beautiful. The special effects are also upgraded, while the first film had some great effects for the time, it's definitely aged. The second film had a much smoother look with its CGI but there's nothing terribly impressive about them. This film however, still looks excellent nine years later. All the creatures in this film have a lot more detail in their movements and design and Buckbeak(a hippogriff in this film) is probably the best example. During his introduction scene, he's always doing some sort of movement in the background. If you look carefully, you can actually see him taking a dump, I'm not kidding. There's also a lot more detail in each shot. Every time I watch this movie, I always see something in the background that I didn't notice before such as a certain prop or someone in the background doing something. Lastly, the score is even more beautiful and elegant in this film than the first two.Secondly, the story is a lot more engaging this time around. The first film had a fun, imaginative story but what it lacked was compelling human drama. Though, it definitely had its emotional moments. The second film had a little more human drama going on but there isn't any real character arcs for our three protagonists. This film in comparison, actually has adult themes and compelling character arcs. This movie is ultimately about confronting your past. Harry's character arc in this movie is about learning to get over his past. Throughout the film, he's haunted by his past. He has memories of his mother's scream as she's about to be killed by Voldemort, he wants to murder Sirius Black when he learns that he was the reason the Potters are dead, and he constantly gets attacked by Dementors whom sucks away his best memories and inflicts some of his darkest memories. But throughout the film, he gets over his past because he learns to remember who they were and what they stood for. The scene that illustrate his arc the most is when Sirius and Remus want to murder Peter Pettigrew, the real man who's responsible for the death of the Potters, but Harry tells them not to because his parents wouldn't have wanted them to become murderers. That scene shows that he remembers his parents for who they were and will do what they would've done.So there's some good character stuff in here but one thing I don't like is that there's this really cheesy speech given by Sirius Black at the end of the film that goes like " Even though they're dead, they're still in your heart. " Come on, was that speech necessary? Another thing I don't like is that Harry at the beginning of the film kinda looks like a murderer. He accidentally blows up Aunt Marge when she insulted his parents but he doesn't even think about trying to save her! That's just cruel!Some other things I want to touch upon is the shooting, acting, and writing. Cuaron has a very unconventional way of shooting. The dialogue scenes in this movie often are shot in one-take without any edits and that's pretty unusual for a movie today but I actually really like it! The acting from the adults are good as always, Emma Thompson is really funny here as Professor Trelawney but I think the showstealer is David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. He has a warmth and wisdom to his performance that makes it believable why Harry latches onto him so much. The kids definitely show some improvement here compared to the first film where they were just kinda reading lines. Daniel Radcliffe kinda overacts here and there but he overall carries the film well. Rupert Grint doesn't do a whole lot but he interacts well with Emma Watson and there's some really funny moments with them together. And Emma seems a lot more natural this time around. This film is a lot less faithful to the book compared to the first two films but I actually think that's a good thing. The first two had somewhat stilted dialogue and awkward pacing here and there but this film fixes these problems because there's more attention to making a good movie rather than just being faithful to the book.Overall, this film is a huge improvement over the first two. Better acting, writing, and technicals make this film triumph over the first two. I am gonna give it a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am uneasy person with long sequels and I was prepared for a disaster when I started to watch the movie. I am not Harry Potter fan either so after the over-boring Chamber of secrets, my expectations towards this one were even lower. Luckily this part was a positive surprise. It was but a darker and more exciting sequel it was also funny to watch. It seems the creator team really paid attention to the details and didn't rush with this part same way as with the previous part.The new creatures, "the demendors", were very interesting and frightening and gave the movie totally new power and danger. The overall tension of the film was also way darker than in the first two. This time the danger was something real and in presence all the time.On the other hand the movie had not forgotten the humor either. The first episode in "real" world was refreshing and very fun to watch.In the Chamber of secrets, the wonderful outdoors were more forgotten and we spent unnecessary long time inside the dark halls with little of interesting details. One of the few scenes outside in that one were actually inside a greenhouse which points out how forgotten the outside world really was. This time we will see the wonderful visual side of Hogwarts once more and it is even more detailed than in the first one. The creator team seemed to have realized the infinite possibilities what kind of a world they can create and how well the nature can be combined with it. Along with the nature we will be introduced with several new interesting creatures of the wild too that all have their meaning and part in the movie.The growing up of the actors bring the own spice to the movie. It opens up the chance for elements which were not possible with the children. It seems the old actors are starting to get used to with their roles since they felt more comfortable and seemed to handle their characters better than previously.The biggest flaw with the old movies was the way most students were left behind and the "hero trio" seemed to have the spotlight on all the time although the events were supposed to affect the entire Hogwarts. This time that matter feels more logical because the danger is more centered to Harry Potter, not to the overall school life. Also the teachers seem to be more alive and actually take a contact with the events and the students. In the first movies they seemed to wish someone would get hurt.It still doesn't mean the movie is perfect. It has its own flaws with some of its illogical and slightly paradoxical scenes. Also although the movie lasts for nearby 2? hours, it still feels like it needed something more. It doesn't fill the idea of a complete feature film with the beginning, the halfway and the ending. To be honest the sign "to be continued" would have suited to the ending very well.Overall the movie is a refreshing return to Hogwarts. The story has gained a new strength the actors are more confident with their characters. Also the atmosphere of the magical world lingers in the movie again. As a non-fan, I found this movie to be a far more successful sequel than the previous Chamber of Secrets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the first good Harry Potter film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry finds out a maniac has escaped the wizard prison Azkaban, bent on killing him.A darker, fast-moving installment. The reins are finally given to a real director, and the results are a dramatic improvement. Alfonso Cuaron gives the film an appealing visual style, brings the characters down to earth (with the help of the costume department ? the clothes now look like they've actually been worn), while making the film's fantastical elements (the Dementors, the Whomping Willow) feel at once more real and truly magical.It also helps that the young actors have matured to a level where they've actually begun acting. The only real flaw is that by accentuating the sense of fun, the film ends up feeling a bit slight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter 3 was Good Enough for Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part two of my Harry Potter reviews is a single review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. This movie is very different from the previous two and also from the next five films. We have the same actors from the other two, the only real difference is the director. The director for this film is Alfonso Cuarón and he put his own directing style into the movie. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it did not. He really is the major strength and weakness of the movie itself.Here we are, year three, and another year at Hogwarts is on the way, but a mass murderer named Sirius Black has escaped. Sirius Black is built as an evil character down to the core. You even see it in his name "Black." Black is a color that literally means evil and bad. He is accused of selling out the Potters to Voldemort. Now he is after Harry so Hogwarts is sort of on lockdown. That's our story but I think it was one of the most well written stories. In this movie we are introduced to a lot of new characters and animals. It is a different view of the magic world. There is a little less physical magic such as spells and potions and more of an abstract magic. We have Dementors, Buckbeak, the boggart, werewolves, and animagus' , and many other ways the magic world blows our minds. I like most of them but I have a few problems with the Dementors. First off, they are a complete rip off of the Ringwraiths from Lord of the Rings. Rowling likes to take ideas from Tolkien and make a tiny difference. I don't like that and seeing it on screen just made me think of Frodo and the ring. Dementors are beings that wear all black and have a skeleton like appearance under the cloaks. They are really terrifying and symbolize fear and death. People feel cold when they are near and they suck the happy memories from people. It is a really good idea and it fits well with the film but the appearance could have been done differently. This is twice that Rowling rips off Tolkien and there are more on the way. Its frustrating to fans of movies and books. We are also introduced to Professor Lupin and he is one of my favorite characters throughout. He is a great character and a role model in Harry so in turn he is a role model to the audience. He was a childhood friend of the Potters and he teaches Harry how to fight the Dementors. He has a weird feeling and throughout the film I got the sense he was hiding something and he wasn't all he was showing. I knew this by following the pattern. All Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers have a major flaw and Lupin seemed too good to be true. This is the first movie not directed by Chris Columbus and this is almost a completely different movie. The color scheme is really different. It is very dark and most scenes are dark. He decides to have the kids wear regular street clothes a lot rather than the Hogwarts robes. He tries to be fun and funny a lot in the movie and most of the time it doesn't work. From the opening title sequence when Harry is trying to light up his wand and Uncle Vernon comes in and out of the room. It is supposed to be funny and I think he made too much of an effort to be comical in a simple title screen. We see it again with the shrunken head. Let's set the scene. Harry just made his aunt Marge into a balloon floating up in the sky, OK that was funny and I enjoyed it so touché, but Harry is emotionally torn and upset. He runs away from home and sees the creepy dog so he is sad, scared, and angry. Then the Knight Bus shows up and we hear about Sirius Black and how he is a murderer. All these negative emotions and feelings and it instantly turns to comedy with his one liners and unfunny comments to Ernie. The whole Knight Bus scene was a disaster and I wish it was done differently. Not all was a fail. I liked the scene when Marge was blown up and the buttons flew off and hit Dudley. It was funny and it worked. Same with Harry in the invisibility cloak and hitting Draco with snowballs and messing with Hermione and Ron. Little things like that made the movie better and added a nice touch to a very depressing and sad story arch. A big question in making the movie is how they will handle the big twist at the end and how mind bending the writing is. I think it was done brilliantly. Walking out it made me think how it actually happened. It was a different type of magic and the director nailed it perfectly. It had a plot hole or two but it makes the audience think and try to make sense of it so that's a good thing. The third book and movie is very significant in my opinion. It is different from all the rest mainly because Voldemort isn't that important. He is only mentioned a few times but he isn't a real threat. Sirius Black is the primary focus as the bad guy. I loved that. I like that there was another sense of evil in the world other than Voldemort. There was something else to fear and it made the world more real and believable. Overall, Harry Potter 3 is not a bad movie but it has a few flaws. The directing style is really well done but has a few things I did not like so Harry Potter 3 gets the WillyT Honorable Mention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect blend of darkness and Humour ..... for some</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of All the Harry Potter movies this is by far the most enjoyable. I am not a big fan of Harry Potter but this is a film that kept me entertained for the whole film ...... Something that is hard for movies to do despite dragging on in some parts. to me the first two Harry potter films were more of a Seven year old movie and despite minor moments that i found entertaining, that only made up for 15-25 minutes of the movie.And an honorable mention has to go to The introduction of Sirius Black who i hoped would get more screen time in the goblet of fire (Luckily we got to see him again in Order of the Pheonix)overall I give this movie an 8 as it is the perfect blend of humor maturity and darkness and it is regarded as the film the first two should have been (At least the last four were OK!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In year three, our cast of unique and magical characters have to deal with a new threat, an escaped prisoner, from Azkaban Prison, who seems to want to kill Harry Potter. Azkaban was a return to the magical formula that made Harry Potter legendary. The story here is suburb and unlike the Chamber of Secrets, it isn't dummied down or rushed for us. New elements are introduced such as the secret map and time travel, but perhaps most important of all we finally see Harry demonstrate some of this incredible power that has led to his fame at Hogwarts. The story was terrific, the action was great, the performances were off the chart, and the childish stuff was kept to a minimum, but was Azkaban perfect? Many critics will tell you that this is the best of the Potter films and it was terrific, but personally I was hoping to see more of the world outside of Hogwarts. I was looking forward to possibly seeing the inside of Azkaban prison and some of the people who are locked up there. While I appreciate the different views and new filming location, it was still centered at Hogwarts. Not a bad thing, but personally I'd have liked to have seen something else. Aside from that, new Director, Alfonso Cuaron, does use parts of the story that were excluded in the previous films, he also does give us a new location, and view of things. Overall, Cuaron really does do a tremendous job, making this film geared more toward young adults than children. Azkaban is much closer to being what J.K. Rowling intended than the Chamber of Secrets was. I absolutely loved this film, there are just some parts of this film that are truly amazing. If you're picky like I am, and are only going to give Harry Potter one shot, then I suggest the film you watch is The Prisoner of Azkaban.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (UK/USA, 2004)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third year of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has begun. This year, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who was accused by the Potter's parents murder, has scape from Azkaban Prison - until then considered as leakproof - and now, everything indicates that he's looking for Harry to finish what he had no opportunity to do.As safety measure, the Dementors - strange creatures that feed themselves with the energies and the soul of anyone who approaches them - are sent by the Ministry of Magic from Azkaban to protect Hogwarts School. But they can make the things become more difficult there too. This time, Professor Lupin will help Harry to discover the truth history of Sirius and why they both are so connected.Within this exciting plot, based on the novel by J. K. Rowling of the same title, Cuarón (The Little Princess, 1995) gamble to its excellent creativity - and good taste - at work with the dark, mysterious and magical photography - so different from the charming and magical world of the first two films, directed by Christopher Columbus - and the ability to work with young minds that developed with "Y tu mamá también" (2001).Kloves can put together a spectacular cast to the development of the series: Gary Oldman ("Hannibal", 2001), Michael Gambon ("Sleepy Hollow", 2001), David Thewlis ("Seven Years in Tibet", 1997) and Emma Thompson ("Love Actually", 2003) are phenomenal actors together to make the fans of Harry Potter becomes increasingly enchanted with the productions. It is important to mention that Gambom was named for replace Richard Harris due to death of it and exceed the expectations of the production team: with his strong Irish accent, managed, along with the dark sphere, given more personality to your character (Albus Dumbleodore) without being noticed as a rookie.Although the amazing cast, the script left to wish. Like the first two films, some details of the story were left out and others being treated only superficially, disappointing a little bit those who also follow the thrilling story of the young wizard through reading. But this point cannot be noticed at first glance: the special effects - in which the team of David Heyman worked hard - even snatch the soul of one who hates the magical world of Harry with the help of the lovely soundtrack composed by John Williams to meet the Scottish sets and landscapes.In this third year of the series, what we have new are the Dementors: vicious creatures that feed on the souls and energies of others, used as guardians of Azkaban, the most safety prison of the wizardry world. They are very similar to the Black Riders from the "The Lord of the Rings". But to balance such cruelty, there is the appearance of the Hippogriff: a lovely creature half-horse and half-eagle, along with the Marauder's Map showing the location of all inside the Hogwarts castle, will make young imagination go very far."Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is, until now, the best movie of the series. Even having developed his script less than it could, can create expectations of what could be the next film of the series, helping to create the obscure sphere that involves the central plot of the story of the young wizard and making your fans stay remain spellbound with each event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is holding no one prisoner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter was a fantastic and well thought up series. The first and second films were pretty mature for children's movies, and I still admired their stories. However, I can see why they didn't pay up plot-wise to Prisoner of Azkaban. First things first, I'm a little reluctant about series that are directed by a numerous amount of directors. It gets... messy. However, this one film is the exception. Alfonso knows what he was doing. 1) New variety of camera techniques. Although I didn't like the fade/circle transitions as much, I enjoyed a lot of the hand-held camera work. You don't see it a lot in filmmaking today. 2) The acting. It seems as though Emma Watson has completely changed as an actress in this film and on. Her acting in the first two films are what some would call dim-witted... ironically. The characters are more realistic and actually have feelings.3) Conflict. Yes, I know there is conflict in every film out there. What most people forget is that most of the conflict needs to be directed towards the main character. Harry almost gets killed by Voldemort in the first film. Harry almost gets eaten by a basilisk in the second film, sure. But it's not enough. Harry falls off his broomstick. He gets yelled at by a teacher who's close to him (which is quite new to the series, frankly). He almost gets his soul sucked out by dementors. A lot of writers are afraid of hurting their main characters. 4) It's emotionally grounded. It's rare to see movies that have this sort of phenomena. Hermione and Hagrid are in love with the hippogrif, despite how harsh of a creature it is. We see Harry's hatred (for the first time) for the person/people who aided in the deaths of his parents. He believes that his own father was the one who drew the dementors away when he almost got his soul sucked out - and it's the first thought he comes across once he awakens from a coma. 5) The motifs. It's also rare to see these in movies, as well! There is the very important and reappearing motif of time in this film, both visually and audibly. There is one entrance to the school that everyone seems to use - and, incidentally, the base of this entrance is a giant clock tower standing like a monolith over a nice atrium. During the entire time travel portion of the film, the faint sound of a stopwatch is heard... for the entire duration from time travel, to climax, to rescuing Sirius.6) The climax itself. Enough said. After Harry and Hermione have travelled back in time and are awaiting their previous fates to take place, Harry brings up the rescue between him and Sirius to Hermione. She claims that only a real powerful wizard could have conjured it. Harry believes it to be his father - and when it comes time for Harry's 'past self' to be rescued from the dementors, it's Harry who rescues himself. He was the powerful wizard after all.7) Almost everything had meaning. I'm tired of watching films that include things that don't have much meaning or use to the story. Why did we spend all those minutes watching Harry practice a patronus charm? Because he uses it during the climax to save himself. That's why. Why did we spend all those minutes watching the Hogwarts Express being infiltrated by dementors? Because they play a big role in the story.I am a strong believer in the difference between good films and enjoyable films. Good films follow the formula, and is static. Enjoyable films rely on opinion and the such. However, it's rare to come across both a good film and an enjoyable film... and I know I had just passed by one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Wicked Finally Came</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does this series get better and better as everyone proclaims? Well, yes and, sadly no.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban sure as hell started that way ? good, that is. The film actually, for once, felt like a real film, meaning well made. Though the previous two entries were not an amateur's projects, this one showed real signs a higher talent took the wand and ran with it. The cinematography was my first indication ? it was crisp, expansive and absolutely gorgeous. It almost made me wonder if Hogwart's Castle had "magically" relocated in the year since the previous entry.That was the first sign that I noticed we were heading in the right direction. The second was a visually older Harry, inside and out. He's running thin on wonder and amazement and he's finally showing signs of frustration. Good. Let it out, Harry. But don't go all Anakin on us?Thirdly, with the locations, most names of creatures, teachers and bleachers (in the backdrop of the never-ending Quidditch matches) and the themes, score or otherwise, established, finally the storytelling can settle in and have fun??until roughly the last third of the movie. I wouldn't necessarily say that's "where it all fell apart" but it was a rather tame and lame finale(s). Sure, I guess, Harry can't always thwart a giant snake (#2) or play a game of chess (#1) as the final battle, but this one ? no spoilers ? was so ho-hum and was completed with one of the most ridiculous final second shot of a movie that I've seen in a long time. I was half tempted to literally erase half a star from my rating for that final moment before the credits rolled. But, as much as it didn't fit and as much as I hated it, I'll just mark it as a "WTF" moment in Harry History. (Like when Harry stole a sucker. I didn't know he was a thief. ??)Leading up to that disappointing third act, there were sure signs of the book here. Now, I haven't, nor plan to, read past book one, but the utter randomness of multiple scenes and characters indicated to me they were just trying to appease the book fans. Although, I'm sure there are a great majority sooo sad that every?single?plot?twist?and?dialogue wasn't involved in every movie. GET OVER IT. I was ecstatic that this was the shortest one, albeit still too long at 2 hours 21 minutes and I DO NOT care to see a 6-hour miniseries of each book (or 42 hours) to ensure every single line was shown on screen.I digress?Once again, Harry's being abused by his adopted family and takes the long journey back to school after summer break. Upon arrival, once again, he's warned not to be there and once again he ignores such "rubbish" ? I'm guessing he's thinking. And finally, once again, Harry &amp; Pals must combat a mystery/terror that threatens to shut down the most unsafe harbor of mutants since Professor Xavier's school, long before J.K. Rowling thought of Hogwarts.Sure, I made that last paragraph out to sound like a complaint, but I confess: it doesn't really bother me. I understand this is the common theme, at least from the first three chapters. What I like is, aside from the obligatory (too long) 25+ minute running time of getting him to Hogwarts, is that once there, the mystery starts sooner and sooner with each film. I'm an impatient guy and can only take so many shots of the kids learning proving to me that A: there's teachers, B: there's classes and C: there's students. Yeah, I get it: it's a school, but can we get back to what Harry needs to solve?Oh, and I also understand we need comic relief, but I've never been a fan of the Three Stooges. The appropriately named Ron Weasley is definitely one of the three stooges and is completely useless. It's painfully obvious that Harry won't be dating miss know-it-all, Hermione, but it's still best they drop him like a bad spell.I know, I know, all of this sounds like criticisms. Allow me to backtrack ? for the first two-thirds, I did enjoy this feature and I liked the addition of David Thewlis and I always like both Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Albus Dumbledore ? although, Richard Harris was much better in the first two.As much as I wanted to proclaim this series has "increasingly gotten better" when it was about an hour over, it was that dreaded middle-of-the-road final act that lowered my score to make it actually slightly dip in quality from Harry Potter #2. I said slightly as I still awarded both 3/5 stars.Here's to Gobleting some Fire for the next movie?(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)</fullReview>

It was a good movie but also bad at the same time. Let me explainThe good: The movie still has it's humor which is great. It has the old Ron that was scared of everything. The enemies were a great addition to the franchise. Great acting that always impresses me when I watch these movies. Making Sirius Black act like a true criminal towards his first scenes.The bad: The movie gets boring. It drags on. Poor action sequences. And those annoying stalking moments with the map, too many of them moments.Overall I give it a 7/10 It is a good movie, but it needs work. The ones before and after it are much better than this one but that's my opinion. This movie remains the weakest of the entire franchise</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the best of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it difficult giving ratings to films, as they're ultimately subjective and have different specifications based on what they're individually attempting to achieve. As a film in the Harry Potter franchise, Prisoner of Azkaban is absolutely deserving of a perfect rating.It's hard to stress just how remarkable this film is. It has a flawless balance between the fantastic spectacle of the previous films and the darkening tone of the later entries. The child leads have evolved to act competently in front of the camera yet thankfully still maintain a charisma and personality that adds humanity to the film.The plot is filled with the usual magical plot-devices and foreboding characters, but is just light enough on the macabre not to alienate younger viewers. The music is just as familiar as in the other entries, but captures well the bleak tone the film purveys.By far the strongest aspect, however, is the visual style. The cinematography is easily the best of the entire franchise. The film has an eerie, washed out feel to it, and director Alfonso Cuarón incorporates incredible scene-long takes that sweep across sets as they follow the actors' movements.The CG, too, is more effective. In the first two films, special effects feel less cinematic and, in certain instances, downright unconvincing. Here, the magical world is brought to life with incredible realism. A spectacular flying scene with a Hippogriff and a close encounter with a werewolf are two memorable stand-outs.Unfortunately, I can't recommend you just watch this film in the franchise. Each is built specifically with the intent of being seen as part of a whole. However, I can say this is the most effective, most entertaining, and most visually engaging film in the series. It's certainly the one I look back to with the most fondness.If you're not a fan of the Harry Potter films in general, this won't dissuade your opinion, but I'd say this is the film that really shows why the series became such a phenomenon. It's dark, yet has elements of escapist fantasy, it's entertaining, yet has a human centre, and, most of all, it doesn't patronise its audience. That's what I consider key to the success of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Improvement on the first two movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies?.I liked the first two films but I thought that this was an improvement and acted and directed with much great assurance than its predecessors. The addition of Gary Oldman and David Thewlis to the cast gave the film greater gravitas. I also liked the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Bear in mind that I haven't read the books so I'm not obsessed about everyone being portrayed as they were in the books. Richard Harris was great and it's a tragedy he died when he did but Gambon makes a more convincing head in my eyes.The look of this film certainly lifts it above the previous two. Watching all the films literally one per day over a week, the changes to the geography of Hogwart's and the School itself was very obvious but I liked the new version. The creatures and the Dementors were realised very effectively.On the downside there is yet another boring Quidditch sequence but at least the dementors livened it up. It is also clear in the latter part of the film that the title should have been "Harry Potter goes Back to the Future" but the reworking was well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ah, the third installment of the harry potter saga. it's probably the prettiest and atmospherically the most magical of all harry potter movies, however! oh, there's a big "however", and the only way I can describe it aptly is - well, it's stuttering! let me explain this - if one has read the book, one might be surprised at the mix-up of many a detail - chronologically, situationally, character-development wise. this film is bold enough to not be afraid of a change here and there. what was borderline hate in the book has turned into a very early blossom of romance in the movie. what took a few good chapters in the book only takes a single clever scene in the movie! brilliant! but with this brilliance there's also darkness - the film has distanced itself from the book enough to make the viewer think it has all it takes to have a proper structure and meaning, it makes the viewer think that the movie can stand on its own legs! alas, it can not. by distancing itself from the book with so many changes it hasn't been able to build up its own foundation. important scenes from the book have been cut short or out entirely to anger of the devoted fan of the book, yet the scenes almost unique to the movie do little to fit in with the whole story, at best. at worst, they make, well, no sense.and all together this creates a problem of pacing - some scenes rush by in mere seconds, while others surprise you with their lack of sense, leaving you dumbfounded as to what they mean in the context of the whole movie.it doesn't help that the acting's really weird in this one. it's almost campy at its most dramatic, yet it's also a bit more interesting than the previous hp movies considering the lead actors are a bit older in this one.still, I feel great sadness. a magical movie, but deeply flawed for me - no longer being true to the book, yet not being too well on its own. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite Harry Potter film. It is the only one in the series that shows the magic of the HP universe while presenting a film mature enough for adults but fun enough for children. Where this film completely beats the others though, is the pacing. Excluding the Shrieking Shack scene, the film never seems rushed. And unlike the films following this one, at no point does a non-fan sit and wonder whats going on. The directors and writers of later HP films trip fail to explain simple plots, but PoA does it with little fuss. Little scenes relevant to the main story appear in between classes, so that the plot keeps moving, something that a film like the Order of the Phoenix, failed at completely. The director in this does very well. The awkwardness present in some scenes in other HP movies is not present here. Scenes are shot through nice camera angles, and the director takes full advantage of the brilliant setting by showing quite a few long shots of the castle. The audio is quite great as well.The acting is an improvement over the last two films, but not great. The only other complain I have is the rushed climactic scene where the trio meet the antagonist. They do a poor job of explaining the twist in the story. One does wonder why the producers spent so much time on classes and then rushed the main part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When viewing 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', you really begin to see how much more mature the young casting members have become when you cast your mind back to 2001 when they made their Potter debut's, in the 'Philosopher's Stone'. As a member of this current generation, I can soundly say it was a privilege to have grown up with this consistently thrilling and entertaining series of movies - originating from the stimulus of author J.K Rowling.Anyway - enough off the topic - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is now in his third year at Hogwarts. After reaching the end of his tether with the dreaded Dursley's, the teenage wizard flees the nest and soon realises he needs to watch his guard. This due to the fact Azkaban convict Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) - the murderer of Harry's parents - has escaped and is on the prowl for Harry. Also, the Dementors - new guards at Hogwarts - have a withdrawal effect towards Harry as he struggles to cope with all of his personal life, despite support from friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).An enforced casting change from the 'Chamber of Secrets' was required following the untimely death of acting great Richard Harris. However, filling his boots solidly was the more eccentric Michael Gambon. Although he's no Harris, Gambon's interpretations of the old wizard are easy to adapt to.Again, the dark ambiance/atmosphere is increased as Potter finally becomes more than just a children's wizarding fantasy - it becomes more appealing to older generations. Seriously though, if you thought 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was too dark for your child, they certainly shouldn't view the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' as certain areas of the film can send a brief shiver down the spine of even the oldest of civilians. In brief, this is the best of the first three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat entertaining at it's best but mostly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start by voicing my initial disappointment when I first saw the film in the movie theater in 2004. I was so disappointed I've avoided watching it again until recently. I had hoped I'd like it better the second time but sadly I did not.Had I not cared about the books I would have probably enjoyed the movie more than I actually did and here are my reasons: I did not understand the pressing need the director seemingly felt to twist every little scene in the book. From small unimportant details like Harry's ride on Buckbeak to the importance of Crookshanks being left out (and the Whooping Willow going from whipping it's branches madly to quietness without any explanation). Not one scene followed the book with precision.Scenes were made up specifically for the movie: The part when Hermione throws a stone at Harry's head while hidden outside of Hagrid's hut. Ron being fully awake when Harry and Hermione use the time-turner. Harry casting a spell under his sheets (Lumos Maxima) which contradicts the rule that underage wizards are forbidden to do magic outside of school - a detail that should have been explained in more detail as it becomes important in later books (although the scene was amusing as most scenes with Uncle Vernon are). Sirius' soul levitating out of his mouth during the Dementor scene.And what's with the talking heads hanging in the Knight Bus?! They are not funny, they do not bring anything to the film, they are NOT in the books! They do not even fit the scene!Harry receiving the Firebolt at Christmas was cut out and so was the fight that the happening originated. The crackling tension between Ron and Hermione over their pets and the subsequent fight ditto. The relationship between Lupin and Sirius was badly explained and his knowing about the Map of Marauders was not explained at all. The (very important) mention of who were really Padfoot, Mooney, Wormtail and Prongs was not made even though it plays an important role when it comes to understanding who these men that Harry barely knows once where.I found Hogwarts' change of scenery disappointing as the grounds were not recognizable and seeing that this movie is a follow up of two previous ones, it was completely unnecessary. The fact that students mostly walk around in regular clothing was a bit disappointing as well.In conclusion, lots of important scenes were left out or replaced by happenings that were seemingly made up by the director himself, distancing the movie from the original story.Not all was bad about it however: the background music was lovely even though it lacked some magic; the first scenes were okay and the first appearance of a Dementor was as creepy as I imagined it to be. The scenes are breathtaking, Buckbeak was beautifully made as was the scene in which Harry flies on him (even though it was completely unnecessary for the plot and honestly a waste of movie space), the Boggart scene was amusing. I'm positive I would have enjoyed the movie hadn't I been so utterly miffed over it's deviation from the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time and Perception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing and beautiful. The Time subject is the main concern on the movie and that is pleasant. Big plans of the clocks working, the way they have to change their path going back, shown in a decent way. The difference between reality and perception, how harry gets to do things believing in something that it's not the truth, but it's what makes him deal with his problems. Of course it's not perfect, i think the Shapeless monster scene, where harry tries make his spell it's not really credible in some parts. And the one where Hermione grabs him while bouncing on the tree. Nhaaac, not really the best way to show it. But still these scenes are smashed by the beautiful concept of the castle and the greatness it inspires. Buckbeak it's amazing too. Never blinked to think it was CGI or how it was made, but still i was finding the story much lovely to worry about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This addition to the franchise is quite a bit better then the last two. The other two were pretty boring and childish and this one is somewhat more exciting. This is where the acting starts to get better to which is enjoyable.This movie follows Harry Potter as he goes back to Hogwarts and guess what once again he is in danger and hogwarts is in parrell. A serial killer has escaped azkaban a magic prison for the worst of the worst of criminals. This so called serial killer searches for harry potter with some unlikely news.This was the best of the three movies so far but they left even more out of this one. They need like a three and half hour runtime to make a decent movie with this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now how does the time travel in this film work?!!!! It doesn't make sense what so ever when the time travel is introduced and even before it is. when harry is in Hagrids hut before Buckbeak is executed he clearly gets hit on the head with a pumpkin stone and another stone smashes a jar in the hut and when harry turns around no-body is there. But when Harry and Hermione go back into the past it is Hermione that throws the stone at harry to warn him the executioner is coming this leads to a very confusing story line of how originally hit harry with the stone because this would mean they had already went back in the past which would have meant again they had went back in the past before that and also when Ron is in the hospital wing and harry and Hermione come back after saving Serius black and Buckbeak we see an other Hermione and harry leaving to go back in time which would mean it would happen all over again which is very confusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Harry Potter Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry, Ron and Hermione, now teenagers, return for their third year at Hogwarts, where they are forced to face escaped prisoner, Sirius Black, who poses a great threat to Harry. This movie features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. This fantasy film directed by Alfonso Cuarón is based on the novel of the same title by J. K. Rowling. It is the third installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and produced by Chris Columbus, David Heyman and Mark Radcliffe. The story follows Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and wants to murder him. It is somewhat of a departure from its predecessors, and particularly beloved among fans for its surprise ending. Prisoner of Azkaban also marks the introduction of Sirius Black,portrayed by Gary Oldman who has escaped from the title prison after 12 years of incarceration.Believed to have been the right-hand-man of the dark wizard Voldemort, whom Harry mysteriously rendered powerless during his infancy, some of those closest to Harry suspect Black has returned to exact revenge on the boy who defeated his master. Upon his return to school, however, Harry is relatively unconcerned with Black. Run by Albus Dumbledore who is widely regarded as the most powerful wizard of the age as Hogwarts is renowned for its safety. Harry's nonchalance eventually turns to blind rage after accidentally learning the first of Black's many secrets during a field trip to a neighboring village. Of course, a loose serial killer is only one of the problems plaguing the bespectacled wizard's third year back at school such as the soul-sucking guards of Azkaban prison have been employed at Hogwarts to protect the students, but their mere presence sends Harry into crippling fainting spells. With the help of his friends Ron and Hermione, and Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin, Harry struggles to thwart the Dementors, find Sirius Black, and uncover the mysteries of the night that left him orphaned.Some movie-loving wizards must have cast a magic spell on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, because it's another grand slam for the Harry Potter franchise.Under the assured direction of Alfonso Cuaron, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban triumphantly strikes a delicate balance between technical wizardry and complex storytelling. Demonstrating remarkable versatility after the art-house success of Y Tu Mamá También, Cuarón proves a perfect choice to guide Harry and his friends into treacherous puberty as the now 13-year-old students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry face a new and daunting challenge: Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison, and for reasons yet unknown, he's after Harry in a bid for revenge. This dark and dangerous mystery drives the action.The familiar Hogwarts staff returns in fine form and even Julie Christie joins this prestigious production for a brief but welcome cameo. Technically dazzling, fast-paced, and chock-full of Rowling's boundless imagination, The Prisoner of Azkaban is a Harry Potter-movie classic that deserves the highest rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different from the first two...but in a good way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who have seen the third harry potter film will be surprised by the sudden change of tone and direction taken to create a dark and mysterious film unlike a happy family related movie. The first time i seen it i really didn't like it because of that but as the other harry potter films were released, they all sucked. So in retrospect this makes the third much better. I am not saying i like it because the others sucked but the more you watch it and compare, you will like it. As a 10 year old kid, i was hyped with harry potter, having read all the books, owning a lot of merchandise and knowing all bout the classic books. I was mad into it. I needed something to get into after the end of the lord of the rings (with one more star wars and more hp, things started looking great for me as a kid).Everybody knows the movie, its simple but adding in the different conflicts between characters, increases drama and tension in the movie, hence the different direction for harry potter. The music is still by john Williams who i really like the medieval themed music to create a spooky atmopshere. The characters all have changed as well but the big change has to be dumbledore played by Micheal gambon. The dumbledore in the first two films was played by the late Richard Harris who did a magnificent job in playing the beloved dumbledore. I know gambon In;t as good but he is still great and i hate it when people give him a lot of slick for him. He does give a great performance and I'm sure Richard is proud of him.The book is not as different from the movies, especially as the later films take not much from the books. The third book is the second best to read and the film is the 3rd best. A great movie that should be marked still as a classic and the first film i was introduced to the famous Gary oldman. What a performance as Sirius black! 9/10. Brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful--absolutely breathtaking adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I might be the only one who thinks this, but in all honesty I think this is one of the best directed movies of all time. Alfonso Cuarón changed the Harry Potter series forever with his stunning, mature, and rather dark vision of Prisoner of Azkaban. Some of his shots are beautiful, especially when he zooms in and out through the clock tower when the go back in time. He is and extremely creative director and although he only did one Harry Potter movie, he has forever left his mark on the series. The acting from the young trio is also much improved--they seem more comfortable as students in their magical world, and definitely more comfortable as friends. They are growing up and dealing with many new issues and emotions, such as stress, despair, and anger, but also friendship and love. It is really amazing to just watch the entire young cast interact with each other in such a realistic way.The supporting cast is also great, especially the new additions of David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, who tries to be kind and helpful despite his inner torment, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, who, as usual, was flawless in his insane interpretation. Something must also be said for Michael Gamban, who replaced the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and seems to have added a level of seriousness and maturity that goes along with the kids' growing up. Everyone else does a fine job too, but some more that stood out were Robbie Coltrane, Timothy Spall, and Fiona Shaw.However, I cannot say enough about the new vision this gives to the Harry Potter series. Even the landscape has changed to one that's much more wild and untamed, and the use of lighting made the entire film more grey. The costumes, too, are less childish, as the actors in a way got to dress themselves, and it definitely shows. This movie is really fantastic--there's just something about the story that gets to you. It's so imaginative, and really in the end the only enemy is fear itself. Nothing is necessarily defeated, just overcome, yet it is all the satisfying because of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not excellent, but a compelling follow-up to Sorcerer's Stone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sorcerer's Stone wasn't a masterpiece, but was at least a compelling start and while not as great as the first, The Chamber of Secrets was at least decent and entertaining at the same time. So, when Chris Columbus got replaced by Alfonso Cauron (A Little Princess) to direct the third one, I was a bit worried, but wouldn't you know it, he did a great job on this one and I think it's a compelling follow-up to Sorcerer's Stone.The only problem that I do have with the movie is that, like the previous two films, it left out some unnecessary events from the book.With the flaw aside, everything else turned out great. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson once again did great with their performances as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and the two new actors, including Michael Gambon, who replaced Richard Harris after his death in 2002 before The Chamber of Secrets was released, with his serious and less whimsical take on Professor Dumbledore, and Gary Oldman for his amazing take on Sirius Black, who had something to do with the lifetime of Harry and the death of his parents caused by Lord Voldemort himself.It also has some great moments along with some darker ones, including the scene where Harry flies the Griffin from the forest and where Harry saves Sirius Black from the Dementors by shouting "EXPECTO PATRONUM!". It also has some nice visuals including the new version of Hogwarts, some great CGI special effects, some spectacular and intense action sequences, and John Williams' beautiful music score.Overall, not excellent, but a great follow-up to the Sorcerer's Stone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, I'm quite impressed by the quality of the reviews for this film from fans who follow both the books and the movies in the Harry Potter franchise. To say that they've invested a significant amount of time into their hobby would be an understatement. I don't bring that same intensity to my viewing of the Potter films, for me it's a Saturday evening family entertainment, and the franchise has served well so far. This one had an interesting balance of humor and a more serious dark side, and youngsters might actually wind up with a nightmare or two after watching 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. I remember as a kid being scared of a tree in the middle of a meadow that someone told me would make a grab if you got too close, so I made it a point not to get too close.I also like the whimsical play with words used to describe various components of the story, like the Monster Book of Monsters, and the Accidental Magic Reversal Department. They're introduced into the story with no fanfare, simply as a matter of fact, a part of life for anyone attending the Hogwarts School. Those dementors though, pretty creepy apparitions if I have to say so myself.The first two Harry Potter movies are the only ones I ever saw when they were first released, so I'm behind the curve here as far as most viewers go. That turns out to be a benefit however, as I can watch the series in order at my own pace and not have to wait a long time for the next installment. It's interesting to watch Harry, Hermione, Ron and the rest of the students grow up and into their roles, and consider it a pretty remarkable achievement for J.K. Rowling to have invented this creative ongoing story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Installment of Harry Potter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the third Harry Potter film and things are changing. Alfonso Cuarón has taken over directing, and as the characters get more mature, so too do the themes.It's summertime at the Dursleys again, and things only get harder for Harry when Uncle Vernon's dreadful sister Marge comes to visit. Harry is unable to control his emotions when she insults his parents, flies into a rage, and accidentally causes her to blow up like a balloon and float away. Still furious, Harry storms out and catches a ride on the night bus to the Leaky Cauldron. While on the bus he hears the latest wizarding news?mass murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison. Harry is even more alarmed when Ron's father tells him that Sirius Black was one of Voldemort's followers, and that he likely escaped to find and kill Harry. The whole if the wizarding world is on the lookout with dementors, the guards of Azkaban looking for Sirius and guarding Hogwarts. The dementors are dark, hooded creatures who drain all happiness from their victims. Harry learns first-hand how horrible they can be when one attacks him on the train to school; but luckily he is rescued by the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin (David Thewlis). Professor Lupin proves to be the best teacher they have had in this subject, and even gives Harry private lessons to defend himself against dementors. Harry, Ron and Hermione try to go to their lessons, Quidditch, and on outings to Hogsmeade village as normally as possible with the constant search for Black going on. They manage well enough until it's rumored that Sirius Black has infiltrated Hogwarts, and the heroic trio go on their own personal mission to find him and discover what he really wants.This film is where the Harry Potter movies start to feel less like children's movies, and more like young adult movies. The tone and emotions are darker, the theme is more serious, and even the colors/lighting are darker. Cuarón did a good job on this film. Hogsmeade looks great, and the special effects with the hypogriff and patronus are really good. The only thing I don't really like about this movie is the wardrobe. In the first two films the students were almost always seen in wizard robes, but in this the students are always in normal "muggle" clothing during their free time. I feel that seeing a witch and wizard in a sweater, jeans and sneakers takes a bit of the magic away. Some of the more "traditional" wizard wardrobe has also changed, and looks more adult than in Columbus' designs. However, that probably is one of the only criticisms I have for this film. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have definitely learned to act better, and they have become Ron and Hermione, as Radcliffe has become Harry. Puberty is definitely setting in as the emotions for the characters (Harry especially) get more uncontrollable, and they seek more independence as well. Unlike the first or second film, we really get to see how emotionally damaged and traumatized Harry has been by witnessing his parents' death, and suffering a life of abuse and neglect. Some sexual/romantic tensions are also being strongly established between Ron and Hermione. Not to mention, this is the first film with Michael Gambon playing Dumbledore. Richard Harris was a hard act to follow, but Gambon has done a decent job. However, he is a very different Dumbledore?harsher, more serious, less whimsical. But the tone of this film being darker made the change (in both personality and actor) flow well. Gary Oldman and David Thewlis give good performances as well, with their characters filling in a good deal of information on the personal life of Harry's parents. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a great film with one thing for certain, our boy Harry is growing up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, as soon as we left the Yate's movies, the Potter movies are rather good. Newell brought a touch of humor and levity while Cuaron has a really naturalistic feeling. If I had understood, it's the one who had been shot the most outside in the Scottish country and it's clear: the cinematography are extraordinary, much, much better than the dark Yate's movies. Next, if the movie is as calm and dull as the book (it's about an invisible threat without attacks contrary to the previous one), Cuaron took the opportunity to put Hogwarts and its grounds on the stage. We have never seen the school like this and the passing of seasons was depicted with poetry. In fact, as the only story Voldemort- less, the characters make a step behind and in this void, Cuaron was a best choice to shoot this stillness. For me, it was almost a lynchian movie because it was deeply rooted in nature and grabbed a lot of abstract or symbolic shots. I didn't count them but the ring, the circle is a motive repeated a lot here. Next, Williams succeeds an amazing task to double the great themes of Potter's score: after the Hedwig's one, the new one with the flute is excellent. At last, to explain my title, the climax of the story is as exciting than one its predecessor: with movies traveling into time, it's always great to see the characters watching themselves. On the extras disc, you got the best interviews session of the cast with a very supportive host. Thus, if all the ingredients were there for this great potion, the mystery is why they throw it away? NB: beyond the Hyppogryph poop, other funnies details: can anybody explain me why Pettigrew can have his clothes when turning into a human and lost them when he comes a rat?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I love the new direction. The style fits the movie perfectly. I also think the kids acted much better in this one. I really hope they don't get rid of Daniel Radcliff, even if he does get too broad in the shoulders. You can't swap horses mid-stream. Also, did anyone recognize the kid who played Neville at first? The biggest problem that I had was that there were a lot of things the movie didn't explain, such as "Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs." I think that it may have been hard for those who hadn't read the book to understand. It also didn't show that Harry's Patronus was a stag, which I thought was important. And Harry's eyes aren't green (which is mentioned at least once in each book), but that's a minor thing. I felt that the style fits the book well. I go back and read the first book and think "Wow, how young they all are, how naive." The books age, and I think that comes out in this movie. I hope they continue to follow the same path.All in all, I loved the new direction and the movie itself. I can't wait 'till the next one comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isn't really faithful to the book compared to the previous movies, but it's fast paced and keeps your attention for the most part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame some aspect of the movie is missing this time around, at least a lot compared to the previous two movies. Although this movie is missing some scenes I wanted to see from the novel, but I liked the fast pacing of this movie at the same time. But being more faithful to the novel while being fast paced would have been nice. Another thing that bothered me about this movie is the fact that the original actor that played Albus Dumbledore is replaced because of the unfortunate passing away of Richard Harris. The new Dumbledore lacks a lot of aspects that Richard Harris showed while playing the head Wizard of Hogwarts. The new guy simply didn't have the soft and yet someone you should never cross thing going for him, nor did he have that certain look in his eyes that showed wisdom. Yes, for some movies that is based on a book that doesn't go EXACTLY like the book doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. But like I said those scenes would have made this movie much better in my opinion. Even if I didn't read the 3rd book in this franchise and saw this movie after watching the previous two movies. I would have thought something was missing in this movie regardless. I personally thought it could fit a lot of the parts in the book in this movie since this movie isn't close to the 3 hour mark. On a positive note though besides the fast pacing, is how this movie somewhat atones for the stuff that is missing from the book and makes it a bit more lively and actually has a bit of satire. Everything seemed slightly more sharp including the humor. Also addition of Gary Oldman is always a plus.6.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Harry Potter installment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We now come to Year #3 of the Harry Potter films. After inflating his uncle's sister's with his anger and unconscious magical powers after she insults him and his parents, Harry runs away from the Dursleys; he's also afraid he might get expelled from Hogwarts for using magic outside the school.Harry took the "Knight Bus" to the Leaky Cauldron pub/inn. There, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge tells Harry he will not be expelled; but he was a bit...miffed at Harry for running away, when a supposedly dangerous criminal named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban. Later on, Harry was also informed by Arthur Weasley that Black will likely come after him.Harry journeys to Hogwarts with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. On the train they share a compartment with the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, who is sleeping when they enter the compartment. Abruptly, the Hogwarts Express is stopped and a phantom creature called a Dementor boards, searching for Black. The creature has a profound effect on Harry, causing him to faint. Lupin awakens and repels the Dementor. At school, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore informs the Hogwarts students that because Black has escaped, Dementors have been set up around the school as a protection. In addition to Lupin's appointment, Hagrid is announced as the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. As lessons begin, Hermione frequently arrives at their various classes by appearing out of nowhere. Lupin's lessons prove enjoyable, as he teaches useful spells and helps less confident students like Neville Longbottom. However Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class does not go as planned, and on the first day, Draco Malfoy deliberately provokes the Hippogriff Buckbeak into attacking him. His father successfully has Buckbeak sentenced to death...those Malfoys really p*** me off!So that's all I could you - watch the film and see how it ends. I loved watching Hermione giving Malfoy a slug in the face. And I think Lupin has to be the funnest D.A.D.A teacher. Anyway, the Prisoner of Azkaban goes very well with the first two Harry Potter films - another great installment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have grown up with "Harry Potter" and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week.In the wizarding world, there is a criminal on the loose- Sirius Black. He has escaped from his imprisonment at Azkaban for the murder of Harry's parents and is looking for Harry. He is now at large and Dementors (soul-sucking guardians of Azkaban) are seen everywhere, searching for him.The plot may seem normally adequate, but I really think that this third installment was brilliant. This was a lot better than the first two movies. I loved the new characters who were introduced, especially Remus Lupin. I particularly liked the humor and sheer fun that this movie had. Yes, this movie was dark, but the touch of humor added here and there in dialogues, balanced the movie out.I remember when I first watched this movie, I thought that it was too long. I think it was because I was too young to actually understand what was happening. Now that I'm older, I can see why this film is a definite favorite amongst fans. "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" really is magical. You can see it everywhere. There were so many things that were happening in this movie. But surprisingly, it worked. I never got the feeling that events were too fast paced. The flow was great. I don't know how they did that!Viewed on: July 10, 2011</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic darkens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the two quite children friendly early Potter films the series takes a darker tone from this film onwards and this third year at Hogwarts is certainly one of the better ones.Stripping back a lot of the cosy nature of the first two Potter films the director creates a mean and moody Hogwarts where danger lurks around every corner.The fantastic mostly British acting cast returns with Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon being the two main additions while the young trio of Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe all give continued great performances as they mature before our very eyes.This film combines all the darkness and heart of the original source material and this film remains one of my personal favourites out of all the Harry Potter films to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually has improved, story is starting to get better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie was okay, it helped to set the scene. The second movie was okay as well, although it was pretty much just a small change in plot.This third movie has really added many changes. Not only are the visual effects a lot more improved, the story is more interesting and easy for me to understand now. Plus those kids sure grew up fast! I was a bit confused near the end when all the explaining occurred, however I was still impressed by, despite the fact that it was based off a book, the way the plot continued. A new challenge for Potter, with more character growth. Of course, the ending wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but it was good enough.And that time travel scene was wonderfully done, despite the fact that time travel is a very difficult topic to discuss.Rated 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic movie-- best out of all of them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a Harry Potter fan since I started reading the books around 8 years ago. I've seen most of the movies, and this one is by far the best. New characters such as Sirius Black and Remus Lupin are added into the story, and they have important roles in this film.This is probably the most important movie out of all of them because it explains about the real reason behind the death of Harry's parents. It tells who was really responsible for it.I think that the actors have also improved since the first two films. I think that Daniel Radcliffe's acting has improved greatly, along with Rupert Grint's and Emma Watson's.To be honest, I enjoyed just about every second of this movie. It has the right amount of scariness, humor, and emotion. This movie was breathtaking and magical, and I'd recommend it to anyone. I give it 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Saga Grows with Its Character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like its two predecessors, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an out-of-this-world triumph in production design. But it's the first to depict not only the sensation of yearning propelling the characters at the heart of the world constructed by Stuart Craig, but a grasp of the way the supernatural lies beneath the ordinary, rather than merely frolicking whimsically at a frivolous remoteness from it. It's far less self-conscious about how to gratify an audience as immediately as possible and isn't as unquestioningly cooperative with the conventional modern family blockbuster mold. A new director with a diverse point of view can recoat and ventilate a series that could otherwise fall back on tired reiteration, which it previously seemed poised to do, and Alfonso Cuaron, a clever, unique and energetic filmmaker with a highly sensitive eye for quirky nuances, has done what few sequel custodians ever achieve or care to achieve, stimulating the characters and story arcs.His exceptionally lensed wizard cosmos is coarser and grittier than Chris Columbus's. It seems immediately more hazardous, more utterly captivating and more authentic. While the two first installments were set largely in the passageways and classrooms of Hogwarts, this one stays behind in the eerie forests and soggy pastures outside the school walls, a backdrop that accentuates Cuarón's flair for inducing the poignant, physical influence of natural environments. His work always having crossed all cultural and stylistic barriers, his was a name that was certain to electrify the spirits of critics more than the greater part of die-hard Harry Potter aficionados, who tend not to see many unrated, subtitled films or to be familiar with the names of many foreign filmmakers, were prone to react with a shrug.Harry, Weasley and Hermione drift on the threshold of teenage years, and whereas they seem nervier and more competent than before, the perils they confront appear far more serious and their own vulnerabilities deeper. At the start, in the compulsory Muggle-baiting scene, Harry's boiling resentment at his orphaned situation and his malicious adoptive keepers finally overpowers him. As the plot follows him---as opposed to normal, in which he's a piece of a clockwork plot---toward a battle with the man who allegedly slayed his parents, a fugitive convict played by the great broad-spectrum villain Gary Oldman, Harry's carefree civility is dimmed by sorrow, anger and moral bewilderment.If Rowling's success is in not allowing her child characters to languish but thoughtfully delving into their maturation in a way that only some, if any, children's literature have before, then the films' producers' is in electing Cuarón to take charge of the franchise's first physical and mental transitional stage. Not only is Harry getting bristly, but Weasley and Hermione are shedding their juvenile hides in surprising ways, and Cuarón stages everything about their lives in a minor register. The soundtrack buzzes with recognizable themes, only now heard in minimal arrangements on archaic instruments instead of the swanky orchestrations of the first two films. The pubs now look authentically aged and dilapidated. The Hogwarts castle now sits among a much less steady, much more jagged panorama. Colors are subdued. Cuaron's signature use of hand-held verite-style camera-work contributes a further closeness, occasionally a claustrophobia that's precisely truthful. Even the costumes echo the fidgety contradiction of character moods: The Harry's school uniform tie is at all times crooked.Sinister and visceral, this really is a grim fairy tale, in which Harry confronts bigger doubts and threats than before when he would play Culkin to Voldemort's many Pescis and Sterns. And I don't mean Sirius Black. What great madcap wizard doesn't seemingly target Harry? Before Harry even disembarks for his third year at Hogwarts, it's obvious that threats will come from within. Cuarón and recurring screenwriter Steve Kloves deal with antagonistic, temperamental adolescence like Stephen King: Harry's thick with anger, almost savoring too much the intoxicating occult capability he has. The literal flare-up of infuriated conjuring he directs at Uncle Vernon's thoroughly deserving sister evokes Carrie at the prom. The first scene, right from the start: What happened to our kind, wholesome little Harry?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Could Be Anywhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts; not only does he have a new "Defense Against the Dark Arts" teacher, but there is also trouble brewing. Convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizards' Prison and is coming after Harry. Of the first three Harry Potter films, this is by far my favorite. The atmosphere shifts to a darker place, which may be partly due to the story and partly due to the new director. Besides the darker images, I like the characters introduced here -- Professor Lupin, the best Defense Against the Dark Arts professor thus far, and Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who is my favorite character in the entire series. We also have the Hippogriff, which is a fantastic creature, and Doby the house elf. And a time travel element that plays out just as effectively -- and with more sense -- than "Timecrimes".Harry Potter purists may have some complaints here. Hermione now has normal girl hair rather than the wild, frizzy hair, making her less of an outcast that she may be supposed to be. And they spend very, very little time in their school uniforms. Of course, they are more often outside of the school grounds, so that explains itself. I was curious why Ginny never appears even once. Perhaps she does not appear in the book, but at this point she should be becoming a more important character.There is a line in the film that really stands out: "Black could be anywhere." I do not wish to dwell on this, but I cannot help but wonder if this is some sort of inside joke...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Sirius Black in fact was a friend of the Potters and did NOT betray them to Voldemort, why did he want to kill Harry? The scene where they all meet in the Shrieking Shack is so confusing: First we see Sirius about to kill Harry, but as soon as he and Lupin explain that Pettigrew is the real culprit, Sirius doesn't want to kill Harry anymore. Did anyone else have a problem with this? The same question must be asked about the book. It would have made sense if everyone THOUGHT Sirius had betrayed the Potters, which they did, but then when we meet Sirius, he explains that it was Pettigrew who was to blame and that he never wanted to kill Harry, that it just a rumor. All this said, I loved the film and all the others, too!</fullReview>

She just told me what she knew from the books and tried to get me to actually read some) and then finally watching it myself made me start reading the Harry Potter books. The film is brilliant! It couldn't be any more true to the book if you ask me. Awesome acting, soundtrack and I think Harry looks cutest in this film. However I won't vote on it yet as I think it deserves a re-watching soon (every time I re-discover this stuff it's just as good as the first time, I have to watch it again when I get the time).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Harry Potter Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT** First I would like to apologize for my bad English and possible misspelling. Anyway ... As so many people before me I have read all the books of the Harry Potter Franchise. This particular movie captures almost everything that is essential to the story. I must say that even though late Richard Harris was an outstanding actor (Gladiator, The Count of Monte Cristo ...) I still feel that Michael Gambon is better as Dumbledore. I certainly like the new outfit - Dubledore seems much more elegant. You can notice that Hogwarts is also changed and looks much less fairy tale-like. It is logical that it's practically impossible to capture all the book scenes in one movie. What bothers me most was the scene in the Shrieking shack. It's quite different from the one in the book and I just can't understand why. I think it would be much better if Lupin returned the wands to three young wizards after disarming them and after that Sirius and him would start to explain the real story. Those may be details but in my opinion important ones. Bottom line - this movie is great and certainly worth watching. One of the best Harry Potter movies. I give it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slight improvement over the second.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this one better than the second one. I don't know what it was, but something about this movies tone and mood, as well as the way it was crafted together gave me a better feeling for it. Now directed by a new director, a lot of things have changed, including the cinematography, the visuals, the plots, and altogether the directing. This one is more adventurous, more loose, more fitting with the book, and a lot more progressing.Harry's third year consists of a serial killer whose escaped from Azkaban named Sirius Black, (Gary Oldman) trying to find and kill him. This causes Harry to be extra cautious this year, trying to avoid both him, and the dreadful dementors of Azkaban trying to find Sirius as well. Like I said, progresses the series quite well. The first two were very similar together, with similar looks, settings, and costumes. This one goes a little less decorative, but still exciting.The music score is still by John Williams, which will never die. The plot holes are a lot more clean, and the suspense is 10x bigger. Its also a lot more emotional, talking a lot about Harry's parents, as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Lupin, was a good friend of James and Lily Potter.Doesn't refer to the other as much, but maybe thats a good thing, to focus more on the main plot. Also has really cool new material in it, introducing us to new and magical things that you wish you could do.Still could have a little bit more to it. Still doesn't compete with the original one, but still one of the top ones of the series.</fullReview>

The final though is great, and full of good action.I had a problem with some weird scenes and conversations that simply did not make sense. I also found that the movie lacked a bit of atmosphere compared with some of the other parts. Also, I have been a bit disappointed that Voldemort has not been part of this movie. The big story around Harry Potter did barely move forward in this part. Beside that, the movie was less funny, and less witty than the 2nd part. Yet, this movie was atmospheric, beautiful and full of creative great ideas. I liked the map, and how the story was connected to the map, the most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great addition to the franchise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly i have too say that Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book of all of them (I haven't read the first) in the Harry Potter series and I am very pleased how they put this story on screen. First and naturally right decision was too replace Chris Columbus because we are getting into a darker times in the series. The Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón chances the whole atmosphere that Columbus had created, he goes deeper into the mysterious world and creates this wonderfully fresh and magical style that fits the movie 100%. He has also put a stop to most of the warmth and Sugary sweet attitude that the other two movies had, but that's only to show how much this story has matured. The characters have also grown up a lot and with that comes obviously new darker adventures then before.Prisoner of Azkaban was exactly one of the darkest (except for the final one) and the director is able to bring moments from the book so completely on screen that it gave me goosebumps but that is something you don't see often. Watch your kids because Dementors and werewolves are no teletubbies.The actors have also grown and Daniel Radcliff is again the man who grows the most from the second one but he has really grown as an actor since the first one. He could have practiced his crying a little bit better because his crying scene seemed a little forced. Emma Watson does her character ones again justice and brings to life the wonderful Hermione who has grown into a mature women. Rupert Grint keeps on getting better and better and his future looks quite promising. Michael Gambon takes the role of Dumbledore and does it very well but Richard Harris had made a wonderful character in Dumbledore, so entertaining and likable. Gambon gives his own style of the old headmaster and does it very well, he doesn't mimic Harris, he rather makes him his own. David Thewlis is also fantastic's Remus Lupin and Gary Oldman is also amazing in his role has Sirius Black, even though he has limited screen time.Everything involving the style was flawless -- but I am not going to drag this review for to long so I try to keep it short. From the technical side of it to the wonderful music from John Williams, it's all great and there is nothing really to complain about but all this is also getting darker and darker with every movie.There are some flaws I would like to talk about. My biggest complain is that there are a couple little holes that aren't filled from the book, like who made the map, how did Sirius escape and I wanted to see also them going more into Harry's past but unfortunately that happens when you are making a movie from a book, there will always be something that had too be left out.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban could easily stand on his own as a really entertaining and well made adventure-film that goes really fast through those 135 minutes; I mean it feels like an hour. Even for a couple of small flaws, this one is better then the other two (the other two are also really good by the way) and it seems every movie is better then it's predecessor.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After giving his rude, overweight aunt her just deserts, teenager Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) is off for another year at "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry" with fellow magic-makers Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger). You can be sure the trio won't be bored. First out of the gate is dastardly Gary Oldman (as Sirius Black), who was somehow involved in the murder of Mr. Radcliffe's parents. "The Prisoner of Azkaban" referred to in the title, Mr. Oldman looks out for blood. This puts everyone at "Hogwarts" in grave danger...A change in direction, literally, to director Alfonso Cuaron, helps gives this third "Harry Potter" film a moodier, darker style; and, it is the perfect accompaniment to the three leading players' rapidly approaching adulthood. Up until about the time the students unconvincingly mouth animal noises, everything runs smoothly. But, even when it's silly, or wanders away from the original text, the story is marvelous. The players are more endearing than ever, even Tom Felton (as Draco Malfoy). And, new "Defence Against the Dark Arts" professor David Thewlis (as Remus Lupin) is a howling success.******** Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (5/31/04) Alfonso Cuaron ~ Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, David Thewlis</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't be held prisoner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been watching the Harry Potter movies despite being the one person in society who hasn't read the books, and I've been enjoying them. The series got a new director for "The Prisoner of Azkaban," and that's immediately apparent not just from the name on the credits but from a noticeably different stylistic feel. As a consequence, the strengths and weaknesses of the third film are balanced a little differently from those of the first two. One of the most immediately arresting, memorable, and commendable things about "The Prisoner of Azkaban" is the extraordinarily imaginative and well-realized visual style, far outpacing the already-impressive first two films. It's packed with stunningly-created sights such as the aunt who is blown up like a balloon, talking shrunken heads, crooked offices, and rather haunting moving mugshots on the newspapers. I even loved little touches such as the addition of a uniform number and realistic-looking sports equipment to the quiddich game. I don't know how much of this stuff was described is prose form by J. K. Rowling and how much was created for this film, but I'm hugely impressed: I feel as if I could pause the film at any shot and spend fifteen minutes examining the background.I also appreciated Alonso Cuaron's approach to handling scenes. There was a little bit more down-to-Earth realism cutting through people's interactions in the magical world in the film, and I appreciated that. Again, little touches such as Harry Potter's reactions to his uncle's family's obnoxiousness, the very authentically middle-school was Draco Malfoy and friends circle round to gang up on the heroes, and little offhand indications of running jokes between characters that we now know have known each other for a while ("How is it she knows everything?") make a big difference. There is a strong strain of dark humor running through this particular film, casting special light on officialdom's obliviousness to the fact that Harry Potter might want to know there's a convicted murderer chasing him down, and I appreciate it. Character-wise, the leads are growing up enough to get some more satisfying development, and Harry Potter himself especially is becoming a very rounded character with a stubborn, anti-establishment streak that I enjoy. Due to a sad death among the cast Michael Gambon is called upon as a replacement -- he avoids imitation and is as excellent as ever.In many senses, then, I found this film superior -- but unfortunately the way its plot is handled felt a little unsatisfactory to me. After a certain point where a major twist occurs involving how we perceive one of the characters, a number of things start failing to make sense to me or to be explained. I think issues of what actually happened between Pettigrew, Black, Lupis, and Harry Potter's father are only hinted at here, with the expectation that fans already understand them. What's more, they are sprung upon us very quickly without much of a lead-in. In all I found this stylistically a joy and far ahead of it predecessors, which were no slouches, but the muddled plot line mitigates that somewhat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking the fantasy for granted, it's doubtless that these movies of Harry Potter's saga are indeed and above all, well made. The visual part (special effects, landscapes and the magic of Hogwarts castle interior's) is fascinating. And the stories reveal a limitless and rich imagination that enslaves you. The story of this particular movie is full of spectacular moments, some adventurous and hazardous while others are dazzling and some others humorous but all of them making sense, taking of course the fantasy for granted as we said above. Their rhythm is almost hallucinating. The majority of these wizards (the young ones and the adults) are intrinsically human creatures and behave humanely, displaying humane feelings of love, hate, fear, distaste, friendship and solidarity. The actors and actresses who play their roles, do it in a very efficient and beautiful manner. In short, a movie that in the end leaves you in a good mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first two 'Harry Potter' films took the world by storm and made the Fantasy genre hot again. Both showed us sights that we've only dreamed of before and promised more to come. Since there are seven books in the series, naturally they would all be adapted to film. By this one, the third, something changed. Christopher Columbus, the man who brought us childhood favorites like the first two 'Home Alone' films and 'Adventures in Babysitting,' would not be returning to the director's chair. He handed the reigns to 'A Little Princess' director Alfonso Cuaron and it ended up being a very smart decision. What we got was a different look and perspective, and it was successful. The first two films turned out amazing, but this third adventure is even better.Pros: As usual the cast does an excellent job. Fantastic score. Amazing effects, even better than in the first two. Perfectly paced. Plenty good humor to keep things from getting too dark. Strong, atmospheric direction by Cuaron, who has a better handle on this than Columbus did. Gorgeous photography and scenery. Impressive job on the production design. Suspenseful and full of surprises.Cons: The first two films have such a grand finale, it's a disappointment that this one doesn't.Final thoughts: The second is better than the first, which is already a fabulous film. So it was a pleasant surprise that the third was even better than the second. Christopher Columbus did a fine job on the first two, but it was time for a bit of change and it turned out to be a good idea. Let's just hope the series, near it's end, keeps up a high level of quality.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Java Man Reviews "Harry Potter &amp; the Prisoner of Azkaban" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com July, 2004.OVERVIEW Harry (Radcliffe) and his pals Hermione and Ron (Watson and Grint) are now in their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry when news arrives of the escape from prison of the notorious murderer Sirius Black (Oldman), who is after Harry. "Protecting" the students are the Dementors, sinister wraiths that can suck souls from the bodies of their victims. Harry acquires a marauder's map which has special powers that come in handy as the story progresses, especially when a werewolf begins to prowl the grounds. Hagrid (Coltrane) introduces the three friends to Buckbeak, a hippogriff (half bird, half horse), who may be a match for the nocturnal beast. Most of the Hogwarts faculty is back, with some new additions, including Professors Lupin (Thewlis) and Trelawney (Thompson).REVIEW: 3 1/2 Java Mugs out of 4 Harry Potter (Radcliffe) transforms an obnoxious dinner guest into a hot-air balloon. Hermione Granger (Watson) lands an uppercut to the jaw of the despicable Draco Malfoy (Felton). These aren't the well-behaved, precocious preteens of the first Harry Potter movie. They, along with their primary audience, are growing into teenagers -- and are not to be messed with.There's an edge to this movie, thanks to the brilliant direction of Cuaron, one of Mexico's bright young movie makers and director of one of the best films to cross the Rio Grande in recent years... Y Tu Mama Tambien.Though the story follows much of the formula of the first two episodes, sharp writing and directing elevate the material beyond author Rowling's rules of order. Especially effective are the tricks with time travel, which can be appreciated even more on a second viewing.Young performers Radcliffe and Grint continue their fine work, but the revelation this time is Watson's portrayal of the smart, assertive Hermione, a character who provides inspiration for young women in the audience and young actresses as well. There's been some talk of bringing on newer, younger child stars for future episodes, but I'd like to see these three actors take the characters into at least their late teens.As for the older players, there seems to be an endless supply of great British character actors who can be called upon to fill any vacancies among the Hogwarts staff. New for this outing is Gambon who capably fills the Dumbledorean robes of the late Richard Harris; Thompson as the hilariously nearsighted tea-leaf reading Sybill Trelawney; Thewlis as Professor Lupin, the Dark Arts Defense teacher with a suspicious surname; and Oldman as the dreaded Sirius Black who is in dogged pursuit of Harry.Shot in England and Scotland, the look of the film complements the mystical material very well, while the computer graphics, animation and the other cinematic "magic" add to an enjoyable experience for the entire family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the series so far...truly an 'atmospheric' film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the true coming of age story for both Harry and for the series in general, then Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the spiritual coming of age for the series; something which the film adaptation emphasizes subtly but brilliantly. The story itself is a departure from the previous two books; both Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were all Harry and his friends exploring all the wonders of the wizarding world, specifically Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. True, there WERE villains to fight and challenges to overcome and danger, but basically, for all intents and purposes, the first two books are very well-written and elaborate children's fantasy books. Prisoner of Azkaban is different; there is a constant atmosphere of depression, of darkness and evil lingering in the air. Harry is no longer a small innocent child opened up to a world of wonder; he is instead a young teenager filled with emotion, at one point prepared to kill a man he is convinced was responsible for his parents death. Such fantastic elements and trappings as a flying car, a three-headed dog or a giant chessboard are traded in for werewolves and Dementors, the latter personifying the atmosphere of evil and darkness lurking over Hogwarts and over Harry in particular. If the book is a departure from its predecessors, the film is doubly so, for it deviates from the two previous Potter films directed by Columbus both in plot as well as in overall direction (not surprising since we have a new director at the helm, Alfonso Curaro). There is a marked stylistic difference from the previous films-Hogwarts is no longer a wonderland of magic and fantasy, it is a dark ancient castle bubbling with mysterious and invisible forces, some of them evil...danger may well lurk in its every shadow! This transformation is not just something you see, you feel it, quite literally! Add on to this the fact that Harry is the prime target of an escaped convict believed to be a vicious mass murderer, and that he is dogged by omens of death (the Grimm) everywhere he goes, not to mention being particularly susceptible to the despair spread by the Dementors and you get the idea of the atmosphere that is being skillfully and subtly crafted here. And yet, as Dumbledore rightly says early on in the film, 'Happiness can be found even in the darkest of places'. For it is in this films that Harry first truly finds a mentor (he and Dumbledore have barely shared any screen time at this point); in Remus Lupin, his new Defence Against the Dark teacher, who teaches him to combat his despair both literally by teaching him a spell to repel the Dementors, and figuratively by offering him moral support throughout the film. One of the few shortcomings about this film was that a lot of the expository dialogs from the book were left out, presumably to maintain a fast pace, in stark contrast to the previous films which were almost word to word adaptations in most regards; while these omissions do not ordinarily detract from the story in any way, die-hard fans may find their absence disquieting The performances are spot on, as expected in any Potter film, though Lupin comes across as being more confident and assertive than in the book (a small liberty) and Draco Malfoy seems reduced almost to comic relief. But overall, my review is an appreciation of the film as a whole. This is definitely the best film in the series too date...it clearly surpasses its otherwise excellent predecessors, and none of its successors have succeeded in coming close to matching it; though Half-Blood Prince may well be the one that beats it when it releases later this week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually dazzling, but lacking in some areas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very pretty movie indeed. Cuaron's biggest mistake was sometimes overemphasizing the wackiness. One of the most charming things about Rowling's writing is that she works so hard to immerse you in the world of magic, a lot of very odd things happen but they just sort of happen. Cuaron spends an inordinate amount of time on quirks (see talking heads among other things), time which could have been invested in better storytelling. Aesthetically aside from that complaint "Prisoner of Azkaban" is the most satisfying of the Potter films, as Cuaron does manage to pull off what he's clearly going for and wow the audience with great visuals. While this is a huge step up from the plainly weak Columbus films, Cuaron's sensibility doesn't really sync perfectly with Steve Kloves' screenplay which as per usual is alright but really saves very little room for character development and develops less of the mature confidence Rowling gained in writing "Prisoner of Azkaban", a clearly superior effort to the first two installments, instead it's really just more of the same. It seems like Kloves sat down, flipped through the book, picked out the 'most important bits', and converted them to screenplay format. It just whizzes through the story points and doesn't earn its Big Emotional Moments. Also difficult to know exactly how much of this rests on Kloves' shoulders and how much on Cuaron's, after all storytelling is the ultimate responsibility of the director, is it not? The film does grow stronger as it progresses, and the final 40-50 minutes is truly excellent, but the movie as a whole is more flawed than some will let on, although it's easy to see what impresses about it. The score is Williams at his cutesiest too, which is never good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Potter" is sharper, smarter with new director Cuaron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producer Chris Columbus, who directed the first two films made of the Harry Potter series of fantasy books by J.K. Rowling, couldn't have made a better choice than stepping away from the camera and giving the reigns to a seasoned director with a fresh perspective. It's what makes "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" go from merely good to great.Director Alfonso Cuaron, who brings his fantasy experience from the mid-'90s film "A Little Princess," adds a layer of complexity, maturity and beauty to the Harry Potter universe that had been just a bit too fantastical and gimmicky under Columbus' direction. Though the second does this better than the first, the third completely outdoes both.In this chapter, Harry (Radcliffe) heads for Hogwarts with the knowledge that an infamous Dark wizard named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizard prison of Azkaban and is out to find Harry and kill him. Along the way Harry must learn to overcome his fear of the Azkaban prison guards out searching Hogwarts for Black -- ghastly creatures called Dementors -- during which he learns a bit about his parents. New to the cast include David Thewlis as new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and ally of Harry's, Remus Lupin, a nearly unrecognizable Emma Thompson as Divination teacher Professor Trelawney and Michael Gambon as the new Albus Dumbledore after the sad passing of Richard Harris. All are great, even Gambon, who adds a youthful vigor to Dumbledore despite the true magic that Harris brought to the role.A lot has also changed visually in "Azkaban." There seems to be more of a sense of realism to the characters despite the fantasy world around them. Cuaron has the main trio of Harry, Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) in modern dress most of the film (whenever they're not in classes) and this really helps make them seem more like the teenagers they are. It makes us identify with them more. Even when they are in robes/proper dress, they do what Catholic school kids with uniforms would: loosen the ties, unbutton a couple buttons -- Cuaron's image is not as neat and tidy of a fantasy world. This is more of a young adults adventure story, not a children's fantasy. Then again, the books are heading in this direction and it's only appropriate.The sets are even more beautiful and Cuaron's attention to the seasons changing helps emphasize his themes of time while grounding the narrative of the film. Steve Kloves, adapter of the first two books, has clearly by now honed his craft. He has much better ways of working in the information of the book visually than through dialogue. Cuaron's vision makes that seem all the more apparent. What you see in "Azkaban" just has so much more weight to it. There aren't nearly as many visual effects or interesting nature sequences that are just there to be pretty. All of it has a purpose with the exception of Harry flying around on Buckbeak the hippogriff for a few minutes, and even that lets John Williams take his great score to the next level."Azkaban" is easily the best Potter film to date and it's one of the shortest, so that gives you a sense of how much more improved the entire process was this time around. This film really lives up to the book more than any other in entertainment and maturity. It's a shame Cuaron didn't stick around for another go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and exhilarating! One of the best fantasy films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is without a doubt one of the best fantasy films ever made. Yes, it is a Harry Potter film, but the first two look like TV films compared to this. The special effects are amazing, much better, the cinematography is beautiful, the direction much more confident and focused. Alfonso Cuaron was the best thing that ever happened to this series, and I miss him. Technically, it is one of the best achievements of the decade. The acting, for the most part, is brilliant. Wonderful performances from the adult cast, and most of the child actors. Daniel Radcliffe is weak at times, but he gets better as the series goes along. The writing is superb as well. Nothing but praise for this film, and I think it is a shame that some people think of Harry Potter as some fanboy film series, where it really is something magical (well, besides the first two). I really need to rewatch Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix to see where they stand, but one thing is certain. Alfonso Cuaron's direction was the best this series ever had, and this film is the most beautiful and visually stunning of the Potter films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Harry Potter Movie so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best of the Harry Potter movies. The critically acclaimed director Alfonso Cuaron brings his own unique vision to J.K. Rowling's wonderful story. He adds nice touches like the showing the Whomping Willow snagging passing birds. This movie can stand apart from the books and other movies as a good movie in its own right. It has poignant moments between Harry and his friends and with Professor Lupin, scary moments, and of course lots of adventure. The only complaint that I have that the movie does not explain why Harry thought the Patronus that saved him was from his dad. The book explains that his dad's Patronus is in the form of a stag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Harry Potter that laid the foundation for the rest of the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently got a chance to see Harry Potter and the prisoner of azkaban for a second time since I had seen it in the theaters almost four years ago. The one thing I can remember when I saw it in the cinema was that I very much disappointed when the credit's rolled. I'm quite certain that over time and the process of maturity my understanding of movies grew and now four years later I have a much much much better and appreciation and understanding for this particular film and why it was done the way it was done. Why Alfonso Cuaron is brilliant is because he showed us you could take a popular kids franchise such as Harry Potter and turn it into a franchise that is a just as popular for adults. I also admire the way Alfonso approached this film as if he was not doing just another movie to fit in with the rest of the series but to approach this film as if he was creating his own personal work of art with his own personal style. All in all Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban is fantastic movie with plenty of laughs and thrills. Don't watch this movie expecting to find the same Chris Columbus feel that has now diminished. I am writing this review just over a month before the the sixth harry potter film is released and so far I can definitely say that this adult mood Alfonso created in this movie has continued into the next two and will stay until the end of the series I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Potter films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban' is a nice follow-up to the previous movie. The special effects are dazzling to look at. Cuaron wonderfully creates a sense of magic and adventure. The magical world of the school is spectacular to look at. The movie moves at a sluggish pace in the beginning but eventually picks up. Cuaron reunites and newly casts a terrific ensemble where Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon and co reprise their roles, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis bring freshness and there are the hilarious cameos by Emma Thompson and Dawn French. Of the three protagonists, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are getting worse with their acting (even though I quite liked Hermione in this one). Rupert Grint remains more consistent with his character and he steals the show once again. Overall, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban' is still a nice family entertainer and it's quite sad how the next movie turned out to be so boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are one of those HP fans who list every departure from the books, don't watch this this film, it will only infuriate you and ruin the whole experience. You want the unchanged story? Read the book, it's excellent.However if you only want to be entertained for two hours and see a good fairytale/fantasy picture, this is the film for you. The story is the best yet for Harry Potter it's twisting and turning, yet it is not unfollowable (even my grandma understood the story). The new director is simply brilliant, he didn't want to copy&amp;paste the whole story into the silver screen, he just wanted a great movie so he took the scenes he needed and left out what he didn't.He even changed many things established in the first two films, but to the Potter universe's benefit: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry never looked and will never look more magical (at least in the 4th and 5th movies), it's as the castle is truly alive, not just a Gothic background.The special effects are great, better than film 2 and a lot better than film 1. John Williams's new score is excellent, it serves the new atmosphere really well, he rarely used the full orchestra. He didn't reach his 'Hook' or 'Home Alone' level, but this score is still very good.The teenage actors are okay, not brilliant but okay. Daniel Radcliffe couldn't properly channel Harry's emotions yet, but he is fairly decent (he will get better in later films).The adult actors are excellent, especially the newcomers. Gary Oldman joins the cast as the resident threat to Harry's life, he is maddened, he is tortured soul and you never know what he'll do next. His presence looms over the picture with much more strength than Voldermort's did in the first or second film.Michael Gambon's headmaster Dumbledore is very intelligent and somewhat crazy (like in the books) and more energetic than the late Richard Harris's, yet he is not the more aggressive Dumbledore we'll see in the 4th film.David Thewlis is also very good as professor Lupin, an old friend of Harry's deceased father, his scenes are warm and touching. Emma Thompson... she is magnificent, you'll see. Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Robert Hardy and Maggie Smith are all returning, Coltrane and Rickman are simply stellar.To sum it up: great story, brilliant new designs and atmosphere, excellent special effects, very good music and magnificent actors, BUT: if you are a hardcore fan and hate when the filmmakers change things from the book, do not watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darker, deeper and better. The best 'Potter' so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: The best of the novels come to the screen as the best of the blockbusters. Even as an avid fan of J.K. Rowling's bestselling enterprise that took the teenage generation by storm, I wasn't able to read the first two books in the series before having seen the movies, which were instant blockbuster attractions at their best. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was the only book in the series I have read so far, and the film adaptation, directed by acclaimed director Alfonso Cauron (1995's THE LITTLE PRINCESS), is the best and most entertaining of the series so far (even with the inclusion of later chapters GOBLET OF FIRE and ORDER OF THE PHOENIX). All from the brilliant characters, exuberant special effects and elaborate plot twists, PRISONER OF AZKABAN offers it all in yet another involving and intriguing fantasy adventure. It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year in Hogwarts, and its gloomier this time around (and not just because Cauron gave Hogwarts a gloomier makeover). Harry, along with his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are thrown in to a gloomier adventure shrouded with peril and mystery when a convicted murderer named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the "inescapable" Azkaban prison with rumors all pointing to his vengeance on Harry and his family. See, Black is supposed to be the evil Voldemort's (aka "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named") shady accomplice who led him to killing Harry's parents, but I bet you all know that. Harry wants to avenge his parents death of course, but the plot grows thicker than that and they (and you) are thrown into a bigger, more exciting adventure than you expected.The characters are as attractive as ever and the special effects are more seamless, but what makes AZKABAN superior to the previous films (which are both still grand in fashion) is the darker, more efficient directorial approach by Cauron. Filling in from his predecessor Chris Colombus, Cauron does everything Colombus has offered us in the previous films with the addition of a whole lot more. Although I feel that comparing this both Cauron and his predecessor Colombus give their own style to their own adaptations, I agree with other critics saying the film as the one that definitely doesn't feel like reading the books in style (not that I felt both previous movies, which I loved, felt like on-screen book-reading). Cauron isn't afraid to risk a little from the fans by altering some elements from the book, making the film much more than an impressive adaptation but a perfect stand-alone effort that would be more pleasant and fitful to the series' non-fans. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the kind of movie the words "movie magic" is meant for. Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Harry Potter books and films have entranced people all over the world and it is easy to see why.Again they have stuck to the books which is a great decision. The darker atmosphere is very prominent, which I think is helped by the main characters entering Pubity.The Acting is superb just like the two previous instalments, most of the actors and actresses are able to capture the essence of the character.Next on the list is the soundtrack. This aspect of the film is splendid and adds to the dark tone of the storyline.On the other side of the coin are a couple of problems. One. the design of the werewolf. To me it was designed to look purely cruel and evil without any animal instincts whatsoever. Two, the choice of Michael Gambon as Dumbuldore. He seemed unable to get into the character as Richard Harris was.My last word is wonderful. What I love about the Harry Potter films is the dark atmosphere and not overdoing the blood and gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing the all of the Harry Potter films in theaters. The first one I saw twice in the theater, the fifth one I saw only once. The rest I saw three times, however, the third Harry Potter film is the only one that I saw in the IMAX theater. And not to say is that because I saw it in IMAX, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" remains my favorite of the Harry Potter series. And while at that, I thought the series has gotten better as the time goes along. Harry Potter and all of his friends are on their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This time around, Harry Potter hears that a deadly prisoner escapee has escaped from Azkaban prison and Harry Potter is afraid that Sirius Black (that's the name of the escapee) wants to kill him. But as soon as Harry Potter meets Sirius Black, he actually turns out to be his godfather. Sure, the story was short to explain, but on the other hand, I actually didn't mind that at all. However, be warned a lot of stuff gets left out of the book. What I would say is the worst change of all is that Harry Potter gets his broomstick at the very end. But for some reason, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" did manage to not follow-up from the book but made it in a way where it can be turned into a great movie. Overall, I thought "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" was the best Harry Potter film. But that's just my honest opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry becomes trapped in a much darker wizarding world where Harry is hunted after by an fearsome serial killer named Sirius Black, who sold his parents to Voldemort. Harry has a story that isn't as worried about the evil wizards, but more about past that is delved into even deeper because of Professor Lupin, the new DADA teacher, who is a brilliantly cast by David Thewlis. Gary Oldman is great as the dark on the outside, secretly good guy Sirius Black. Again, the trio's acting progresses. I think that this is the best movie in the series. Alfonso Cuaron's directing was pretty good, and change was only expected when they didn't do it in 2003, one year after the previous film like the first two. Change is good, and I think that this series is progressing constantly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prizoner of Azkaban is definitely one of my favorites out of the seven Harry Potter novels, although perhaps not my favorite. However, I can say without reservation that until the next two films come out and I can pass judgment on them, this is my favorite of the film series. Cuaron's genius at direction and writing is easily tangible in this instant classic.Azkaban starts much the same way as the previous two films - at the Dursleys. It sticks to the plot of the books well, modifying it where necessary. He first manifests his latent anger and frustration as an abused orphan by blowing his aunt up into a helium saucer and letting her float out the door. He goes on the run and ends up being picked up by the Ministry of Magic, saying that for his safety, he'd best remain indoors and out of sight. Over the course of the film, he learns that an ex-convict and alleged Death Eater, Sirius Black, has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban - a feat which has never been accomplished before - and he's coming after Harry to kill him. As Harry further unravels the mystery surrounding Black's escape and why he's the target, he learns something about his legacy which changes his life forever and sets him out on a quest for vengeance.As a film, Azkaban doesn't disappoint when it comes to pacing and inclusion. Many fans were disappointed when certain things like the Quidditch matches were taken out of the book - I wasn't. The film did a fantastic job of following the plot essentials, showing us Hogwarts and its students, the everyday student life, while focusing heavily upon Harry's character development from a child into a teenager. His supporting actors are no less influential - Grint as Ron Weasley serves perfectly as a foil for both Harry and Hermione, with some hint of the romantic tension between the latter and himself. He also provides, as usual, a conclusive source of humor and lighthearted comedy.Watson's character takes a turn for the worse, however. The first two films accurately portrayed her as the young schoolgirl whose firsthand passion is studies and bookish knowledge, often at the expense of her social skills. At the time of Azkaban, she's not altogether different in the novels, but the film seems to make her more fashion-conscious and emotionally turbulent, a characteristic we don't really see come to fruition until the next novel. Nevertheless, her partnering with Harry is what fleshes out most of her determination - and that's what truly matters.If you haven't seen the film, I highly recommend it as indicative of the feel of the Harry Potter books. If anything it would serve as a "gateway" experience for reading the novels.</fullReview>

In this third film, Harry becomes a lot more wise, he is now having to face Demeter's and is continuing his feud with Draco Malfoy but overall I do not think the film came off.

It is Harry Potter's third year and suddenly things are changing for Harry things that have never been told to him about how his parents died are surfacing and suddenly everyone is worried about Harry's safety a Madman named Sirius Black has done the impossible he's escaped from Azkaban something no one have ever done before. People are worried That Black is going to look for Harry and kill him. THEN things take a twist for the extraordinary as one sub plot meshes with another and another and you end up with the finest entry in the series thus far. Gary oldman is outstanding as Sirius Black a Tragic figure if there ever was one and again the cast pulls together to deliver a fine incredible family movie that is worth watching over and over again. Richard Harris is sorely missed but Michael Dearborn fills Dumbledore's shoes very nicely indeed. One of my all time top favorite movies.</fullReview>

Like when Peter was discovered, they didn't go much deeper like Rowling did in the book. They made some modifications, but I didn't mind them that much. I feel bad Richard Harris died as he was perfect for the role of Dumbledore. Special effects are good. The whooping Willow's location in this movie is different that of the second movie, I guess. There is no final talk between Dumbledore and Harry where Dumbledore explains about Peter Pettigrew's bond and more into the love of Harry's parent's.I give this movie 6.5 for 10.My order of movie rating in HP Series:- 1.

		<shortDescription>Getting Darker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this, like most people I saw how the children are getting older. The first two films were good but this film is better. Some say that Harry shows his dark side when he takes revenge on Aunt Marge by blowing her up like a balloon but I personally was completely on his side after what she said about his parents. The scene with the Knight Bus is great. But the films are getting more sinister. A case in point is when the train is halted on the Glenfinnan Viaduct, everything goes dark and the Dementors are on the train. Harry's flight over Hogwarts and Loch Shiel on Buckbeak is spectacular. There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot and the pace never flags. This film has definitely set the pattern for the rest of the series. A really good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superbus Totalus! THE Best adaptation of a Harry Potter book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself quite a Potter-maniac. I have seen each of the films based on the novels over and over again and I consider this adaptation of 'Prisoner of Azkaban' to be THE Best! Everything about this film just brings the world of Harry Potter to life more vividly, more convincingly and more movingly - from the Knight Bus, the Dementors, the Marauder's Map, Shrieking Shack, Buckbeak, the Hippogriff and of course, the eponymous Prisoner of Azkaban Sirius Black, is brought to life so well that it's an unforgettable experience! Of course, I do personally think that 'Azkaban' as a novel itself is leaps and bounds better than the previous two novels Rowling wrote. Compared to 'Sorcerer's Stone' and 'Chamber of Secrets', 'Azkaban' inherently is so fast-paced, action-packed and thrilling that a movie based on it HAD to be good! How could it not?! And yet, this film exceeds expectations... Even the soundtrack for 'Azkaban' is way better and plentiful than in the previous 2 films. The Harry Potter theme given by John Williams, the theme with which this film opens, is one of my most favorite movie themes. I cannot praise John Williams enough for composing that theme... The moment you hear it, you're just transported to that magical world of Hogwarts and Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Hagrid and co! I don't think anyone could've composed a better theme to encapsulate the sheer magic of Harry Potter! One of the things that they brought really well to life was the Marauder's Map - it was just so well done! I mean, even when you read the novel you have a fair enough mental picture of the map, but when you see it in the film, you're like, "Wow! Excellent!" The Dementors were appropriately creepy and scary - the train sequence again was superb! The Harry, Ron, Hermoine trio was very good - Daniel, Rupert and Emma have all done very well. Both Daniel and Emma are especially brilliant in the entire time-turning sequence. Emma Thompson as Sybil Trelawney was just adorable! Great choice! Gary Oldman is superb as Sirius Black! Lupin is one of those characters every Potter fan has a soft corner for and fortunately David Thewlis as Lupin is very good and very Lupin-ish :) In all this is certainly my favorite adaptation of a HP novel. I had equal hopes from 'Goblet of Fire' and 'Order of the Phoenix' but was left quite disappointed. I just hope 'Half-blood Prince' is good... I wished Alfonso Cuaron directed one more Potter film. I wished they had given 'Half-blood Prince' to him instead of David Yates... For 'Deathly Hallows', they should have an online poll from fans about the choice of director and I really would not be surprised if most choose Alfanso Cuaron! Bless Cuaron and John Williams and Rowling and Harry Potter! The world is a better place 'cos of them!! Nox!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why I pointed him out, but I liked his character here. If you've seen the movie or know the books (I personally haven't done the latter), than you know his serious ... excuse me Sirius Black character is very detailed and fun to play (for him) and to watch (for us the viewers).Talking about watching, if you are about to watch this, I can safely assume that have seen or read the previous installments of the franchise, so you know quite a bit about Potter. And you will notice here, that the overall tone just got darker. Which is a good thing! Still family friendly enough though, while Potter remains a "kid" magician that has to face another challenge (almost) day by day ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching the first 2 Pothead movies, so I got used to some stuff from the book to be left out. But this movie left out too much. What they should do is put out 2 parts of this movie, and make you see the first part first. That would work perfectly. Overall, a good movie!List of Negatives: ? Hagrid's cabin isn't down that big hill. ? Harry receives the broomstick in the middle of the book, but the movie has him getting it at the end. ? A leaf falls, and more nature scenes. They're nice, but have nothing to do with the movie. ? The Knight Bus never had that stupid talking head in the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent third installment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's year three at Hogwarts for Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Some may wonder how the trio has grown so much since the last movie. It's simple. While Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban are only one year apart in the story, the movies were filmed two years apart. In storyline the three kids are 13 years old.The acting is good, but not as good as the first two films. I think Emma Watson's acting in this one is somewhat rusty. Daniel Radcliffe also has a few rough spots. Maybe it's an age conflict or something. They're playing characters younger than themselves in the teen range. I will be fair and say they both have some good highlights in the film. Rupert Grint managed to keep his character well portrayed the best. Professor Dumbledore is being played by a new actor, since Richard Harris died after the second film. Whether the new actor is better or worse is really up to the viewer. I don't see much difference. Alan Rickman is doing a terrific job as the harsh professor Severus Snape, whose character is becoming more important.This installment is slightly awkward and can be confusing if you don't pay close attention. There are three new characters important to Harry's past: The new defense against the dark arts teacher(RJ Lupin), Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew. There's also the introduction of more creatures, like werewolves and Hippogryphs. The plot is very confusing, so I'll only mention the easy parts. Sirius Black is a convicted murderer who has escaped from Azkaban, and it's believed he wants to destroy Harry Potter and revive Voldemort. Dementors, the creatures who guard Azkaban, are searching everywhere, and are for some reason drawn to Harry. Eventually Harry comes to believe that Sirius betrayed his parents, and only when the three new characters previously mentioned are brought together, does Harry learn the truth.Harry, Hermione, and Ron are definitely growing up and maturing in this third installment. You'll see the best-friend relationship between Hermione and Harry get a little stronger. Whenever Harry is in trouble or gets hurt, Hermione is right there with him. Whenever he passes out, he wakes up and Hermione is sitting next to him, wanting to know if he's all right. At one point she holds Harry and tells Siruis if he wants to kill Harry he'll have kill Hermione and Ron as well. You'll also see really clear evidence that Hermione and Ron like each other. There's a shot where they briefly hold hands and get embarrassed, and a scene where Hermione asks if they should move closer while observing a haunted building. This movie also introduces traveling back in time, and this is the first movie where Harry casts a spell that shows just how great his powers can be. A pretty good movie for the series, but pay attention or you may be confused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Magical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 3rd instalment in J.K Rowlings multi-billion pound franchise is widely regarded as the best and most confusing of the entire series for people who haven't read the books thus far.It is certainly the best film, but by a clean mile. Alfonso Cuaron, the brainchild behind 'Taxi' is at the helm of the Prisoner of Azkaban which takes these films onto a whole new level.Cuaron has extracted some of the best sequences out of the book and used them to good effect; something which seems to have been amiss in the latest films; particularly the newest.Prisoner of Azkaban features an array of brilliant acting from all the major leads; Alan Rickman &amp; Maggie Smith are as excellent as usual. The newcomers; Michael Gambon as Dumbledore is good, but perhaps not as lovable as the late Richard Harris. David Thewlis takes the role of the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin who is simply spellbinding in his role.Of course, this wouldn't be a review without mentioning Gary Oldman as Harry's estranged Godfather Sirius Black; a monumental feat for Oldman to climb has been realised in one of the best pieces of acting I have seen in years.Prisoner of Azkaban is an excellent addition to the Harry Potter saga, excellent special effects, brilliant acting and a storyline that cannot be rivalled. Cuaron should be incredibly pleased with himself, he has produced a truly magical film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New director and new tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuarvos takes over from Chris Columbus for the third tale in the "Harry Potter" adventures. The plot has a more adult, ambiguous tone than it's predecessors, and Hogwart's feels less like a place of magical wonder and more like a creepy, haunted house that just happens to be a school.After performing a spell on his repulsive aunt, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) flees his home and relies on his old mate Ron (Rupert Grint) to help him back to Hogwart's. Word reaches Harry that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped Azkaban prison. Black is meant to have had a hand in his parents death and is heading to Hogwart's to hunt Harry down...The casting in this one is a bit mixed. While the regulars (Emma Watson as Hermione, Coltrane, Smith, Gambon et al) do their parts well, they are let down slightly by Emma Thompson, who just seems embarrassed playing the kids' new psychic teacher. On the other hand Mark Williams is on form delivering some delightful comic exposition as Ron's father, and David Thewlis is very moving as a teacher who hides a dark magical secret. To anyone not familiar with Potter but know their cinema the presence of Gary Oldman may wrong-foot some into thinking he's the bad guy. He isn't, and his brief appearance continues a run of quality good guy characters from the actor.Another great sequel. Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Better than 1 &amp; 2. Simply Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004, Dir. Alfonso Cuarón)It's a dark time again at Hogwarts witchcraft and wizardry for Harry Potter and his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, as they start their third year. Sirius Black, who is believed to have helped in the kidnapping of Harry's parents, have escaped from Azkaban prison. Dementors are everywhere, keeping a lookout for Black. Life is still not that bad, that is, until the Fat Lady reports that Sirius Black is in the castle. Whatever Harry Potter does now, he will always need tread carefully and watch his back.After the previous two successful Harry Potter movies, it was going to be hard to improve on them, especially with a different director. Fortunatly, they manage to create a movie which is a lot better and more fun and exciting to win. The young stars are the film have improved tremendously and really gave the film its professional film. The set pieces are wonderfully crafted and the special effects are amazing. Gary Oldman and David Thewlis brings life to the characters and really make them fit in with the sinister. Sirius Black really does have that feel to make you hate him and then love him. The story is a lot more interesting than the previous two films and is so much more exciting to watch. Alfonso Cuarón has really brought a wonderful masterpiece of children's film-making."Well, Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering." "And that there could be the sun and that's happiness." "So..." "...you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it." - Ron (Rupert Grint)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oooh, It's so dark!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third outing for Harry Potter sees the franchise beginning to expand on its roots. The feel of this movie is different compared to Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, giving us a darker, more intense experience. Harry and his pals are growing up fast, our hero having to come to terms with the fact that the psychopathic betrayer of his parents to Lord Voldemort has broken out of the wizard's prison Azkaban (a sort of magical version of Broadmoor)and is possibly hunting him.Director Alphonso Curaron wastes no time in setting up the plot, which fairly zips along, bypassing the occasionally leaden pace of the first two films. And the basic theme of the story - that of facing up to fears and conquering them, gives it slightly more gravitas, too. Curaron takes a few more risks with the material, and generally brings it off, although the "darkness" of the story is only relative. Get Carter it isn't.Certain scenes will stay in your memory, The "Boggart Bit" and the hilarious sight of Alan Rickman in drag. Hard to picture him as the Sheriff Of Nottingham after this! The leads do reasonably well again, and David Thewlis is a welcome addition to the regular cast. And it's great to see Gary Oldman playing on his image as the escaped dark wizard Sirius Black. Of course there's more about him than meets the eye...Michael Gambon takes over the role of Albus Dumbledore from the late Richard Harris, although he doesn't have the same sort of charm, coming across as a bit stroppy on occasion. It is always difficult to replace an already accepted actor in the part, though.If it were possible, I'd give Prisoner of Azkaban 7.5, as it's the best of the first three films, but I'll have to settle for the same rating as Chamber of Secrets.Highly recommended, though it might be hard to pick up the story if you've not seen the first two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better With Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a huge fan of this movie. Everything changed and we feared the loss of Chris Columbus at the helm. With the unheard of director at the time, I feared that we would lose the fantasy element that we had with Chris Columbus, especially when Alfonso Cuaron started talking about "coming of age" rather than pure unadulterated magic.I am however delighted to say its "stood the test of time" and I think will continue to do so. It is quite an accessible and should be remembered quite fondly.It's somewhat more professional than the first two films in the franchise and it's good to see the young cast fleshing out their roles a little more - they're not so stiff. Having just read Book Seven, the Deathly Hallows, it's quite intriguing to re-watch this movie and recognise the fore-shadowing.Despite another tired clichéd and familiar sound track from John Williams, and another linear, disjointed scene-by-scene adaption by Steve Kloves, this is a fine movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfonso makes a good effort, yet fails to stay faithful to the books.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have not previously read the books, do so before watching, else you shall be even more confused by a film that misses out so much background that it fails to develop the plot correctly.To Concentrate on the Direction of the film Alfonso has made a somewhat more believable effort than efforts of Columbus in HP1 &amp; 2. For starters it appears that Alfonso has understood that it is unusual for students to wear their uniform outside of school, a clear sign that he understands what the films are about a little more.Be prepared however for some stupidly over-blown CGI that sacrifices time in the film that could have been used for better purposes. It is also to be noted that Daniel Radcliffe is placed with two extremely embarrassing scenes that would not have been out of place in "titanic".This brings us onto our Actors. The "trio" (Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger)) who have undoubtedly progressed in Acting ability, while they have been good so far (and have had some awful directors to work with in HP 1 &amp; 2) they show that they are certainly capable in PoA. Emma Watson delivering the best performance of the three in this film showing that she can use expression fully. With some stunning acting from other, older actors, but as other critics say their roles can hardly be called more than "cameo" appearances, which is disappointing as such time is wasted with, the aforementioned over-blown CGI.I scored this film as 5 (out of 10) simply due to the fact that it is half-baked, not even half as good as the book, and the adaptation leaves the audience with little satisfaction from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Wicked This Way Comes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prisoner of Azkaban draws quite a different line than the Chamber of Secrets or the Philosopher's Stone. Most of it is summed up in the tag-line 'something wicked this way comes.' The first two installments were pretty light, but relatively long, viewing, introducing you to the world of Harry Potter and its delightful characters and their antagonists. But as Harry grows older, the world grows darker. When Harry's third year at Hogwarts dawns, the news is all aplomb with news of the recently escaped Sirius Black, a supporter of Lord Voldemort and murderer of many people, and for some reason is coming after Harry. Hogwarts, because of this danger, is being protected by evil shrouded Dementors, who guard the wizard prison Azkaban. They affect Harry especially, but he is helped along by his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), along with his new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, the shabby looking but very nice Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) As the story progresses, Harry learns just why Sirius is coming for him, and in a magnificent intricate climax, he learns the truth.Absolutely stunning, the dark tone is immediately set. Begone be the kiddie wizard robes and hats, and gone are the child-like themes. These are growing young people, in a world growing rapidly more wicked. Bravo to Alfonso Cuaron. Probably the best Harry Potter yet. The acting is as well done as I can expect it to be by the main three characters, but the supporting characters hold up the movie, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Michael Chambon. Brilliant. The plot is extremely well done, is not stretched. Does not seem like too little or too much. The best Harry Potter yet. 10/10 "Something Wicked this Way Comes..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Potter Yet!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I loved the first two films.When I heard that they got a new director(Alfonso Cuaron) for the third installment I was worried,but I must say I worried over absolutely nothing.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban begins when Harry(Daniel Radcliffe) accidentally blows up his Uncle Vernon's sister like a balloon after she makes an off-color remark about his parents.Wrapped in anger Harry runs away.Through various trials Harry makes it back to the wizarding world,and is reunited with his friends,to learn that a dark wizard named Sirius Black(Gary Oldman),who followed Voldermort,has broken out of Azkaban(a wizard prison) and is out to kill Harry.When Harry returns to school he meets an old friend of his fathers,while he learns more about Sirius Black learning he is his godfather and that he betrayed his parents,angering Harry.Throughout the film Harry battles these dark,hooded creatures known as Dementors,he prepares for a confrontation with Sirius Black,and battles his own inner demons.Overall this film is much darker,and more serious in tone than the first two,which in my opinion has only made it better.Once more the cinematography,special effects,and production design is superb and definitely creates this believable fantasy world,although the look of the film is different it fits the darker story,and I even prefer this film's look at times to the first two.That isn't all that is different,John Williams is back this time,but tries something that is much more darker and a little less playful,and it works helping to create this amazing fantasy.Once again the acting is great,although their is a new Dumbledore(in Michael Gambon).What really is the show stealer is the directing,Chris Columbus has stepped down as director and Alfonso Cuaron takes his place at the helm of this franchise and he does an amazing job.Cuaron takes the dark tone of the story and sells it to the audience while still retaining much of the look of the first two,just adding on.Cuaron also transforms the three leads into teenagers in this film and expands their characters even further.Cuaron and screenwriter Steve Kloves definitely need a huge pat on the back for the time turner sequence.This third outing in Harry's world is darker,and at times scarier than the first two.I find it hard to believe this got by with a PG rating.The kids have now grown up into rebellious teenagers and are now handling more mature themes and adult problems thus adding to its darker tone.Its darker tone in fact actually makes it better and more enjoyable.With more character development than previous entries,just as many laughs,more emotion,and more heart than the first two,this film is the best entry in this franchise so far.A superbly perfect: 10/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) goes through his third year at Hogwarts and has to deal with convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from Azkaban prison.Ironic that my favorite of the first three books should prove to be my least favorite movie. Whatever magic and energy is powering this film, it's not Rowling or British. Cuaron is a fine director, but was a bad choice for director. He's too breezy with the material and whips through the plot with not enough of the book's charm. Once the kids get to school, everything gets pretty not fun. The Dementors are wonderful creatures and are done to terrifying effect, but are not explained very coherently and some other vital stuff will be lost to people who didn't read the book.There's some fine humor and dark atmosphere, but a lot of the humor is gags and pratfalls. Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Hermione Granger) are sidelined to doing this one routine and are both wasted. In fact a lot of the cast is criminally underused. True, Quidditch has been established as one of the "gimmicks" in the series, but this movie could've really been livened up had they included the fantastic Quidditch Final,but Cuaron couldn't be bothered. He was too busy doing long tracking shot after long tracking shot back to the Whomping Willow again and again. We REMEMBER, okay? A line of exposition would suffice to make everyone remember about it.The movie seemed like more of a companion guide to the book. Some of the best things in the book were absent and the magic had more of a creepy "Day of the Dead" quality (talking shrunken heads. Why are they all Jamaican?) The kids are acting better. Gary Oldman was good. The movie in general, was good, but disappointing for me as a fan. It seemed like Cuaron found it a chore to be dealt with. Some fans may not mind. A B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts. But as soon as after he left the Dursleys and set off for a new year at school, catching up with Ron and Hermione again, things were not as smooth-sailing as it seemed to be.The wizarding world is abuzz with the news that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban. Many were convinced that Black was indirectly the reason why Harry's parents died 12 years ago. As a result of Black's escape, Dumbledore had ordered tighten security with the Dementors guarding the school. But somehow, Black managed to enter in the school compounds.The new school year even sees a new Defence Against The Dark Arts professor - Remus Lupin (David Thewlis). Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson), the Divination professor makes her presence. She may be eccentric at times and not many taking her seriously all the time, one of her predictions did came true.And when Ron's new pet rat Scabbers ran away on its own, a whole new set of adventures await the famous trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Which even led to who was the real person who went over to Lord Voldermort's side 12 years ago, leaving Harry's parents dead as a result.Lies, betrayal, friendship...do they really have a place in Harry's world? Something (really) wicked this way comes! It was really enjoyable, and I'm glad I finally catch it when it was on the television here few days back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter is having a tough time with his relatives (yet again). He runs away after using magic to blow Uncle Vernon's sister Marge who was being offensive towards Harry's parents. Initially scared for using magic outside the school, he is pleasantly surprised that he won't be penalized after all. However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile shape-shifters called Dementors are appointed to guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry know that by the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be filled up and he will have a clearer vision of what the future has in store.This film is darker and much better than the previous two films. I loved the new vision of the Harry Potter world by Alfonso Cuarón (obviously, each director has a different perspective). I found this perspective much more dangerous and less for little children, per se. The comedy is still here, though.This film or the fourth Harry Potter film is probably the best film to date! I love the new score (although missing the old one) but this one gives us a bit darker atmosphere and magical at the same time. I love the new style of the film, giving it a more "laid back" look than the uniforms look.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson matured more into their roles, which makes their performances better. The new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, plays a much younger and stronger look of this character.The visual effects are also good and there are much more sophisticated story telling in here, which I like. There are even more darker action sequences which contains more thrills and suspense. I like Alfonso Cuarón as a director and this is one of his finest work.No more kidding around. This movie is much better and darker then the previous two movies. The performances are a bit better and the story a bit more sophisticated with great CGI and script. It's not all about the action. It's more about the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Harry Potter Film So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many fans of the series will agree the third book, 'The Prisoner of Azkaban," is the best book. Similar to its literary counterpart, the third installment of the Harry Potter movies is also the best so far!Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and gang are in their third year at Hogwarts and new dangers and adventures lie around the corner. Primarily, Sirius Black (Gary Oldham) is a prisoner who has escaped Azkaban prison and is believed to be after Harry. This is because Sirius supposedly played an integral part in the death of Harry's parents.The film-making, along with the plot, become considerably darker. Many scenes occur through thunderstorms and ominous dark clouds. The lighting hardly ever gets light or happy, but rather filled with an abundance of black and gray tones.But what makes this movie the best is the plot. You must compliment the director completely for letting the amazing plot and storyline carry the movie. He does not try to overact, overproduce or over-do any scenes. He just lets the characters develop in the scenes and the plot carries the story from there.This is the best of the first 3 Harry Potter films and contains a more mature watch-ability level than the two previous films. This is a movie that older children, young adults and parents will all enjoy.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes Columbus' mundanity and turns it into magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two Potter films were not bad movies. On the contrary, they were "pretty good". Of course, they were following Rowling's excellent stories as close as humanly possible within the span of a motion picture, so that does a lot to explain why they don't entirely suck.Unfortunately, a book is not a movie, and Columbus doesn't have half the imagination of a director like Alfonso Cuaron. How can you take a series like Harry Potter--whose essence is to be so magical as to spark the imagination of its readers--and apply such a mundane approach to its transformation into film? It followed the letter of the books so closely that it was boring. There was nothing magical that hadn't been made a point of in Rowling's work.And then along comes Cuaron. He changes the sets, swaps in a new Dumbledore to replace the sadly late Richard Harris, and proceeds to breathe life into the entire thing.Sure, the result is less true to the text of Rowling's story; but it's far more true to its spirit. And just as importantly, it actually feels magical. There's not a shot in the movie without something exciting and imaginative going on.And the child actors, stiff and unnatural under Columbus' direction, also come to life under Cuaron's careful guidance. They won't be winning any Oscars anytime soon, but at least they seem human and at least you can relate to them and feel their emotions.Of course, the final element that makes Azkaban a superior Potter film is that, in my personal opinion, the story is just plain better than that of the first two books. It's more personal, and the puzzle-like plotting actually comes together neatly and believably (as long as you ignore minor time travel paradoxes, which will always occur whenever you use time travel as a plot device).In any case, this is, to me, a beloved film, since it purely captures the spirit of the books that I love so much. Hats off to Cuaron, who did what Columbus did not, and actually created movie magic for a series that lives and breathes magic as its currency of wonderment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfonso Cuarón is just want Harry Potter needed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moments after leaving the theater, I was still a little confused to whether I liked the film or not. After a few day of letting it soak in, I realized Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban finally took the series to a whole new level of movie making. Alfonso takes a very huge leap away from the first two movies but the leap was greatly needed. Azkaban finally makes Harry Potter feel like a movie, rather than a book made into a movie. The environments and moods he creates are what really make this film stand out from 1 and 2. The dementors were especially creepy and were done perfectly. Azkaban shines in all of the areas it's predecessors were weak and Alfonso has improved on the already strong foundations left by Columbus. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban receives a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Potter Film: Alfonso Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had my doubts about this film when I learned that Alfonso Cuaron was to take the director's chair, but they proved to be completely irrational. This film is easily the best of the Potters, excelling in nearly every area. Alfonso brings a new, very spooky quality to the film franchise that was much needed. His new Hogwarts set is perfect for the third film, which was meant to be dark and different. For instance, the pumpkin patch and the "floating" walkway give off a very mystical and Halloween-ish aura. In addition, Cuaron and the set designers actually reinforced the themes of the film in every aspect. The newly designed gears and clock chime in the castle reinforce time, which is of utmost importance in the film. Also worth mentioning is the overall look of the characters and visuals.The special effects of the third film far surpass those of the first and second, erasing all traces of cheese and campiness. The Whomping Willow scene with Harry and Hermione looks incredibly real, and is very exciting. The dementors are also incredibly creepy looking, which is the perfect effect for them. I also liked what was done with the students themselves. Instead of walking around in their school robes and looking incredibly dorky, Harry, Hermione, and Ron dress and act like normal teens, simply thrust into the wizarding world. Their lines reinforce this as well. I found it especially comical when Hermione sees herself outside of Hagrid's hut, remarking "Does my hair really look like that from the back?" Overall, this third film is ingenious, blending fantasy spookiness with typical teen behavior. A masterpiece on nearly every level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sad when Richard Harris died as I wondered what would happen to the series. I was glad when they said they were not going to stop filming them and had cast Michael Gambon in the role. He does an admirable job but I found his slight Irish twang to be odd, I know he is trying to be different from Richard Harris but it is a little bit silly as it comes and goes.What appeals to me about this story is we see Harry in his teens, changing from the very first movie, where he stands up to his horrible family. I have to say I cheered when the aunt blew up and then flew away.I'm glad that Gary Oldman was in this film because I regard him as one of the best actors to ever come out of Britain.I like the fact that this story was not so much focused on Voldemort as the others, this was more about Harry finding out about who betrayed his parents to Voldemort and that he had a godfather if he ever wanted to get away from the Dursleys. It was also interesting to have one plot line which involved going back in time. The special effects for this was amazing as Harry and Hermione have to hide from their past selves. The other special effect I thought was amazing was Lupin turning into a werewolf and then the way the werewolf was animated.I had read the book but was still surprised, probably as it so long ago that I read the book. The scene, in particular when the audience find out that the one that betrayed Harry's parents and framed Sirius Black was Ron's rat who has featured in the other films. I laughed at the scene where Harry is invisible and is throwing snow balls at Malfoy and his friends.My favourite of the series so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite books...not my favorite movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many Potter fans, I felt that after number two much magic was lost in the series. However, JK Rowlings ever increasingly better plot lines make up what the movie lacks. This was one of my favorite books, so despite a lot quirky things added(hem hem, shrunken heads anyone??), I still found ways to enjoy this movie.The actors have grown up a lot, not completely for the best. Dan Radcliff is not yet good at pulling off emotional scenes-I sincerely hope he gets better as he matures. And I found Emma Watson rather annoying, to be honest. However, Rupert Gint as well as the Weasly twins have matured well, and I feel are absolutely perfect for their roles.The adult actors are also wonderful-Alan Rickman is still brilliant as Snape, Gary Oldman was cast well as Sirius, Lupin, McGonagall...Alas, Alan Rickman no longer can bring his magic to the movies. I really didn't feel any connection to Michael Gambon, but maybe with time..Not the best movie, but very good actors and plot make up for the set/director changes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a really good movie! I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I have watched it about 5 times now. The story lines are engaging.I would say that the acting is phenonmenon. I am glad that Harry Potter is growing up so now that he can fight evil like a man. The 2 other characters are very entertaining. Omini and the red head boy. I am so glad they picked these three kids to be in the movie. I heard that there was a major attack on the Asian girl playing Harry potter's new girlfriend. I don't understand what the jealousy is about, if you really take a good perspective, harry potter, the real boyis still single, he is now the richest young man in the UK and yes, you have a chance to marry him, but you might have to fly out there to meet him first!http://localsandtourist.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Harry Potter movie to date!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** The review assumes familiarity with the Harry Potter canon *** This isn't the perfect movie by any means. I'll grant that. For one, I'd definitely have liked more about Marauders and a much better clarification of how they were all related to Harry, especially Lupin. (This would've explained so much, like how Lupin could read the map while Snape couldn't and the significance of the stag patronus.) This is also the movie that deviates significantly (for the first time; the earlier two were rather slavish adaptations) from the book. But the differences are what I cherished the most. The whole time turner sequence is quite brilliant IMHO, cheesy but brilliant. There's absolutely no way Rowling could have written in all the visual flourishes and Kloves and Cuaron take full advantage of the possibilities presented with the whole time turner sequence. Sure it's sort of deus ex machina but that's the way it was written in the book and they couldn't possibly alter it entirely. For one, Harry, Ron and Hermoine aren't nearly quite magically or emotionally ready to do the whole thing right in the first go. So, while the deus ex machina weakens the whole plot a bit, this is about the best movie one can come up with, within the plot. Another small distraction is the very first scene when Harry obviously performs magic during summer, which he's not allowed to do. (And it gets stated explicitly multiple times in the movie!) That was a fairly major goof.Now about the rest of the movie. It's the most visually sumptuous HP movie I've seen so far, even narrowly better than Goblet of Fire. The only sequence I can think of where special effects were below par was the knight bus sequence. I also like this movie's score more than the rest so far. Some of the sets could be better but overall they're great. Cinematography is easily the best I've seen in HP movies so far. Darkening of the visual palette was done brilliantly and set the stage for the rest of the movies.Performances wise, the three leads are still finding their way. They each had good moments and clunkers - Harry when he cries at Hogsmeade, Hermoine when she greets Harry at Leaky Cauldron, and Ron when he freaks out in many scenes, for instance. Gambon was good as Dumbledore but there are portents of the disaster that came in Goblet of Fire. (IMHO, Gambon's performance was the single most disappointing feature of GoF. He just shrieks and shrieks some more. Whereas Richard Harris was delightfully understated, bringing out Dumbledore's experience, maturity, wisdom and humor, I don't even know who the guy Gambon plays is in GoF! Read the book and watch the movie - what a contrast!) Gambon was already showing a few signs of 'panic' in this movie. Then there are the three best perfs of the movie and how brilliant they are - Thewlis as Lupin, Oldman as Black and Rickman as Snape! They outdo each other and act circles around the rest of the cast each time. Alan Rickman, in particular, deserved some sort of nomination for his perf. Watch the scene when he finally asks Harry to turn to page 394 in the book. Years after watching the movie, I still remember the way his nose twitches then. I doubt he will ever play a role better than Snape's. William Hurt was given a supporting actor Oscar nomination in "A History of Violence" for a travesty (over-over-over-over-the-toooop) much shorter than the brilliance of Rickman in this movie. While I don't claim Alan Rickman was robbed of a nomination, I definitely would not have complained one bit if he'd gotten one.Alfonso Cuaron has made absolutely fascinating movies, and in particular, movies with tremendous repeat value. He's someone to watch out for. I wish he'd come back and direct another HP movie.All in all, a good and worthy addition to the HP sequence. 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say this is the worst out of all of them in my opinion, but it is still a good movie. I think that this movie is the least exciting, and is the only one that doesn't have much involving Voldemort which i think is what made this a tad less interesting. I also didn't like the demetors but some how it seemed like they were taking the place of voldemort(besides Serious black). What i personally thought was the best part of this movie was when Hermionie punched Malfoy in the face, that was the best part of this movie to me. So to conclude my comment i have to say that it was kind of a let down to the other Harry potter movies but still a good movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Internal/darker Harry Potter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I never saw the second Harry Potter, but a few weeks back on a bus to New York City, I saw the third Harry Potter film. Sure the conditions were less than adequate for viewing such a would-be mega movie, but it managed to keep me occupied on the trip down.So what can I say? It was entertaining enough. At times I had a hard time following the storyline or the significance of the various elements of the film. This one also wasn't able to pin down what it was trying to say as well as the first one, although it appeared to be similar in tone, despite the overall "darkness" of the film. I think the film would've benefited tremendously from a larger screen presentation with a proper sound system, so I'm going to adjust the final score +1 because of the limited presentation facilities onboard the bus.That said, the film is a bit internal. There's a lot to learn about the world that the film tries to express and although a lot of it isn't necessary, it's all hinted at, which made me feel like I was missing out not reading the books, at the same time, it also made me feel like the film wasn't self-contained enough, not knowing the significance of the creatures, spells and etc. occurring in the film.Anyway, it was entertaining enough for a bus ride and I'm sure it could be even better in a proper environment. 7/10 (6/10 on a bus, adjusted for poor viewing environment/sound).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rich and entertaining third screen yarn for Harry Potter. This one's a bit more human than the first two with further family ties making it into the grounds of Hogwarts. There's not a great deal to distinguish it from the first two, unless one is looking carefully for invariably wide-angled or pan+zoom shots.The principal trio of children impress and charm as ever. In addition to Alan Rickman's dependably terse Snape there's the new addition of Michael Gambon, a more earthy replacement Dumbledore. David Thewlis is the pick of the new additions - there are plenty of others to look out for from Emma Thompson wearing ashtrays on her face to Julie Christie running a pub. Even Ian Brown (yes, Stone Roses Ian Brown!) pops up in cameo.I was competently diverted and amused. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings Back the Magic of the Books That Was Sorely Lacking In the First Two Installments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JK Rowling did not know what she was getting herself into when she scribbled the first few pages of 'HARRY POTTER' in that London coffee shop. The series has become a worldwide smash and has spawned four movies so far (a fifth is on the way). My review is concerning the forth.Alfonso Cuaron brings us 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', the third movie of the third book by JK. Harry is returning to Hogwarts for his third year at the boarding school for witchcraft and wizardry. I daresay some religious fanatics might find this offensive. Anyway, he has some problems--his family hates him, his course book won't stop trying to bite him, his grades are in the balance, and a deranged wizard-turned-escapist wants Harry's blood.Cuaron, not widely known before this film, is the director of the hit sex comedy 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' and the children's film 'A Little Princess'. He brings his unique vision to the Harry Potter film franchise that was sorely lacking in the previous two films, which suffered from Chris Colombus's generic style and cute child moments. Alfonso Cuaron certainly has an eye for cinematography and where to place the camera. Emmanuel Lubezki (sp?), the DP, brings us a dark, murky look to the story. The restlessly moving camera adds to the mood as well.John William's music is, as always, breathtaking. His score for this film surpasses the past two, as he brings a mischievous and dark, thematically-tied string of music that never seems to stop (which is a good thing).The performances by the kids in this movie are, well...good. Better than the first two movies. They have matured (thankfully), not only as humans, but as actors as well. Of course with any children's story, you are going to have some cheap 'kids' moments as well. But they are, for the most part, subdued in the storyline.Overall, a more realistic (if that term can be used), stylized, mature, and specific movie. Entertaining for all audiences. It brings back the magic of the books that was lacking in the first two installments.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only watched the first two Harry Potter movies because I am in love with Emma Watson. I thought both movies were, otherwise, unwatchable. The Prisoner of Azkaban is different - it has a rational plot and believable adult story line. The star of this movie is Hermoine. She gets all the witty lines and all the good scenes. Emma Watson has improved greatly as an actress. It's truly hard to believe that she was only 12 when they first started filming it(13 in later scenes), she's incredibly mature for her age. Except for a preposterous grab of Harry's shirt in the tree swinging scene, a lack of fear in a werewolf scene, and a silly line regarding Hermoine's hair in a serious moment - the movie is quite believable within its magical boundaries. The time reversing sequences are exceptional with Hermoine taking charge. The intelligent plot twists are an unexpected welcome addition. It is a dark, beautiful, mysterious, and enjoyable film which even adults are welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I really like about the Harry Potter movies is that they are not sentimentalised, babyish, immature trash that is only made for kids and babies whose parents don't wish to scare them - they are all gripping, dark, scary, and actually have brains behind them that will please the adults as well. This film is no exception - it is probably the darkest of all Potter's adventures so far, and easily lives up to the title of a worthy Harry Potter adaptation. The opening scenes with Aunt Marge are very funny, but after that - the adventure begins - and it is dark from the off. The Dementor scene on the train is stunningly and grippingly done, and this film has a real sense of mystery and intrigue to it. John Williams' classic score is once again used to great effect, Hagrid actually has some kind of a soul in this film, and the ending is a superbly done close to another great Harry Potter film. This might have been the shortest Harry Potter film, but it is by no means the worst. Another thumbs-up is the credits sequence - hugely original, and a great end to 2004's greatest fantasy film! Potter's third adventure will not fail to disappoint! 9/10</fullReview>

Another thing is, the acting is outstanding especially by Rupert Grint. He's a brilliant actor when it comes to being scared. But my favourite thing about this movie is the animation. The hippogrith that Hagrid owns looks real. The domentors look really freaky and all this clever animations look like it's actually there! But the reason that it lost a mark was because Albus Dumbledore sounds younger than the second and the first and I understand why. Also I thought Dumbledore's last actor was better than his new one.

		<fullReview>After many years of avoiding the harry potter films my mum invited me to sit down with her and watch a few. after watching the first movie i wasn't particularly surprised or looking forward to the next films. i read the first 3 books when they were first out and was looking forward to this film remembering that i enjoyed the story. I think the choice of getting in the new director was a masterstroke, although the first two films were aimed towards the younger audience this one was less predictable and far more entertaining. Without initially realising it director Cuarón was involved with both Y tu mama tambien and Great expectations(or which i enjoy both), i was still keen to look up what he had done previously.i thought this movie was well worth watching and was entertaining for those of all ages, and i don't mean that in the same way as monsters inc. which people say its suitable for all but is only really suitable for kids and simple adults. Its got unpredictable twists and luckily the numerous deus ex machina's take on believable explanations due to a twist!in a fantasy world of werewolves, wizards and witchcraft the main characters take on more adult attributes and work together to protect Harry from the ghosts of his past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until Goblet of Fire came out, this was my favorite of the movie series. The visual effects and scenery are magnificent (especially when Harry's riding Buckbeak), and the music fits this description as well. Some people say that John Williams' music is trite, but he wins my vote in this film. I think it's interesting how he helps evolve Harry's character from a wide-eyed child in the Sorceror's Stone to an adolescent determined to make something of himself. What disappointed me: They left out a couple of parts that I would love to have seen, such as when Harry hexes Malfoy and his group (thinking they're dementors). And of course, before that, the firebolt. They should have put that in the middle of the movie, where it belonged in the book; then the Malfoy scene would work. And it also would have been fun to see Gryffindor's Quidditch victory. But other than the above mentioned...this one is a triumph. I don't expect any movie to follow the book word for word, and it'd be boring if it were done that way. Kudos to Cuaron.</fullReview>

I think this is the best out of all the films to date. Alfonso Cuaron is a fabulous director! I think the change in vision from Chris Columbus' pumped fresh energy into the story of the young wizard's trials at Hogwarts. I especially loved the motif of time that appeared consistently throughout the films. The images of the Whomping Willow throughout the seasons and the repeated use of clocks and ticking noises were a great touch! I really feel that Cuaron was especially tuned in to the spirit of the story, and that spirit definitely comes through in the movie.

		<shortDescription>not the best, but the most well done all around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where it's sequels and prequels lack, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is better. Unfortunately, it doesn't match up to 'Chamber's' excellent suspense and story, and the action is nowhere near 'Goblet'. But what you do have is a well rounded and fun flick for the whole family. Filled with a stellar cast and a great coming of age story, Harry Potter 3 is a real winner.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe has certainly grown) is now 13 years old, and preparing for his third year at Hogwarts with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). After a weird series of events, Harry finds out that a serial murderer and former Voldemort supporter, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), is out of the wizard prison Azkaban and has his eye set on his next target: Harry.The cast is excellent, but the first notable change is the fact that Dumbledore is new. Richard Harris passed away around the same time that HP2 came out in theaters, so Michael Gambon has taken over the role. He is simply adequate, because he lacks the fatherly affection that Harris had perfected in the 2 movies previously. The trio has certainly grown up, both physically and in terms of skill. As usual, the best is Rupert Grint's Ron, who is terribly adapted here. Most of Ron's lines in the book are said by Hermione, which is not fair to Rupert. Emma Watson is nice as Hermione, and her character has more mystery to her this year, more than ever. You'll like Hermione, but not as much as the boys. Dan Radcliffe is good as Harry, and this is definitely his best film playing the boy who lived. His only bad scene is the emotional scene, but he was only 14 when he made this, so I can let it slide. He gives us what we've been looking for in Harry: a hero. Harry is a hero in this film, no doubt about it. The rest of the cast is perfect. The new Defense teacher, Remus Lupin, is one of my favorite characters in the books, and I must say that David Thewlis nails the part very well. I love him as Lupin, the friend to Harry's father, and the calm and intelligent teacher. Alan Rickman is wonderful as Snape as usual, providing that mystery that makes his character so intriguing. The last cast member I'll review is Gary Oldman's Sirius Black. I can't do too much without ruining the plot, so I'll just say that Gary does typical Gary things here, which is great.The film's direction is its strongpoint, as Alfonso Cuaron directs it much better than Columbus or Newell did in the other films. He totally reverses what we're used to in the Potter world, and makes the characters like they should be: teens who don't care about uniforms. Good music and costuming as well make this an enjoyable watch. Steve Kloves...well...he's not that good of an adapter, but I have to say that this is his second best job to date, as his best would be Sorcerer's Stone. Overall, the animation is good, the music and costumes are good, the writing is above average, the acting is superb, and the direction is superb. Harry Potter 3 is a great threequel that does a good job of helping Harry grow up.8/10 --spy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this movie - of the 4 this is the one i can put in and enjoy over and over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have not read the book you may not understand a couple of items, but you won't really notice them or think about them for long, if at all (ie. the stag, etc.). If you have read the books you must separate movie from book. Hey, I'm a Lord of the Rings fanatic and am completely able to LET GO of the many areas of lost content that leave most of the story unexplained and just ENJOY THE MOVIE. Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the 4 - the first two were just too childish and sort of lame to enjoy if you are over 14, and the 4th was inexplicably odd - I have no idea why the characters whined so much and had inner fighting for no apparent reason and it was too dark and depressing, leaving nothing at the end to really care about - ie. why would i want to watch these characters again? Azkaban is a great time - much improved acting, great characters, engaging story - this is the HP that made me actually care about the characters, especially Harry, and the more I watch it the more moving and interesting it gets. Class act movie great for 10 - 99 year olds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before anybody reads this, I want you all to know that I have read all of the Harry Potter books, and I am a fan of each and every one of them. Saying that, I'd like to express how much of a fan I am of this movie. I must confess that I was a little disappointed that the explanation of Harry's patronus and how it relates to the Marauder's Map was left out, but everything else about this movie made up for it. The music, special effects, acting, scenery, and surprisingly dark and stylish cinematography are all high points of this film. The book is something else, but this movie stands out on its own. I was so astonished and excited on how different this film was from the others, and I think that a change in director was very necessary, and it worked out fantastic. I am an avid fan of both books and movies and their adaptations, and I am able to view a film separate from it's book. This is a brilliant film and I still find it very enjoyable while being a fan of the book as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This potter film i believe went downhill from the first two. I believe that warner brothers should have never changed directors. I had many problems with this installment. Me being a Potter fan myself i had an idea about what this film would look like. I am sad to say that many portions of the film were not only done wrong but out of time sequence, there was also a lot of things missing from this film that could have been done if other minor parts were left out.Though i did enjoy the special effects and the characters, i felt that there wasn't enough time in each scene to digest what was really happening in the story. I think you would really only understand what was going on if you had actually read any of the books. I think many people would agree that even the look of this film was different then the previous films. Its understandable that because directors were changed things would be different, but certain things i believed went to far.I gave this film the ranking that i did because like i said before i am a potter fan and i still stand behind the books and the films no matter how bad or good they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A healthy blend of fantasy and suspense in an easily manipulative world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With two Harry Potter films firmly under the belt and many other books, the phenomenon that is Harry Potter is easy to recognise and will stick with generations to come, but how does this film match up against two other reasonably successful films? Surely the curse of the sequel has to strike sooner or later. Not necessarily.Chris Columbus is something of an auteur when it comes to family films given the fact 'Home Alone' (1990) and 'Mrs. Doubtfire' (1993) are two easily recognisable films when it comes to the genre and the first two Harry Potter films were a healthy way in which to introduce the series. This third one takes it up a level.Oddly enough, the film starts rather blandly, almost randomly, and it takes a while to get to grips with the world of the film and in which the characters live in. This may be easier for others depending on your taste in film and knowledge of Harry Potter though. We're given a rather ridiculous and unfunny introduction to Harry Potter at home during the summer and the reminder of the cruel setting of which he lives. Everything here seems a little too forced and it's as if it's mandatory that we are told, once again, Harry isn't happy at home. It's unnecessary.Once the film gets going, we are thrown into the world of magic and of Hogwarts, the superb setting for the film. The fantasy element is amazing and it's easily to get lost in. This is clever as you need your brain active for this film in order to follow the plot's twists and the time travel element when they arrive but at the same time, there's no shame to just simply relax and let Hogwarts take you wherever and engross you with it's entertaining quips that it has. Some techniques that I'm a big fan of in this film is the one used really early on which sets up an uncomfortable feeling you have throughout the film. Here, the example is when our three heroes are on the train and dialogue is used to build up a disturbing and uncomfortable feeling for characters know as 'dementors'. This is done, as I said, early on in the film and sets the scene brilliantly as the threat of them is there throughout and we know what they're capable of and what a threat they are. The technique is also used with Sirius Black's character.Following on from this dialogue technique, the use of a rather disturbing and eerie scene so early on and so soon after the dialogue is another good way of making an effective film. We are told of the beings and then suddenly, we are confronted by one and we're left with the feeling if 'Hold on, this is too soon! I need more time to digest this stuff!' Clever film-making.This happens through out the film and the timing and placing of the horror, the fantasy and the comedy, which has a couple of reoccurring jokes, is very welcome and very well done. It makes the film so much more clean and well put together. There's also a very pleasant feeling of ambiguity flowing throughout up until round about the start of the last act which keeps everything very mysterious and suspenseful. This, along with my last point, keeps the film going beautifully.Apart from a bit of 'poker faced' acting from the heroes, nobody else puts a foot wrong in the acting department and one thing I didn't like was the confusing way in which suddenly everything is un ravelled following a plot turn. Although I'm alien to the book's content, it didn't work well for me and had to have it explained afterwards.Don't be put off seeing this film, as it is enjoyable with a nice blend of almost everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the best Harry Potter. Here are a couple of reasons, well first, they took out way too many scenes, second, they arranged them in totally different orders and changed the whole story. I agree with some of these comments, because they should get a Director that actually READ the book. Not a Director who just gets the main plot and changes the whole book. The first Harry Potter was far more better than this one because that one at least GOES with the book. All the Harry Potter movies are always missing something very important. In this one, they took out the other Quiddich Match. That's where he ACTUALLY got his Firebolt and beat Ravenclaw. Oh, and they shouldn't change the scenery, that wasn't so smart because everything looks all different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a good film overall. The scenes would occasionally stray away from the book, but heck, remember the Shining? An excellent film, sometimes completely different from Stephen King's version. I'd give the shining 8/10. It was important to show the relationship between Harry and Remus Lupin as the movie did. The trio of friends has grown as well! This probably makes the film more popular for the youngsters! :-D Anyway, the hipogriff was cool. Like I said before, it was a pretty good movie! I just had one problem, I just HATED Gary Oldman as Sirius. I wanted Sirius Black to be at least SOMEWHAT handsome! A charming film, really.

		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/2004/***1/2Main Stars: Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint Emma Watson David Thewlis Gary OldmanOnce again the magic of J.K. Rowling and the magic of film combine together to make another amazing Harry Potter film to be released in the theaters. The first two are still the best to let human eyes set upon. But, as usual, we wait for another Harry Potter film to beat the first two; yet still it has not come but it can still be possible because I've read all the Potter books and the fifth and sixth seem to be tied with impressiveness. The sixth has the best beginning. The fifth and sixth have the best middles. And the fifth has the best end. I would have to say all of Rowling's books are impressive and deeply interesting in, at least, most of the parts. So the third movie is finally released in theaters. I'm excited to see this one because it looked like the best one from what the previews showed. It wasn't the best but I was deeply immersed in the story. As usual, this Potter film had another major storyline behind it. The evil and crazy Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison and is the first to do it. This causes tensions and worries throughout not only Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry but throughout all of London. Everyone's on the lookout for the supposed lunatic. Harry has a discussion with Mr. Weasley (Ron's dad) about Sirius Black and that Harry should keep a look out for the man. He tells Harry very firmly to not go looking for Black because he wants to kill him and Harry answers, "Why would I go after a man who wants to kill me?" You could see that Harry did not solemnly swear to not go looking for him. He actually wanted to after what information he overheard Professor McGonagall, Madam Rosmerta and Cornelius Fudge talking about in an upstairs room of Rosmerta's pub. But before this Professor Dumbledore (replaced by the gruff Michael Gambon) had warned each and every one of the Hogwarts students to be very cautious and said that dementors would be guarding the school. He said not to go near these creatures. They're very dangerous. And it turns out they were. School matters were mixed in with Sirius/dementor matters like the Quidditch Final. This turned out not to be like it was planned. However, school matters seem to wane when the film gets closer and closer to the dramatic ending which reveals many answers that refer to people's suspicious questions. Professor Remus Lupin caused a bit of uneasiness. As did Scabbers, Ron's rat. Harry, Ron and Hermione were the first to investigate. During the intense and adventurous scenes, John Williams was really going crazy with his orchestra to try to catch the moment. I have to say, he succeeded in doing it because William's music was definitely the most pronounced in this film especially during the parts with Sirius and Lupin and the rest of the gang and, of course, Quidditch. So if you haven't seen this very well done, dark and intense film yet, which I highly doubt, buy it (DO NOT RENT IT BUT BUY IT!) on DVD or VHS. But you should think of getting it on DVD. I enjoy it better at home because I saw it in the theaters the first day it came out. It wasn't very fun. We were supposed to go to an early showing. However, there was an idiotic woman in front of us in the ticket line fiddling with her purse. So it was SOLD OUT after five minutes. So, an hour and a half later, we see a later showing and we went inside the theater passing by two security guards with real guns in their pockets. I know the Potter films are popular but securing a theater so no one comes in without a ticket which only cost a maximum of ten dollars is pretty pathetic to me. And I just hope that purse woman had a bad dinner that evening if she had dinner at all. Movie directed by Alfonso Cuarón.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feat of movie making that continues an outstanding series of films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter is a phenomenon. The books and the films, although I haven't yet read the books. I am convinced that one of the reasons behind the success of these films is that they are the only enormous epic adventures made for kids that don't make them feel like kids. Sure Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks CRANK out the huge films but they are cartoons and made with kids in mind. The Harry Potter series (especially the last two installments) including Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban gives children and adults who love fantasy a very serious epic with no holds barred, it doesn't feel toned down or edited for content but rather very real and intense and scary at times, exciting, masterful, and brilliant. Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón takes the helm from director Chris Columbus and gives the series a serious boost in maturity which it definitely needed. Harry is older, his friends are older, the story is darker and his fans watching it have aged too quite likely. Cuarón gives it exactly the dark edge it needs. There is no doubt he is a far more mature director and perhaps even too dark himself to take on a children's movie such as this but he does it and flawlessly.One of the amazing and terrific things about the Harry Potter films is the cast that always seem to return for every film so far and the addition of new characters as well. Daniel Radcliffe takes his third turn as the boy wizard Harry Potter and nails it home once again. Radcliffe was absolutely BORN for this role. He might get typecast for the rest of his life but he should be blown away by his accomplishment of embodying a literary legend such as Harry Potter. His intensity, sadness, power, hidden talents all shine through and no one else could nail the part like he does. Rupert Grint also returns as Harry's best friend, the terminally nervous and jittery Ron Weasley. His role seemed to be slightly less in Prisoner of Azkaban and that might be perhaps because his role is comedic at times and takes a bit away from the edge of the dark tone of the film. Still he does a terrific job and really nails his role as well. The third in the trio is the terrific Emma Watson. I wish she would do something else in films because I think she is extremely talented. Her performance as Hermione Granger not only gives young girls someone to root for but really puts a bite into the story. She's feisty, strong, easily stands up to the testosterone driven cast and she's fantastic. Veteran actor Michael Gambon graciously and flawlessly takes over the role of headmaster Albus Dumbledore from the late, great Richard Harris. Not only does Gambon look the part (kudos to the make-up and costume teams) but he does such an incredible job and performing the role exactly the way Harris did. A strong, mysterious, caring, powerful wizard. You don't even notice the switch between actors which truly is great compliment to not only Richard Harris but Gambon as well. Robbie Coltrane returns in one of my favorite roles as Hagrid, a loving, caring giant of a man whom the kids always turn to in trouble. Now a professor Hagrid doesn't get a whole lot screen time but still shines when he's on there. Coltrane embodies the character like the rest of the them. Alan Rickman returns as Snape, the professor everyone loves to hate. Rickman doesn't get a lot of screen time either but Snape is a great character and Rickman is perfect for it. The two big additions to the cast are David Thewlis as Harry's new found mentor Remus Lupin. Thewlis fits right in and has great chemistry opposite Harry Potter alumni especially Daniel Radcliffe. And Gary Oldman who until recently I have never been a fan of. I always found him rather dry and boring, and always confused him with John Malkovich for some reason?? But Oldman does a terrific job and is barely recognizable as the misunderstood Prisoner Sirius Black. He is convincing as being a terrible murderer but easily switches to being misunderstood and cared for by the audience as well as Harry.There are so many brilliant things about The Harry Potter series. I happen to think just now with the third and fourth installment the series is really taking off. Prisoner of Azkaban is an easy 10/10 and Goblet of Fire was EVEN BETTER!! a 10+/10. For a film series to get better three or four films in is a rarity especially this incredible!! The special effects are far beyond special effects. They create this incredible world at Hogwarths and beyond that just sucks you in and makes you a part of it and makes your imagination come alive. The beautifully created creatures such as the incredible Buckbeak, and the trees that come alive, the castle, the school, the magic...everything just falls into place and creates this epic with children in mind but so brilliantly done that every single person can adore it!! Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is brilliance unprecedented in film history. You must see this installment!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i was one of those readers who fell into the magic of hogwarts and loved the childish scenes portrayed in the first two movies. The quiddich scenes, the jovial music and overall juvenile feeling made those first two movies special. Now, with the third movie and a different director, you can expect a very different story. Apparently harry isn't a kid anymore because we aren't allowed to enjoy the movies like we enjoyed the books. not only is there a totally different feel, but the actions in the movie are jittery and some scenes are almost scary. The third movie completely changed the way hogwarts looks and how the grounds look. The new castle has this feeling of darkness, not the overwhelming happiness that harry originally felt by coming to hogwarts. I have seen the movie a few times since the first viewing, and i will admit it has grown on me. The new style is definitely an art, and should be respected. It is just sad to me that the magic of hogwarts will never appear the same..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PRISONER OF AZKABAN : Stylistically Superior, Though The Storyline Underwhelms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HARRY POTTER &amp; THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN The third installment of the Harry Potter franchise represented a re-birth of sorts for the series b/c new creative blood was brought in. Alfonso Cuaron took over the director's chair from Christopher Columbus... resulting in the first Harry Potter "film", as opposed to the Harry Potter "movies" we'd seen already.With the new vision of Cuaron, the movie feels more magical and real. Columbus' films seemed to always pull back and capture Hogwarts on a grand, blockbuster scale. Any moment that called for special effects or some sort of magic, Christopher Columbus seems to fall to the predictable conclusion of tacking on special effects. In this film however, Cuaron finds a way to capture some of Hogwart's magic on a very personal, simplistic scale... and as a result it resonates in a much stronger way. For example, when a character turns into a werewolf at the very end (a scene that Colubmus would have filmed from a distance capturing the special effects) chooses to zoom in on the eye and have the transformation start there. It's a simple choice... however it is that kind of bold decision making that Columbus lacked in the first 2 films.PRISONER OF AZKABAN tells the story of Harry's 3rd year at Hogwarts. When he arrives he discovers that Sirius Black, the man who killed his parents, is the first person to ever escape from Azkaban prison... and he is now out to kill Harry Potter. Do to the danger, Hogwarts is protected by Azkaban's guards... the Dementors... and the staff is on high alert. However, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermoine can not help but investigate the story behind Sirius Black and what they find isn't what the expected.As I've said already, the main strengths of this film lie in the direction of Alfonso Cuaron. Also enjoyable is the addition of David Thewlis and Gary Oldman as Prof. Lupin and Sirius Black. Their camaraderie especially in the final moments of the film is very compelling.Despite the film's superior direction, it still lags at points in the middle. This section spends a lot of time giving the younger actors and their characters more depth... exploring the tension Harry feels towards his parents' murdered, exploring Hermoine's situation as a Muggle. What hurts this section so much is that the young actors just don't deliver. While the performances were merely aspects of the spectacle in the earlier films... here, thanks to Cuaron's more introspective eye, the performances become more vital. Unfortunately, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry and Emma Watson as Hermoine don't seem quite ready to play the scenes as naturally and realistically as they should be.Also, the storyline of PRISONER OF AZKABAN doesn't feel as complete as the earlier two films. AZKABAN works much better then the other two in terms of developing character and getting the ball rolling for more compelling films later in the series... however as a film it doesn't stand on it's own quite as well as the others.Despite that fact, HARRY POTTER &amp; THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is still a highly entertaining film. And once the action really gets rolling near the films climax it get really good. In the end, thanks to Cuaron, AZKABAN is a great improvement stylistically over the other films and a great transition into the next films.... B+ ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Darker, More Mature Potter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Chris Columbus did do his job making worthy adaptations of the first two Potter films and had the loyalty of fans of the book (myself included) they lacked much, entertainment being one of the biggest, as they felt more like a vision with people talking from the book rather than an actual movie. But the Harry Potter series has now met Alfonso Cauron, who proves to not only manage to give the Harry Potter series some much needed spunk and maturity, but also proves to make it a good movie on its own merits.Part what makes Prisoner of Azkaban such an improvement over its predecessors is that the young actors seem to have gotten the space they needed. It's hard to get young actors/actresses to get a particular role right and still make them feel comfortable with their career, but Cauron seems to have taken pressure off of Radcliffe, Grint and Watson's shoulders. The older performers in the movie are also given time to let the audience get acquainted with who they are.Prisoner of Azkaban is also much darker and mature but also more humorous than the previous installments. The mood of the story and movie not only looks dark but also feels dark and it helps to reflect on the younger roles of the movie by making them seem all the more mature. But even with this, the movie manages to crack a few jokes to make the viewer get a chuckle or two here and there and it helps to provide a brief relief from the seriousness from the film, and a little humor never hurt anyone right? But most of all, this third installment proves to be far more entertaining above all. Unlike Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, which felt much like a bunch of actors and actresses efficiently speaking word-for-word from the book , Prisoner of Azkaban liberates itself from the book but manages to keep much of the sufficient details from it in the movie and in the end it pays off as a much more fun to watch movie.Serious Harry Potter fans might feel somewhat betrayed by Prisoner of Azkaban and how it shares only the main plot details from the book, but casual movie goers will find a tasty and ultimately satisfying treat in it.</fullReview>

I didn't really want to see it again. I wasn't sure why, I knew I liked the movie, perhaps it was because I had seen this not too long ago. But nevertheless, I started to watch it again. About half way through, it dawned on me why I wasn't too thrilled to see this again.The Dementors. Seriously, those things scared the WILLIES out of me. Something that sucks your soul out? Nuh-uh.

This time Harry must come face to face with the man who possibly killed his parents! I liked this one (except for the Dementors EEK!) I found it fitfully amusing that David Thewlis, Gary Oldman AND Alan Rickman all threaten each other with sticks, (Let me repeat, Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman have it out in a HARRY POTTER MOVIE) and all the kids are great as usual.Great stuff!

		<fullReview>First of all I would like to say that I really enjoy the Harry Potter movies although there are some things that need attention I thought that in Harry Potter 1, 2 and 3 Daniel Radcliffe's acting really spoiled the film because once you notice it, it's all you can think about and the bad thing about bad acting is that you really do notice it.Thankfully the acting in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire improved greatly. I heard that Daniel Radcliffe actually had to have acting lessons for 'the Goblet of Fire' because otherwise the director wouldn't direct the movie. I do like the fact that this movie is so similar to the book although naturally a few things had to be cut out and sometimes it doesn't completely fit so it's a necessity to have read the book. I love the setting and I'm glad that this movie had become a bit more 'grown-up'. The performances of Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are really good. All in all it's not my favourite Harry Potter flick but I sure think it's worth seeing. However, with most films based on books, read the book first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best in the series so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite one in the Harry Potter series. Now that he's aged more, you can take this movie seriously.I so far went to go see all of the Harry Potter movies in theaters. The first one was good, the second was better, and this one was pure magic. I remember when I went to this one, the line at the movie theater reached to the end of the building. This was a really popular one. Luckily I arrived early, and had to wait only about an hour.If you want a good movie to see, I encourage you to rent this movie. Most of you will probably buy it after. I would give this movie 10 stars anyday 10 stars out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Wicked This Way Comes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter (Danielle Radcliffe), Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) have returned to their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And yet again, Harry's life seems to be in great danger from Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a prisoner who has most recently escaped from Azkaban in order to kill Harry for He-who-must-not-be-named. It also seems that the school has become under the protection of hundreds of Dementors from Azkaban. Soon Harry realizes that things may not go as they planned for him or his friends either.Director Chris Columbus does a fantastic job in portraying this movie from J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban." Also along with the actors who has portrayed these characters to the best of their abilities. Although, it may not portray the book in the exact order of events, but it does indeed give the story fluidity and meaning like Harry Potter has never seen before.The movie does not go along with the book that it is based on, and skips on a lot of major details which is explained in the book. Yet the film does give the book meaning as it deserves. The director could have done a better job on the special effects shown in the movie, especially with the werewolf. The graphics on the werewolf aren't as up to as it should be. Other than that, it was an excellent movie nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The screenplay writer's one-page summary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been said that the new director, Alfonso Cuaron asked the young stars to go away and write an essay on their characters. Emma Watson came back with a 16-page(!) essay on Hermione, Daniel Radcliffe, a 1-page summary on Harry and Rupert Grint didn't even bother handing his in. The point of mentioning this? Well, the film feels as though Cuaron had also asked the screenplay writer to do the same thing with the book and this film is his 1-page summary.Firstly, I need to point out that I have not yet finished reading Prisoner of Azkaban ? I'm only half-way through it, but from what I have managed to read, around 80% of it has been omitted from the film. With that in mind, I will try not draw too many comparisons between the two, but will try to focus mainly on the film itself.The locations are atmospheric although changes to the layout of Hogwarts seem to confuse rather than enhance the viewing experience. Daniel, Emma and Rupert seem completely comfortable in their roles as Harry, Hermione and Ron, and once again are backed by an extremely talented cast comprising of regulars, Robbie Coltraine (Hagrid), Alan Rickman (Snape), Maggie Smith (McGonagall), Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon) and Fiona Shaw (Aunt Petunia), as well as newcomers to the series Gary Oldman (Sirius Black), David Thewlis (Remus Lupin) and one I probably should've easily recognised were it not for those thick glasses, Emma Thompson (Professor Trelawney). Contrary to what a few commentators have said, Michael Gambon made a fine Dumbledore given the circumstances.Sadly, despite the strong cast, the screenplay is somewhat weak. The film seems to jump back and forth to events with no consistency (Quidditch, for instance was a major event in the book this time around because it was to be Oliver Wood's last attempt to take the Gryffindor team to the top before he left Hogwarts for good, but it's just about squeezed in with little purpose in the film, except to show Harry coming face to face with the Dementors again); Lupin is asked if he's been taking his potion before turning into a werewolf (this would make no sense to viewers of the film as there were no other references to the potion), and the time-travel sequence at the end of the film feels more complicated and pointless than it needed to be. Characters that played an important role in the previous film (i.e. Ginny) are reduced to just brief appearances and often without saying anything at all, and entire events once again find themselves left on the cutting room floor. Also, there are moments that just seem to drag on, for no reason at all.Perhaps the most immediate thing any follower of the Harry Potter series will have noticed is how dark this film is. Harry, although more mature is a lot more confrontational and rebellious; the Dementors really can send a shiver down your spine at times; Buckbeak's execution, Trelawney's spirit possession and immediately near the start of the film, the presence of the dark and mysterious Grim who Harry sees immediately before the Knight Bus turns up adds to a film that tries to portray a sense of growing maturity and the realisation that the wider world really is full of danger. It's no Batman Begins, but the darkness the film portrays is a pretty welcome direction that drags the viewer from the safer and more pleasant worlds of the previous two films.It's the whole coming of age theme that Cuaron had probably pushed most though the growing maturity of the three main characters. Harry, as we already know is a lot more confrontational. Hermione, too exhibits moments where she can certainly defend herself from the likes of Draco Malfoy (with a painful reminder he won't forget in a hurry!), and Ron finally becomes less of a sidekick and more of an equal in the "team". There are moments where it seems that Ron and Hermione actually find themselves being attracted to each other, but Ron's awkward approach to these things tend to be comical and work to good effect.Having said that, some of the humour that we would expect to find in a Harry Potter film just isn't there. Without doubt, much of the dialogue has been re-written for the film, and some of the in-jokes lost along the way. Some of the jokes that remained had no meaning because the corresponding event or conversation had been omitted earlier on in the screenplay.It's difficult to say how future films will turn out. It would be a bold statement to say that Prisoner of Azkaban marks the point where the films and books go their separate ways because I have not finished reading Prisoner of Azkaban, nor have I seen Goblet of Fire, but certainly reading around IMDb, it would appear that this was becoming the case.Considering how much has been stripped out of the first half of the book (against the first 20 minutes of the film it seems), it would probably be a safe bet that fans of the books will continue to be disappointed with the big screen offerings, whilst newcomers to the Harry Potter films will continue to be mesmerised.Sadly, Prisoner of Azkaban has probably been the weakest Harry Potter film offering so far. Not because of the performances given by the cast, and not because of the special effects and atmospheric setting that are used to good effect, but simply because the screenplay omits too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Days For Harry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to admit something here that I probably shouldn't: I haven't read ANY of the books in the HARRY POTTER series (don't hurt me!) It might be because everyone says "Oh you just HAVE to read this!" that puts me off. I'm not the type of person to follow all the lemmings over the cliff. I tend to enjoy more obscure stuff. But I digress...What I don't mind doing, though, is watching cinema and I've thus far seen all of the "Potter films." And this one I found to be quite different. Although the second in the series (THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, 2002) was pretty dark, it pales (brightens?) in comparison to this third installment.Harry is breaking the rules and barely getting away with it. He's using his powers outside of school and in general muggles population (he causes a relative to inflate to great size and drift away). And when he can no longer stand staying with his aunt and uncle, Harry decides to leave and seek refuge in the outside world. The trouble, though, is that a dark creature seems to be stalking him. Was that a wolf peering at Harry through the brush? Eventually Harry makes it back to Hogwarts and discovers that a psycho prisoner ? Sirius Black, played by the wonderful Gary Oldman (BATMAN BEGINS, 2005) ? has escaped his cage and may be stalking him. Was Sirius responsible in some way for Harry's parents' death? Dementos, dark specters that resemble wraiths, are assigned to the perimeter of Hogwarts and Harry has some very uneasy feelings about them. They seem inordinately interested in him, too.With the help of Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) Harry is led down a dark path, a path believed to contain the secret to his mother's and father's death.Friends and enemies are often intertwined within the same characters as this third story unravels. Director Alfonso Cuaron (Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, 2001) gives some excellent direction to a film that could've easily gotten out of control. With the multiple twists and turns (i.e., time travel, werewolf friends, etc.) this film flowed smoothly and was packed with angst and action.The special effects (specifically the early bus ride) are pulled off nicely and give a slight sense of the whimsical without going overboard. But the previously mentioned wraith-like Dementos are pretty creepy and could easily freak-out children under 12 years old (so be careful, parents.) Again, not having read any of the books in this series, I have no idea where the storyline is going. But things tend to be darkest before the storm (forgive the cliché), then they clear. So my assumption is that things will come to a head very soon for Harry and his Hogwart friends. Darn! I might have to pick up one of the novels now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent although flawed - contains spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent adaptation, with the necessary darker feel to it from the first two films. The cast keeps improving with each film, although Daniel Radcliffe still struggled with the emotional outbursts - "He was their friend and he betrayed them" a little cringe-making. Also, Draco was far too afraid too quickly of Hermione in the fight scene - good punch though. I don't think this was a fault in the actor, but rather a fault in the direction.Most of the film was a joy - I especially liked the change of location - Scotland has never been more beautiful. The look of the film was definitely an improvement on the earlier ones, enjoyable though they were. More excellent performances from the adults but sadly the teachers still didn't have enough to do. I would have preferred a little more of Snape that's for sure - Alan Rickman is always watchable. The main flaw shared by the first two films was too slow a pace and too many schmalzy scenes with the three leads grinning at each other and giving long looks to camera. This has all gone (thankfully). Also, the plot was a lot pacier and exciting. David Thewlis made an excellent Lupin although it might have been nice to see a little more of Snape's hatred for him and why - especially as there is some clue as to why he hates Harry so much. There were hints of "just like your father" but no explanation as to how awful James Potter and Sirius Black had been to Snape during their youth. Also, although I greatly enjoyed the look of the film, I was rather sad that the kids were not in their robes. It is often commented in the books that Wizards don't know how to dress in muggle clothing and tend to look odd, even when not in robes. The fact that they all dressed normally tended to make a nonsense of this.The PoA, even though very enjoyable, had SERIOUS plot holes (no explanation as to the identities of the authors of the Marauder's Map - "Moony (Lupin), Wormtail (well we know that one now), Padfoot (Sirius Black) and Prongs (James Potter, Harry's Dad) or of why they had these nicknames (they were all animaguses (animagi?) apart from Lupin and had all trained to become one out of deep friendship so that Lupin would not be alone when he was in his werewolf stage) and these were descriptions of their animal identities - Prongs was a stag padfoot the black dog and wormtail the rat) and, consequently, no explanation as to why Harry's Patronus was a stag (like James Potter as Prongs) or why this was the main reason he thought his dad had summoned the patronus to save them). This was the worst plot hole imaginable in what was otherwise an excellent third film. These quibbles aside - a truly enjoyable film of what is still my favourite book. - Not as good as Goblet of Fire though!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say, I cannot understand those who say this one is the best of the Harry Potters. To me, it is clearly my least favorite. I don't understand, really, how anyone can want *less*. And this is less in every way.What, exactly, is wrong with being faithful to the books? They are GOOD books! I can understand cutting some things for time, but really - how can you leave out all of the relationships with Harry's parents? How can you leave out who made the map? I've read the books, but a friend of mine did not, and is going *only* by the movies. She was completely confused by this lack, which IMO should have been in the movie.It's not like this one was running three hours, so let's cut. It barely made two. And honestly, the one that went long - the second one - is my favorite to date. I am hoping the next one (I see it Friday) will be better than this one, and back to up to the first two's standards.Why did I dislike this one? Firstly, it was a GREAT shock to me to find this was actually about becoming a teenager. When I read it, it seemed to be about Harry's family background, and his parents' old friends. These books are very well written, with puzzle pieces all coming together, and this one was especially fun in that way. I read it to my son, who had NO idea of the surprises that came out at the end. Yes, the Scabbers surprise was still in the movie, but Peter Pettigrew was merely explained as a kid who followed Sirius Black around all the time. We needed to know about Moony, Padfoot, Prongs and Wormtail. It was vital. Magazines I've read have pointed out that some things can be cut without taking from the story, and some things cannot - and the author of the article (I believe he was the guy with the Harry Potter Lexicon) was specifically writing about this cut.Next, I really did not like that they changed the grounds of Hogwarts. I know they had to recast Dumbledore, and for the most part I am okay with that (I had wanted Richard Briers, who would have brought more humor to it, I think. More of the, say a few words: Idiot! Pumpkin! sort of thing from the books), but changing how the place looks suddenly is a little unnerving. If it had to be done, it should have been more subtle. It's almost like starting from scratch this way.Reading reviews of Goblet of Fire, most said they thought it to be the best of all the Harry Potter movies, but one said no, Azkaban is best. I cannot agree. I will watch it, and enjoy bits of it, but overall I was unsatisfied at the time, and eager to be on with the others the minute it was over (which, to me, was too soon). Of the ones up to Goblet, I will re watch Chamber of Secrets more often that the others, but something tells me, with Ralph Fiennes playing Voldemort, that from Goblet on I won't be looking back!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed in the portrayal of Dumbledore by Gambon. Richard Harris brought dignity and a sense of stature to the role , mainly thru his wardrobe. A wizard in his position should be dressed in grandeur, not in what looks like a night robe and skullcap as portrayed by Gambon. I don't think he changed his clothed once in the movie where Harris had many different robes and hats (all wizard approved). And his dirty fingernails...yuck! He must also use "just for men" to remove his white hair and make it gray! Peter O'Toole would have been a better choice and wished those involved would have listened to Harris' family on this matter. From what I see of the previews of the Goblet of Fire, his attire and bathing habits have not changed. D.L.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cuaron covered the basis of the story well and included some good foreshadowing but in reality I believe this movie should only get 6/10. Key plot points were dropped out of the movie or put where they ruined some plot points. In the movie Cuaron has Harry receiving the Firebolt from Sirius at the end of the term. While in the book the broom was received at Christmas to where Harry could continue with quidditch but Hermione told McGonagall who confiscated the broom, due to this Ron and Hermione got into a fight. Now I think getting this in the correct sequence is just as important as foreshadowing because we know that friends who like each other do get into fights over dumb and not so dumb things. Although I did love the dementors and Buckbeak, both were awesome uses of CGI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply magical! The best Harry Potter movie yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to begin by saying that I am not generally a backwards person but to all you Harry Potter fans out there who got into the movies by first reading the books I may appear rather strange because I got into the books many years after being a fan of the movies! I must admit that I was never able to get into Harry Potter until the release of The Order of the Pheonix, I didn't even know much about the books until I brought the third instalment The Prisoner of Azkaban. Obviously I had a vague idea that Harry Potter existed because I had been to see the first film and thought it was quite good but nothing to get too exited about... or so I thought. All I knew at that time was that I couldn't get into the series so why should I bother? Well how wrong was I? I can't remember exactly how I finally got into the books, I think it was something that just gradually crept up on me but after reading Order of the Pheonox I got into it so much that I read the books backwards! Thats right... backwards, and oh how confusing that was, and yet oh how fantastic and enjoyable! Well reading over this I must admit that so far I don't seem to have said a great deal about the film do I? Well lets start by saying that not only is Azkaban my favourite film but it is also my favourite book of the trilogy. I have read it over and over again and I never seem to tire of it. Lupin is great and by far my favourite character! David Thewlis was (in my opinion) simply made for the part! This movie far exceeds the other two! The character of Sirius Black is really brought to life in this movie! The magic of it is that he appears genuinely evil at the start (even though we all know he's not) but by the end we all realise him to be a helpless victim of the murderous so called friend of James and Lily Potter Wormtail. Call me a woos but I must admit that I did cry at the end scene between Sirius and Harry and again between Lupin and Harry. They are both such amazing characters and the actors are all amazing especially Alan Rickman who has played Snape with what appears to be such an understanding of the character from the beginning that to many fans I think it is safe to presume that he is the Severus Snape! This movie is definitely a 10/10. Simply magical!!!!!</fullReview>

I especially liked this movie because, the timeturner was cooler because when they went back, it so happened that some of the things that happened in the original time, happened because they were there in past time, like the rock hitting harry in the head, and hermione threw it, but when they were traveling.

		<fullReview>The Prisoner of Azkaban tries to dazzle us with action, suspense, and special effects. These elements, I believe, take away from the character development that made the first two Harry Potter movies worth watching. This one feels a bit more like a video game than a movie, trying to cram as much excitement in as little space as possible. This is probably a great movie for children, but it fails to draw in discriminating adults the way the previous installments had. In the next installments, I can only hope the director reduces the tempo and pays more attention to the individual characters. I know this is difficult considering the length of the books they are drawing from. Nevertheless, cutting vast sections of the book's plot may make for a stronger, more intelligent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>hey everyone! my name is (they wont let me say it), great name for a girl. I was born on dec.31,1990 and i am from Pakistan ( just to let you know about my self:) OK i am a really big fan of harry potter books, i read all of them.They were all so exiting that i finished each of them in 3 days so that means i finished all of them in 18 days.the prisoner of Azkaban was great, but unfortunately i can't say the same for the movie. i mean like they didn't even show the most important parts, the visual effects were alright but they could've improved it. the movie was short and it seemed like they were rushing through the whole thing. they didn't show Snape or Tom Felton or any of the major characters we love. the new Dumbledore cant act like the old one and its creating a confusion but i will get over that. the best part in the movie was when Harry was flying with the horse-bird( cant remember all the names in the book but i think it was Hedwig but i am not sure) well anyways that part was cool. the movie was all about them switching from time to time, from the past to the future to the past it was like a part of a show, not a movie. do you all remember the sorcerers stone? now that was brilliant and awesome and exiting and fun and really really good, i miss it so much.i wish they can make all the movies like the first one.Daniel Radcliff didn't play a great role in this movie because he is supposed to be a great pal to Ron but all it looked like was that they were ignoring each other or something. i think Rupert was great. he had a great part and he played it well but the long hair in the goblet of fire gotta go i mean like it looks like his in the 60's lol but it really doesn't match his character, his kinda like a funny person with fierceness inside. Emma was good too. Snape is such a good actor and a great antagonist and he doesn't even get a good act in the movie, the only time i remember seeing him was when he stopped Harry in the forest. i hope future movies turn out to be better and more like the first one. i hope some directors or someone reads this because i am not writing this for no reason ( i got tons of homework to do) i am giving advice on how to improve a little. the movie was good but needs more characters like in the book, longer hours, the performance of the actors should be good( i should act to show you all.) anyways a person cant get everything they want. i cant wait and see how the goblet of fire is. i really really hope its good and the way i pictured it while i was reading the book. i must warn you all that hoping too much might run out of luck so don't hope and i will stop too:}. i know i wrote a lot but someone should take the time and finish reading this, its important.</fullReview>

I didn't really think the new Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) was that great, i mean his acting was all good, but his voice (which he cant change so no offence to him) his voice didn't really work with Dumbledore the character. MY favourite character was Sirius Black! and I'm a bit sad we didn't see more of him, but oh well, Gary oldman was really really good even if it wasn't really what i thought he would look like never the less he was GREAT!

		<fullReview>I am an avid Harry Potter fan, have read all the books and enjoyed them immensely. The first 2 films captured the adventure and mood that J.K.Rowling incorporated into the books. They were exciting and full of mystery and intrigue.I waited with baited breath for the third film "The Prisoner of Azkaban" expecting it to be of the same quality as the first two, only to be terribly disappointed.Prior to seeing it, all I had heard was how dark and more adult the film was and how it had added more to the story. Well all I can say is that I was badly disappointed with the whole thing.The screenplay was badly written, the direction or possibly the editing was poor, and I am inclined to think that it was more the direction. I felt that even though the individual scenes were fairly well filmed and directed, the story just had no flow. The scenes just seemed to start and end and there was no connection or continuity between them.The special effects concerning Professor Lupin's werewolf and Sirius Black's morphing in to a dog were amateur in the extreme. Lupin's werewolf reminded me very much of an old plastacine character called "Morph" that featured on Tony Hart's old BBC art programme. Black's dog looked just like a pen and ink drawing. Surely with all the money that is available for the production of a film like this it would be possible to come up with more believable special effect than this.Well at least they have dumped the last director and gone For Mike Newell, hopefully this will bring a re-think and perhaps re-introduce some of the original innocence and fun of the first two films, One lives in hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surgeon's General Warning: If you love movie 3, don't read this!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this is my favorite of the 3 so far Harry Potter movies, there are also several things I dislike about it. Let's start with the good. Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson (I really hope everyone who's reading this knows who they play but if not: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger) have totally grown into their roles. They are are amazing actors and I loved every one of their scenes--and since the movie is focused around one or all of them at all times, this was really what made the movie work for me. Also very good were Madam Rosmerta and Severus Snape. As for the bad...I'm afraid there's quite a few things. Number one being Dumbledore. I absolutely loved the Dumbledore from the first two movies. I thought he was amazing; he really embodied the character. This guy--Gambon or something?--is pathetic. I'm sorry; he's just not Dumbledore. I am especially disappointed about this because in books 4-6 Dumbledore has some great lines and I'm hoping that he won't mess them up but predicting he will. Numbers two and three are Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. Lupin was this greasy-haired, weird man; totally unlike what I imagined a friend of James Potter to be. Sirius is supposed to be handsome. And I'm a woman, guys, and...he's not. What else? Well, there were the Hippogriff, werewolf, and Dementors. The Hippogriff is supposed to be made of glorious colors. He was gray. The werewolf...well, I don't really know what a werewolf is supposed to look like, but I feel he could have been much more scary. And the dementors come in about where the new Dumbledore does. In the books, Jo says clearly, several times, that Dementors GLIDE. Didn't catch that? GLIDE, people. These dementors FLEW. ?????? Sorry? Maybe I missed something, but Dementors don't fly...that is, if this movie was really what I thought it was--an adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and not some weirdo's take on Jo's story. Their hands also looked like they were made out of strips of black garbage bags wound into some sort of hand shape. There were too many pointless scenes that could have been the funny lines Jo has written. All in all, I loved the trio, but hating mostly everything else. I would watch this if and only if you are a Harry Potter fan. As for movie 4...even critical me says WHOOHOO!!! If you've seen the theatrical trailer, I'm sure you agree. It looks outstanding! Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best book...the worst movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am almost 27 years old. A lawyer. A pianist. A computer freak. But above all, a Harry Potter maniac. And I feel proud to admit that, because, for me, the HP universe is something extremely exceptional, powerful, full of substance and every true value we hold. A whole new complicated, parallel to ours, world with a lot to teach every kid or adult, capable of making each and every one of us think and think again. The character analysis is awesome and the plot childly enjoyable but brilliantly mature. So, I'm a HP fan. And, naturally, I've read all the books (10 times each) and I've watched all the movies (20 times each!!).I loved the first movie, I had some objections about but still I enjoyed much the second one. But the third book was destined to give the best motion picture. Because it has everything in it, all the very fine ingredients to provide a great total!! Because of the Olympic Games, the movie came out in Athens in September 2004 and after a lot of irritating waiting we rushed to the cinema the very first day, full of excitement and predisposed absolutely positively. The result: THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT OF MY LIFE.THE HARDEST ONE TOO... Is that movie an "adult" movie as they baptized it?Why? Because it has nothing to do with Potter?Because it was deprived of everything that matters in the Potter universe? Because "magic" is a "childish" thing and we have to eliminate it to make a mature movie?Or the kids wearing cloaks and uniforms of Hogwarts would humiliate Cuaron's creation?And I ask all of those who have read the sixth book, how in the name of God is this little "sissy" of Cuaron's Draco going to be the person he is supposed to be in the 6th movie??? The atmosphere is changed dramatically and not because of the Dementor's presence. The Hogwarts is changed substantially too, and not because of the different location. Of all the classical British super-actors, only few remain decent and even fewer do something more than that. From all the new characters only Trelawney makes a statement-but that's because she is Ema Thompson-and Thewlis' Lupin is also something relatively memorable, while Gary Oldman's Black is not acting but absolutely overreacting, making you think whether Black was in Azkaban or in St Mungus' Hospital!!And that's definitely not Odlman's fault.Further more, the unavoidable replacement of the late Harris' Dubbledore with the Gambon's one has seemed to have a deteriorating effect on the Headmaster!He simply is...less magical, less proud, less grave, less "aristocratic", less important and less.....clean.And that's not Gambon's fault either..... The only really decent element of the movie is the artistic creation of the beasts. Hippogriff is a piece of art and Dementors exactly as anybody would picture them reading Rowling's description.Some elements of the plot - things that could not be anyway altered - also remain thrilling or sentimental or terrorizing but the question is whether all these are enough to save the movie... When, in the beginning of the movie, the Knight bus is running on the streets of London and it is IT that gets out of the way of things and not THE THINGS getting out of ITS way (like in the book), we overpass it without difficulty.But, in the end, it's all about the same thing: GET THE MAGIC OUT OF THE WAY. Deminisize it. Reduce it. Eliminate it...Or even humiliate it (see shrieking heads, the most ridiculous idea in the history of ridiculous ideas...). Cuaron is no fan of HP. He knows it. We know it.I doubt whether he has ever read any other HP book except from the 3rd one//If we accept that he has really read that too!And he has the right too hate HP and magic in general.What he is not allowed to do is force us to witness the desecration of our beloved world!!!THAT HE CANNOT DO!! 6/10 only because it is theoretically based on the third HP book, a triumph of J.Rowling...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what happened to the series?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i saw this on the first day of it opening i was really excited when the movie finally started, and there was this little light coming on the screen i thought it was a candle than "Lumos Maxima". I think this was the best opening of all the potter movies, but the that was only one of the few positives about this film. What was really disappointing about this is the lack of care that Cauron put into this, he spent to much time trying to figure out he can change it so that he can make it stand out, than just making a good Potter movie. The only reason why i gave it a 7/10 was because the acting in this was the best so far and had better graphics than the others, but the rest was unfortunately what i cared about. Most would people love or hate this movie, me i don't like a lot of things in this movie you could say i hate all the stupid little things that were changed for no reason. If i had not read the books i would be really confused, ironiclly i did read the book many times and after i saw this i was actually confused. Most average movie goers will see this and might not be as intrigued as they should by this fabulous story. this movie could have saved itself, if it actually knew what it was doing but sadly it didn't. I hate to bash this movie, and this one was one of my favorite book of the series, but this movie might actually turn you off of future Films, but i hope that doesn't mean you cant enjoy the books.All in all as much as i don't like it, i seem to have this love hate relationship with this one. It is worth seeing, if you are turned off by this I can only hope that the best is yet to come if not, reading a book wouldn't kill you. 7/10 is because i am bias, sorry...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great stuff !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the first two Harry Potter movies were fun and entertaining The Prisonner of Azkaban gives you something more substantial. Watching the movie really gives you the feeling of being immersed in the magical world created by J.K.Rowling. I've read the book a couple of years ago and it was a true pleasure to see the people, monsters and artifacts of Hogwarts (all of which I had already almost forgot). The script of The Prisoner of Azkaban is tight and does a good job of bringing together the best elements of the novel. Sure the director has taken a few liberties ( notably with the dialogs ) but unless you are a Potter maniac chances are it won't bother you. As a result the movie is well balanced ( this time, thankfully, we don't have to go through an over-long Quidditch match...). The rhythm of the movie is flawless : after a long enough first part which lets you appreciate the depth of Rowling's imagination, the action gets rolling and don't let go. The special effects are mostly of great quality, my favorite being the talking paintings and the Marauder's map. The animation in the sequence where Hermione gets molested by a tree is way too blurry, though. A weakness of the movie, in my opinion, is that the Harry Potter character, seems a bit flat. With all the wonders around him I didn't care much what happened to him. Maybe it's also got to do with the somewhat flat acting of Radcliff. And the girl playing Hermione gives a poor performance : the only time I liked her acting was when she was running.. But Ron is great so it evens out !So The Prisoner of Azkaban is a great adventure movie in the same way Indiana Jones 2 and The Goonies were more than a decade ago (Ah those glorious movies of my youth !). They are thrilling and exotic teen movies and that's a nice combination. When the 7 Potter movies are complete I'm sure the third one will stand out. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For every kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really wanted to see this movie. Why? Because I was 24 years old student who really grew up from this kind of movies. Luckily, that year I was involved in a project of helping problematic kids. So I had an eleven years old boy to look after. Naturally when we decided to go to the cinema together he was the one to choose the film. I won't describe the joy of the kid and just say that he loved it. As for me, I don't really remember when was the last time I liked a movie that was meant for kids. And maybe it's not because I grown up, but because of the movies that are made. To me this levels with such greats as "Neverending Story" ( Only the original) and "Thursday after rain". Of course the visual effects of "Prisoner of Azkaban" are awesome, and the colors are very unique and interesting but these are not the main points. This movie shows creativeness, imagination and kindness of heart which most of the movies lacks. One of the best in it's kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tough third year for Harry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following both the Harry Potter books and the progress made on the films has been fascinating, not least in guessing what will remain in the film and what won't.It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts and already there he is in trouble both with his horrible adopted family (the dreadful Dursleys) and with the Ministry of Magic for finally getting fed of them and leaving but not before swelling his aunt to the size of a small air balloon and sending her flying. Picked up by the Knights Bus (I wish we had one of those), Harry finds himself back into the world he knows and loves much sooner. But, unlike other children, there is trouble in his direction - in the form of Sirius Black, escaped convict and possible traitor to Harry's dead parents.The film concentrates quite well on the key points: the dementors (shades of Tolkien's ringwraiths creeping in here) and Sirius Black as well as Harry's struggles with his life situation (Voldemort wants him dead and he has to live in the holidays with the Dursleys). All this and Quidditch and, of course, growing up.This film is considerably more grown up than the other two. Radcliffe is able to give the character a much needed shot of teenage stroppiness and inject some frustration as Harry realises that he has much to overcome as well. He is helped in his task by Professor Lupin, his new Defence against the dark arts teacher who helps Harry considerably against the dementors and gives him more much needed insights into his parents' own characters by revealing what his father really was like. Added to that, Gary Oldman is perfect as escaped convict and would be murderer Sirius Black.My only disappointment is that Gambon was perhaps not the right choice for Professor Dumbledore, playing him more like an elderly old hippy grandfather given to muttering strange stuff than the old, wise grandfather Dumbledore which was Harris'. Hopefully after the Goblet of Fire - he can settle into the role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is by far the best of the three Harry Potter movies already released. Compared to the other two, this one has much better directing. The acting skills have improved, especially in the children, perhaps due to the actor's maturity. The new scenery in this movie is really fitting: the rolling hills, the steps down from the castle, the bridge: it fits the magical, historic, and mysterious mood of the books and the idea of Harry Potter's world. Many arguments have been made that its inconsistent with the writing in the book, which is true to an extent, but one must realize that exact following of book plots does not always make a good movie. In this respect, I thought the editing was very good. Complaints: Although a much better movie singularly, there is a definitely rough transition between movies 2 and 3. Also, the Dumbledore from movies 1 and 2 was better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the best Harry Potter Movie that has come out. Some of the things were not accurate but all the same it was a GREAT movie the director did not include enough i think. Some of the things were wrong to for example Harry got the Firebolt in the middled of the book in the movie he got it at the end. The also did not leave Snape down at the shrieking shack they took him with them. Chris Columbus did capture the world of Harry Potter very well in this movie and i hope he does the same if not better in the 4th movie and I've seen the trailer and it looks amazing so i cant wait for that and I've read the 5th and 6th books and look forward to those movies too although I'm not sure chris columbus is doing the sixth movie but whatever i hope it will be good cause the books were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disagree with review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not disagree more with the review done by ladypythia. I am a humongous Harry Potter fan and was not disappointed. Granted some plot points were left out of the movie. However this is the fault of the studio who insisted on cutting and cutting, and the fault of the people who chose a person who was not interested in the Harry Potter world to direct. Cuaron did a good job, but had never even read the books before being asked to direct. He could have made the movie more all inclusive and from what I heard he did shoot more footage, but it all got cut. All in all I think what you get here is the best harry potter movie of the three in spite of all this. The mood that was created was better than the others and it sets the tone for the fourth movie which should be longer and more inclusive. Also, the issues that were left out are for the die hard harry potter fans, but for those who just want to see the movie and keep up they wont sit through a 3 and a half hour movie. So it had to be left with what it was to ensure that it would appeal to a broader spectrum of viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't expect sugar and spice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a true Potter addict, this is by far my favourite of the three. But don't expect any nice sugariness as we saw in the first two. With Columbus gone, we are left with the darker effects of Mr Caurons direction, which makes for a more grown up and serious Harry Potter. Viewers will note that the pictures might seem a bit cold and blue and that some of the original set has been moved around, just some little touches added by Cauron. Gone are the cheesy lines from the first books such as Harmiones obsession with Harry's broken glasses. The young actors seem far more at ease with themselves in the skin of their characters, showing greater maturity and understanding. You will also notice the humour that comes under the hand of Cauron. The new soundtrack, again by master of film scores John Williams, is very different from the often repetitive music from the first two films in the series, not as catchy but more devisive. Fans of the book will not be disappointed with this reproduction, but be warned that some scenes are a little disturbing, even for some sensitive adults, and not all children will be impressed. If you are lucky enough to have your hands on the DVD, don't forget to check out the extras disc for some truly entertaining moments with the Shrunken Head, engaging interviews and fun games.</fullReview>

Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson were nominated , why not Rupert? And sometimes the window blinds don't work like they should. And why there is a choir, it isn't any in the book?

		<shortDescription>The Hogwarts Trio start their third year with magical creatures and learn about past betrayals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third chapter of Harry's life at Hogwarts begins. This film is better than the first two Harry Potter movies because it's so much funnier. One of the funny scenes was when Aunt Marge come over for dinner. She calls Harry's parents "unemployed drunks" and finally Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has had it. All of a sudden she starts blowing up like a balloon and floated out of the house. The funny thing was that two scenes later you see her floating over a house, yelling for someone to help her. Another was when Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) were bickering about Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, chasing Scabbers, Ron's pet rat. They will later be seen arguing about whether or not Scabbers is dead and if it was killed by Crookshanks. The Fat Lady singing was also funny. She can't sing and she was trying to break a glass cup that she was holding. She started to scream causing everyone to shut their eyes and cover their ears. She broke the class on the wall behind her and claimed that she did it by singing. I think that everyone's favorite part of the movie was when Harry, Ron, and Hermione caught Malfoy (Tom Felton)about to witness the execution of Buckbeak, a hippogriff that attacked after Malfoy insulted it. Hermione walked over to him and pointed her wand at him. Ron told Hermione that "he's not worth it". She looks at Malfoy, who it seems started crying, and lowers her wand. She turns and him laughing. All of a sudden she turns around really fast and punching in the face. Some parts of the movie were scary. The scene where the dementer enters the train to Hogwarts. It almost sucked the happiness out Harry. Luckily, Professor Lupin made it go away. Another was when the dementer attacked Harry at a Quidditch match. He fell off his broom and wake in the hospital where he learned that only they lost the game but his broom went into the Whomping Willow (it was destroyed in other words). Harry also, later in the film, learns Hermione's secret to getting to all her classes was a time-turner when they traveled back in time to free Buckbeak and Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a falsely accused murderer. At the end of the movie Harry receives a Firebolt, the fastest broom in the world, by Sirius. I think this movie was the best also because more people watched it more than the first two films. Before my cousin saw it she thought Harry Potter was alright. After she saw it she bought all the books and we now talk about Harry Potter every time she calls. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, tragedy, and magic all in a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Summary: The novel starts on the night before Harry's 13th birthday, when he received gifts by Owl Post from his friends at school. The next morning at breakfast, Harry saw on television that a man named Sirius Black is on the loose from prison. At this time, Aunt Marge came to stay with the Dursleys, and she insulted Harry's parents numerous times. Harry accidentally caused her to inflate. Harry left the Dursleys house and is picked up by the Knight Bus, but only after an alarming sighting of a large, black dog. Then he is dropped off at Diagon Alley. There, he saw Cornelius Fudge, Ron and Hermione. When the students boarded the Hogwarts Express train, they were stopped by an entity called a dementor. Harry faints and is revived by Professor Lupin, their new defense against the Dark Arts teacher. Soon afterward, the students arrived at Hogwarts. Harry and his friends had their usual day to day, to-do: classes. Their classes were all interesting, well except for Divination, being one of the most imprecise magic taught at Hogwarts; Hagrid, as the teacher in Care for Magical Creatures, and Professor Lupin's "Riddikulus" spell, used against boggarts, and were the only ones that were great, for some. Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermione, had experienced great problems and trials such as learning the Patronus charm (for Harry), Hermione being secretive (because of her secret), saving buck beak from execution using Hermione's time turner, saving Black from terrible misunderstanding. But, all these were surpassed since their friendship gave them, Harry and his friends, to forge on the path they believe in which lead them success.Review:A. Setting Wow, I love the direction! The setting, as described by the author was amazing, definitely! For me, the setting is highly unbelievable but I don't know why but it tends me to believe in fiction. B. Characters The characters character in the novel are great because maybe in real life, that is what their attitude in day to day living. The actors acted much better in this one.C. Plot The style fits the movie perfectly which makes the plot quite interesting, since it makes the reader/viewer curious of the next event, especially for good readers because they try to picture out the situation then makes some guess of what will happen next.D. Theme The Duality of Life and the Importance of LoyaltyThe theme is circulated throughout the story. It is shown by Lupin, who spends much of his time as a professor and then another part as a man-eating werewolf, but that's a minor thing. We understand that everything ids capable of having two sides, good and evil. We also see this when Hermione starts to break rules, Buck beak's execution is reversed through a simple intrusion through time, and when Black was found out to be innocent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter 3 was the best movie from series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the best movie from the Harry Potter series. In fact it was also the best book. In the beginning, the part where they show you that Harry is reading in the Dursleys' home was kind of a lame part. What was the point of it? When Aunt Marge showed up it was an upsetting, yet funny part. It was upsetting because it would make you feel sorry for Harry because his parents are dead and no someone just makes fun of them because they are mean. Funny because Aunt Marge gets blown up.When he runs away and sees the dog it was a little freaky, especially if you haven't read the book. The movie had many funny scene and scary. The heads we're pretty funny. "Why the long faces," one of them said when the night bus went in between two buses. I would say the dementors were the scariest thing in the movie. The appeared in places you didn't want them. Even though this movie was a great movie, if I could change things in them, I probably would have changed a lot. The director Alfanso Curon was excellent, but he changed a lot in the movie. He didn't make the actors make wear the clothe that they are supposed to. Instead he made them wear normal clothe. The part where Harry receives the firebolt after he falls down and his Nimbus 2000 goes into the womping willow wasn't even added. In the book Hermione wasn't talking to Harry and Ron for a long time because of this, but they didn't put it in. The actors did a great job too. They have improved a lot since the first and second movie. (what did I expect) There were scenes though when you would think, oh they would have done better. Over all this movie was amazing. I mean if each movie is getting better and better, I wonder what the fourth movie would be like. This is a recommended movie and every one should watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best "Harry Potter" among the first ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter was not specifically designed for the cinema, that is why adapting a Harry Potter book for the big screen was, in itself, a challenge. The first two of the movies were quite faithful to the book, but took the time to show some details of the world of HP, for example life at school or others things that were not indispensable to understand the story completely. With the change of the director (Cuaron replaces Colombus) comes a change in the way the story is set up for the screen. Cuaron didn't think it was necessary to keep the previous details, in order to focus exclusively on the story. It might be a bit embarrassing for the people who are not familiar with the atmosphere of Harry Potter, but for the other it is really efficient: The story turns to be more intensive and breath-taking. Nothing to say about the actors, they are mainly the same than in the previous movies. A last word concerning the music: when will Williams retire??? He could have composed a much more interesting music, given what he'd written in the past!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure that Harry Potter fans will turn out in true form to see this movie. The reputation of J.K. Rowling's story and Steve Kloves' (screen writer) adaptations of previous books have been exceptionally well done.In The Sorcerer's Stone a new and fascinating world of fantasy was opened up and Chris Columbus did an impeccable job of making you believe in the existence of that fantasy world.In The Chamber of Secrets you expected action and you GOT action. For some of us even more than we wanted. Ewwwwww, Spiders! Chris Columbus once again did not disappoint his audiences.With two extremely well done movies as predecessors, the third film promised to be just as exciting and well done. You could feel the excitement and see the anticipation on every face of the audience as they entered the theater. We left disappointed. Gone was the excited buzz of chatter after the first two movies; people left this one in stunned silence.The story-line itself left much to be desired, jumping all over the place and veering completely away from the book in several instances. Unfortunately, the veering left excitement behind and bordered on mundane.So, what saved this movie from actually becoming mundane? 1. Excellent graphics exceeding those of the first two movies. The "blowing" up of Aunt Marge, the transformation of Peter Petigrew, and the knight bus adventure are some of the scenes that will certainly impress the viewer.2. The characters make-up and costuming, fabulous.3. The set, exactly as you would picture Hogwarts to be from the books. In Azkaban the setting should be darker and it does not disappoint us.4. The actors were right on with one exception. Michael Gambon's portrayal of Albus Dumbledore fell short. He simply was unable to portray the quiet strength people have come to expect from Dumbledore.Alfonso Cuaron's direction did not make the cut with me. He had it all; characters, setting and plot....he just didn't make it work.Steve Kloves, stop attempting to "improve" upon J.K. Rowling and continue to follow her lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I do think this is a very good movie. It's well directed, the music is excellent, the acting is great; however, I don't feel as though it's got the same "Harry Potter" feel as the first two, Columbus's two.For me, the first two Harry Potter movies "felt" perfect, they felt right. To be frank, they felt like Harry Potter! I've read the books a dozen times each, and from what I read, I had my own vision of what Harry's world would be like. Chris captured it amazingly, exactly as I'd imagined it. Alfonso's was OK, but he seems to have changed an awful lot and tried too hard to get the movie into a "new" style, his style. This, I feel, is why I'm opposed to his version to Chris's. However, despite all that, the movie is very good (excellent for the last 30 minutes). The acting is good, and the movie moves at a great pace; you really feel it has been a year at Hogwarts. There are a handful of "cringe-worthy" moments, which really bug me. You'll know them when you see them, trust me.Anyway, definitely see this movie and form your own opinion. It's not all bad, seriously. I just wish Chris had directed it, I have the strange feeling it would of been better and "fitted" in with the first two.(4/5)</fullReview>

And it makes want to believe. Actually it MAKES you believe. The graphics were also amazing and the casting, it couldn't have been better! It also followed the basics of the book and also had character building, in which I mean you could tell that the actors really felt their characters. For anyone who hasn't watched the movie I suggest you watch and the first 2 movies as well, you should also read the books, they are amazing! (There are currently 6 of them) I hope that you enjoy Harry Potter as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently watched HP and the Prisoner again this past week, after finishing the latest book. I was struck by how wonderfully magical the filming of this instalment has been created with fade in's (don't see many of those anymore), hilarious bridging scenes with the Whomping Willow, and the clock / time theme throughout. This HP movie has a vivid sense of humour playing against the rapid plot, and a screenplay that does a brilliant job of pulling together all the critical elements of Rowling's story. It's a daunting task to recreate something that has played through so many people's imaginations, but Prisoner has done a fantastic job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite Potter films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started my career as a Harry Potter fan at the age of 6. When I discovered that they would be made into movies, I immediately felt hesitant to see them. What if they were completely manipulated? Changed around? What if the actors and actresses were no good? Fortunately, I was not disappointed. Though many things were changed about the movies, they left all of the important things in there, while throwing in several new twists. This movie is no exception. I was delighted at how well everything was portrayed. Almost exactly as I had read it. I was delighted at the wonderful one-liners thrown in, and was completely mystified by the concept of going back in time. Yet another spectacular feeling was fear. The dementors, the fear of facing a boggart, and the idea of having a killer looking for you are quite terrifying. The stars of this series may be growing up, but they still manage to act out the characters magnificently.However, I have one suggestion; If you haven't read the book, you may find this movie to be VERY frightening. But if you are a Harry Potter fan, you shouldn't be bothered when everything starts to mysteriously turn to ice...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is outstanding! There is a lot of suspense and many exciting parts! Some younger children might be scared of the dementors and other creepy parts, but children 10 and over should be fine. The movie is almost as good as the book by the same name which was written by JK ROwling. Many parts from the book are included in the movie. An interesting thing about the movie compared to the other two is that the actors are wearing normal "Muggle" (non-wizard) clothes instead of the Hogwarts robes. I think that this takes away from the "magic" of the movie, but the movie is good just the same. This movie is a must-see especially if you have read the book!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Harry Potter was really good. I enjoyed watching it and the plot was just as interesting as the first two. It followed the book and it was very well put together. But this movie was different from the first two movies. This one felt more..."dark." I think this may be because of the plot, and how disturbing it is to Harry, so I think that is why it's different from the other two Harry Potter movies. The acting was a lot more dramatic in this movie. I think the events of the story engage this more dramatic acting. I was extremely impressed by all the actors and seen how they've improved from the previous films. All in all this movie was great. I recommend it to all Harry Potter fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I didn't care for it. Too many things taken out and the plot was almost ruined.But then after the third time seeing it, I realized it wasn't too bad at all. Alfonso really did a fantastic job. And after watching interviews, I found out that JK Rowling was happy with what turned out. If my favorite author is happy, I'm happy. She even liked the things Alfonso and the screenwriter added in that she didn't write in the books. I myself loved the whole shrunken head concept.I absolutely love all the special effects. Buckbeak, the Hippogriff, looked so realistic. Those Dementors gave me goosebumps. I cried when Sirius Black (played by the awesome Gary Oldman) almost got his soul sucked out at the lake. The moving paintings and photos are also a real treat in the movie.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Tom Felton are some of the best teen actors I've ever seen. Daniel deals with all that pressure really well, being the star. Rupert Grint, hot like Daniel except in my opinion, hotter, gives comic relief throughout the movie that made me and my friends laughed at over and over again. Emma has really matured a lot and does a great job but I think they are showing more Emma and less Hermione which, plainly, isn't good. Tom Felton, another British heart throb, plays Draco Malfoy, a snobby, rich, mean Slytherin student who thinks too highly of himself. Tom plays the role very well, but we all know he has a heart of gold outside of acting, right?We also meet some new actors in the third movie. Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore. He will never be as great as Richard, but I suppose he did an acceptable job. Garry Oldman, who plays the framed Sirius Black, does a good job. Timothy Spall, the sniveling Peter Pettigrew, who turns out to be Ron's rat and also he framed Sirius, does a good job but I think they made him look too ugly. I didn't expect him be handsome, but I didn't expect him to look disgusting either.I really loved this movie, being a huge Harry Potter fan and all. But I think even people who don't like the books would love this movie too, because it's deeper than wands and brooms. There are messages about life in these movies and books that make people think and learn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my most favorite sequel so far, dark like the second film...and we sort of take a break from voldemort trying to kill harry! and we are introduced to another great character Sirius Black...Harry Potter's Godfather (but people and read and own the books like me knew that ages ago)...and the bit with aunt Marge is terrific...here's the plot...For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard "accidentally" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the non-magic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? The best sequel so far and i have i high expectations for the next film...the only disappointing part was Richard Harris passing away and now a new actor plays dumbledore...sure he ain't as good as Richard...but i still think this new actor does a great job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Harry Potter films so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was the best of the Harry Potter films so far. Quite possibly because I couldn't remember the little details in the book, and it had been years since I read it. The first two movies, although good, didn't seem quite like what I pictured. Because I had little preconceptions, I liked it more overall. I thought it was very easy to follow, and a cute movie. It's nice seeing the main actors older, and acting more like teenagers. Their non-uniform attire also makes it better, in my opinion. The effects were good, and beautiful backgrounds only added. Some construe it as darker than the others, and perhaps it is, but only a little. The characters are growing older, after all. It was a good movie, I really liked it, and I can't wait for the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MINOR SPOILERS* The Prisoner Of Azkaban is the best movie of the three Harry Potter films so far. But i think The Prisonr Of Azkaban is the worst book of the five books already released, my favorite is no. five. The new director Alfonso Cuarón changed the atmosphere in this movie, this movie is very different from the other two Harry potter movies.Why is this movie different then the other Harry Potter movies? Well, in the other two movies the plot was always; Harry gets in danger and something happens and then he meets voldemort by him self and duel's him and wins. And after that he is in the school's hospital and is okay after that.The other two movies are exactly like that, but the third one is very different. Thing about the third one that are different from the first two: Voldemort never appears in this movie, Harry never meets him by himself and duel's him, the go back in time to fix things in this movie.Yes there are few more things that are different about this movie but i am not going to count them all now.***1/2(out of ****)</fullReview>

This was the first book I read from the series and I loved the two movies. I was kind of upset that they didn't show more of the friendship of James, Sirius, Professor Lupin, and Peter and why it was so horrible that Harry's parents were betrayed. Also they didn't explain that map more. If I just watched the movie without reading the book I would been confused how Professor Lupin knew how to use it. Other wise the movie was amazing. The three actors have gotten so much better and continue to grow as actors. I nothing but respect for them. Ron is always funny and my favorite. I love how the director made this his own movie.

		<shortDescription>Third Harry Potter Movie Isn't The Best One But Still Terrific Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Harry and his friends' third term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and the big news is that the sinister Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison. Black was incarcerated for his role in the death of Harry's parents and will be seeking revenge, so headmaster Dumbledore orders the school guarded by the fearsome Dementors and appoints a new teacher in the Black Arts, the mysterious Professor Lupin ...The third Harry Potter movie is an excellent adventure, bursting with great ideas and lots of deliciously scary scenes, but for some reason it doesn't quite match up to the first two films for me. I'm not quite sure why - it could be because the big revelation about Sirius Black at the end is that he turns out to be a nice guy, but I think it's the complexity of the script itself, which crams in so much detail it can often be confusing. There's a key scene where Smith and Hardy explain some crucial backstory to Christie - a character we have never even met before - which is hasty, badly written and vague; fantasy movies need to be clear about their mythologies and this one occasionally dips into incoherence. There is much to enjoy though - the wacky Knight Bus, an ultra-scary train ride, the cantankerous and unpredictable Hippogriff, the Boggart sequence, a supercool map of the School and a great time-travel loop. The cast are all terrific again, particularly Rickman as Professor Snape, but Thewlis completely steals the show as the troubled Professor Lupin - sad, thoughtful, kind and eloquent. Oldman is always a joy to watch, even if his part is really just an extended cameo, and Gambon is amusing as Dumbledore, but doesn't bring the role quite as much pathos and mystery as Richard Harris, who died in 2002. As with the previous films, the production quality is first-rate, particularly Michael Seresin's dark photography and the gorgeous sets by Stuart Craig. This is still a great adventure movie by any standards, but isn't quite as magical and enchanting as its predecessors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my ultimate favourite book of the Harry Potter series. Its a turning point in Harry's point and it contains two of the best new characters of the HP world: Sirius and Remus. These two characters are portrayed brilliantly by Gary Oldman and David Thewlis respectively.I think my biggest peeve over the film is that it doesn't stick too well with the book. The best scene in the whole book, The Shreiking Shack scene lasts at least 2 chapters in the book but it is cut down to a measley 5 minutes in the film. This scene tells a lot about the past and well it leaves a lot of holes for those who haven't read the book and this could cause a lot of headache trying to understand the next two books.If you have seen this film but not read the book, then read it.

		<fullReview>The Prisoner of Azkaban is the third installment of the Harry Potter books turned into a movie. With a new director, some mite say the film would be destined to fail but in my book, it's honored the book memorably. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is yet again returning to Hogwarts for his third year at the magical school. Topping the wizard headlines is that the dangerous wizard criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. Harry thinks little of it until it is revealed that Sirius is after Harry, Harry must do his best to remain calm and deal with idea of the man responsible for his parents death coming after him. To help with Harry's problem are his everlasting friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) along with their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). Eventually the dark past of Harry's life would reach him again as the vile Sirius Black closes in to finish his work. With a new director in Alfonso Cuaron some things are changed and others shifted around. Hagrid's hut is moved to a different location and some darker features are added to the castle. The story is darker then the previous two and makes it a bit more fun. The kids act as they usually do and show they each have promising careers after the long series is completed. The special effects are sometimes over-used and sometimes distract the viewer from the story. One big and obvious replacement is that of the late and honorable Richard Harris being replaced by Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore. Dumbledore's character isn't focused on as much and doesn't really have any effect on the film. Gambon has proved though that he is an honorable replacement to the great Richard Harris.The acting by each actor is pretty strong and the film is loaded with a variety of great actors. The film is pretty good and hopefully the film series continues to be as good as this. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Starring: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, and David Thewlis. 4 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

Nothing against the first two though. I guess I just like that Harry is starting to realize his destiny lies on a different path than most others.Anyways, I liked the intro of Lupin and Black. I particularly like the scene where Sirius tells Harry about his feelings from the first time he passed through the doors of Hogwarts.

		<fullReview>This is the best of the Harry Potter films thus far, but as other have pointed out it's a bit dark and scary for younger children (10 and younger). Some of the scenes are pretty intense, especially the scene where a man transforms into a werewolf. The actors all seem to be growing into the roles, especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe). The special effects are impressive and are well integrated into the film. The film runs long (2-1/2 hours) but it's fast paced and doesn't drag at any point. My one complaint is that the plot is a bit confusing at times if you haven't read the books. My daughters helped answer some of my questions as I watched, and maybe the target audience is readers of the books, so it's a minor complaint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first two Harry Potter movies were faithful, efficient adaptations of their respective books. I enjoyed them, although since I had read the books and they just retold the story of those books I felt they would have been more fun for someone who did not already know the story.This third movie is something entirely different. Directed by Alfonso Cuarón, who helmed the brilliant, magical A Little Princess, Cuaron adds a lyrical quality to the magic and brings Hogswart alive in a way Chris Columbus, the competent but unimaginative director of movies Like Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire, failed to do in his movies. Columbus brought the sort of magic you get from a stage magician, Cuaron makes magic come alive.Skimming the other reviews I get the impression a lot of people were put of by the darkness of this film. Having read all the Potter books I am ahead of the movies in terms of grimness: I am so used to the darkness of later books that it didn't even occur to me this one was dark. I must warn those who don't read the books that things are going to get much, much grimmer in the succeeding movies. Honestly I wish the books weren't getting so brutally tragic, but I still find them fascinating.Sadly, none of the future Potter movies are to be directed by Cuaron, and I won't be surprised if this is the most artful of the series.</fullReview>

The book doesn't have it--the dementors are pretty lame in the movie in that scene. Two: WHERE ARE THE ROBES!? They are wizards, they wear robes, not...not...MUGGLE GARMENTS! I think Alfonso or someone just wanted Hermione to show off more. You'll notice that she is center on some of the posters, and very prominent. Three: Er, where's the backstory? Ron doesn't seem too angry at Hermione for having her cat eat his pet. In the book, they argue. Not here. Now,they all just are a happy bunch, and getting very mushy, too.Four: WHAT HAPPENED TO HOGWARTS!? It is not the same castle--and why is there a pendulum? Poor Neville is going to get clobbered by that thing!Five: Speaking of Neville, where is he? And Goyle? And everyone else? Wood? Nope. Cedric? I think he gets roasted by a lightning bolt. Malfoy? Where is that evil-looking, arrogant, cold, smooth villain, anyway? He seems to be missing. There's only an ugly meanie who looks similar.Six: Does it disturb anyone that there are shrunken heads everywhere? Consider: where do they get these heads? Think of that. Seven: How did Sirius escape? They kind of forget to say that. Plot hole, right there. Also on plot holes, the thestrals are invisible, despite the fact that Harry saw Quirrel die in #1. (This is not a mistake in the books). And might I inquire WHY there are so many weirdos who sing with TOADS? Also, Harry is a nobody, it seems--he has never won a Quidditch cup...but another key plot hole: wouldn't it be proof that Peter was alive if they found his CLOTHES on the GROUND!? Eight: RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! IT'S THE KILLER BIPEDAL GREYHOUND! Nine: Does a pathetic howl really sound like a werewolf, or is that just because it was the killer bipedal greyhound? Ten: The school is not safe. Our dear headmaster Dumbledore thinks hitting Ron on the leg is amusing! And he saves Harry when he falls, but lets the Hufflepuff seeker get blasted out of the sky!Eleven: In the book, Harry never sees a Grim. He only sees Sirius. What is that cloud formation? Twelve: The final shot is kind of freaky.Actually, though, there were one or two good parts. Buckbeak looked awesome, and some of the magic usage was cool (no longer flashy, but actually magical). And Lupin and Sirius were great, though Sirius did seem a little happy for being in a soul-sucking prison for twelve years. And John Williams is good once more. But seriously, this movie was the biggest letdown I have had. Check the post "100 Complaints about the Movie," coming soon, for a list of book-related comments. Most of the above concerned the movie. Thank you for your patience, and watch the fourth one...AND READ THE BOOKS! TEN TIMES BETTER THAN THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, TWENTY TIMES THE THIRD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did they do to my film????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all sounded so promising... A darker film, no more Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron - a man whose films are stunningly beautiful, unfortunately Steve Kloves was still writing the script but hey we can't have everything can we...So where did it all go wrong? I understand the concept of artistic license - believe me I do... and I understand that certain aspects of the book have to be left out, altered but there are some things that are sacred! One of my biggest gripes is with the Mexican Werewolf... I'm sorry a hairless werewolf in Britain? Just... just no! I'm sorry - it would be mocked by all the other werewolves.... plus it would freeze! And when would Lupin have been in Mexico? Which leads me to another gripe... Lupin. Now don't get me wrong, I love David Thewlis, he's a great actor... He's just not Lupin... The weedy 'stache, the abrupt way in which he addresses Neville, the way he cowers, some of the things he says. It's just not right.Also, the bluebirds and the Whomping Willow. It's Scotland - they don't have bluebirds. Bluebirds are not native to the UK.One thing that interested me the most was the use of magic at the very beginning of the film... Lumos Maxima... what's wrong with good old Lumos? Why do the spells all of a sudden have sound effects? And who isn't allowed to do magic outside of school? What fact is reiterated some time later by good old uncle Vernon? - 'You're not allowed to do magic outside of school.' Come on people! Another thing that frustrates me... but this is speaking purely as a film student... is the sudden trend in using wipes. Why? It looks so amateur.And what is the need for all the repetition? 'How is it you know everything?' 'How is it she knows everything?' We are not stupid. We don't need things such as those to be reinforced time after time. We have read the books. We know what is going on.My biggest problem with this film comes at the very end. Sirius's last words are not to Harry, they're to Hermione. Why? This would never happen. A beautiful moment spoiled by the line 'You really are the brightest witch of your age.' It truly infuriates me. The original line of 'You really are your Father's son' is far better suited and means so much more.This really has turned into a major rant about the film. The thing that probably annoys me the most is the fact that despite all this I still have to admit that it is truly beautiful and that it is far superior to the first two films.With a British Director, finally, at the helm of the next film and the fact that there will be no more Steve Kloves bodes well for the next films. If only we can get Warner Bros. to budge on the time restrictions....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fair review of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to complete the commentary that currently appears on the web-page, for I don't agree at all. I watched Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban while I never opened one book, and I went to see this movie while I hated Harry Potter. And I loved it. This movie was so great, it made me change my opinion on the whole Harry Potter thing. I understood it totally, and I don't think you had to know every detail and know all the books by heart to understand. Then I read the books and, of course I learned more details but I also had an increasing respect for the movie-maker, indeed, all these people who are crazy about Harry, do they realize how difficult it is to make a movie, to try to put everything in 2 hours ? while you need at least 5 or 6 to read it? It's so easy to criticize, of course, he had to cut things off, but let me tell you, I didn't know anything about nothing, I didn't even knew who was who, and I loved the movie. Emotion, and action and a lot of thinking and feelings, and fun.. This movie is one of the best I saw, and I can't wait to watch the next !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have to admit i was not a fan of the harry potter films. esp. when inevitably compared to the lord of the rings, the first film was so flat and dull that i didn't even bother watching the 2nd. in fact,i myself gave that first film a "1" rating here on IMDb.the problem,i think was simple..it was a Hollywood board room product all the way, helmed by studio yes man chris columbus to drain all the surprise and interesting elements out of the books and make them bland and palatable...concerned more about the bottom line and who they were going to offend than telling the story in an interesting or exciting way.thus, i was surprised by the 3rd entry. i literally walked in b/c i had nothing else to do that day, and a friend who i trusted had encouraged me to see it. after a few moments, i saw what the excitement was about. cuaron made all the difference, and his version of rowlings world is at once thrilling, fascinating, and magical. this is a place i could imagine wanting to spend several years of my life learning magic. i never felt the bland cardboard cut-out world of the first film. this film felt organic, as if anything could happen and very well might.this just makes chris columbus all the more pathetic. those first 2 films could have been close to lotr quality, if a real director had been brought in. i, and others like me, will just have to rue the day columbus was allowed to taint this film series with his blandness.this one, well, it has not only excited me for the impending release of the next film, but has made me consider reading the books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry and his wand-waving friends return in "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," the third in the series of high-flying adventures by British author J.K. Rowling.This latest film finds a more grownup Harry being pursued by the evil Sirius Black, who has just performed the unprecedented feat of escaping from a prison for wayward warlocks. As Sirius moves inexorably closer to his intended victim, Harry learns some surprising details about the murder of his beloved parents."The Prisoner of Azkaban" is a pretty decent installment overall, although it could use some tightening here and there to make it more streamlined and evenly paced (the film runs an overlong two hours and twenty-two minutes). The production design and special effects are as stunning as ever, as once again we are transported to a visually beautiful world of unbridled fantasy and imagination. One of the reasons why the Harry Potter works are so popular is that they root their stories in characters who are realistic and believable, so that even amidst all the riding of brooms, casting of spells and reciting of incantations, Harry, Ron and Hermione are able to keep their feet on the ground and their hold on the audience.Although many people have noted a "darker" element running through this film, I really didn't see it, and, in fact, I think "Prisoner" is less intense than the second - and best - installment, "Chamber of Secrets." Although there seems to be enough creativity in the original concept to support a few more "Potter" movies, even Potter-maniacs may feel that at least some of the bloom has begun to fade from this particular rose. I guess only future installments will truly tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a sorcerer's student to his master... followed by a try to describe what magic is....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's difficult to find any words for the film Alfonso Cuarón made of Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. I had so many many expectations to this adaptation from ? for me the best of JK Rowlings novels ? that book so i feared it would become as boring as his predecessors are.But....Cuarón made it! Absolutely real magic from beginning to end. This film breathes the spirit of it's model, although shortened and changes in many ways, but I don't care...Cuarón eliminates all of the sticky American sugar icing from Harry's film-life. Shown already in the very first scene with the Dursleys. Nothing is multi-coloured anymore, instead we see a typical depressing English suburb-family, not better or worse than any other suburb-family.Even to Hogwarts some locations-updates are made. Somehow it looks like in the predecessors but it's surely different, within the hilly Scottish landscape, with staggering new settings (this bridge from the castle to Hagrid Hut ? really great). The Kids are changed to modern typical teens, like you will find in every school in Great Britain. A lax funny atmosphere at the beginning, the boys hangin' around together, happy to be back at school, that all seems like a really normal school day.Radcliffe will never be one of the greatest actors of the lifetime, but here he made some good tries to mediate Harry's feelings....even Emma Watson &amp; Rupert Grint did a good job, hopefully they will do the remaining films together....Completed by old and new adults: Snape (Rickman) nasty good as ever with a lot more scenes as in HP 2, Coltrane lives Hagrid but Maggie Smith leaves it only to a few Cameos... Michal Gambon as Dumbledore fills in the vacancy leaving by Richard Harris terrific, the Schoolmaster is no longer only a wise great wizard, he's also lax and funny . David Thewlis as Remus Lupin is great. Though i was a little bit disappointed with the casting-news, because my Lupin looks very very different in my mind, i must say: Great - Thewlis evolves his figure fantastically, those scenes between him and Harry are the strongest of the whole film.Well and Oldman......NOBODY could have been better to play Sirius Black. This unbelievable ambivalently figure comes to life with Oldman.....i can't find words for this. Only one thing disturbed me....his appearance is too short. Really too short. But he has definitely the greatest scene in the film with Harry......let me nearly burst out in tears....*sniff*...(well because i know how the story will go one....)There are so many beautiful scenes in the film: The lesson with the Boggart, the Quidditch-Match through the rain and the attack of the dementors, Harry's Patronus, the time-travel, the flight with Buckbeak.....and so on....Well, all of this is Harry Potter like i have it in mind from the very beginning. Cuarón knows like no other before him how to bring Harry up to film-life. A magician of pictures, lights, &amp; scenes ? a sorcerer bringing Harry Potter up to LIFE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfonso has done a fabulous job with the latest installment in Harry's journey. Prisoner of Azkaban has more mature, darker tones than the previous two films and gives glimpse of what is to come in the rest of the books.All the kids have grown as actors over the years and it's obvious in this film how talented they've become. The additions to the cast in David Thewlis, Gary Olman, Timothy Spall, and others are perfect as our favorite characters from the book.For those that have read the books a few things have been changed but the main story lines remain the same. For those that haven't, the story should flow nicely with the previous movies and be easy to understand.If Goblet of Fire continues with the example Cuaron set it's sure to be just as enjoyable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read and heard many stories about Rowling wanting, before Columbus took charge, Gilliam as a director for a Harry Potter movie. Sure it would have been great... but didn't come true (as many dreams about the movie industry..).But hurray, miracles happen! With Alfonso Cuaron we have here the closest possible thing to a Gilliamesque version of HP given the circumstances. And the funny thing is it's not even with Gilliam's cinematographer Roger Pratt (who was actually responsible for the second HP's wonderful visuals, contrasting with the poor storytelling and awkward direction common to the first two movies). Michael Seresin (Alan Parker's cinematographer) was an excellent choice, and was quite up to the task. I was glad to see what he did with all these ambitious complicated "dancing" steadycam shots (very similar to Gilliam's and Jacksons') that Cuaron threw at him and the operators... The visuals are splendid. So is the pacing, which is the very best I've seen in a long time in a "commercial" movie. This pacing is like music. So much that Williams gives what may be his best work ever, probably because the editing had already done half the job for him... Excellent humour, too. This housekeeper at the door really got me, so did the "book of monsters", with a nod to Evil Dead III's "flying Necronomicon"... Actually nods to cult movies are everywhere if you take the time to look for them (noticed the character out of "Young Frankenstein" for example?)...All in all a very, very enjoyable movie for almost everyone, pop-corn eaters and (non-snobbish) cinephiles alike.Are these cynical executives actually learning, at last? The mass-consumption movie production seems to make sensible steps towards a reasonably intelligent and tasteful approach of cinema for the masses... Jackson hired for LOTR, Raimi for Spiderman, Singer for X-men, Cuaron for HP, Gilliam for Brothers Grimm... signs of the times? I certainly hope so.It was more than time that real storytellers and real movie makers get these "big money" jobs. Now there is a -tiny- chance that the movie industry starts producing blockbusters with taste and brains.Cuaron, my god, such a gift for pacing and liveliness, for energy and precision, bravo, bravissimo, I'll go and rent every movie from this guy. Now to be a GREAT director, he should get more involved with the inner world of the characters... Here, only Thewlis really "gets through" (sorry: Pam Ferris does too actually). The rest of the cast, well, look like.. well... actors doing their job. Could be on purpose, though. I'll have to look at Cuaron's previous works to know for sure.8/10</fullReview>

The move was good but true HP fans will be in for a shock at the things that where left out of the movie, it is a must to read the book first.I hope that JKR takes a hard look at this film and puts her foot down with the next movie and keeps it very close to the book, the new director needs to take a leaf out of Chris Columbus's's book of Dir. If you want to see a lot of Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle forget it. All in all this movie is good but not as good as the first two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vital information was left out of this movie that should effect the rest of the sequels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe they let this movie be made this way after staying relatively close to the story lines in the previous two. There is never any mention about how Professor Lupin knew what the Marauders Map was and how to activate it... hmm I don't know, like maybe mentioning that he was one of the four that made the map in the first place.They also neglect to clarify the fact that the reason Peter Petigrew and Serious Black can turn into animals is because three out of the four members of James Potters circle of friends became unregistered animagus to help keep Lupin out of trouble when he turned into a werewolf. That is why his father appeared as a Stag in Harry's petronus.Having the new broom delivered at the end of the movie instead of having it given to him right after his old one is destroyed was ridiculous. They should have included the fact that he was not allowed to ride it at all because the teachers were afraid it may be cursed. They pretty much neglected the whole Quidditch aspect that all the stories build on.These are things that have to be explained before moving on to the next movie and they did not do a thing about it. I looked for these things on the DVD with hopes that they just shaved them to save time, but sadly it was not addressed there either. All in all I hope they do better with the next movie or I will shun them all together and stick with the novels. If they can't get the basics right they should not make the movie at all.</fullReview>

Some might like "Chamber" better, but "Azkaban" Tops it in acting, plot, and visuals.Harry begins his third year at Hogwarts while being stalked by a big, black, scary, doggy! He meets new teachers, and creatures (same thing, right?) and learns some new magic.Daniel Raddcliffe who, some may say, stinks as Harry is really good here. I never thought he was bad as Harry, but he plays him best here. Probably because he has had two movies to practice. Rupert Grint as Ron is very funny, and Emma Watson plays Hermione perfectly. Michael Gambon, a very good Dumbledore was ALMOST as good as Richard Harris but.. I can't say he was better. That would be sacrilegious.If you like Harry Potter, see this.

Harry just keeps getting better and better as befits the books and hermione is a torch bearer for young girls every where. elsewhere the standard of acting is par excellence, for a fantasy film of course, and the manner in this is maintained harbors well for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This without a doubt is the best movie yet. That is major because of the new director, Alfonso Cuaron, who really knows how to put magic into a movie. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved the first two movies, but something was missing and so was a flowing story. Cuaron improves on many things, from better sets too the movie rushing past you that you have to pay attention or you will get lost. While, he does all these good things, their are some things which hard-core fans of the books will dislike. Firstly, the movie isn't as faithful as the first two. While I think the first 2 were too faithful and they suffered because of it, many fans think a faithful movie is all that matters. Secondly, Cuaron has moved some things in the movie around to fit better with the story. This may bother some people who hate dis-continuity. Regardless of those things, Poa is a far better movie all-around, and I would love Cuaron to direct another hp movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) enters his third year at Hogwarts, amid perceived threats to his life from the man (Gary Oldman) who escaped from wizard prison.Finally, after two movies they got it right. This chapter catches the spirit of the novels almost perfectly and far better than the previous adaptations. The cast is coming into their characters perfectly, the performances are getting better with each film. The scenes are edited together with much more fluidity than before. This feels like an actual movie and not a screening of scenes from the book. And this film has style; the camera no longer just sits still but moves all over the place. Credit must go to new director, Alfonso Cuaron. Taking over from Chris Columbus, he has succeeded at making a fantasy book look like a fantasy movie and not just a movie with fantasy elements. I hate to see him step down; hopefully he will return for another one. Another welcome addition is Oldman; he is a wonderful actor who plays his few scenes perfectly. My only complaint is the young actor's costumes. It's a bit jarring to see private school students in normal, everyday teen wear. In the years to come, this will probably date the movie more than the other two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a peculiar thing. The "Prisoner of Azkaban" was written by the same author ... adapted by the same screenwriter ... played by the same cast ... so why the hell is it so much better than the previous two? The answer, of course, lies in the change of director. Mr Columbus, I don't want to hurt your feelings but ... you suck. The arrival of foreign director Alfonso Cuarón has saved the franchise for me, just when I was about ready to give up on the whole series of films. The problem was that I could see the potential of the books, which had thus far not been realised on film. They just had no magic about them at all. But this latest offering from Hogwarts has plenty of that magic to spare.The colour palette for the movie is suddenly all dark shades of blue and green, a stark contrast to the browney-orangey memories I have of the first two -- and it suits the mood of the film so much better. And remember all those tedious sequences that you hated in the other two movies (i.e. the Dursley household, Dumbledore's office)? Well, in this one either they're cut short or they're done in an interesting way.Also, the dialogue is considerably less clunky, even though it's written by the same people and spoken by the same actors. Either Cuarón fiddled with the script a little, or he taught the kids how to act. It certainly appears so, as the three child stars who failed to be convincing in the previous movies have suddenly learned their craft a whole lot better. The new arrivals, notably Gary Oldman and David Thewlis, are somewhat unusually cast in their roles, but both come off extremely well.One criticism of the film is that it may be a little confusing to those who haven't read the books. Whereas the previous two movies had those tedious dialogue sequences which explained everything that happened, this one sacrifices those to save the pace of the film. I only wish that Cuarón had signed on to direct the next installment, and then I could honestly say "The Goblet of Fire" is one of my most anticipated movies of the coming years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Harry Potter movie yet, but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read all the Harry Potter novels so far and I saw the first two movies before I watched 'Prisoner of Azkaban', which is definitely the best Harry Potter movie yet. The acting skills of the youngsters improve steadily, the CGI was nice but not breath-taking and there were some tense and exciting moments. Cuarón did a much better job than Columbus, that's for sure.So far the good news. The whole movie was totally messed up by the worst adaptation I've ever known. It was completely disorderly, unbalanced, indistinct and without any structure. The movie starts way to fast (you only have to blink after Aunt Marge's blowing up or Harry is suddenly in Hogwarts), the mid part is an incoherent pack of randomly taken fragments of the book (with leaving out lots of important stuff and mentioning vague, further unexplained elements: Snape taking over the lessons from Lupin, Trelawney making a creepy prediction) and the end isn't too long but also not very interesting. After Black is saved, Harry suddenly receives a new broom, he flies with it, and BAM! the movie is done ... The pacing was horrible. I also didn't like the 'restyling' of Hogwarts and its students. There weren't hardly any resemblances to the Hogwarts from the first two movies and the school from the third movie. Hagrid's hut is suddenly replaced, there are Stonehenge-like structures, the Wood has a totally different look ... not to mention the fact that the students almost never wear their costumes anymore, contrary to the first two movies.I rated HP1 4/10, HP2 5/10 and this one 6/10 (so maybe number 7 will get a 10/10?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who has read the books will be able to tell you just how good the Prisoner of Azkaban was, and how good the movie really should have been. POA is by far my favorite of the five books that have been so far released and to say I was excited to watch this movie doesn't even come close. This was the first of the Potter movies that I went to see on the big screen and although I did enjoy the amount of information and aspects that made the book so good were sadly missing from this adaptation. Add the fact that due to a new director the grounds were completely changed and you find more reasons for me being upset at Alfonso Cuaron. Richard Harris being replaced didn't help either but that couldn't be changed unfortunately. Harris was the best person for the job and although Gambon did an almighty job in the role there really was no way to replace the man who many people will now see as the face of Albus Dumbeldore.But anyway enough with the critical side of things, I'm not paid to do that. (I'm obviously not paid enough to do my actually job either since I'm doing this whilst in the office! Oops) Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is about to start his third year at Hogwarts but all is not well. His Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris), although not his actual aunt he still had to call her that under strict orders from Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), is coming to stay and she's brought her dog with her too. All sorts of antics occur and eventually her bad mouthing of Harry's parents (James and Lily) leads to her blowing up, not in an explosive way but a floating away sort of way. Which forces Harry to leave his summer home and take to the road, enter the Knight Bus which takes him to the leaky cauldron in London and all sorts of hectic adventures can start right there. The introduction of several new characters occurs in this latest episode of the boy wizard including Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and the maniacal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and there former friend Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall) these three actors I believe did there parts tremendously and although the relinquishing of the directors title of Chris Columbus I did enjoy this movie, here's hoping that Goblet of Fire is better. I guess that depends on Mike Newell however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm 16 years old and a very big harry potter fan i have read all of the five books currently written and am very much anticipating the 6th. after watching the third movie, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban i have to say that i was hugely disappointed. this move does not compare with the book, vital scenes were missed from the film which were great in the book. the layout of the castle grounds were changed massively, i feel that this let the film down. Dumbledores character was replaced (i know that this is because of the sad passing of the character who played dumbledores character in the other two movies) but their new actor (Ian Mackelen) i feel does not resemble dumbledore in anyway, the way he dresses, talks and even the small things like his beard. i feel that his acting in the third film does not even compete with the dumbledore who acted in movies one and two. this film for me, is unrealistic and does not come close to the other two moves. yes i know that the other two aren't realistic, obviously, but they made it more realistic that the third. ending was also poor, tiresome and very boring. as the characters go back in time with the timekeeper thing the whole scene becomes repetitive after watching the film for a second time i turned off at this point the rest of the film, i could watch over and over again but when it repeats itself i find myself bored. this part of the story is much better to read than portrayed at the cinema. i can read the third book over and over again enjoying it more than the last. even the whomping willow was changed, instead of having big huge branches and clubs for branches it was thin and looked like a regular tree. i also cant wait for the fourth film to be released, harry potter and the goblet of fire. the special effects should be awesome, i just hope that the fourth film does not let me down as the book is one of my favourites. maybe they should bring in the old director to put back the errors which were made in the third film such as the landscape of the castle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A darker, grungier "Potter"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alfonso Cuarón has taken the third film from popcorn culture and entered the realm of true cinema. One might, at first, be taken aback by the washed-out colors and lack of "wizard clothing" in favor of more modern "muggle" wear, but it somehow works, although I must admit to sorely missing the richness and jewel-like look of the previous two films. The sets and props are darker as well and even Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry takes on an almost dilapidated, sinister look for this scarier installment.The children are becoming accomplished and experienced actors in their own right and one can only hope that future directors aren't stupid enough to call for a new cast as the films progress. There is a great deal of talk about how Radcliff and friends are "outgrowing" their roles, but the truth of the matter is that they are maturing in proportion to their characters as the stories progress; unless there is another delay in filming or in the release of future books, there is no reason that these talented youngsters can't make it through to the very end.The only criticism for this film is that one really needs to read the book first, as the writers have left out a great deal of important information that could and should have been retained. We could have had a little less of the Knight Bus antics and special effects and more information about the originators of the Marauders Map, Harry's parents, Sirius Black and the symbology of Harry's patronus charm. Friends who were ignorant of the books that accompanied me to see this film felt completely lost, especially at the end. The point of making a film based upon a book is that one should not have to read the book first ? but in this case, you should!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happened to this movie? I don't think it was as good as the first 2 movies! The first 2 were awesome! I really believe they should have never changed directors! From what I heard this director never even read any of the Potter books! The actors and actresses were awesome as usual! And maybe they could have spent a bit more money on making professor Dumbledore a bit more like the original Dumbledore! This one seems to be way more younger then the first one! With all the special effects they put in this movie they could have done something with his voice to sound older and to make him look older! As I said before kudos to the actors and actresses for their hard work! The story did not follow the book what so ever! Overall I was a bit disappointed in this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a movie, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkhaban' falls somewhat short of the novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the Theater in the hopes of another great adaptation of J.K. Rowlings fantastic series and came away somewhat disappointed. There was so much that had been left out of the movie. Gryffindor winning the quidditch cup, Ron and Harry having a huge fight with Hermione over the Firebolt and refusing to even speak with her, The significance of Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. The movie left you wondering how Professor Lupin knew that the map was even a map, or how he knew to work it. Harry attacks Snape in the shrieking shack and the school year just continues on for him? Snape does nothing about it? On another note I felt that the acting jobs of the three main characters was done fairly well. Emma Watson seems to be leading the pack in acting abilities and I wish that screenwriters would allow Rupert's character to develop more fully. In the books Ron is a colorful and fun character and is a great contrast to both Harry and Hermione. As for the newly added cast, David Thewlis did a terrible job as Professor Lupin, but I suspect that has more to do with a poor choice of Director, rather than Thewlis' acting abilities. I do actually like the additional scenes of the school, the showing of the grounds, etc. It gives Hogwarts more the feel of a real place. I have since watched the movie a couple of times on DVD at home and have become more comfortable with it, but no matter what I do I can't get past Lupin's rushed lines in his various discussions with Harry. Sorry but it really lowered my opinion of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I have to say that I love the books and I'm really fond of the Prisoner of Azkaban. I didn't like the previous Harry Potter movies at all because the acting was just so bad. And it hasn't improved much.The thing I liked about this movie was Alfonso Cuaróns directing. The area of Hogwart was also more beautiful than it had been in the previous movies. Emma Thompson was quite good as Professor Sybil Trelawney and Rupert Grint was again funny as Ron Weasley.The thing I don't like about movies that are based on books is that they don't leave anything to your imagination. And again this movie ruined a little bit of my reading experience but not as strongly as the previous Harry Potter movies. I think that if you haven't read the books you really like these movies.I wish that they'd stop producing Harry Potter movies because even though I haven't liked them I still have to go and watch them in the hope that this one will be better.So the conclusion: If you're a Harry Potter book-freak, don't watch this. If you haven't read any of them, watch this because it is a beautiful movie and the story is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry, Ron and Hermione are growing up, in this film. In fact i thought this was the best out of the three films. For a stat, the narrative of the film, and the plot change near the end. Completely twisting at the end was a good way in the book, and works even better on film.Being from the UK, the use of British actors (Mark Williams - Mr Weasly, Lenny Henry - Shrunken Head, Dawn French - Fat Lady, Tomothy Spall - Peter Pettergrew) made this a fun movie to watch. Not only that, but the whole way it was shot.. Marvaolus.Some of the film however didn't make for good movie sequences. Like harry invisible cloack. In the first films, everything that was held outside the cloack, you could see harry's hand. However in this one, Objects just floated.However the casting for this was awesome, the shots were amazing, and well the film was just right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the book. I have seen all three movies. I did enjoy PoA. With that said, I really did not like it as a part of the series. As a film, in its own right, it's not bad. Way too stylish for my tastes, however. Too many wide angle, fish-eye lens shots, way, way too much color alteration. Result: a very MTV look. I'm not impressed by these devices. They only detract from the story. As a filmmaker myself, I'm very familiar with the techniques used in the film to achieve that look. I don't dislike them. I just don't care for them in this series. Overall, the film was enjoyable as a stand alone film, not as a part of the Harry Potter FILMS. Notice I didn't say "BOOKS". Films and Books are two different media. Incomparable. But adaptations of books to film, DO have to maintain consistency in the message and theme. I did notice some annoying things, the obvious deletion, or alteration of certain characters, items, places, locations. Now, not having read the book, perhaps most of my criticisms/observations are unfounded, since, many of these points might be explained in the book. Here's a somewhat humorous (i hope) list of things I found distracting. Here we go. Enjoy...Why does the headmaster's nails look so dirty, long, and sinister now? Where's little sister Weasley who had a crush on Harry?Where's Q coach Wood?Where's Colin? Why the increase in "minority" students when they weren't there in such numbers before? They should have been there from the beginning. To change it now, seems like the director is making a racial statement. Too obviously well placed in each shot. It felt like a political campaign photo-op. Distracting. Why did Hagg's house move location down the hill away from the castle? To seem much more sinister?Why did Hogwarts move location? Again, to seem much more sinister?Where did the Stonehenge druid stones come from, making Hogwarts and Hagg's house seem much more sinister?Why did the Womping Willow move location conveniently away from the school (and help from teachers) during the attack?Why did we need to see the relocated Womping WIllow smote birds all the time? Again, more sinister? What happened to Percy? He's now a whiny wimp nobody listens to in the hallway, as opposed to a whiny wimp people listened to previously. Why are the students not wearing their uniforms or wearing them in a very hip-hop, "progressively" sloppy way? What's the statement the director is trying to make, that they're more "mature" and "cool"? On a related note, why is Malfoy, alone, wearing his uniform correctly? Is this clear difference in the book? Are those really Malfoy's two friends from the previous films, or did one of them get replaced? Why does Hagg's cry at the lakeside seem so poorly acted? And why is his hair a continuity mistake no one noticed? Why does the word "brilliant", as in, "... it's brilliant" get constantly uttered? Where did Prof. Snape come from during the full moon event? He suddenly shows up, starting to scold Potter, not noticing an 8 foot tall werewolf transforming two meters away. Why do so many of the sets and locations look more like something out of Fight Club than a British boarding school, magic or otherwise?With that said, I did like the ending, and the whole time travel bit. It was cleverly done.Is it a prerequisite for the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor to be the crux and/or villain of the story? This makes 3 for 3 doesn't it? Also, it's annoying when characters or plot points are introduced and then dropped off quickly after their "gimmick" is done. This is particularly obvious in sequels and/or series films. Examples I noticed were: the girl ghost in the bathroom, the House selection ceremony, Harry's aunt and uncle having personalities, Headmaster's phoenix, Prof. Mag having more than one speaking scene, The appearance of a music teacher who is not introduced but is seen in the great hall, the divination prof. who is not seen in the great hall but is seen in her classes, the mandrake growing prof from HP2, who is not seen in the great hall, in her greenhouse, or anywhere else in the film, the magic car, Ron's broken wand, the hydraulic Loader Ripley uses to defeat the Alien Queen. oops, sorry, wrong film. I don't want the film to explain everything. Of course not. But there are certain "beats" to every story that must be shown or given some treatment, however brief, to let the audience in on the act. (Pun intended)Now, I know different directors have different takes on the same story. And characters are supposed to develop, and all. But there seemed to be a concerted effort to make this one very different from the previous two. It was a daring risk to take, when the previous two were beloved by millions. Comments by some of those millions who were not pleased with the changes in tone and approach are right here on IMDb. Multiply them by hundreds of thousands, and you get the idea. Personally, I hope the next installment will resemble the first two more than the third. And will somebody please move Haggards house back up the mysteriously appearing hill, and put it near the castle again. Those mudslides must be murder!HR</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful skilled directing and incredible film, but missing plot and story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Harry Potter, and "Prisoner of Azkaban" is my favourite book. The series has taken a large step in a new direction, from the two first Columbus made films. An understandable choice.What's wonderful about the stories is the way things are introduced as one thing and often turns out to be something else or have a significant role later on. A wonderful thing about the books, and therefor saying "Prisoner of Azkaban" is the best is not saying that much. But "Azkaban" has some more important elements of seriousness and it is where, for me, the real story starts, where the fight between good and evil really starts. The two prior stories is an introduction to persons, with Harry and Tom Riddle as the most important. So I had some what high expectations to the film. They where mostly fulfilled, although I found quit a lot of holes. The news of Cuaron as Director had me some concerned, although it didn't scare me off, far from it. But when I heard of his work with Practical Magic on set, I actually found my self looking forward to the film. As always the film has the same magic to it as the books, the locations, sets and magic is fantastic, but by now that shouldn't be a problem for them. Rather what is the problem is story and acting. For once the acting is of a quality seldom seen in family films. Cuaron has made a great job with the young actors, and some of the scenes actually out matches the good old thesps. Incredible to see the actors growth that way, how they evolve into the characters. This is something I really appreciate. It makes this much darker installment of the series more realistic and gives a feel of the story, that to some degree lacked in the two prior. The cast is good and solid, really works out fine, although Gambon as Dumbledore is a hard one to swallow after Harris' take on the role. But the rest is great, and most of all believable in their role, even Thewlis works as Lupin, although it is quit another direction from anything else i've seen him in.Cuaron's feel is in the movie. It is a director movie if anything, the use of cameras and it's movements, symbols and images that is repeated through out the films, long shots rather than fast editing and it work so well, it looks amazing, Prisoner is an example of what you get if a director is taken from the smaller movies where he had artistic liberty to the major films in Hollywood, would love if more films where like that. It is something few still possesses in Hollywood, like David Fincher and others. The long shots with dialog are impressive, and explains quit a large deal of the background of Harry and therefor some plots of the future films. And they again show the work between director and actors. The story is quit a problem, the important stories are as they are in the books, but being a director with his own ideas, Cuaron has changed some smaller parts to fit his vision and the movie, a shame, cuz somethings have a innocence in the book that the movie hasn't, and somethings are much more significant to the story than the film implies. They are the animagus-plot, Snapes connection to Black and co., some of the "erotic" feelings between the three friends, to soon in my opinion, and the fact that scenes are cut, most likely due to time constrains, fulfilling Trelawney's prophecy.As a fan I know much of the background and plot, but I figure that people who haven't read the books doesn't get the whole picture, a shame, cuz in Prisoner there lies so many things that explains who Harry's parents is and who his parents friends is. Guess they have to read the books then. As a series fan i'm sad that many things are missing, as a movie fan i'm impressed with the treatment of the media, which looks so great it blows me away, as a fan of both I'll give it 9, for the effort and the feel of the film, and because I know i'll be watching it again and again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some parts are very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the third instalment in the Harry Potter series, following on from the Philosophers Stone (2001) and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) I went to the cinema on the day it came out, expecting the film to be better than the first two. How wrong I was. The story revolves around Harry's third year at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, alongside his two best friends, Hermione and Ron. Harry's life becomes endangered after the mass-murderer Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban; everyone says that he escaped to come and kill Harry.There are some fun and exciting scenes, such as the Knight Bus scene and the time - turning. But there are so, so many mistakes made, it is hard to count them all. Firstly, I believe that the new direction is not a very sensible idea, as the new director changed: A) The room that was the Great Hall B) Hagrid's Hut - It somehow doubled in size and the location was 100% different C) The fat lady - A completely different person, and the portrait hole was in a different location. D) The uniform was also differentThose are to name just a few - but a lot of things were so wrong. It is unfair on the viewers to suddenly make these dramatic changes. It doesn't matter if the director has changed or not, because they can still use the old set, as it was a lot better than the new one. This is quite a good film for the girls, however, as Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) has a major role in this production, and is nearly the very main lead. Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) hasn't got such a large role in this, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is just a tiny fraction ahead of Emma Watson.Overall, I think this film is OK, but certainly not as good as the first two, and the third book. It is a pity, because the third book is my favourite, but the third film...isn't. But even if it isn't up to the high standards of the first two, I still recommend it, as a lot of people have totally different opinions on this production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great adaptation belongs to Thewlis and Cuaron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics of this film should just stop complaining and watch it for what it really is, a great, if very probably difficult adaptation to produce. The book I think most people will undoubtedly agree is one of the best in the series, containing all that is going to be hard isn't it. I agree that the changes that were made were unnecessary, moving Hagrid's hut and the whomping willow, but don't critics get it, the changes actually I think bring the film closer to the book than the first two. David Thewlis as Lupin just stole the film, he made it feel as if he was always on screen he had such presence. Gary Oldman was just great as Sirius Black, if only they had more screen time. Alfonso Cuaron, I just can't praise enough his influence on the film, it feels less like a bad children's film franchise now, and more like the magical world it was meant to be. Visually his influence is most notable, but I think the difference in all the actors shows as well. The harry potter world has grown up, just like it did in the book, and it got a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me be honest here, I'm fully signed up to the "Harry Potter is an irritating little git" brigade. But then, that's what hype does for you. No, I've never actually read one of the books at publication and, if I did (which is unlikely), it certainly wouldn't be in a breathless dash to the finish line along with 10 squillion others (usually to be found on tubes trains to work, on park benches or other public places as if to say "Look! I'm reading the new Harry Potter!"). Harry Potter is great stuff but, please, keep it indoors people.So, having overcome my in-built inhibitions, what of this third Potter epic? This could well turn out as the best of a very impressive series. Visually stunning and brimming with inventiveness, this owes something to the weird and wonderful likes of the "Singing Ringing Tree" and the warped vision of stop motion-master Jan Svankmeyer (Alice). Not the sort of thing one expects from a movie aimed at the average 14 year old. Its power to scare and thrill in equal measure is a tribute to director Cuaron and his team. So if you're still a Potter cynic, who can blame you. But if you love fantasy cinema, don't ignore this film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film very good, as an adaption from a novel not so good.What I mean here is that the film looks lovely, the actors (children as well as adults) give creditable performances and the special effects are well produced, as a film there's little to criticize. The problem comes from the fact that you only get a skeletal sketch of the novel itself.Most people have criticized the film for not explaining fully the marauders map for instance, however, the problem goes deeper then this. The time it took for harry to produce a petronus was greater, giving Lupin and Harry time to converse (I don't remember walks on bridges or woods). But what I found most astonishing was (unless I've missed it) the lack of explanation as to why Snape loathed the Potters, Sirius and Lupin - this is really quite central to Snape/Harry relation, and if it was covered it was fleeting. All in all the novel had a good deal more depth and detail then was in the film. Perhaps if the director didn't waste time on unfunny shrunken heads he could have added more detail that was actually in the book.If you haven't read the novels or are quite content with the essence of the book then this should prove to be a very enjoyable film. If you have read the novel you may find yourself grumbling slightly under you breath but you will still enjoy the film - just don't be too literal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only does "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" manage to shed most of the syrupy "kid-stuff" atmosphere of its predecessors, it comes amazingly close to the status of a true fantasy classic.Fresh, original and creative, this film is visually and subtextually unpredictable; the change of directors stands out like a breath of fresh air. Even the musical score is a major improvement. This is saying a lot... I enjoyed the first two movies, in particular the second. This one I enjoyed on a much different and 'higher' level. It is in fact "darker" than the first two as often claimed, but still quite appropriate for kids. What really makes this one different is that it's appropriate for adults as well... parents, go see and enjoy this one with your kids.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is a new dark turn for the Harry Potter series. This movie focuses on emotions of Harry and his friends, rather more than what is going around the castle. In this movie there are many new elements that are quite exciting. The whomping willow is explained, the night bus is introduced, we meet 2 new main characters for the first time, we see Harry, Ron and Hermione start coming into their own - having romantic feelings, realizing who they are as people, having more to say about what goes around them.The aspect of time plays a very big part in this movie, and it was done brilliantly. There is only 2 faults I found in the movie. 1) It wasn't long enough, and 2) A few important things in the movie were introduced, but not explained.However, this movie is very good, and does J.K.

		<fullReview>Ah, watching this was very much like the book's lines were mended into pictures. Well... almost most, they are indeed a great film.Shortly before this film was made, i was worried that the new director will kill off Harry Potter and turn this into some "Dangerous mind on magical school of death." but i was wrong. The director was good. Not brilliant, good. but that's still good.The personality of the cast was magnificent. And the Hippogriff, oh my god, he looked so real. I mean really, real. As if he existed. Not some phony graphics you see on computers that looked clunky and cheesy with no personality. This bests the graphics along with Gollum and Dobby the house elf.I never expect Gary Old man or the other guy who plays Remus, sorry Remus, but these two are my most favorite characters in the existence. i always picture Remus as a great father figure. I always wished he were my dad. but that ain't happening folks. Not that i don't like my dad.Sirius Black, i pictured him more handsome but frightening looking because be has been sent to azkaban for twelve years.Remus Lupin, i was thinking of young Obi Wan Kenobi. But hey, it wasn't that bad. Sure i mean, the mustache thing? Bad. get rid of it next time. But they were great. Their acting was great. I was afraid that this actor who portrays Remus would act like Lockhart or Quirrell. But he was close to what i pictured him.now, the thing i love the director about, he got rid of some scenes that seems too repulsive in the book. Sorry JK Rowling, but your story had bits of nauseating moments. But love them all to death still.Well... i hope the next sequel will be the biggest hit than this. Let's hope. but not too high.

And what was with tom the barkeeper he turned all goofy and weird, and even though tom felton did a great performance as Malfoy his character was sissy than ever...Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a fairly good entertaining movie but it was missing stuff the other two potter movie's had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Treat For Fans, Mediocre For Others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not particularly a fan of Harry Potter, although I understand the over-hype and fever thats hit the young impressionable youths of the world. The movies are always just a little over-rated due to the expectancy of them. Yet regardless of this they remain entertaining with a good contrast of British cast with only a few exceptions (Oldman). I acknowledge Gary Oldman as a good actor for his diversity of roles (Murder In The 1st - 5th Element) and he plays his role very well in this. Daniel Radcliffe is a bit weak in the lead and although it is a role that carries pressure with it hand in hand he does his best. Radcliffe for his age is not a bad actor but not a very good one, the same could be said for his counterparts (Grint and Watson). Although this cannot be overcome the fact the cast is mainly youngsters takes a chip of the overall acting quality as none of them are outstanding, and few satisfactory. The movie is made primarily for youngsters, the dark contrast of Cuaron's directing clashes with this leaving a mixed mood of film. This is not always a bad thing but for something that should be consistent its a disadvantage. Grint adds some comic relief whilst Watson looks good for the young men watching. The Potter films are average in an ever growing fantasy genre but will be forgotten soon after the hype which is catapulting it to such success that the second movie is the third highest grossing. Then again Titanic wasn't the greatest piece of film art, when putting any Harry Potter film next to any Lord of The Rings film it puts into context the sheer mediocrity of the Potter films, only catapulted to such extreme success due to the volatile and fickle interests of a young and naive audience. Overall, entertaining if your into fantasy, average if your not. 6.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done movie, got away from being too childish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read all of the Harry Potter books 10 times each and I'm a huge fan, which also sets me up to not like the movies. I liked the first two movies. I was worried about this movie because the book starts to get darker and I was afraid it wouldn't be captured in the right way. Alfonso Cuaron did an amazing job with the cameras and the movie turned out very well. The one let down may be that if you hadn't read the book, you wouldn't understand some of the story that somewhat is useful to know later in the books...I don't know about the movies. The casting for the movie was excellent, at least in my opinion. I imagined Sirius Black, and the other new characters exactly as they are in the movie. Gary Oldman is the perfect Sirius Black. However, I didn't picture Remus Lupin to look like David Thewlis, but still a good job with the casting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To answer your question, he appears as that because a true patronus takes the shape of something that truly protects you. That is the animal that Harry's dad transformed into (all 4 of the friends were animagus) Overall, i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and liked the new director much better than the other one, though he was good too.As to other plot holes, most of it is things they left out from the book that they don't show happening but also don't show NOT happening. That tends to happen often in book-to-movie films. I think they did a superb job at not making it to long with tedious facts from the book and not leaving enough out to go too far out from the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>hmmm, not much to say about this movie, I guess. I thought it was better than the first 2 movies. The acting was a lot better too, I really think you can see that the actors have grown during the movies. I've read all the books (until the 5th one) and I sometimes think somethings are left behind, which were quite important in the book. (I can't think of one at the moment, but I do know it is!) I really wonder what the next movies are gonna be like. I hope that they hury up with the books, before Harry, Ron and Harmoine are grown up and they have to find new actors, I think that would really be sad. I love prof. lupin btw! I've seen him as the bad guy in Dragonheart (God I hated him in that movie, spoiled little prince) But he's REALLY freakin' cool as a werewolf :D I like this one! Keep up the good work guys, now that you've got a good movie of Harry Potter, DON'T MESS IT UP AGAIN!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 2nd time is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie the second and third time I watched it better than the first. There is so much to see and comprehend that it really needs to be watched more than once. The only problem I find with the movie is the confusing and seemingly flawed time-travel sequence when Harry and Hermione travel back in time. It still doesn't make sense to me even after seeing it three times. Some of the movie seems to be disorganized as if it was made-up on site during filming. It is refreshing to see the darker side of Harry Potter and a new independence that he has developed with age. There is much anger in the movie and it is definitely much darker than the first two movies. It is a good movie, albeit flawed, and worth watching more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER - likes and dislikes of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These comments focus on the effects etc. of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and make brief comparisons to the past Harry Potter FilmsI was particularly impressed with Lupin's transformation from human to werewolf - the look of pain in his eyes, the way they changed colour (contacts) and how it looks as though the werewolf was trapped inside him and was breaking out - as if his exterior ripped away to reveal the core. The idea of having the water bottle turn to ice on the train was great - showing that it made them feel cold and icy. John Williams has as usual provided great music that completes the movie. I think it is great that they've changed the look of hogwarts castle in this film to its predecessors. For example the giant pendulum and the covered bridge. It gives a feeling that hogwarts is always changing - just as you think you know your way around it. Michael Gambon has taken on the role of Dumbledore well, i like the way he appeared to make the candle go out and come back on again as he was speaking - it kept interest.I was not happy in the change to malfoys hair - it started long and slicked back which suited him perfectly - now its short and doesn't look quite so evil anymore. There is a lot more emotion and even occasional physical contact in this film as opposed to the previous ones. Hermione reaching for Ron's hand for example. The choir at the start of term suited hogwarts very well - especially as lots of them were holding toads etc. Finally, this is a much darker film and we learn a lot more bad things - particularly about Harry's family. Although this is necessary to the future plot i think there should have been a few more contrasting scenes of happiness and joy - it feels the same sort of darkness all the way through!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie in June, now also on DVD. It's really strange.I saw the first two movies and I think that I like better Christopher Columbus as a director of HP.It was quite annoying-the way Alfonso Cuaron changed all little things like clothes, appearances, new look of the whole wizard's world.I didn't like these shrunk heads, Sirius Black's tattoos, Lupin's scars, and all final scenes - they were like a huge mess!Oh, and the werewolf - wereWOLF, I said - it was looking like something bald and strange! The most horrible thing is that some really important informations were missing in the movie, eg. - the whole background story of Marauder's Map, troubles with Crookshanks, Black appearance in boys dormitory.Next: too much moments showing Harry-Hermione-Ron relationships; I think it's too early for thing like that:), instead of that Mr Cuaron should have make some parts of the movie longer. On the other hand, Hogwarts is even more beautiful than it was before.Buckbeak is a well-made, lovely creature.And actors.They are rescuing the movie.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are acting much better than before, they are really good.Michael Gambon is not my Dumbledore.But Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman and David Thewlis - I must admit I like them the most-they're perfect.Oh, and Emma Thompson as well:). Fortunately the next movie will be directed by someone else.I hope there will be no more such changes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Prisoner of Azkaban was my second favorite book. The movie was to short,and to chopped up. I was disappointed to say the least. I'm so afraid my favorite, The Goblet of Fire, which is full of so much action and story, will be my biggest disappointment unless, this new director hears our voices. WE LIKE THREE HOUR HARRY POTTER MOVIES. PLEASE DON"T LEAVE US FEELING CHEATED Again. I don't know about anyone else I left the theater feeling unfulfilled and cheated after waiting so long to see it. My question is why was it so short? If this is what this new director is going to do next time he makes a Harry Potter movie, he should not waste our time and money. I want the old director back. Sad and disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8?/10 [with explanation]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[Caution: May contain spoilers]My rating: 8?/10Why?Best installment of the series so far, in my opinion. The new director added more punch and character to the film, whereas the first two seemed a bit wooden. Some complain that the grounds of Hogwarts changed; I say it's about time. The new, more interesting terrain seems more realistic and beautiful, so that you can see why the students like it. The flat, treeless plains of the first two movies were unattractive and dull; I'd rather stay indoors.The acting improved greatly on this film. Emma Watson, who already proved herself competent in the first two, really shines in PoA [and is getting rather pretty as well: perfect timing with the Yule Ball coming up...]. Rupert Grint is good, as well, and Daniel Radcliffe, though he needs more improvement, is getting better as the series progresses. The new actors...well, they're good for the most part; I just don't agree with some of the choices. Emma Thompson is brilliant in the part of Trelawny, bringing that frenzied, bug-eyed woman to screen excellently. Gary Oldman and David Thewlis also played well, but I don't agree with casting them in the first place. Also, as it was a rather large burden, Michael Gambon did okay in the part of Dumbledore, though he didn't bring us the twinkle-eyed old wizard Richard Harris gave us.The movie was darker than the previous two, and rightly so. Now we have dementors, a supposed murderer [and the real one], more mysteries and secrets, all leading up to the dark climax of Goblet of Fire. The pace is quicker [though some more details might have been nice], but the movie flows a whole lot better than the first two.--</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the book not to long ago. It was very interesting to find the the movie is missing loads of important details. It was a small disappointment to see that the movie only had a fraction of the details that the book had. I am hoping that when the goblet of fire is finished that it matches the book a lot more then this one did. I have read the goblet of fire as well and I could not put it down. I have a feeling that this movie to will be a bit of a disappointment. I do think that the actors and actresses are great but I don't think that this movie was put together that well. I think that the director could have done a better job at putting the movie together. To be completely honest, the movie left me a bit confused as to what has going on and how thing had happened. All in all, I hope the the next one will be a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now we're getting to the meaty stuff. Harry cops an attitude! As the children become adolescents, the filmmaking skills surrounding them mature also. Alfonso Cuarón confidently adopts and revitalises a well established cinematic world designed by Chris Columbus. The visual effects are now tighter than ever; the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking; and Radcliffe and his teenage co-stars are now steady on their feet.What shines through in this third instalment that didn't quite make it in the first two is the rich and emotional story, as Harry struggles not only with new revelations about his past, but with ordinary life as a teenage boy as well. New recruits Oldman and Thewlis are fantastic together, and Gambon's turn as Dumbledore (after Richard Harris' regrettably short run) breathes new life into the character, and it's remarkable.Looking great and sounding great was accomplished by Columbus. This one looks and sounds better, and feels awesome too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I loved this movie better than the other two films, but I also hated it. When i watch the film and just watch the film without trying to analyze whats happening I think it is amazing. But, when I compare it to the book and see all of the crucial information that was left out, I really don't like it. I mean, the least they could do was explain what and who moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs were. And also why Harry's patronus took the form that it did. But no, that would just be silly to have people actually understand the movie. OK, sorry, I got a little off track.I do have to admit that the special effects and the acting was very good in this, at least compared to the other two movies. I still like this movie even when I compare it to the book, I just wish they would have went a little more in depth with it. I mean, out of the three books it is the longest, but out of the movies its the shortest. I think there is something a little wrong with that picture. I'm hoping GOF with explain things a little better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter is back for his best film yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The start of Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is threatened by the escape from Azkaban Prison of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), Voldemort's murderous henchman who betrayed Harry's parents, getting them killed. Along with this pals Hermione and Ron Weasley, Harry must try to stay one step ahead of Black while dealing with the new school year and the horrifying Dementors, Azkaban's jail keepers that now surround the school.After two sold entries in the Harry Potter franchise, the third film really kicks things up. It's a fantastic film with gorgeous special effects and lots of entertaining moments. There's a new switch behind the camera and I like Alfonso Cuarón more than Chris Columbus. Alfonso Cuarón put a lot more "magic" and soul into the project while Columbus made the first two films kind of bland. He is a very vanilla like director whereas Alfonso is more fast paced and exciting. This entry is a little more different since they leave out more parts from the book and it's more action. This didn't bother me because the film was more energetic but non readers of the book may be annoyed by this.The acting was pretty good and it was a lot better than the first two entries. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter and he's improving. He's still lacking a little in the emotional scenes though. Emma Watson plays Hermione and she's probably the best of the three. Rupert Grint was okay as Ron though he is the weakest of the three. There is a new Dumbledore in this film as Michael Gambon replaces the late great Richard Harris. He doesn't play the role as well but it's still pretty good. Emma Thompson plays Professor Sybil Trelawney and she does a pretty good job. However, her character isn't in the film that much which is too bad. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was okay, nothing really special.The only problem I had with the movie was that it went by too fast. They could have added some more scenes so the story was told better. Besides for that, the book's magic seems to have been captured. The dialog is all sharp and funny. The direction is great and the acting is good. The special effects are amazing and the film is just beautiful to look at. People who are bashing this movie are most likely just bitter book nerds. Not all of them are but it seems to me that most are. In the end, the movie is great and it's worth checking out. Rating 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of three.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely the best Harry Potter movie to date. I am actually quite surprised that this film got by the MPAA with only a PG rating (It really feels like it should have been PG-13.) And that's a good thing. Cuaron's direction is much darker than Columbus' previous two and the three main leads seem more comfortable in there roles than ever before. The performances are much stronger and the subject matter is much more developed than what we've come to expect from this franchise. Cuaron's transitions between scenes and the note on which he ends the film (Does anyone remember freeze-frames?) really add to the visual style and in my opinion give the film a much more ominous impact. Not to mention that there is barely a frame in this film with any sunlight (Think Tim Burton's Batman.) The end result is a very engrossing and entertaining mainstream film that will be enjoyed by even the most sophisticated moviegoer but may actually scare the little ones a bit!</fullReview>

Although it didn't perfectly follow the book (what movie does?) it was good. Here were some things i Didn't like though:The werewolf: He was bald. BALD. Need i say more? Sirius: OK, i loved the actor and all (he was good in the Scarlet Letter) but i think that he didn't do his best. Jim Cavesial (s/p?) would have been better.Dumbledore: I think everyone agrees with me that this Dumbledore sucked. The first one (i don't know the actors names) was better. I got the feeling that he knew EVERYTHING going on. HE was graceful, wise, and refined. This one was dressed as a hobo, had a PONY TAIL IN HIS BEARD and acted clumsily. The first one sort of glided. The second stomped. His hair was short, wavy, and gray. Overall, i hated him. If i were to say the one think i hated in this movie, it was him. Anyone would have been better.Alfanzo: Hated the director. Cristopher Columbus was way better. IT kept shifting to much and left little explanation. My mother, who has never read the books (but seen all the movies) kept asking me what was going on.Hermione: OK, first of all i LOVE emma watson. I just didn't care for her ooc (out of character) comment about her hair"Does my hair really look like that from the back?"Hermione Granger as J.K wrote her would have never , EVER said anything like that. I also don't care for Emmas short hair, and nearly going blonde. Its VERY OOC.Well, thats about it. Everything else was great. All in all, i rate it a 8/10 and am definitely going to buy the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An edgier, darker, more mature Harry returns to Hogwarts School with his friends Hermione and Ron ready to take on yet another adventure in his world of wizardry. New characters, mixed in with the old, is the precise recipe for a great sequel that is followed perfectly by director Alfonso Cuarón. Kudos to Cuarón and Warner Brothers for matching story to artist with seamless accuracy.Harry and friends become embroiled within the fascinating story of murder and revenge as Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), an old friend of Harry's father, escapes the wizard prison of Azkaban where he has been held for 12 years. Accused of murder, Black seeks to reveal the truth about all things, mostly about what happened that mystical night when Harry escaped Lord Voldemort's wrath long ago. Werewolves, Animagis, and the growth of already established characters make this film by far the best of the three. With fresh faces and a fresh story (unlike "Chamber of Secrets", which is essentially a continuation of the first film), the "Prisoner of Azkaban" is a delight for young and old.</fullReview>

Rupert, Daniel and Emma were amazing once again playing Ron, Harry and Hermione. I've noticed they have developed the characters well and make themselves come off as good well-known actors. I hope they don't stop filming after the fourth movie because I'd hate to see Rupert, Daniel and Emma go. The ending was completely surprizing to me and as was to my friends too.

These films were so fantastic and sweet, that I asked my mum to send me the books, so I could compare them with the movies. When I read them, I was surprised that the content of the films is following that one from the original book. I read the five books for Harry till now and I can't wait to read the next one? When it will be ready? Also I am desperate to see the next movie (4-th one). I hope it will be as interesting as the book by J.K.Rolling is. Congratulations to everybody who worked hard for us, the audience, so that we can read and see, and admire that fantasy story! I love you very much, Creators of Harry Potter, because you gave me one more reason to fight and survive in today's cruel world! Thank you for the smiles on my face while I was watching the films!

I thought it was so cool when Harry was flying Buckbeak for the first time. It was cool that they added some comedy to it, too- Hermione especially. ("Come and get your nice dead ferret!") I was booing at Draco, clapping when Hermione punched him, and basically cried at the end because I didn't want to end. I'm a Harry Potter freak. I can't talk for anyone else.

		<shortDescription>Better Than the First Two!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J.K. Rowling showed the world the boy wizard on paper, a place where he could be whatever we wanted him to be. Now that he is on the silver screen, the audience is given a wonderful view of how one person sees the magical world of Hogwarts. However, for some people, if a director strays from the source material even a hair, the movie is immediately deemed a failure. What these people (fondly known as 'potheads') don't understand is that the books they love are many hours in length and the movies have a time crunch of 21/2 hours. And the movies are also based on the books. If a viewer can swallow that fact that movie is not the book, then The Prisoner of Azcaban will come off as an excellent film. If not, then the differences from the book will most likely distract from the fabulous scenery, the improved actors and the inspired vision of Alfonso Cuaron. Cuaron's credits include The Little Princess and Y Tu Mama Tambien. What this movie shows is a combination of Cauron's other directorial works. He captures both innocence and the lack there of in the life of thirteen year-olds. Not to say there is promiscuous sex between Ron and Hermione in every other scene (although there is foreshadowing of a future relationship) but Prisoner of Azkaban captures the actuality of life, unlike the cookie-cutter version Chris Columbus created in the first two installments of the series. All three of the principal actors have grown in their abilities since the last film. Perhaps it's the influence of a new director or maybe it's just that they've had four or five years to finally find the characters that they are playing. The whole cast, new and old, take their roles and give them the spike they need to stand out as their own. They are aided by a script that does not demand they recite such wooden dialogue as they did in the first two. The script is also much braver in cutting out material that would not have helped but just taken up time. This is where the potheads get angry but in fact this is just what the series needed.Of course, this is not a perfect movie. It still has a bit of the sense of being very rushed (although not nearly as bad as the first one) and it has some scenes that leave the viewer thinking 'What??'. For example, there are a couple points in the movie where story is going smoothly and then, we're walking in the garden with Lupin and Harry or we're in Lupin's office with Harry and the Professor. For a student-teacher relationship, they seem to be very good friends. Their friendship does exist in the book but not quite to the point where the movie uses it. Still, it's the only falture in the script to expand upon what's already there.It's a shame that Cuaron is not staying on, but with much of his crew and the whole cast are staying, perhaps the Potter films are headed for a bright future. Prisoner of Azkaben is a better film than both its predecessors. ***1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding....If you thought the first 2 were good then you Have to see this one, it is incredibly good. I loved it!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was outstanding! I absolutely loved it. I recommend it to anyone who is in for an exciting hilarious film, but also has enough time to spare, because it is nearly 3 hours, but it well worth the time. I will have to say that the book is better, because the movie left out many things (such as who actually made the mauanders map and other things), but the director did ant excellent job without making it like 10 hours long.In this movie everyone is getting better and better looking I was like OMG all the guys are hot! (the twins are hot, Harry is so hot, Ron got hot, Draco is super sexy etc.) Harry's voice has deepened and he has gotten taller and i have to admit I've formed a little crush on Daniel Radcliffe and Tom Felton, along with many of the other characters. To all you guys out there Hermione (Emma Watson) has gotten very pretty.I thought that this movie was an improvement from the other 2 films (which is saying a whole lot because the other 2 films very excellent also.) I like this one in particular because the acting skills have increased a lot (by all the actors), and this was my favorite book out of the whole series, but i also really like the 4th book, so I really recommend this book to anyone who liked the first 2 films. I give it 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror for kids!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard Alfonso Cuarón is at the helm of affairs for Harry Potter III, I was a bit skeptical owing to his reputation for Y Tu.... But after watching the movie, I must admit that he has done a fantastic job. Right from the start, the movie has an eerriiee feel and most portions of the movie are dark probably signifying the rise of Voldemort in days to come. The movie also seems to the horror for kids. Major portions of the movie are shot in dark and surprisingly the Quedditch game as well.I was a disappointed with Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) as his character seemed more like a dumb moron. Richard Harris had created a regal touch to the character. Snape, McGonnagal and Malfoy had small roles compared to earlier Harry Potters. I was expecting a substantial footage and great acting from Gary Oldman. On the contrary Prof. Lupin has done a great job couple with good footage as well. A lot has been written about Emma Thompson but I particularly found her to be loud and screeching - probably thats how her character is in the book, but lets not forget that a some actors have really given different dimension on screen to their characters.A point worth mentioning Hermione Granger is growing up gracefully and I would not help admiring her (compared to Harry Potter and Ron Weasley). A very mature expressions and firm dialog delivery. The story slowly is moving ahead to create suspense of what actually happened between Voldemort and Harry Potter's parents.Just as was skeptical about Alfonso Cuarón, I am now worried about Mike Newell as Alfonso has left the benchmark way ahead and its up Mike Newell to take it forward and live upto it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best film of the three definitely. Harry, Ron and Hermione actually act like real teenagers in this film as opposed to the first two (the tension between Ron and Hermione is especially endearing, and Draco Malfoy seems to be acting more like an actual bully in this one (he seemed much too sweet in the first two movies) ) Daniel Radcliffe's acting has improved immeasurably. There were a few cringworthy moment in the film (Harry flying the Hippogriff over the lake and having a 'Titanic' moment) but generally this is a fantastic film. A lot of things in the movie made me laugh intentionally- Malfoy's "You'll regret this and your bloody chicken." Ron's disgust over Malfoy playing up his injury to get the attention of a girl then later on doing exactly the same thing with his own injury to gain Hermione's sympathy (right down to both of them claiming the limb would have to be amputated!) I loved the Snape Boggart and thought despite this film being the darkest of the three it was also the funniest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best movie of the HP series so far, 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before assessing the good point of the movie, I start with the most obvious problem: it's length. If you've read the book, you'll know that it is a complex story with rich details and background and puzzles, so a 141 minutes is too short. Consequently, the script is slightly less than perfect. Questions are left unanswered, and other details important to any HP fan were either left out or diminished. But considering that Kloves (aided by JKR) was fighting a mighty lost battle, the job he has done is truly amazing, as he nearly managed to compress and rework the story without reducing it to a pitiful broken image of the original one. He did succeed in preserving most of feelings of the novel, while adding a couple of new details (Snape's lesson about werewolves with the slides using 'lanterna magica', exiting and re-entering through the clockwork in the beginning and the end of time-turner sequence are just two excellent examples, Arthur Weasley talking to Harry standing next to Sirius Black's picture). The storyline of the movie is pretty enjoyable on its own right, even if it leaves the reader of the original novel a bit unsatisfied. I really hope that the Right Decision will be made concerning the length of the 4th movie (ie. the longer the better), as having seen this one I have no doubt that Kloves (&amp; JKR) will be more than able to cope with the script of the 4th movie given half the chance.Actors. There is no question about the adult actors being very proficient, including the new ones (Gary Oldman (as Sirius Black), Emma Thompson (as prof. Trelawney), David Thewlis (as prof. Lupin), Michael Gambon instead of the late Richard Harris (as prof. Dumbledore)). In a sense, it's a bit of an overkill: the script should have allowed more time for Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall to play. Tom Felton (as Draco Malfoy) and Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) could get better though. Felton did not manage to play the 'real Draco': sneering, rotten, ambitious, but witty, and not so helpless as in the movie - I guess this one might be partly the fault of the directing concept. Radcliffe is not that bad, but he is the main character, therefore his faults stand out the most. The good news is that overall the kids are definitely getting better. I personally think that the lowest point was the 2nd HP movie (Chamber of Secrets), where they did not act 'themselves' as in the first movie (Sorcerer's Stone) but tried to be more conscious in their acting to the effect that it was not natural at all. Now, with the 3rd movie they are much better, and a particularly spectacular improvement was shown by Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley), and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) is just great. Music. Good as usual with some new spice. John William's original score for the first 2 movies is excellent, so being excellent for the 3rd movie is old news (same characters, similar situations/places/emotions are associated to similar tunes part of the time). However, in this 3rd installment of the series, many times the music becomes integral part of the scene, driving it instead of being merely a background noise filling up gaps or conveying emotions. Traveling on the Knight's Bus; the choir in the beginning of term feast singing "something wicked this way comes"; the lesson with Lupin fighting a boggart are examples of this clever afterthought. I say afterthought, because it's apparent to me that it wasn't planned that way from the very beginning - unfortunately. If the whole movie had been interweaved with the music in all other scenes too, who knows, it might have challenged great movies with the same idea (a classical example is "Once Upon A Time In The West"). Some of the new scores could have been orchestrated more alike than the original scores to make the overall impression more 'harrypotterish'. But in overall, the music is even better then in the prequels.Directing. I just liked it. Yes it's darker then the previous ones. And more disturbing. But the original novel is getting darker, and the characters are evolving too - and so should the audience. The terrible past of Harry's parents seems to catch up with this Harry, including treason and murder, plus dark creatures enter the scene: werewolves, dementors and the like, so this is not a story about cute little kids for cute little kids anymore. I think that the makers of the movie should admit this and reflect it in the length of the forthcoming movie - oh, well, here I go again about the length of the movie. But in any case, the director was right to make this movie darker than the previous ones. Hopefully the 'home alone' feeling will be abandoned altogether for the rest of the series as well - it does not fit anymore, and Cuaron has shown a feasible alternative.Visual effects is pretty good: Buckbeak, the dementors, the patronus charm are excellent. I expected the Patronus Charm to fend off dementors as a stag, but this way it was probably better in making the impression that the Patronus is very complex and difficult and only extremely powerful wizards can perform it. The werewolf was OK, I thought it to would be more wolf-like, but I think they wanted to preserve some of it's human nature (I'm not telling which character - although one can guess by the name), so the compromise is acceptable. One thing which is (still) unsolved: the way people ride broomsticks. Acceleration, deceleration, turning, and the wind effect should be more accurately modeled with respect to clothings and hair - it doesn't look plausible most of the time. Harry riding Buckbeak is a scene beautifully done, beside being poetic.-- SPOILER --Plot (the novel). One particular thing I liked very much about it is the way it handles time traveling. Usual time travel stories go like: "one goes back, changes the past, travels back or maybe gets a little bit lost on the way, and voila, the present has been changed". No. With JKR, it's the "what you did is exactly what you've got". This has obviously been recognized and valued by the script writer so much that he added his own little sub-plot to reinforce this theme (the one with Hermione throwing snails (or stones? I couldn't make it out)).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art-house Potter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest Harry potter film is the first (and last) film to be directed by Mexican Alfonso Cuaron. He is also the films most striking (but by no means greatest) flaw. Being his big chance to break into Hollywood (and feeling the need to break out of Columbus' shadow) he overdoes the directing of this film so dramatically that you at times feel you are watching the world's mos expensive student film. One minute into the film he brings in the Dogma 95 -style hand-held camera. And throughout the film he sticks in shrunken heads (yes Alfonso, we know you are from Central America, but you ARE aware that this takes place in Britain aren't you?). THREE times we are treated to swooping shots of birds flying though the air, leaves falling off the trees etc. Like Potter himself, it felt like Cuaron was an eager adolescent trying to show off what he could do. On top of that, the architecture of Hogwarts itself was filled with freudian symbolism. Sure. In an adult movie this would be great - Cuaron should do more of those. But this is completely out of tone with the rest of the Harry Potter universe. A good (professionalistic) director knows his genre and sticks to it. This felt a bit like the Tom and Jerry episodes from the 70's where they ruined it with all kinds of modernistic, artsy-fartsy details. For all his technical show-offing, Cuaron fails to ever bring genuine suspense to the story. He simply makes it a bit more depressing and feels satisfied with that.While there is a new director, it is striking that they didn't see fit to replace the screenwriter Steve Kloves. His truly uninspiring, and unimaginative paint-by-numbers adaptation of the books worked acceptably in the first films, since the books were almost like screenplays themselves. Yet in this film he leaves out the most important points in the story - and misses some perfect opportunities to add depth to the storytelling with the flashbacks, and dreams abundant in the books. And the humor and self-irony that characterized the books is completely absent here. One glimpse of imagination, and the only truly outstanding feat of the movie, is the cinematography. Micheal Seresin does his best to make up with visual style where the story lacks. Unfortunately, this is not enough. Sad, since this could have been the most creative and deep of the films. Instead it just seems like a less fun version of the same thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Most Ways, this was a let-down. SPOILERS TO FOLLOW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Warning! Spoilers throughout**In most ways, Azkaban was a let-down. However, it did continue one important aspect that has made the movies thus far so popular. The characters are dead-on from the books. Especially here, where Sirius Black and the Dementors are such crucial elements in how Harry's life and power as a young wizard continue to unfold. Trelawney is her airy fairy" self to a T. Excellent job there. Lupin came to life on screen in a way he didn't for me in the book. I'll even go against most "Potter Purists" and say I loved the a capella arrangement at the beginning. Rowling's genius is in creating such a wonderfully detailed world that her readers are drawn in; here, the decision to hint at Hogwarts activities that we've yet to see (ie-a choral program) is in keeping with this and cleverly done. All that being said, I left the theater hugely disappointed. The further the behaviors, conversations, events and characters strayed from the previous HP movies and the books, the worse the experience became. Some of these could have been forgiven. A few were understandable as the movie is aimed at young audiences and a "faithful" following of the book would have had to have been longer than "Return of the King" to not miss anything. What turned me off on this one was the "cut and paste" approach to editing. In this case, it was cut all connective information and paste "highlights" from the book. The result was a hackneyed Cliff's notes sort of film. Also, if this overzealous editing was done in the interest of avoiding a rump-numbingly long movie, why are random scenes like Lupin and Harry talking on the bridge dropped in? The birthday group of middle schoolers in front of me booed the movie and those who hadn't read the book complained that what they were seeing made no sense. Their unfortunate friends who had read the book didn't have time to explain everything that was left out between scenes. Some were still making a valiant effort as the credits were ending. Entire chunks of Snape's backhandedness against Lupin were omitted. So much of Draco and Co. bullying Hermione is left out that when she hits him, she comes off hotheaded rather than sympathetic. All of her stressing over doubling her time, the trial of Buckbeak, the revelation of Prongs, Wormtail, Moony and Padfoot's true identities are lost. Had I not reread the book in anticipation of Azkaban's release in theaters, I would have been lost, too. If Goblet of Fire is to redeem the HP movies by giving us something more in keeping with the first two movies, I'd recommend firing this editor and finding one who doesn't approach his task like a maniacal toddler who's just discovered the joy of scissors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mature HP Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great movie, by Cuaron. A mature tone setting which sets it out from its prequels. Although a major part from the book has been excluded, still the rest stands out as OUTSTANDING. Especially the scenes of the Marauder's Map. Also there are plenty of comedy in the movie. There is a hint of a budding romance between Ron and Hermione, Harry's two best friends. Also the sound and music of the movie is especially awesome. John Williams has left all of us spellbound by his ingenuinity. The portion where young Professor Lupin tells Potter about his parents is magnified by the outstanding slow background music. (A Window To The Past) And most important of all is the deadly "villain", Sirius Black, who also happens to Harry's godfather. Although this movie lacks Quidditch, it has Buckbeak the Hippogriff flying over the Lake in the Castle. Overall it's a definite must see for all HP fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You see the books are excellent in fact, the prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite. But the thing is the movie missed out sooooo much and it didn't make sense. Like for instance. Lupin new how to use the Marauders map but it never said why. Sirius and Peter were animagus but it never explained how that came to be. It never said how they were the marauders and how they used to run around the school with a werewolf and how it was THEM that wrote the marauders map. i think that if you make a movie then you should do it right and not change the story line. they even changed the prophecy that Professor Trelawny made! the effects were good but the story line was lo lo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effervescent, If Impish "Potter" Installment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", despite what you might be led to believe, is not an overly curious, "scary" installment to the "Potter" franchise. It's a harmless, sometimes tepid, children's adventure into the world of magic, featuring Potter and company on the search for an escaped convict who is luring about Hogwarts. Sometimes, the adventure of "Potter" can be vivacious, lurid, and effervescent, particularly the zany tour bus rescue chase. Then again, it has its tedious and complacent qualities, particularly when the "heroes" band together to solve the great mystery at hand, and the congenial, whimsical theme of magic is deviated to one of impish and tepid "mystery". Call me an ignorant cynic, who has yet to read a single "Potter" book, but as a curious film buff who demands a degree of action, comedic, and intelligent qualities in my movies, there were some very long, eventless sequences in this film which had me perplexed and even tired. Of course, a vibrant premise such as this must have a conflict, yet the idea of junior wizards exploiting a dangerous criminal was a tad too juvenile for me to enjoy. The film succeeds in its dazzling tale of a world of magic spells, congenial haunts, and zany escapades, yet not quite enough satisfaction to warrant a genuine recommendation. However, it's the fairest "Potter" yet, if that's worth acknowledging. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rating:8.5/10When compared to the first two movies,Prisoner of Azkaban is technically very good right from the beginning.Alfanso Cuaron took good care of the art direction being the director and the movie gave a new feel to the viewers. But however,as a reader of all the HP books,i felt most of the parts getting neglected in the movie with regards to the book.The new actors like Emma Thompson,David Thewlis,Gary Oldman,Timothy Spall made a very good mark on the movie in their respective characters,but i felt Michael Gambon was not upto the mark in terms of Dumbledore's authority. The best thing about this movie is,unlike the second one,it has maintained its pace till the last scene.The final scenes were taken very well but it was too fast.The flow of the story and the action was taken at an average speed but the exact reason about why snape hated the four friends Lupin,James ,Sirius and Pettigrew was not properly explained.But the movie is refreshing and will be liked by people who did'nt read the books as well. Anyway people......the movie is worth a wait for all HP fans and it will not disappoint you!!Dan and emma had given a good performance in the last scenes,Thought rupert did'nt get that much opportunity to show himself.The Director had definitely moulded the performance of young child actors and helped them to bring their best.The visual effects were better than the second one.Knight bus sequence was the funniest from the whole movie. ENJOY POA!! The movie is all about facing your darkest fears and being a teenager!!_</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Three, But Still Missing Something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film to be the best of the three movies out thus far, mainly because of the general feel of the movie. It was more on an emotional level than the first two, and good guys and bad guys aren't so well-defined like they are in movies one and two. It wasn't just a battle of good and evil, it was about turning thirteen and the emotional dealings that come with it. Obviously, not every single detail of the book could be filmed since it would most likely take five hours to show the book scene-by-scene. With this film, I didn't mind what they ended up cutting out (for the most part) because they made up for that lack with what I would definitely call good character development and emotional content. My only negative comment about the film is that they left out some information that was necessary to follow the storyline that only people who have read the books would understand. Otherwise it was an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I too resisted reading these books due to the fact that they were books my 10 yr old was reading and it didn't seem like my thing. Of course when the first movie came out I took her to see it to be a good mommy. I actually really enjoyed it and later bought it when it was released. Then the 2nd movie came out and of course we went to see it together. Harry Potter became a good mommy/daughter thing to do. After seeing the 2nd movie (of which I loved) I decided I'd better read the books so that I could stay up with what was going on. I read all 5 consecutivly like they were one book. Though I loved them all, Goblet of Fire is my favorite. My daughter and I looked forward to the release of Prizoner of Azkaban for months. We checked up on and followed the filming and very excitedly went and saw it on opening night. All I can say is YUK! I think the director had someone tell him what the book was about and he made the film based on that. There was no loyalty to the book at all. Now I'm an avid reader, always have been, so I know how taking a book and turning it into a movie is usually going fall a little short. But HP and the P of A fell right off the cliff. Thank goodness we aren't going to see this director for Goblet of Fire. JK Rowing is an excellent FANTASY writer, (key word there...FANTASY) Harry Potter is not real world stuff, so all these people talking about the feel of the movie being more realistic with real life....GET A CLUE! This is a book about fantasy, let's keep the movie's that way.Franticly crossing my fingers they do better on the Fourth in Nov 2005!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A large improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoner of Azkaban exceeds its predecessors in almost all respects, which isn't to say that Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were bad, just that this is better. The acting from all concerned is top notch (especially Thewlis as Professor Lupin) - the young actors have come on leaps and bounds from their previous efforts - and the special effects are so much more realistic (who can say Buckbeak is awful?). What impressed me most though, is the way the whole idea of magic is portrayed: whereas Chris Columbus presented it as some wondrous, awe-inspiring thing that has to be marveled at at all opportunities, Alfonso Cuaron let's the camera just glide by, as if seeing a spoon stirring itself or pouring a cuppa from a teapot suspended in midair are completely normal, everyday things!Chris Columbus was burdened with laying the ground rules of the Potter universe (at least on screen!), and it was obviously a big burden, resulting in lots of exposition, slow pacing now and then, and long running times for the first two excellent movies. But Cuaron has clearly been given more freedom to maneuver and he expresses himself wonderfully, supplying one of the best visual films I have seen in a long time. The Dementors in particular are a treat. Not only are they actually frightening (unlike the Basilisk or Spiders in CoS) - physically AND figuratively - but reading the novel, I just imagined them as indistinguishable from the Nazgul, or the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, or the Grim Reaper, and I was pleasantly surprised to see them flow and weave like they were moving through water. I would never have come up with that!! Yes, some of the characters are barely given any screen time - Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall for example - and I do imagine that the one or two people who watch the movie with no prior knowledge of Harry Potter will be left floundering at times, but at the end of the day Prisoner of Azkaban is a continuation of a series and if the price for enjoying a simply brilliant film that zips by at a joyously fast pace is having to know beforehand who Harry Potter actually is etc, and being slightly disappointed that some good sections of the novel are cut, then I for one am glad to pay it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totty score: 4/10. Awesome destruction: 1/10. Scary monsters: 8/10.Favourite bit: boys dormitory scene (not for that reason!)It seemed very rushed though, when you know the original so well it's hard to leapfrog through the story like that.Gary Oldman was great, David Thewlis was perfectly good acting wise but not quite right for me as Lupin. The new Dumbledore had two problems; his accent was a bit distracting and he had a McGonagall clone thing going on in his mannerisms. Hermione was no longer irritating, a feat I did not think was possible, although she did rather take over the story towards the end of the movie. Ron was sweet, Harry was better though still shaky in places and Malfoy was hot. Neville looks really different and both Seamus and the Weasley twins were leaps and bounds better acting wise. Crookshanks was perfect. The set and style were really really good. The Dementors were awesome and scary and Buckbeak was pretty cool. The werewolf effects were pretty good too.The new direction has improved the film by leaps and bounds from the previous two, most particularly by improving all of the children's acting. But rushed, a lot of it felt rushed to me, I'm hoping for an extended version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a Harry Potter movie not just for kids.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was absolutely nothing wrong with the first two Harry Potter films, and Chris Columbus did an admirable job of capturing much of the feel of the first two books after which they were made. But Book Three, Prisoner of Azkaban, started on a darker path, and here is where a change of mood was required. No longer does Hogwarts look like a Disney film, but rather like the medieval castle it is. Cuaron sees the world of Wizardry and Witchcraft for what it is, that is, essentially Middle Ages in aspect. Wizards' homes have no electricity, none of the regular modern amenities, and their world, even as Rowling paints it, is more like the Dark Ages. Rowling herself advised Cuaron that while the first two films followed the books faithfully, they lacked the spark of creative storytelling quite necessary to take the much larger book and pare it down into a couple of hours. Others have written that the story felt rushed, but that is a tribute to the complexity of Rowling's story. Ask a person who has not read the book what they think of "Prisoner" and I think you'll find they followed it very well. In thinking about this, I too felt that the set-up for the "three turns" time twist was a bit weak, but only because Rowling reiterates it so often in the book. This is really unnecessary for the film, and the few references in the middle of the film work quite nicely.I had an initial problem with the actor playing Lupin at first, because he wasn't my vision of the character. But then I saw him as the weary world traveler type with a mysterious past, and the character came alive. I was also struck, early in the film, by the way in which the lines were being delivered by the primaries, sounding more like a stage play than a screenplay, as if projecting to a large, live audience. But this too ceased to be a problem.The overall richness of the locations was a huge change over the previous films. This one simply has more atmosphere and scale, and the sense of something dire about to happen is infused throughout. This gives the film a much broader appeal than its predecessors, since as the books get darker, as the characters mature, so must the stories that are brought to the screen have deeper emotion. Harry Potter, as those who have read all five books so far know, is not Peter Pan. He has real anger, real emotions, real adolescent turmoil. I can only hope that the subsequent movies (it is rumored that Goblet of Fire may be turned into two movies to accommodate its length) continue to grow this theme. As do real people, the fictional Potter must outgrow the Disneyesque pristineness of youth and begin to embrace the problems and ugliness in the world -- his world -- the magical one with evil wizards and dark secrets.As a Baby Boomer, I resisted reading the books until recently, when I read them all one after the other as if they were one book. I have to say that Rowling too is maturing in her storytelling. This can only be good for the next books, and, we hope, for the next Harry Potter films.-- TGRegner</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best movie of 2004! Daniel Radcliffe is an excellent actor and did well in this movie. I love this movie and the people in it! I feel so sorry for anybody who does not like Harry Potter or hasn't seen this movie yet. I can't wait until The Goblet of Fire is released! I know that it's going to be even better than The Prisoner of Azkaban, if that is possible! My favorite character is Daniel Radcliffe. I think he's so hot but none of my friends do! They all say I'm weird for liking him but I think that they are weird. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite movie and I'm obsessed with Lord of the Rings and the Butterfly Effect but The Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the best movie that I have ever seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly I don't know where to begin with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Having not entirely been enamoured by the previous two films both of which were far too long to sustain their storyline and didn't have enough humanity to make the viewer care what happened to anyone I went in with a certain foreboding. My main, if not only reason for turning up this time was the knowledge that Alfonso Cuarón, who directed the beautiful Great Expectations and thrilling Y Tu Mama Tambian was behind the camera -- I wanted to see if someone with his talent would be submerged within the needs of this kind of franchise. I needn't have worried.The new Harry Potter film is bloody brilliant.I know. I can't believe I typed those words either. But its like watching a whole other film series. The closest comparison I can think of is Star Trek : The Motion Picture and The Wrath of Khan. In that case, out went the massive set pieces, the portentious dialogue and the assumption they needed to be answering all of the big questions and in came a revenge drama mixed with a meditation on the legacy of the past -- and so happens here. From the opening moments when Harry is practicing his magic under the covers so as not to attract the attention of his Uncle which is presented in such a way as to imply that he's doing the wizard version of what other teenagers his age might be doing under the covers, its obvious that we're in the hands of a director who has a clear vision how he wants to tell the story of how Potter is growing up. Unlike the previous films were the characters forever felt like puppets wheeled in to speak their lines on cue, here they gain all kinds of dimensions and so we actually care about what happens to them. It's quite a shock -- from watching an animated storybook illustration to a real film. For more evidence watch for the moment when the kids are trapped on the stairs and the new head boy dashes about trying to take charge and is roundly ignored.Remember in previous films how the Quiddich game was the main feature for nigh on half an hour, with the build up and the sports film style presentation with a beginning, middle and end in which we essentially waited for Harry to win by catching the snitch? Here the game becomes something the kids do as part of their normal school year -- we don't even find out who won (although its implied). Hogwarts the school has developed into somewhere which feels like a real place rather than a bunch of sets and for the first time we even have a sense of the geography of the place. And perhaps more significantly the costume design has become more varied, with Harry and friends in their civies more often and Haggrid in particular displaying a greater wardrobe.Is it all down to Cuaron? Well the scriptwriter Steven Kloves is the same as on previous projects (perhaps he was happy to have greater flexibility), and its widely acknowledged that is the best novel of the series. But we welcome as photographer Michael Seresin, whose previous work includes Angela's Ashes, Birdy, Fame, Bugsy Malone and Midnight Express and there are some similarity in the camera-work with those films -- the pallete in particular which includes blue and greens in comparison to the reds and browns of the past. Its more fluid, with greater use of hand held and steadicam. Throughout you feel like you're in the action instead of watching from the outside. Its visceral to an impressive degree.But the real improvement is in the performances. Its still an British character actor's convention but even they seem to be having fun this time with more dramatic performances. David Thewlis as Lupin and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black prove yet again why they're continually hired to play the grey areas in us all -- both share some very touching scenes with Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, as does Maggie Smith. But they're greatly helped by the fact that this time they have something to bounce off, because the kids have gown up slightly and actually give proper performances. Radcliffe shows the power bubbling under, especially in the Gilliamesque opening scenes. Rupert Grint's Ron Weasly used to be a collection of facial expressions. They're still there, but now he has something behind the eyes even though on this occasion he's mainly the fall guy. The real revelation is Emma Watson who given the chance to relax and probably offers the performance of the film as Hermione, suddenly a kickass, passionate, intelligent role model -- no longer the annoying, grump know-it-all.So I loved it and can't wait to see it again so that I can pick up on all the details I missed. Two things can happen from here -- it's either going to be the turning point in the franchise as later episodes make the first two as reductive as The Phantom Menace or it'll be the aboration, the good one, the Live and Let Die of the Roger Moore James Bonds. My great fear now as I await The Goblet of Fire is that it'll be back to business as usual, the magic of this one bleeding away. It's being directed by Mike Newell who on the one hand has made things like Enchanted April and Awfully Big Adventure which would suggest something in the old mood. But he also made Four Weddings and Donnie Brascoe so it could go either way...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's how I feel about Harry Potter, so you know how I align with the fandom:-The books are enjoyable if not genius-- 4th is the best and 5th is the worst.-The first two movies were awfully disappointing. Near the bottom of big budget children's fantasy.-Alfonso Cuaron is a director about whom all I know is that Little Princess was gorgeous.Now you know what I was expecting coming into this. Coming out, I have to say that the viewing public is crazy not to love this movie, that it is not even in the same category as the first two, and that I am very sad that Cuaron is not directing Goblet of Fire (Mike Newell is). In this film, everyone stops looking like that were stuck on a postcard and starts showing some chops. Emma Watson shines and Daniel Radcliffe emotes and cries, finally, like a pro. The CG is no longer just passable; it is top flight. And in the camera work, the whimsy that makes the books endearing is finally captured. I just can't find fault with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban was the longest of the three books they made into movies, yet it was the shortest movie. I happen to love Harry Potter and was looking forward to this movie a great deal. It was my favorite book throughout the entire series. I would have loved it if it was more like the book. I have a few complaints about it. One, the werewolf was horrible, it reminded me of Gollum. Two, the dementors don't follow HArry into the storm, and he reads more on the Marauders Map. Three, since when does Peter Pettigrews get found by Harry? Four, where did the Quidditch cup match go. Five, why was the firebolt at the end and why did he know Sirius sent it to him. Six, why wasn't the Quidditch World Cup mentioned at the end along with Ron getting the owl. And when, when did Sirius speech only take five minutes when it was two chapters of Dialog. I know if someone Killed MY parents I wouldn't believe them in five minutes. Especially if i know they went to a jail that's supposed to drive them mad. But that's just my opinion, I'm glad they got another director for the fourth book.</fullReview>

Ron Weasley become bigger and stronger than Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter's hair become more messed up and Hermione Granger's clothes changed well! That stayed good on a movie like this. The thing that me and many other watchers want to see is Ron and Hermione's love. In Goblet of Fire, that's explicit and obvious, when Ron becomes angry after Krum invites her to that dancing thing... well it's worth watching! 4 stars out of 5! P.S.: Why they never stop growing??? They're mutants? Harry Potter's not so BIG in 3rd book... well, thanks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O.K. here's my beef, I saw the first movie (with low expectations I might add), then the second movie... then I read the books. The first movie and the second movie adhered masterfully to the books, which is how it should be with such superior literature. Needless to say I was incredibly anxious to see the new movie, and was disappointed in the extreme. This is the longest book of the bunch thus far (speaking chronologically as movies come out) and yet it's the shortest movie. Whole large chunks of the story have been left out, scenes are not in the same order as in the book, and all in all I was left wondering how something that started so well fell so far down hill. I understand that there is a new director for this one, and in that case I would seriously suggest not using him again and sticking with the original or at least someone who respects the written version as much as his vision of it. Also, I have to give kudos to the whole cast. While the story itself was chopped up and butchered in comparison to previous two movies, the actors all portrayed their characters to perfection, giving glimpses of the personalities that would have been clearer had the movie been done appropriately. And lastly; our new Dumbledore gives a great performance, while I respect the others work and applaud it, he is now more like the literature version of the character with his jokes, smiles and twinkling eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie impressed me very much. After I saw the second movie I worried that the third story (that incidentally is my Fav. of the series) would be inferior to the first two because of a new director taking the helm, new actors in new roles etc. A role that worried me immensely was that of Sirius Black.What scared me the most was the rumors that Christian Bale was casted.To my relieve the best actor from the UK...Gary Oldman was casted as Black and I was relieved. This movie was a brilliant piece of cinema and had everything...Brilliant SFX,superb acting, good direction and a more than decent script.Alfonso Cuaron concocted an entertaining and intelligent brew of magical film that is superior to the efforts of the quasi-genius we know as Chris Collumbus. Yes I would have loved to see MR.Cuaron furthering the history of Hogwards but the man has higher ambitions and other movies. We are yet to see if Mike Newell is Uber enough to fill Cuaron's shoes at the helm of the next movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous Filming Amidst the Fatal Flubs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter. I probably have the books memorized. And "Prisoner of Azkaban" is my favorite of the books. So I was well psyched for the movie. And it didn't disappoint. For the most part. The actual cinematography was so much cleaner and better than the first two films. The visual effects were also much tighter and more believable. Sirius as Snuffles was so well done, with a nice tip of the hat to "The Nothing" from "The Neverending Story." Lupin as a werewolf was pretty cool, not because it was necessarily well done, but because he was clearly a werewolf and not a regular wolf or dog. The new look of the Hogwarts castle and grounds was really more with the mood of the books, if not consistent with the other movies. My main complaints are that the director (Alfonso Cuaron) had never even read the books before being approached about directing "Prisoner of Azkaban", so he didn't have any investment in the series or any passion for it. Also, he took a lot of the fun and humor out of the story and kept in things that were unnecessary or lingered too long on certain subjects. The scene where Malfoy, Crab, and Goyle dress as a dementor to scare Harry is one of the most hilarious parts of the book, and I was incredibly disappointed about its disclusion. Finally, why why, oh why, did they change Lupin's relationship from being best friends with Harry's dad to Harry's mom. Lupin's friendship with James Potter, and thus with Sirius and Wormtail is MASSIVELY important to "The Order of the Pheonix" and it is just stupid and confusing that the relationship was changed. Although I like Cuaron as a director, these films would benefit more from someone intimately acquainted with these books and the story, and someone who would keep in the important bits, trim out the unnecessary stuff, all the while keeping the humor and essential story details intact.</fullReview>

In Azkaban, yes a lot of changes have been made, and the order of certain events have been put in a different order to that in the books, but for heaven sake, does that really spoil the enjoyment?? No. Most books go through changes. It happens. Get over it and enjoy it!!This film is the best so far. The acting by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint has improved a lot since the first film, and they have all settled wonderfully into their parts. The adult cast are terrific too, Buckbeak is a wonder to behold (the flying scene is just exhilarating)the comical scenes a hoot. PURE MAGIC!! 10/10- Oh, and make sure you see it on IMAX.

		<shortDescription>Gets Better And Better:Best Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban is by far the best film in the Harry Potter series yet.Intriguing from the start to finish.Deeper and darker then the past two films Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.I am very satisfied with the new director Alfonso Cuaron.He handles the legacy of growing up very well,since this is the third installment of J.K.Rowling's fantastic series in which Harry Potter reaches his teenager years at age thirteen.(Possible Spoiler Warning) Harry's abilities are put to the test when he learns of a very dark wizard's secret...that involves him.He needs to know when to follow his gut instincts.Dealing with average teen problems is only half of what he has to cope with.Suffering still on his grief of his parent's death he reaches the boiling point.This is a must see movie which I rate 9&amp;1/2 out of ten!Great directing on Alfonso's part and I hope he returns to the Potter Scene.Interesting shots too that are shown again later on.Steve Kloves also does a great job transforming J.K.'s masterpiece to a movie script form.The cast is improved with more well known actors and actresses like Emma Thompson,Gary Oldman,David Thewlis,and Michael Gambon replaces Richard Harris(who has recently past away) for the role of Dumbledore.The only disappointments are the lack of information that is not mentioned here where as is in the book.But they say it will all be brought onto the scene later in the series.The order of events from the book is also slightly altered but is therefore put into a form more understandable to the theatre's audience.My review is an A+,so you better go see this one while it lasts!Because it won't be there for much longer.These are my feelings on the film and you may not agree with my opinions but all the same I hope you enjoy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the people that said the they were disappointed with the directing, the special effects were great, but they flipped too many things around; like Hagrid's cabin and the whopping willow were totally different place (also the tree looked nothing like it did in the 2nd movie). What was it with Harry doing magic during the vacations, that totally contradicts what Harry had to go through because he did magic in the 5th book. I really wasn't happy with the Dumbledor, i mean, why didn't they just make him look the same as before, with a different person playing the roll. I was really unhappy with this movie and i just hope the put a bit more effort into the movie following the what the book says instead of trying to make it shorter. i would much rather see a good movie about a great book i read then a movie that has a couple of reference to the book. the 4th book is my favorites book and i hope i'm not disappointed when i go to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been great, but as always it wasn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Harry Potter movies have never got special treatment from their Directors. It's fair to say also they were never treated in the same way the Lord of the Rings was but Harry Potter has time against it where Peter Jackson had the money and the time to play around to make it the masterpiece it became. When reading every Harry Potter book you can easily believe that they could be even better than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy with all the twist and turns every thread hole of the story has and that?s not including the amount of characters portrayed through the mammoth story. Philosopher's Stone was good, Chamber of Secrets was very Good and Prisoner of Azakaban was Good but not great. When Gary Oldman comes into the picture , it is where the films begins to become what we had hoped but till then I think there was huge cuts made in parts where questions were left unanswered. I know there is always an occurring argument over the films and how much they miss out from the books but this films was nearly twenty minutes shorter than The Chamber of Secrets so they could have easily added more scenes to the films to make up the time. Film distributors believe that for a child to watch a film then it must be short in time but a child gets lost in films and as long as the film is Magical like Harry Potter then they get lost and have no idea what time even means when watching something like this. It was obvious that scenes were filmed and then cut but that's filmmaking for you and it is something which cannot be overseen and one day we may and probably will see extended cuts of the Harry Potter franchise, I hope anyway, but what is The Prisoner of Azkaban really like?Daniel Radcliffe has grown up and is very angry. When he is angry though he grinds his teeth and ends up looking quite stupid but kid's his age actually do that because I remember doing so, so that can be forgiven. Ron did not really have a big part like the previous two but Hermione did. David Thewlis as Lupin was brilliant, Gary Oldman as Sirus was just great old Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon was very good as a more active Dumbeldore. Overall this was a good film and Alfonso did a great job but he should stick to his Mexican independent movies. I still blame Chris Columbus for these mistakes though as he is not Mr Adventure man like Peter Jackson or even Spielberg. We are all in love with Harry Potter but there is something deep inside us all that believe we are not getting what we deserve. It's taken a long time for me to come up with what I really think about these movies and I have come to the conclusion that they are just ok. Kids who range from the age between 5 and 12 who will go on in life and remember Harry Potter as the film they grew up on. I am 21 so the films I remember as a young child was The Goonies and The Monster Squad. We have another four films left to come and we have to have our fingers crossed that next four will hopefully become groundbreaking masterpieces like they should be, but I think we all know there is little chance of this ever happening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly I must confess that the newest Potter film was a great disappointment. I expected a lot, especially having read all the praising reviews. I found the film far too incoherent and fragmentary. If I hadn't read the book previously, I would have been totally lost with the "storyline" as the film just sort of jumped from one sequence to another. Not even the highly praised dementours impressed me that much--I expected more and was---disappointed. The book is much better--as it often is the case. As for the actors, the main characters did a pretty good job. Professor Dumbledore, again, was a far cry from his previous self--had the ending been more like in the book, his true character would have been more evident. Maybe the movie would have been better, if it had been a bit longer. In contrast to Spiderman 2--this movie didn't seem TOOO long but managed to hold its grip--even of a critical viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi all Harry Potter fans, I would firstly like to say that this is by far the best film. But I must note that this is not due to the new director it is because that the book was better than the first and second. I agree with many of the other comments that there were many parts of the book that were failed to be shown in the film. For instance it failed to show that there was a lot of speculation that the Firbolt was sent by Sirus Black. In the book there was a large argument between Hermoine&amp;Ron and this was lost in he book. Which I believe was due to the fact that the film makers want it ti be like a Disney movie happy throughout. I think that the film makers need to include these parts as it will make us care about the characters a lot more.I think anyone who watches the film and doesn't read the books misses out on caring about the characters. I do hope the next book is created well and that the happy and sad parts are all included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A snort of disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, there is not a bigger "Harry Potter" fan out there but me. However, the energy and time I have put into reading and watching the books and movies feels like rubbish. I believe that the "different approach" by Alfonso Cauron couldn't have been worse. It came out on June 4th and I went to see it on July 29th. Your probably thinking "some big fan" but believe me, I am. Yes, in the fourth book J.K. Rowling shows a little spark going on between Ron and Hermione, yet, that is no excuse for putting such garbage in the movie of their friendship, such as; the part when Hagrid's hippogriff (Buckbeak) "supposedly" dies, Hermione rests her head against Ron's shoulder and clings onto his neck, then, Harry puts his arms around her. HOW LAME!!!!!! I hated it. I was THIS close to throwing my shoe at the big screen. Yes, most people do like the "new approach" by Mr. Cauron, yet, I believe he has changed my whole view of "Harry Potter" movies from "good" to "horrible." I personally think he should simply STOP making the movies of "Harry Potter" anymore because he will make me not want to read the upcoming 6th book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the film yesterday. Aspects of it were very interesting - but they rearranged and left out very important markers in the movie. The don't celebrate Christmas - just kind of keep going - don't even mention it. There are other things I was disappointed in but that would spoil it. The acting was really good - and the effects are wonderful. I would just hate to see the effects over shadow the story, or "carry" the story. The kids have really grown up! Especially NEVILLE! The score was also very good, but don't bother staying to the end of the credits - nothing fun at the end and they go on FOREVER. Maybe the next time I see it I'll like it more....Bats</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of a Great Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter 3 is the best of the series as it, like the book before it, takes on a much more darker tone as Harry finds himself the target of one of Voldemort's loyal supporters, the evil Sirius Black.This more than any in the series before it had the potential to go seriously wrong as this is the first of the Potter stories to really have more threads than the obvious ones of Harry's immediate quest. However Alfonso Cuaron has done a great job of making sure that these endings are ( mostly ) tied up while at the same time making sure that the main story is not slowed down or lagging.The performances of all of the children actors are good, but it is the supporting cast of the adults that really makes this shine. Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are great in their return as the vindictive Snape and the rough diamond Hagrid respectively, while Michael Gambon, while not having the same presence as the late Richard Harris in the role of Albus Dumbledore, adds something of a twinkle that Harris seemed to struggle with in number two, perhaps because of his illness. Out of the newbies, David Thewlis is fantastic as Remus J Lupin and Gary Oldman is also very good as the enigmatic Sirius Black.Perhaps the last thing that lifts this movie over the others is the special effects, or rather the lack of them. Cuaron has made the use of magic in this one less like a laser show and it gives the whole thing a more intimate atmosphere instead of the slight heavy-handedness of the first two.Prisoner of Azkaban is a movie that is inundated with great performances that, coupled with great, subtle directing lifts it above the other two. I just hope Goblet of Fire is just as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best adaptation of the spirit of Harry Potter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was most clearly better adapted from the previous Harry Potter films not because of being true to the book, but the spirit. What struck me the most of what was wrong with the first two were that they were *too* close on following JK Rowling's Harry Potter, and left the wow factor at that, save for the pause-to-awe of the awesome magic that really made the films too childish and stupifying. This film weaves the magic throughout the experience and causing wizardry to be more normal and casual, helping to add to the darker, more adult act. I was especially pleased by Gary Oldman's Sirius Black, in fact most out of the new characters added to Harry Potter. The actors for Peter Pettigrew and Prof. Trelawney was passable, and the acting for Prof. Lupin was a good choice. This was definitely the best of the three so far, but unfortunately I will be happy to see the director skip HP 4, because of this history that he would go over many of the very significant plots of the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually beautiful... but that's about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that I think this movie is very atmospheric. That is, when you actually see a scene longer than 1 minute. (Slight exaggeration.) The problem with the movie is that it does not really stand on its own. I have read some criticism of PoA, and tried to do what one suggested: not to look on the movie as a book-to-screen adaptation. This is no mean feat, since the book is actually the best one in my opinion. Trying to look at it in any other way than a book-to-screen adaptation proved impossible. You need to have read the book to understand what the flippin' heck the are doing. This movie takes place over a whole year... It feels like a week, disregarding the seasonal changes. There is no real feel that they are in fact at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which the first two installations delivered. The actors are doing what they can, and the Weasley twins are getting to be a lot better. It is too bad Cuarón does not seem to want to give anyone any meaningful screentime. All the characters seem to be supporting players -- and yes, I mean Harry as well. Then we have to ask ourselves who they are supporting. If I was of a nastier disposition, I would say Cuarón's ego... Oh what the heck, I'll just go ahead and say it. It is never a good thing to put so much effort into making something look stylish that you forget to put in the story... at least not when the story is basically what you have. This is a story read and loved by millions! Why take almost all of it away? Even as someone who has read the book a couple of times, it seemed choppy and incoherent. The story of PoA in the guise of a detective story: "'Welcome to the manor'... 'Call the police! The countess has been murdered!' ... 'What's all this then?' ... 'The butler did it.' The End." Not very fulfilling/interesting, right? Fill this out with sweeping landscapes, dark corners and uneasy moods. Still not enough, is it? Solution: We need to set a mood, to establish relations, understand characters, and why they have changed (if they have), and last but not least: Establish the MOTIVE! All this was more or less forgotten in PoA and if not forgotten, truncated almost beyond recognition.It is all very well to talk about artistic license and how good the movie looks. That does not alter the fact that this is a confusing, albeit stylish, mess that is, more or less loosely, based on a work called Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, by J.K. Rowling (who I think should take more interest in what is being done with her work).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing yet not altogether welcome change.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Harry potter and the prisoner of Azkaban (the latest installment of the Harry Potter trilogy if you will) Is if nothing more a refreshing change for older audiences which makes sense considering that the actors are getting older along with the whole concept.Some of the die hard/ hardcore fans of the book will be disappointed in all they left out from the book. It was also noticed that the movie characters act much more mature or just hormonally crazed. There was more then one time I noticed that there were uncalled for hugging when something moderately scary or surprising that happened to them I don't mind that kind of acting because it makes the characters more true to they're ages. Although a lot of the places in the hogwarts castle were changed quite a bit it added more fantasy to the tale. With the giant pumpkins and what not.I think some of those changes in the setting make it more appealing to younger children(especially with buck beak) and the actions and clothes of the characters make it more it more appealing to older audiences.The movie had a lot of good special effects such as the dementors and buck beak but I must note the worth less scenes that they could've replaced with scenes from the book. Like the birds that exploded when showing the womping willow it was just for good laughs (which it got from the audience i watched it with)Over all I cannot say this movie was a disappointment because I do like the way Harry, Ron and Draco are shall we say maturing. I would say that my over all idea about the movie is that it was pretty good except for the plot being derailed a lot. Yet it remained good and I would see it a second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic is lost! And he stole it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry to put it this hard, but the director ruined the movie entirely!!!Lets see, where do I begin? Locations. Hogwarts is a school of Magic, where everything looks and really is magical. It is NOT a common educational institution where students busy themselves on their assignments. In this movie, the School of Magic looks more like a respectable British university located in some antique building. Even the paintings in the walls have lost their fantastical charm, they seem like some portraits hanging from the walls of a pretentious country club (they should have been inanimate, it would have been preferred). The haunting and fearful Forbidden Forest, where mystical (and sometimes evil) creatures lure, looks in this film like a botanical garden in the middle of suburban boredom. The Hogwart's Express is no longer that magnificent and beautifully preserved old engine, that takes the audience on a fabulous journey to a enchanted land; now it looks like they shot the whole train scene in a neglected West Line Coach or so. Throughout the movie, ALL the magic is just gone.The story is very poorly underdeveloped. I had read the book beforehand, so I was able to understand it. But after the film ended, I had to explain the plot to my friends (and about a dozen other people that remained sitting at the theatre listening to my explanation) because barely anyone got it. Even some key elements of the story (Crookshanks, Ron and Hermione conflict, the relation of Moony and friends, who was Peter Pettigrew and what was his role, how the hell Black escaped from Azkaban? Etc.) are just ignored.Acting? Oh dear! Let me be clear, it is NOT the actors fault. It is A DISGRACEFUL DIRECTING!!. The Dursleys seem to have grown bored of despising and fearing Harry, they almost treat him like one of their own. Aunt Marge is not annoying enough to deserve being blown up. The mischievous Wesley twins may as well have reformed. Hagrid doesn't seem to give a damn in the end about Buckbeack's fate. Ron could have been erased completely from the film and nobody would have noticed. Hermione has lost all of her annoying but charming know-it-all attitude. Malfoy is no more Harry's nemesis, but a pathetic coward kid that gets butt-kicked by a girl and just runs away crying. Sirius Black looks as menacing as a poor homeless man who cleans windshields for a penny. Dumbledore is no longer the wise and powerful Head Wizard, but a pitifuly senile circus magician. Even Harry himself looks plain and bland? ALL the characters, for that matter, are flat, insipid and bland. That can not be blamed on ALL the actors, can it?And the final scene? well, that was just insulting!!!!.In summary, the movie is sadly (if not infuriatingly!) disappointing. This was a Mexican teledrama (yuck!!!), not the fantastic and enchantingly imaginative world of wizardry and magic that the books and the previous films portray. Even my 9 years old nephew was bored (and actually angered) at it! Did Cuaron at least SAW the previous two films before ... perpetrating the third!? Or did he watch "Batman &amp; Robin" instead?!!!!!If the first movie had been like this one, I seriously doubt a second and third and fourth would have followed. Cuaron just ruined it all. And his mother too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't really a Harry Potter fan going into this film, but a friend convinced me to go, and I am sure glad she did!The third installment of Harry's saga, shows that the children and the production have matured since the last films were released.The darker theme and visuals coupled with the well written story kept me glued to the screen until the very end. It was a little long, but the time seemed to fly by (no slow points in this one). It was funny, suspenseful and a bit cute at times. Everything a movie targeted more at children should be. Even though there were some scary images, and the language honestly isn't as strong as the rating suggests, I'd give this film an 'A+' movie because it's something that the whole family can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(first of all, apologies for my bad English. It's not my mother language)So far, I've seen PoA three times and I wouldn't mind seeing it a thousand times. Wow. My favourite book in the series, and the movie certainly lived up to my expectations. The child actors have grown in their roles. I do hope the main three actors will play the roles of Harry, Ron and Hermione in all the seven movies. The grown-up actors are also wonderful. I particularly like Michael Gambon, who's Dumbledore is funny, sharp, strong and convincing. His Dumbledore is more like the Dumbledore I imagined when reading the books. As for the director: nothing against Columbus, but Cuarón adds speed, humor and depth to the movie, which is faster and more grown-up than the other two. I also like the new decor and the fact that Hogwarts and the magical world become less of a fairy tale and more realistic. Good job, I'm looking forward already to the next movie, but wouldn't be surprised if PoA would stay my favourite of the series.</fullReview>

This movie is good from start to finish and its a shame that shrek 2 has mad more money then askaban.The acting and visual effects are superb and like all a potter novels the story is first class. I really and truly hope that they will keep these actors it wouldn't feel the same if we replace these in which they have put a lot of effort to make the stories first class.The most really impressive, in my view, is that of Daniel Radcliff. He captures a brilliant performance in which is delivered in the novel. Good movie bring on goblet of fire</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter and the New Lease of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter is one of those phenomenons that you either get or you don't. Having a little sister who has read all of the books and is properly immersed in Potter-lore I can understand to a certain extent why kids are so enamoured by the boy wizard. I myself have read all the books over the last few years, which I enjoyed even if they were relatively unremarkable.Being a keen film goer I have seen all the Potter films on the big screen and also on DVD. Whilst I could happily sit through the first two films they never particularly grabbed my attention, they seemed more focused on getting over as much of the information from the books than being cinematic entities in their own right. Admittedly the Chamber of Secrets marginally improved upon this but still lacked a voice of it's own. Chris Columbus shouldn't be overly criticised for his Potter offerings, it was a wise choice on his behalf to stay faithful to the books as much as he did or face the consequences of disappointing a sizeable proportion of the worlds child population. As a result of Columbus' offerings Cuaron has a much easier starting position. It is readily established that the cinematic Potter can stand on its own feet, and this allows The Prisoner of Azkaban to spread its wings a little more than its predecessors.It has become clichéd to say the film is darker than the previous outings (see the Lost World: Jurassic Park or Back to the Future II) but in this case it's true, not just in tone but in the look of the film. Hardly a frame goes by where the mise-en-scene is not shrouded in shadow or the action pounded by rain. In terms of the story (many claim Azkaban to be the better of the Potter books) there is an improvement on the first two films, with a significant change to structure, which was already becoming tiresome (welcome to Hogwarts, something strange is going on, quick Harry face Voldemort). Credit here must go to Cloves who was again on screenplay duties, who now seems comfortable enough with the material to be able to steer away from the source more effectively this time around. The result is a much better paced script that is structured more like a film than episodes 1 and 2 which were if anything guilty of being too worthy to the book, which does not make for a good film (Does anyone remember Sphere?).The truncated script is served well by Curaons swift atmospheric direction.Even though Hogwarts had magic in the earlier films Curaons vision of the school is something else altogether more mysterious and often sinister, which suits the storyline and the theme of self discovery, the passage of time and the realisation of the adult world. Curaon and his director of photography Michael Seresin use the camera wonderfully to further evoke these themes. The camera passes through the workings of the Hogwarts tower onto the faces of the main trio on numerous occasions each time effectively reinforcing the narrative not detracting from it. The cinematography allows the audience to become more involved with the events rather than just a voyeur.Despite the shorter running time and general better pacing the principle characters are given more room to grow, we get a much better feeling for the way relationships are developing between the principle trio, especially Ron and Hermione. Unfortunately due to the more streamlined script some of the more interesting elements are left out including any real input by Snape (the always enjoyable Rickman) who is Potters Trump card a character of genuine interest and divided loyalties. Although by sideline some elements of the book it does give the main actors opportunity to shine, the three main kids whilst not outstanding are now much more comfortable with their roles, I genuinely hope for the sake of the films they are not replaced. In terms of the adults both Thewlis and Oldman come out with their reputations as serious actors untarnished, Blacks (Oldman) first encounter with Harry is a genuine standout moment. Also of note is Gabon as Dumbledore who while he does not exert the same ominous presence as Richard Harris provides a much more enjoyable headmaster and a far more likable character.This is however not to say the film is without fault, the Dursleys prologue has now become tiresome (I've heard a rumour they are to be dropped from Potter 4). The first half of the film whilst enjoyable stays too close to the format of the previous films, the major changes only come in the third act. Most disappointing for me however were the dementors, whilst they were an impressive design and had some genuinely creepy moments I thought their potential was somewhat wasted considering the importance of their presence. Although I have sung praise for the shortened script elements which will become of importance in later films have unfortunately been glossed over which may create problems later on but all in all Potter 3 is a highly entertaining family film7 out of 10Oh and before I finish. Those who remember the geography of Hogwarts from the first two film may also be a little confused by the sudden tectonic activity that seems to have afflicted the Hogsmead area. I personally prefer the setting in the stunning Glencoe but some may be perturbed by the lack of continuity, children can however be persuaded it's magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I beg to differ from the people who think that Harry Potter is just a child's' movie. While the storyline may be designed for children, I know of many adults who have enjoyed all three films so far.Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for their third year, but they return to the mystery surrounding an escaped prisoner who could seriously endanger Harry's life. Gary Oldman plays Sirius Black, the Prisoner of Azkaban and a threat to Harry; Michael Gambon plays the role of Professor Dumbledore, Hogwarts' most celebrated headmaster for years; Timothy Spall plays Peter Pettigrew, an old schoolfriend of Harry's deceased father, James Potter; David Thewlis plays Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor who bears a mysterious secret; Pam Ferris plays Harry's evil Aunt Marge; and Paul Whitehouse portrays Sir Caddogan, the batty old Knight who becomes the guardian of Gryffindor Tower temporarily. Harry's third year is made undoubtedly worse by the Dementors that are guarding the school. The guards of Azkaban, the Dementors have amazing powers, powers that have an undesired effect on Harry.David Thewlis in particular gives a strong performance as Remus J Lupin. He is able to play the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor exactly the way I imagined him when I was reading the book. Caring, understanding, clever, just the impression I got from the book. As always, I was impressed with the maturity and the quality of acting from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Tom Felton and the ever pretty Emma Watson and Bonnie Wright. Rupert in particular seems to have come out of his shell. If you'd care to look back at Chamber of Secrets and Pilosopher's Stone, you'll see he tends to be a lot quieter and shyer than the others. In Prisoner of Azkaban he appears to be much more confident, and his acting benefited because of this.I wasn't overly happy with the casting of Sirius Black. Don't get me wrong, Gary Oldman gave an excellent performance as the escaped prisoner, but I don't think I'm alone when I say I was expecting somebody a little younger. Sirius Black is supposed to be a young, carefree, handsome man, and Gary Oldman just didn't fit this criteria. Also, Michael Gambon didn't bring the character of Dumbledore to life the way Richard Harris did. Michael Gambon was far too active to be Dumbledore, who is generally a thoughtful, quiet, slow, steady kind of guy.Another thing that really bugged me was that the grounds of Hogwarts had totally changed. I remember reading that it would be intentional, but I'm sure there isn't a hill near Hagrid's hut mentioned in the book. Yet, this hill has suddenly materialised in the film. I know that's a problem with all movies that are made from books, the film isn't exactly the same as the book, as we would want it to be. But there's no excuse for just adding new things right out of the blue. As a point of interest, I'd like to know if Alfonso Cuarón has ever even read PoA?Moaning over. Overall, I was impressed with every aspect of the film. I would recommend it to everybody, not just Harry Potter fans. Even if you totally hate the boy wizard, you'll enjoy the film because it's a pleasure to see kids acting and giving it their all. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban will go down as one of the greatest films in history, and it deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the greatest adventure movies i have ever seen, its full of energy, a great script &amp; great acting. This movie should instantly be in the top 250 movies of all time, out of all 3 Harry Potter movies released so far this is the best one, all 3 movies should be in the top 250. This movie isn't just for a Harry Potter fan, its for anyone who appreciates a good paced adventure movie, i don't recall once in the movie where i was getting bored, this is a kind of movie that you can call flawless. I think the reason that this one is better then the first two is because all 3 of the main characters, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley &amp; Hermione Granger have matured &amp; have become even better actors over time, if you haven't seen the first two well this will still make perfect sense because they basically explain what everything is. Little children or infants might get frightened by some scenes. Gary oldman as Sirius Black was perfect. A perfect 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic License?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an avid fan of the Harry Potter series, I was delighted to hear that Columbus was being replaced. I wanted a darker, mature Harry Potter. So I went to see the movie as soon as possible.What I got was disappointing.Much of the plot important to future books was sacrificed for special effects. For example, how did Sirius know that Pettigrew was in Hogwarts? How did Lupin know how to work the Map? How did Lupin even work into all this? Why was Sirius accused of murdering the Potters? How was Pettigrew responsible?If any of these questions were answered, then it was said too fast to hear. The entire scene in the Shack was blurred and hazy. The only thing really going for this movie was the mind-blowing special effects, which seemed to fool all the weak-minded viewers into believing that the movie was good. Maybe that was Alfonso's purpose.Someone called it artistic license. I call it bad directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film was a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What was the director thinking! This film was so bad i was so disappointed when i went to see the 3rd movie i fell to sleep. The book was so good it was my second favorite book and the movie was so horrible. Everything was so different and they didn't even show everything in the book. There were so many parts i wanted to see in the movie and didn't get to see that i was mad. If you watch the movie it doesn't explain everything so you get confused if you didn't read the book. I wanted to see more of the things that Harry did with the Marauders Map and all the things that Sirius and Harry went through. This director is suppose to be directing part 4 and that is going to be another disappointment for all TRUE Harry Potter fans. The old director was so much better because he showed every important detail and he didn't change anything around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Hope * SPOILER *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I must say I was really impressed by Alfonso Cuaron's vision of the Harry Potter's world. I read and loved all of the 5 books but disliked the first 2 films by Chris Colombus : in my opinion, there was no real adaptation work on these 2 ; they were nothing but a flat and scholar illustration of the books without any drama or flavor. With the same kind of original material and the same scriptwriter, you can have total crap or absolute grace. That's why the director makes all the difference to me ! To adapt a novel, I think you have to make it yours by being deeply moved and inspired by it. You'll have to make choices in the process and take liberties with the written material. This way, the movie may have its own atmosphere, making sense as a stand-alone work of art.I felt a New Hope ( no joke ;) rising when I first heard Alfonso Cuaron would direct this 3rd installment ; I had seen "Great Expectations" years ago and was convinced by the qualities of his directing... and I'm glad I wasn't disappointed at all ! He chose to focus on the Oedipus's theme ( to grow up by replacing the father's image ) and the dark side of the teenager's crisis ( serving a "hors d'oeuvre" for the next 2 movies ). The pace is much better than in the first 2, leaving space for real life and feelings to come in. Just take, for example, that short scene when the Gryffindor lads eat candies that make them do impressions of several animals : only one shot and you feel like you were in Hogwarts with them ! Cuaron did not hesitate to develop the scenes he seemed to love the most : the taming of the Hippogriff is a marvel, Harry caught holding the marauder's map by both Lupin and Rogue ( Angel and Devil ? ) is a dramatic and haunted moment with a gorgeous photography, and all concerning time travel in the ending is even more brilliant than in the book. The acting is much more inspired, too. On top of everyone in the cast, you have David Tewlis who IS Remus Lupin. And a star is definitely born in the shape of Emma Watson ( Hermione ): everything she does sounds or looks true, every expression she makes gets to the point. A really moving performance. She is now quite an actress ! A career to follow with great interest...On my 5th viewing of the final dementors' sequence by the lake, I suddenly realized Alfonso Cuaron may have paid an unexpected tribute to a french science-fiction animation movie called "Time Masters". In this movie ( which is the adaptation of a novel as well ), you have a young orphan lost on a desert planet being attacked by many giant bees flying all over him. As in PoA, the scene takes place by a lake, the kid is outnumbered by the creatures and this specific moment is the central core of a time travel phenomena... The angles Alfonso Cuaron chose to shoot the scene made me think it's obvious he saw it and used it as an inspiration. Maybe that's the reason why dementors actually FLY in the movie ( because of the bloody french ;) To sum up, I highly recommend "The Prisoner of Azkaban" to everyone who loves Harry Potter and/or great cinematography. What a shame Cuaron will not direct the next movies ! Terry Gilliam for "The Order of the Phoenix" !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie didn't follow the book as closely this time around, but the film itself was great. I loved the casting and the special effects were wonderful. Those dementors were CREEPY! I wouldn't want to come up on one of them in a dark alley. Gary Oldman was brilliant and I really liked David Thewlis. I was more neutral on Michael Gambon, but Richard Harris left big shoes to fill. I will be curious to see how he tackles Goblet of Fire. The kids are really becoming quite gifted actors and are growing up so quickly. What a difference between the three movies. The cinematography was very unique in this one and there was much more of a feel to the castle. I loved the intro scenes with the Dursley's and the scenes with Ron and Hermione arguing about Scabbers and Crookshanks...Very entertaining movie and worth the trip to the theater.</fullReview>

Also the movie could have included who moony,wormtail,padfoot and prongs were and how lupin new how to open the map etc. But besides that i thought the movie was awesome! harry,ron and hermione were amazing. Although the new dumbledore could act a bit more mysteriouse and enchanting since he is a very powerful amazing wizard. I cant wait until harry potter and the goblet of fire.

		<shortDescription>First inspired Harry Potter movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all enjoyed the books, right? Are they exclusively children's books? NO. The first two Harry Potter movies are simplistic, uninspired, bland, yet enjoyable adaptations of the books, and they are evidently aimed squarely at kids, in this they differ from their counterparts. Enter The Prisoner of Azkaban, the first really creative movie of the lot. Child or adult, the movie can be enjoyed either way. The new director's hand really shows, even the CGI is excellent (which in the former movies showed rather fake); couple that with excellent photography, great pacing, fantastic acting, a solid plot, and you've got the entry of Harry Potter into the selective realm of good books turning out as good movies.I simply cannot understand why someone would think it boring or some of the other comments I've read here. It is an excellent effort in execution and commendable in risk taking, two qualities sorely lacking in most movies nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Efficient screen adaptation---a change in director makes all the difference!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very happy to see this film and eager to see it again, unlike the 2nd in the series!A change in director makes all the difference! Careful editing and the improved sets also helped greatly. Most notably the Whomping Willow is now outside the castle walls and given vastly improved rendering!The screenwriter appears to have hit his stride with this the 3rd in the series: seamlessly altering details of time and place for brevity without losing important exchanges between the characters and information for the uninitiated audience. He'll need it even more for The Goblet of Fire; so, I write this in eager anticipation of that product!Standout Excellent Scene: the confrontation in the Shrieking Shack. Oldman is brilliant as Sirius Black, as is Thewlis as Lupin. A solid film. I was a little disappointed about the delay of arrival of Harry's broomstick until the end of the movie, when it was to have arrived at Christmas however; but, that really doesn't figure largely in the advancement of the plot (until the next movie) and so it is totally forgivable along with all other such story alterations.Similarly I would have liked to see the Divination classroom more in keeping with Rowling's original description of having to be accessed from a trapdoor; but, that's just nitpicking. The actress playing Treylawny is a dead ringer for the part---excellent casting all around!I will definitely buy this film for my collection, and seek to see it again before it leaves the theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello, I am great fan of Harry Potter. I have read all the Harry Potter books and seen all the three movies. I was very glad when I first listen that Harry potter is filming. I waited for that very much. And my waiting was successful when I saw the first 2 movies of Harry potter. So, I waiting much more curiously for the 3rd part of Harry potter movie. But what I have seen in this movie? Before understanding the movie it was completed. What is this movie? It is not familiar with the first two. Alfonso Cuarón was failed to reach the inside of Harry potter. The facts were not related with each other. There were some extra facts on the movie but some important facts that were written in the book were totally absent. The campus of Hogwarts also not so good. It is very small and crowded. The previous one was very good. What type of quidch match is this? Alfonso Cuarón missed some important character too. And another failure was Dumbledore.He was very young as a headmaster of such an academy. His voice is not much good. I was very sad to see the movie. It was failed to satisfy me and all the children who were great fan of Harry potter. Now the 4th part is filming. Another new director has came, Mike Newell. I do not know whether he be success or not. Please bring Chris Columbus back as he has experience to make first two part of Harry potter. Chris Columbus is successful to those movies. He knows all about Harry potter. So, for the 5th part please bring him.Please bring Chris Columbus back to direct Harry potter again. So that we can see another great creation of him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Roller-coaster Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this installment was a roller-coaster ride in 2 ways: the quality of the various aspects e.g. acting, writing, balance (what got included / what was edited out) etc. was uneven; but the film itself was also an emotional roller-coaster ride. Pardon my comments but has no one noticed how splendid this 3rd installment is? Alfonso Cuaron has done a great job, throwing in a much-needed magic touch (finally!) and giving us delightful moments and insights into film-making techniques. I have to admit I have not read all the comments here but I am surprised that of the 20-odd comments I ran through, none have said anything about his rich use of tone &amp; colour; combining them with John William's music and long-neglected techniques (e.g. zeroing in / out from scenes) to effectively create a myriad tapestry of moods, nuances &amp; emotions. In my opinion, this is the most important thing Mr. Cuaron has done for the series, and is what elevates the movie far above the 1st two installments. Admittedly I did not watch the Prisoner of Azkaban with too high expectations to begin with or with a critic's view to compare it with the books but I was very pleasantly surprised by the results. By setting up the lovely atmosphere, one gets sucked into HP's world (through the director's eyes) and is far more willing to forgive any shortcomings of the movie, of which there are many.Which brings us to the second part of this comment - namely that yes, it could have been (and should have been) done better - as observed by most. The acting by the young leads has improved (though still a bit one-dimensional), the CGI was done beautifully, the older actors were superb as usual, the mood was suitably darker, yada, yada, yada... Unfortunately, the ending felt a bit rushed and was unclear. And this is my biggest grouse. Instead of ending with a bang (which I fully expected it to given its wonderful start), I was a tad disappointed that it softly ended with a plomp, without so much of an emotional / action climax. I had trouble figuring out what had just happened at the end of the movie (admittedly, I don't remember the book too well) and I imagine those who have not read the books would be even more confused. Here the movie does follow the book quite closely, but I would have preferred if the director had taken a more creative approach with the ending, making it more dramatic. Potter purists may disagree but I think upping the ante makes up for the shortcomings in the acting (though sometimes this deficiency is accentuated) and is better for the film. In short, two thumbs up! Not for the purists, but for those with a willingness to have a good time and be enthralled by the abundance of magic on screen.</fullReview>

I still think the movies are brilliant, but not quite as good as the books.The only problem i have with the movie is the way that Ron is represented. Ron happens to be my favourite Harry Potter character. I think they have done Ron a great dis-service. Ron is far more that Harry's wise-ass side kick, and he has some brilliant lines in the book, which were sadly not incorporated into the movies.I wait for the next installment, and hope that the movie version of GoF lives up to the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a great movie with great special effects. Though they could have gone into better depth of his parents like they do in the book, but I'm sure they had a reason for timing for that. But otherwise, the actors and actresses were all wonderful as their characters. They did not over-act any parts and they did not under-act. I also think that they did a great job explaining everything, making it so if you didn't read or see the first two Harry Potters, then you could still understand the movie. The only bad thing I still think was the depth of the parents. So overall it was a great movie with great effects and great actors and actresses.

		<shortDescription>Finally, a cinematic Harry Potter!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No longer a disney magic kingdom Hogwarts, but a mystical place of the imagination. Not a rote by the numbers read along with the story film, but a cinematic vision of the book. Of course there are more differences but the spirit is truer. It will get harder and harder to keep all the details of each book as the books get longer and longer. This director took the bull by the horns, wrestled with it, and put his stamp on it. I find myself so enthralled with his vision that yesterday I just had to visit Hogwarts again and took an extended lunch hour to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 4th time. Went back to work humming Double Trouble. I do think that the Mauraders Map and the relationship of Prongs, et al. especially with the shape of the Patronus could have been explicated in just a few more lines with Sirius and the final Lupin scene, and needed to be. But when I compare how rote the other films were, especially the 2nd, and I think of Buck Beak dragging his claw in the loche and the four seasons of the whomping willow, Harry's talks with Lupin, all the details that just melt into the affectionate yet dangerous landscape, well I just sigh with happiness that there is finally a HP movie that I like as much of the books. I had almost given up. Gets a 92 from me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just give a short statement here. Having seen the first two movies, although not a Harry Potter reader, I went to see this movie because I expected it to be something like a linear extension of the whole thing. I haven't read the books because A) I don't have the time and B) I prefer other types of books, but strange for me, I did like the first two movies. Why? Because they take you away into another world for two hours and give you a nice, fairy tale like story that is easy going and very nice for the eye. Chris Columbus was a great director for this kind of movies. I own both on DVD and sometimes when I want to relax, I throw them in, lean back and eat some candies.Now for the Azkaban movie. I saw the making of before and did know that I had to expect something different. I heard about "finally being able to wear blue jeans" - "more like real children" and things like that. When the movie opened, the scene where Harry and his foster parents run through the house, I had a sudden flashback. I felt back in the early 70s. The granularity of the film gives a rather rough impression, the colors were altered to the black and white end of the spectrum, the screenplay or camera movement was hectic and MTV like, just like one of those "real life documentaries" they made in the early 70s when filmmakers experimented with new means of expression and tried to be as realistic as possible by means of brute force.The impression went on when Harry left the house and finally reached that tavern (I forgot the name) and it even went on later in Hogwards. How come that Hagrets (forgive me if I get the names wrong, I never saw them in writing actually, since I only watched the movies) shag is all of a sudden on a hill slope although it was on an even surface and close to the school in the first two movies? There were several other clear breaks with the geography of the first two movies but I don't remember them now.All in all the impression I have is this: A new director comes in and he has to make a name for himself by throwing everything out that the former director did. Steady camera shots? I make the camera move around. Rich and nice colors? I go as black and white as I can. Locations which give you a nice and cozy feelings? I make locations as realistic and unpleasant as I can. Fancy school uniforms? I let them wear blue jeans. Not too much you might say. But it's enough to ruin the whole impression you get. Watching a movie is about the total impression it has on you and for me, the impression was ruined. I will certainly not buy the DVD. Even the casting was horrible. Who picked that dude who replaced the late Richard Harris? I know it's hard to fill Harris' shoes but that dude was certainly out of place. He reminded me more of a circus clown who was given a couple of lines (thank god not too many) and added to my disappointment.Should they ever make a fourth film, I hope it's Chris Columbus again, otherwise it's very doubtful that I will watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I liked most about the movie was its ending. Harry zooming on his Firebolt and appearing really happy was, in my opinion, a different, but good ending. And just prior to the ending were some disappointing parts. Like the part where Peter Pettigrew is seen on the Marauders' Map, the complete absence of the concept of the Marauders, the Firebolt coming in pretty late into the movie, the werewolf looking like something that I could swat away with a tennis racquet, no Cho Chang :-) ... I could go on.But then when I sit to analyse the good parts, I see a lot more of them - the handling of the dementors and the Patronus charm, the slick handling of the time turner related scenes, the very realistic Buckbeak, the funny way with which the whomping willow was handled, lots of good effects, improved acting in general.While Cuaron has done a really good job of explaining concepts like the time turner to a viewer not familiar with the books, at some places you do wish that he had handled things better. Not mentioning facts like who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs really are can really leave some viewers in a lurch.But on the whole I felt the movie was handled very well. Giving the movie a sinister touch only gears up the viewers for what is to come in future movies (as is the case with the books). I would definitely recommend the movie to any person who loves Harry Potter - it is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far the best Harry Potter film yet, but it still left me feeling disappointed. Cuaron has taken the franchise and improved it, he has made it grow up along with the characters. The film was scary at times and moving at others. The special effects where the best yet and very rarely looked CGI which was surprising. The acting was a mixed bag however. Only a few stood out; Oldman was brilliant if a little underused, Emma Watson was outstanding and a talent to watch but poor Harry Potter can no longer carry a film, the scenes with other people in were more entertaining. It's also a big shame that there was only one Quidditch match in this one, also how long would it have taken to explain the authors behind the Maurauders Map?8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie stank. It was not in line with the first two. The sets changed, the location looks totally different. All those little details in 1 and 2 that made for a common look and feel element to the movie (the book always attempted for the same feel when you read it) are lost. The director can't have read the book or had his kids there to make the movie honest otherwise they would have burned dad at the stake for blatant mistakes. I won't say that the director could not have done a great job but they obviously let em have 2 many liberties. What's the frakin deal anyway. I mean just study the fricking first two movies, work the same magic, keep things as similar as possible for the feel and it would have been a hit. Who the heck approved this piece, it wrecked the whole series. So much left out, so much out of order, no details with even a remote similarity. You would think the author would have had a shi% storm once she saw it. Do us all a favor and re-do this one with the original formula in tact. We don't care what it costs just do it right! Yes, we would pay to see it done right and I think that all the viewers of the first two would agree to that. Let's keep the movies on par with the book. It's damn stu&amp;1d to put out such great book work and then two brilliant movies only to allow a #3 to be so bad. Heck I was looking forward someday to buying the entire movie collection but with #3 out there I feel it would be a waste of good money. I could rip this third movies up on details after detail either gotten wrong or left out or out of sequence but whats the point. Overall they did it wrong and they need to get back and do it over again. Oh BTW, the new Dumbeldore needs talk slower and more to the point, he never rattled off his dialog like the new guys doing. If I were Harry I'd hide under a rock an pray that they fire the new director or set him straight, whatever it takes to remake it. It wasn't bad it just wasn't in line with the book.</fullReview>

A number of episodes from the book have been deleted, enabling the director to concentrate upon the basic narrative. The young stars, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, have certainly found their feet, each giving a polished performance far in advance of their previous efforts. The real coup of this film is, however, the supporting cast, if one can describe the superb actors Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Timothy Spall and Alan Rickman in such inadequate terms. Their portrayals are, to a man, completely convincing. Of the new members of Hogwarts staff, only Michael Gambon doesn't perhaps quite hit the mark, lacking the mystic air of his predecessor. Emma Thompson is spot-on with other celebrity character-actor cameos effectively inserted. The only drawback is that the unrelenting bad weather at Hogwarts will do little for our tourist trade!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is the third in the series of books and movies. For the third installment, Alfonso Cuaron takes over for Chris Columbus as director. And he truly shines as he takes the helm! "Azkaban" is my favorite of the Harry Potter movies! The imagery is beautiful and amazing, such as Buckbeak the hippogriff's appearance. There has been much creative license taken with the original book, we must admit. But a few of the changes could be called improvements, such as the development of the Marauder's Map. Anyway, I'll be looking forward to what Mike Newell can do when he directs the fourth installment, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was a little disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was somewhat disappointing because it did not follow the book closely enough. The movie did not seem to stress enough Harry's fear of the big dog following him. Dementors do not fly, they float. Malfoy and gang appeared to Harry as dementors and this was not shown.. Snape regularly gives Lupin a potion for his peculiar affliction and this was not mentioned. There were many other omissions and it is my opinion that these omissions did not serve that movie well. Some of the things which were left out are going to be crucial to the next installments. I think the director made the movies banking on the fact that many people have already read the books. I know the books are getting longer but I also think that the writers of the film need to read the next installment to ascertain what they should emphasize in the current movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was excellent. Absolutely fantastic. The style made you realise immediately that the movie was in the hands of another director. (Nothing against Chris Columbus... I loved the first two movies as well). It was definitely darker and scarier than the previous ones and the acting and effects were superb. The kids have really grown into mature actors and now that they have a bit more practice and experience, they looked and performed great. I haven't read the books, but I loved the story. Emma Thompson did a good job but I feel she was wasted. The movie could have done without those scenes... A very enjoyable experience... awesome film. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Harry Potter So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite Harry Potter movie so far. I have to admit I only read the first book. And I read the first book after I had already seen the first movie. So I think it kind of spoiled it for me. So I haven't read any of the other books.But I have made a point to see each movie that has come out. And I think the Prisoner of Azkaban was better - and more scary - that the first two.I also liked the addition of Gary Oldman and David Thewlis to the cast. And I think Michael Gambon does a wonderful job taking his role over from Richard Harris. The only cast member who bothered me was Emma Thompson - she didn't seem to fit it. The minute her character came on the screen I thought "Oh, theres Emma Thompson" - I came out of the fantasy and into reality. And I think Director Alfonso Cuarón did a wonderful job with his direction.My favorite special effects were The Dementors, who are pretty dern frightening just in themselves. They are pretty ugly scary creatures, enough to give small children nightmares.But all in all, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite Harry Potter movie so far.</fullReview>

The only annoying thing when you like a movie is have people forcing down on you the "But it was horrible!" oh well, to each its own, right?

Good for her, she's a woman who understands book-adaptation and it must feel good not to regret having allowed them to "rip her baby" as she put it.I think it was a lot of fun - and although I do share people's opinion on how Kloves keeps making Ron an idiot I am willing to bet he won't be able to do this forever. But I think if ever there was a Hermione book, it was PoA - so let her seize it *shrug*.Oh anyways, I loved it and my friends loved it which thankfully made it a gratifying movie-going-experience Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lamentably better than the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film expecting something along the lines of the first two films, and was surprised to find that this film was very different. Chunks of the story are missed out so the film isn't so attentative to detail as the Chris Columbus ones were. Also, this film is much more "artistic", if you want to put it that way; the seasons are represented colorfully and that sort of thing. But this isn't a bad thing, on the contrary, this film is pretty entertaining with the adult actors doing a good job, but the kids seriously getting on your nerves. Look out for Lenny Henry as the shrunken head on the Knight bus ("It's gonna be a bumpy ride"). Decidedly worth seeing. Enjoy it! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally for me the third movie was definitely the best out of the three. I think it also helped that the third book was my favorite. It also helped me understand the movie a lot more although if you haven't read the 3rd book then i suggest you do after or before you see it, because it helps you to appreciate the story more. There are a lot of people complaining about the acting which i did not have much of a problem with. Rupert(Ron) was there for comic relief, did not do much other wise, but that was his main outline in the book as well so i thought he did fantastic. Daniel(Harry) has definitely improved a lot from the first two films, he has learned to put a lot of emotion but not over the top. Emma Watson(Hermione)has developed the most since the first 2 because b4 she was over exaggerating her acting in her words and actions which now seemed to have diminished. Rickman(Snape),Smith(Mcgonagall),Coltrane(Hagrid) had minor rolls in the movie but they were the same as the first 2. Although Rickmans part has evolved.The new additions of Thewlis(Lupin), whom i thought captured Lupin very well with his weird hand gestures to his slow,calm tone.Oldman(Black), Very well done at making him look gross and scary.Spall(pettigrew),excellent, really did disgust me!!Gambon(Dumbledore), looked almost exactly like the late Harris, except he was more mysterious. Thompson(Trelawney),done well she had the whole appearance of the crazy,weird divination teacher.Felton(Malfoy), I found he did an excellent job but i don't think his character's emotions were right.He came across as a scared little sissy,who seemed to run away screaming in most of his scenes, like when he's attacked by the hippogriff(though very comic scene)and when Hermione went at him and when harry through a snowball at him. Yes he should have been scared but he is a Malfoy,he's supposed to act like nothing scares him,especially not girls!! The CG effects i thought were well done especially, Buckbeak he really looked as though he was real. The whooping willow was done a lot better in this movie, definitely more effective. I really like the look of the werewolf as well, very eerie glad they made him thin and hairless unlike most werewolves you hear about.As for the set i thought is was very realistic, didn't like the fact that the most of the grounds had changed. I wish they would have used the same location for the first two.During the film i also didn't like how the movie kept fading to a black screen for scene change!!Overall the movie was enjoyable, excited to see the next one since there will be a new director as well. If you haven't seen it I suggest you do, it is a lot darker and has more emotion than the first two!! It is also less like the book than the first two, but so far this movie has been my favorite!! Hope you enjoy it!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Harry Potter Fans, this film can really satisfied me. It is full of excitement and fun. The acting of all actors, esp. Daniel and Gary Oldman is great. The story of the film is quite different from the book, but I think the changes are good. They suit the film. My favourite parts of the movie are the sense that Harry and Hermione go back into the past and the conversation between Sirius and Harry, very touching. The music by John Williams is excellent and I really hope that he can get an Oscar nomination. However, if the movie can explain more clearly about the relation between Lupin, Sirius and James,and why Harry's Patronum is Prongs, it will be better. This film is worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This might be a change too far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers Ahead***Disappointingly this films merely 'skims' the book, and might be better described as inspired by J.K. Rowlings novel rather than based on it. Book and screenplay visibly diverge in this third installment of the Potter franchise and significant differences between the two have emerged. Amongst others, liberties were taken with the story of Harry's Firebolt, the first Boggart lesson with Lupin, and the Marauders map as well as the ruthless condensing of several Quidditch matches and Hogsmeade visits, and the subsequent discarding of detail. This has left a couple of plot legacies that will need to be dealt with in subsequent movies in order for the whole thing to make sense. The spirit too has taken a knock with the admittedly unavoidable substitution of Gambon for the late Richard Harris, but the change of director means that the feel of the movie has shifted away from the formula made successful by Columbus. Whether the new director read the book beforehand or not I have no idea, but the movie looks like he didn't, and suffers for it. I was left with a real feeling that this was just another day at the office for all involved and none of the passion or humour of the book comes through. It's not helped by the gap between second and third installment which has left some of the principal 'child' actors unrecognisable. At school we aged over the year, but the relatively short summer break wasn't enough to make much difference, but with the movies being shot in a matter of weeks after a break of 18 months the opposite effect is noticed. I had to check on the IMDb to make sure that Longbottom was actually still being played by Matthew Harris. Other disappointments include Emma Thompson who is miscast as Trelawney, and Thewlis who was unconvincing as the unfortunately named Remus Lupin. Gambon as Dumbledore lacks the gravitas of Harris, but with four movies to go should grow into the part.Having said all that the movie does gad along at pace, with the pick of the early scenes being the wild ride aboard the Knight Bus. The time shifting scene is handled competently if not brilliantly, and the Hippogriff (which I'm guessing was a real horse, with CGI head and wings added) was very convincing. A word about its intensity. My seven year old boy loved it, while my daughter, four, watched most of it through her fingers. Something to bear in mind when bringing the children.Overall it scores a 7/10 and while a step down in class from the other movies is still watchable. It could have been better however and we can only hope that Mike Newell who is currently shooting 'Goblet of Fire' makes a better fist of it.</fullReview>

How did the Weasley family afford a trip to Egypt? Why were Hermione and Ron not allowed in the pub, when they were all in there in the book? Peter Pettigrew was not on the maurauders map in the book, why was he there in the film? Weren't Hermione and Ron meant to have a huge fallout? Hermione wasn't meant to just appear in the classrooms! And Sirius was meant to explain all about the secret keeper and how he fought Peter. All together a film that, any one who has read the book will agree, doesn't follow the book at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shallow representation of the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen all three of the films produced so far and have read all of the novels out in print so I think I am qualified to say that the new movie is sadly lacking from the first two in depth of character and explanations. Until this film the studio had been careful to include all the scenes in the book producing a faithful representation of the novel as JK Rowling envisioned it. Much as the makers of the LoTR trilogy was painstakingly careful to produce a COMPLETE telling of the novels. In my opinion it was this change in format that led to the films being so very believable, emotional, enveloping, and ultimately popular. This new film however has been noticeably glossed over and smoothed up. Most all of the characterizational diologue and sub-plot action in this film was removed or oversimplified into a pathetic gesture or, perhaps a weighted glance, shaving the story down to its large unremovable plot scenes and robbing the story of all its real feeling and emotion. The difference between this one and the other two being mainly the change of plot coverage from all REMEMBERABLE scenes to all UNREMOVEABLE scenes, not to mention the obvious drop in quality... Like the single quidditch match simplified to mostly shots of one character in a featureless "stormcloud" background not showing the depth and three-dimensional qualities of the first two movies; the change in characters (the fat lady, Crab and Goyle, Dumbledore?) Speaking of Dumbledore, did anyone else notice how much more shabby, scrawny, and disheveled this movie's portrayal of Dumbledore was, he is shown in far less impressive clothing, with less hair, colored salt and pepper and not the impressive white of the first two years, looking far less the worlds greatest wizard he was in the first films. Also, aside from a few arguments and a short scene of candy eating, most of the dialogue and character development between Hermione, Ron, and Harry seems to be missing from the story. The relationships and characterisation of the three main characters is a major part of the story and even if the dialogue isn't specifically advancing the plot with every word. It is still a major part in establishing the bonds of friendship and the characterization needed to give the characters the depth and believability of real people. I don't believe this film will turn me from the series as a whole, however, it was editing and missing scenes that kept the animated version of LoTR from being the definitive film version of the novels, and the producers of the Harry Potter films are moving in a similar direction. It will be the next film that will determine whether these, eventually 7 films will be the magical Star Wars of our time or just another glorified overrated television show version of an outstanding novel by a gifted writer. The movie industry now needs to recognise the willingness of an audience today to watch a movie far longer than two hours for the sake of finishing a good story. In the end it will be a love of the films as respectable representations of the loved novels that will have me buying every DVD of every film. A predictable, flat, glossy, shallow version just may not be worth watching more than once or twice, not therefore worth purchasing... ?? I hope to see every scene I loved in the novel accurately and respectfully recreated in the new goblet of fire movie, a particularly good novel. I for one just hope the movie companies can keep their corprate, commercialised, advertising and product development people OUT of the editing room from now on I give it 6/10, because what they did bother to show was good to see</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent third installment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third story with Harry Potter is easily better than the first film and is at least equal to the second and this third chapter seems to have a darker edge to it. Story begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) going back for his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and re-teaming with his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) but while at school he learns that a prisoner named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban and that he is responsible for the death of his parents and now wants to kill him! Harry meets some of the new faculty like Professor Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson) and Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and while Sirius Black is still roaming the area the Dementors guard every exit but are they really going to protect them?*****SPOILER ALERT*****Word spreads that a werewolf is also on the prowl and everyone must be careful but Harry finds a map that may help him solve the mystery about Ron's rat and even the death of his parents. A giant bird/horse named the Buckbeak is to be killed so Hermione and Harry figure out how to go back into time and try and help themselves as Black and the werewolf get involved in their adventures.This third installment is directed by Alfonso Cuaron and he adds a darker tone to the series which I enjoyed and it seems to fit as each of these characters are getting older and not exactly kids anymore. In each of these films the character Hermione keeps getting more prominent and Watson could easily star in her own series of films, her character actually takes charge and brings Harry along with her! The actors are getting older and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy has grown a good foot taller than the last film. Some new actors pop up in roles like Emma Thompson, Timothy Spall, Julie Christie and Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore. Like the previous two installments this is a visual delight and there is so much detail in every scene like all the pictures on the walls having a life of their own. One of the hard parts of viewing this film is trying to catch all the action that goes on in every shot as anything and everything has a life of it's own. One thing about the story that I found confusing was Sirius Black wanting to kill Harry. I never understood why he wanted this and if it was explained in the film than I missed it. Readers of the Potter books should be more than satisfied as this story is brought to life on screen but even if you haven't read any of them (Like myself) this is still a very entertaining film from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's entertaining, if a bit confusing, to read reviews that praise a director's style while complaining that it's hard to follow the story. One of the things we might ask of a director of a film based on a complex novel is that he or she tell us that story without sacrificing narrative to flashy visuals. If Prisoner of Azkaban is an indication of the route to be taken the ads for the next Harry Potter film will read something like:YOUR FAVORITE TEEN WIZZ KIDS ARE BACK IN A NON-STOPRoller-coaster RIDE!

Talk about a scary movie...To put all this in perspective, the movie looks great, the cast does a fine job, I loved the score and any fan of the books will be able to fill in the blanks in the story line. Still, I'm wondering how much of the director's job we should be doing. As for the "edgy" and "dark" qualities the PR department has been emphasizing, these qualities have always been present in the stories - nicely balanced with humor and a genuine sense of wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film while in NY this past weekend with my daughter and best friend, and it was great. It did leave out some of the details of the book that will make true Harry Potter fans find it somewhat lacking but it had some awesome special effects and a nice plot twist or two thrown in. There's not so much focus on their studies and Hermione's part is more minor than I expected. It was enjoyable and I would go see it again. My daughter loved it as she loved the first two and Malfois get smacked for his insults as I've been desiring to do myself. There was a bird / pegasus creature in there that was interesting. And yet another glimpse of Muggle London life in comparison with the magical lifestyle. The characters are more down to earth in this film and you learn still more about Harry's parents, and the past. Overall, a worthy to see at the theater's film, and I don't say that about too many movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third installment of the Harry Potter series is decidedly darker than the first two. It is entertaining none the less with a new director at the helm. The characters and the actors that play them are growing. What is most profound in this movie is Harry's discovery that he can take care of himself. He conquers his lack of confidence in himself, and proves to we the viewers once again why we are captivated by this series written by J.K. Rowling. I recommend to anyone that they not skip reading these books. The movies are a joy, but they cannot convey the important details that the books flesh out for you. In the movie, there are several things that are not connected for the viewer. These will be things that will come up in future movies, so it will be interesting to see how they sort that out in the future. Daniel Ratcliffe is quickly becoming a handsome young lad as well, this will be the first glimpse into the cult following I suspect he will head up in coming years.</fullReview>

I reckon Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is much more action packed than the first two films which to me made it more enjoyable. The "scary moments" really helped the story flow, and gave older viewers a break from the more childish moments. The scene where Harry and the gang go back in time worked out well and is understandable, the other good news is that there is not too much magical jargon appearing in your brain as you watch the movie. Better still were guaranteed at least two more Harry potter films, which means Harry and Hermione will most certainly being going out, maybe we can even expect a end of year prom...?Such is magic 9/10</fullReview>

The parts that were left out left out details that make for a better story, but the movie was still terrific visually and plot wise. More could have been done to give a bigger punch to the important sences. I only hope that there will be more in the next one.

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was a pretty good adaption of the book. It had even better graphics than the first two and you could see a more artistic taste to the directing. I thought that in some situations the movie didn't get descriptive enough and through off people who hadn't read the book. Things like not explaining who prongs, padfoot, wormtail and moony confused why they randomly were mentioned. Also when Harry received the Firebolt was a horrible timing and did not flow at all, it made more sense when he was giving it during the quidditch season. I think the movie should've also showed more quidditch scenes because they won the cup this year and there was quite a few chapters on it. I did enjoy the shrieking shack scene, it was very great portray from the book and it was cool to see it on film. I can't wait for this movie to come on DVD so I can buy it. I also can't wait until the fourth movie comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, and I didn't even LIKE the first two (***1/2)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thoroughly lukewarm on the first two Harry Potter films, and though I was a little intrigued because this new installment was directed by Alfonso Cuaron ("Y Tu Mama Tambien"), I still wouldn't say I was looking FORWARD to it. Boy, am I glad I went. "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is one of the most thrilling big-screen experiences I've had in quite a while. Harry (a quickly maturing Daniel Radcliffe, and all the better actor for it) is now in his third year at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and has just received word that a dangerous murderer named Sirius Black (an enjoyably berserk Gary Oldman) has escaped from prison. Black was a friend of Harry's parents who betrayed them, leading to their deaths, and now he's after Harry. That may sound like a pretty spare story, but it's all the movie needs. From beginning to end, it's one amazing, creative set-piece after another.Maybe I just didn't notice before because I didn't really care for the films, but was Hogwarts School always this beautiful? The grounds of this school are absolutely breathtaking. I'd go to school there in a second.Even though I was intrigued by Cuaron directing the film, I hadn't really expected his style (as opposed to the apple pie non-style of the previous director, Chris Columbus) to have an impact on such a mainstream, multi-million dollar commodity as a Harry Potter film, but I was thankfully wrong. In addition to the more whimsical and amazing visuals, Cuaron actually brings a lean and mean edge to the film. That's right, I said the new Harry Potter film actually has "edge". Not a whole lot, but certainly more than the previous films. The story moves quickly (even when it takes its time), it's genuinely exciting and sometimes scary, and what happens to the characters actually seems to MATTER. There's also a rather brilliantly done time-travel twist near the end, which is actually what's responsible for me raising the star rating by half a star. After this rip-roaring, exhilarant film, I'm actively looking forward to the next Harry Potter film, which has never happened before. At least I am if Cuaron's directing it.</fullReview>

Often the scenes are single shots: the movement is achieved by panning in and out, including different things in the frame. Harry loses consciousness a lot in this instalment. Cuarón fixes on irises ? where a pinpoint in blackness widens into a full image - as the best way to communicate his coming to. The device is used repeatedly: the scenes unfold like the turning pages of a fairy tale. The colour too is great. The images are bleached white or yellow, like the pages of an aged storybook. This visual finesse got me excited all on its own: it was such a relief after Harry's previous, lumbering outings.Hogwarts is still a bore. Going to class with Harry and pals, I was only reminded of how impatient I felt at school. There are assuredly more pyrotechnics at Hogwarts ? the closest I got to magic was a Bunsen burner ? but there is still the dreary whiff of routine. The film lingers too long on these scenes. The main thrust of the story concerns the escaped prisoner of the title, who ? it is darkly whispered ? murdered Harry's parents. Now he is coming after Harry. He is pursued by his gaolers ? creepy wraiths put together out of ragged black cloth and long talons. The film recovers its footing in its final third, when these elements come together. Time loops ? Harry has an opportunity to live through an experience twice. It suggests a Choose Your Own Adventure story ? more than one narrative path is available to the reader. Here the paths are cumulative ? on his second pass, Harry can see himself going through the experience the first time. It has a pleasing metaphysical buzz, like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day.There is a lot of incidental pleasure to be had from the performances. As Professor Snape, Alan Rickman is so monumentally serious ? and deep voiced ? that everything he intones provokes a fit of giggles. He swoops about in his black cape, his face set and grim. Daniel Radcliffe has a limited range of expressions ? he grimaces an awful lot. He is constantly shown up by his fellow cadets. With his ruddy complexion and oversize cartoon features, Ron (Rupert Grint) has a marvellous hangdog face ? the boy who always takes an extra half-second to get the joke. He and Hermione (Emma Watson) ? now a budding adolescent ? are an expert double act, the squabbling couple who do not yet realise they are in love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opinion about the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was a pretty good adaption of the book. It had even better graphics than the first two and you could see a more artistic taste to the directing. I thought that in some situations the movie didn't get descriptive enough and through off people who hadn't read the book. Things like not explaining who prongs, padfoot, wormtail and moony confused why they randomly were mentioned. Also when Harry received the Firebolt was a horrible timing and did not flow at all, it made more sense when he was giving it during the quidditch season. I think the movie should've also showed more quidditch scenes because they won the cup this year and there was quite a few chapters on it. I did enjoy the shrieking shack scene, it was very great portray from the book and it was cool to see it on film. I can't wait for this movie to come on DVD so I can buy it. I also can't wait until the fourth movie comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mexican waves in part three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the third HP film, previous director Chris Columbus has stepped down to be simply co-producer and handed the directorial reigns to Mexican Alfonso Cuaron, until now best known for his comedy "Y Tu Mama Tambien". Otherwise the only change of personnel is Michael Gambon, replacing the deceased Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore, which he does exceptionally well. The main difference in this third instalment of the narrative is the tone: except for a humorous opening sequence, this movie is darker than the others and a little more complex in that characters are not always what they seem. Another (smaller but significant) difference is that, unless I'm imagining things, Hogwarts now has more black and Asian pupils.As usual, Daniel Radcliffe is at the heart of the adventure as Harry himself and he is now well accomplished in the part. It is gratifying to see Emma Watson given a more assertive role as Hermione Granger, although this seems to be at the expense of Rupert Grint who - by comparison - looks rather wet as Ron Weasley. Cuaron has done well to follow Columbus' practice of making full use of a wonderful range of British character actors. All the 'old hands' are there, with Alan Rickman in characteristically fine form, but there are some splendid new performances including Emma Thompson, David Thewlis and an almost unrecognisable Gary Oldman (as the eponymous prisoner).Harry Potter films are unlikely ever to win Oscars, but this one - like the previous two - is thoroughly entertaining and a visual treat with some new creatures such as the hippogriff Buckbeak. In the years to come, the challenge is going to be balancing the tricky timing of two more books and four more films with a young acting trio who are visibly aging at least as fast as their fictional counterparts. The franchise is now so valuable and so popular that all concerned will do what it takes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, this is just a joke. Of course I can´t and I wouldn´t be a wizard. But it would be good if I had the power. Being at Hogwarts would certainly be a great adventure!!! As you can see, I really loved this third Harry Potter´s adventure. It´s intelligent and has lots of action. For the first time, the novel had some of its facts left out. Alfonso Cuaron didn´t do as Chris Columbus did. He selected the most important facts and turned them into this great movie picture. I´m not criticizing Columbu`s job. The first film (made by him) is the best of the already released three ones. But Cuaron had to work with the slowest paced story of all the novels about Potter. Cuaron also created a dark atmosphere. Everything is dark all long the story. There`s also lots of special effects and supernatural facts.My rate 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surely NOT disappointed when I saw this movie, I thought that the change of director was the best thing that happened to this series. He didn't rely on too many special effects to create such a wonderful adaptation of J.K Rowling's third novel. It's great to see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson &amp; Rupert Grint have really grown into their roles and I think we can expect even more greater things as each novel is made in the future.The only flaws that I can note is some of the important details from the book that they left out in the movie, I think they could have made it even more fantastic than it already is.Other than that, I'm looking forward to the next installment and the sixth novel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film with true Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie after seeing "Spider-Man 2", and in my opinion this is a much better "fantasy" movie. While Spider-Man attempts to ground the fantasy aspect amidst everyday real-life situations, this move is not encumbered by any such goals. Its a fantasy movie through and through. It therefore succeeds in making the audience suspend their disbelief far better than Spider-Man, making it enjoyable escapist fare. I certainly did not want to leave the theatre after, I wanted to linger in that world of magic for just a little bit longer. I suppose I have to wait for the next installment of Harry Potter.In particular, I found the music and the general backdrop worthy of recommendation. Each played a significantly important role in drawing the audience into JK Rowling's world. Scenes of note - the song by the choir in the beginning, and Professor Lupin's room with all those golden globes when he is teaching Harry stand out. Alan Rickman as Professor Snape outdid himself this time around; while mostly everyone else seemed a little rushed into their dialouges (with the exception of maybe Lupin), Rickman alone seemed to take that extra frame before talking, resulting in that delicious menace that seemed to underly Snape's words.And I've saved the best for the last - Emma Watson as Hermione. Alfonso Cuaron seemingly did not need to work much oh her, she brings a certain magic all of her own to every scene she is in. The beauty of Emma is that she somehow manages to carry off Hermione's know-it-all stuffiness, her superhuman workload (all those extra classes) and most importantly, the guiding force for Ron and Harry (think about it, how many of their 'sensible' actions have been influenced by Hermione?) without ever giving the suggestion that its anything but Harry's movie. If Harry is somewhat of a loose cannon, albeit a powerful one, it is Hermione who provides the stability in the background. Hermione is again responsible for key elements towards the climax - (* WARNING, SPOILERS Ahead* ) Hermione throwing the stones into Hagrid's hut to warn of the Minister and the executioner's arrival, Hermione's time travel amulet being crucial to saving the day, and Hermione saving Harry's life by calling the werewolf-Lupin away. In a rather delicious bit of irony, the film admits this when Sirius tells her "You are indeed the brightest witch of your time" or words to that effect. A truly profound moment. ( *END SPOILERS* ) And of course she's pretty to boot, with very expressive eyes. Sometimes you get the feeling the camera is afraid to linger on Hermione for too long... for obvious reasons. It is no wonder that Cuaron mentioned in an interview that he would love to do a Love story with Emma when she is older, and we have no doubt in her ability to deliver.As for those who pain themselves about the pieces of the plot that had to be left out, all I can say is if you see the movie for yourself, and you don't expect exactment or perfection, you wont be disappointed. If while watching the movie you concern yourself with say your friend who hasn't read the book and fret that he/she might not follow the story, then yes you might end up feeling short changed. My take on it? Enjoy the movie, and point your friend in the direction of the books. A good chance to convert yet another :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter series has always been kind of solemn, not much jokes in the whole story. This time, it's different. With Alfonso Cuarón, it has a sense of comedy. There are also some touching part in the movie. You will be excited, amused and impressed. Ron and Malfoy become comedian this time. They are hilarious! I'm so glad that I've watched this movie in cinema, not at home(as I always do). It's really upsetting that Alfonso Cuarón is not going to direct Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. He made the movie complete, with a sense of humor. Maybe it's due to the work of the Steven Kloves, I don't know. Anyway, it's brilliant. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely outclasses the previous two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am stunned to see opinion so strongly divided on this film, with many deriding it as a great disappointment and as the worst of the three Potter films so far. Personally, I believe the film to be in a completely different league to its two predecessors, surpassing and outclassing them so astoundingly it's almost embarrassing for poor old Columbus.New director Alfonso Cuaron's marks are all over this movie. Where the first two films exhibited an unadorned, functional narrative lacking any film-making flourishes or cinematic flair, Prisoner of Azkaban is a joyous treasure-box of celluloid delight. Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets contented themselves with simply going through the novels' plot joylessly and mechanically - Azkaban, on the other hand, weaves a spellbinding visual tapestry of a magical world, relying on all the non-narrative techniques open to cinema to bring this world to life.Thus we have beautiful, rich cinematography (too many examples to mention, but the frequent use of wide-angle lenses to juxtapose foreground with background stands out, and just check out the shot of Harry riding Buckbeak as he glides over the lake's surface), a Hogwarts that has changed considerably (into something much more magical and majestic), and direction that frequently borders on the genius. From the hand-held camera in the early Dursleys scene, to the 1920s style fadeouts (which I thought were a nice touch), to the visual delight of the changing of the seasons, to the seemingly constant motif (right from the opening scene) of going through windows (and even mirrors), there are so many wonderful little touches in this film that, after two viewings, I can already see that it will be one to repay many repeat viewings.It's not a perfect film, however, and what's frustrating is that it's so very close to being a masterpiece. Its one great flaw is that it fails to properly explain the backstory linking Pettigrew, Lupin, Black, James Potter and Snape, as well as their link to the Marauders' Map. Just ten more minutes of running time expended on this and the film would have been a solid-gold classic. As it is, the title of flawed gem will have to suffice.</fullReview>

There is a few intense parts of the movie that might scare little children. Professor Trawlorny was excellent. I just love here. I saw the movie three times and it was better and better each time.

		<fullReview>I must say I expect a lot from the third installment of the Harry Potter franchise. One thing that concerned me before I went that critics who gave HP1 and HP2 low ratings were now giving HP3 raving reviews.(To all of you Die Hard Harry Potter fans I warn you in advance that this review may be disturbing to your spirit) :)After seeing the movie I must say I was a little disappointed. I know that focus of this movie was a little more darker and now the kids of the movie were now going through puberty but this movie lacks something. First of all it was not as light as the first two movies. Even in scenes were the kids were simply having fun the movie was two dark. But I say it was too dark, because they went for the PG-13 rating (for the kids) instead of making it the fun loving Horror movie that this installment was crying out for.Another thing that concerned me was that J.K.R. gave this movie the thumbs up. Is she not as brilliant as we once assumed. Because as I writer I would have fough harder for the essence of the book to show through in this book.The absolute best thing about this movie was the justaposition of Harry dealing with his own personal demons (Dementors). This movie will do well, because HP has such a huge cult following. But one more movie like this and the HP fans will simply be nerds like the obsessed Stars Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek fans. God forbid that happens. This was the first franchise movie in a while that had a young and old multiracial following, but I felt that was neglected in this movie.I was honestly bored throughout parts of this movie. Oh my GOD they could have shelled out money for a good score. My little brother could have a better score with his 32 key keyboard. It's not liek they don't have the money. I've heard that this new director won 't be a part of HP4 so hopefully the new director doensn't choose to follow in his footsteps because of th critial acclaim.I give this movie a 6 out of 10.

I'm totally disappointed that they released this film when they did because I'm positive that the release date is the only thing that caused it to open poorer than the previous two. This film is far superior to the other two in every respect. The story is more intelligently translated to screen, the characters more genuine, the effects superb, etc. In short I find myself jaw on the floor, in rapt attention for the entire duration - which is pretty dam good considering I'm a 26 year old guy. I might even go so far as to say that it exceeds even the beloved Lord of the Rings series in fantasy accomplishment. It's truly awesome. The pace is nearly breakneck, the creatures utterly terrifying (yep, even to a 26 year old guy) and believable, the magic magical, and I could go on and on. I just adore this film. I really hope that this new director returns for some of the future ones. He - more than Chris Colombus - has an incredibly visceral style that you can't help but be drawn in by. He doesn't move the camera just for kicks, but he also doesn't leave it completely static for every scene either. His style is mature and effortless. If you haven't seen this film, you owe it to yourself to catch it on the bigscreen. I'd really like to see it again, perhaps even above seeing some of the new highly anticipated films.

		<fullReview>I was finally able to see the new Harry Potter movie this past weekend and was amazed at how well the movie was made; the continued maturing of Harry, Ron and Hermiane. Seeing all the professors back, yes even Snape. I thought the role of the Divinity Instructor was cast and played very well. Kudos. The only thing I was truly disappointed in was the casting of Dumbledore. I felt the actor was a little too quick with the wit and humor.Dumbledore's beard is snow white, not gray, and he did not keep it bound at the end. Dumbledore's beard and hair are also a lot longer than this new characters was. So much emphasis was put in to bringing the horrible feeling of the Dementor's and of being a prisoner of Azkaban, which I thought was wonderfully done. But I feel that just as much emphasis could have been put in to this new person who is trying to fill Dumbledores shoes.The Dumbledore character was very disappointing.</fullReview>

Even after switching directors and creating a more serious tone for the movie (perfect for Alan), the people making Harry Potter continue to underuse one of the most important characters in the movie. In the first two combined, I doubt Rickman had 20 minutes of on screen time. What makes the third even more tragic is the fact that all of the Harry Potter trailers were FILLED with images of Alan Rickman, but again, Snape fans get the shaft. What is the use of hiring these intelligent and highly trained and talented British actors if they're only in the film for 10 minutes, especially after showing those trailers. It was like sitting through a ballet after you thought you bought tickets to a comedy show: you feel robbed and p***ed throughout. For Shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what you may have heard, Prisoner of Azkaban is very much like the other two Harry Potter movies. I think it's a safe bet that people who liked the first two will like this one. On the other hand, if you didn't like one or both of the others, this one has the same flaws. Prisoner of Azkaban is a little more dark and scary, and the three kids act more like teens. But it's really the same basic story line. Harry can't get along with his aunt and uncle. He performs a few magic tricks. In short order, he returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with friends, Ron and Hermione. At the school, the three friends attend various classes in magic and are harassed by Malfoy. After a game or two of Quiddich, Harry encounters some supernatural menace, which by the end of the movie, he is able to overcome. The Potter movies, like the books on which they are based, seem to appeal more to children and their mothers than to other demographics. They don't have the universal appeal of classic children's movies like The Wizard of Oz and E T, the Extraterrestrial. Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) get to do more acting this time around (especially Watson), but unfortunately, neither is up to the task. They are caught in that awkward in-between stage that many child actors go through. They are too old to just act cute but haven't yet learned the craft of acting. They both fare no better than the typical teen actor on the Disney Channel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Tragically underused" is becoming their mantra.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tragically underused" is the first term that seems to come to mind for the Harry Potter films. All three tragically underuse the charismatic and talented Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, the second and third tragically underuse Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, the second tragically underuses Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, and the third tragically underuses Emma Thompson as Sybil Trelawney. They have still risen above these mistakes.This film is the best of the fine series and is markedly different. The first was a fanciful introduction to this world and our hero characters; the second was an hour and a half of pure fun (mostly provided by Branagh and Watson) with an hour-long horror movie mixed in; and the third is a stylish, dark, more subtle drama with some excellent comic relief (which is, this time, truly relief). Chris Columbus's "Chamber of Secrets" was not particularly visually stunning and was mostly carried by the wildly entertaining characters of Hermione Granger and Gilderoy Lockhart (both played brilliantly), but Alfonso Cuaron's "Prisoner of Azkaban" very quickly makes the point that Cuaron is a master of lighting and has a penchant for the visual metaphor--something all-too-little-used in film. *SMALL SPOILER* Harry runs away from his aunt and uncle and sits in front of a deserted playground (which is a wonderful image under any circumstances) that is lightly wetted with drops of water and is oh-so-beautiful, thanks to angles, the location, and, most noticeably, the lighting. This scene sets us up for what is to come visually and thematically. *SPOILER OVER*The best way to describe this new directoral direction is "stylish." Where Chris Columbus was a classicist who never really stuck out, Cuaron shows us that he leans heavily toward the formalist side of the fence. The only downside of this new direction is that it does place more pressure on Daniel Radcliffe, who does not appear up to the challenge. The repeating clock imagery was a wonderful subtle use of visual metaphor and the quiet clock ticking during the ending was also a nice, subtle metaphor that added much to the experience. Cuaron should be applauded for this film (honestly, an Oscar nod--not a win, mind you--is deserved)As for the acting, Daniel Radcliffe seems to be breaking under the strain of an increasingly deep and showy role under a more formalistic director. Meanwhile, the estimable supporting actors, from Emma Thompson to Gary Oldman, were solid as always. Rupert Grint continues to be adequate in the worst role of all of the children, not able to show much but also not needing to. Then there's Emma Watson--she was charismatic and had a wonderful presence from the first time she appeared on screen in "The Sorcerer's Stone," but as her character has become deeper she has only improved and I think that we are seeing a star grow before our eyes in her--especially if she grows up to be as attractive as it seems she will. She has been underused in all three films, but this one is getting it better. While it is probably the most Harry-centric film of the series, Hermione does get a more significant role and the adults are much downplayed (including, unfortunately, the complete departure of John Cleese) in favor of allowing our heroes (Harry, Hermione, and Ron) to take over the film.All in all, this is a wonderful film and startlingly serious and powerful. Most of the acting is good, with only Daniel Radcliffe standing out as inadequate; the comedy, when it appears, is hilarious; and the film is, plainly and simply, beautiful. It should have enough to keep the kids awake (and those in the theater when I went stayed awake--even though it didn't start until 9:15 PM), but it isn't overly loud and it really plays like a drama. I highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

When the audience finds Harry he is at his Aunts home in England practicing magic and avoiding his ever watchful Uncle, when his Uncles sister arrives and sends all into chaos. Obviously she has a great disliking of Harry as she continually insults him and his parents. Harry, in an adolescent fit ends up blowing her up like a balloon and running away from the house. And now the turmoil begins as Harry starts to see spectres of the grim, as an escaped madman hunt him. As if this wasn't enough the ministry for magic has sent Dementors to guard the school (Hogwarts).Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is just an adolescent boy trying to live out a wizards life. As Harry goes through this 'Harry Potter' series it seems that he is growing considerably, and I don't just mean physically. Daniel's acting career has become much better since the almost inconceivably bad acting of 'Harry Potter and the philosophers stone'. It's predicted that he can only get better.Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) was definitely the humorous aspect of the third Harry Potter movie. Rupert certainly provided the comic relief that the 'prisoner of Azkaban' needed. Ruperts acting has also gotten better as the series has gone on. Unfortunately it didn't seem as if Rupert put enough emotion into his part. Eg. When his rat was supposedly dead he was very upset. But none the less he can only get better.Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) is the smartest wizard of her age. Emma simply blew me away with her outstanding performance as Hermione out of all the actors in this movie Emma was definitely the best. One can only imagine what 'The Goblet of Fire and 'The order of the Phoenix' will be like with her in it. Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) was the seemingly evil madman, hell bent on killing Harry Potter. Unfortunately the role of Sirius Black didn't do Gary the credit it should have. Out of all the 2 ? hours that this movie went for Sirius (one of the main characters in this movie) was seen for about 15 minutes and the he was gone again. One can only hope that the remaining 'Harry Potter' movies give him more credit.Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) plays the Defence against the dark arts teacher who takes Harry Potter and teaches him about defending himself against Dementors. David was great and his role couldn't have been played by anyone else. Unfortunately the movie didn't really delve into the true Lupin as it should have.Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is the ever knowing Principal of Hogwarts. Michael did well to fit into this role when Richard died, and it was pleasing to see that he didn't try and imitate him in the role of Albus Dumbledore. Overall his performance was fair to good as he stars in his first 'Harry Potter' movie. This movie incorporates themes such as: 'reputations are just that, reputations', 'Looks can be deceiving', and a well known 'GOOD VS EVIL' ratio which make this movie what it is.The visual effects of this movie are excellent and the Dementors look perfect. They are exactly what people imagine them to be, which is exactly what they should be. Also, but not as good, the hippogriff was well made and moved (coincidently) much like a horse does. Which made it seem more life like. The whoomping willow was also good for a chuckle, there's nothing quite like seeing birds explode. But in everything there must be a fault and here it is. There are no-where near enough grizzly dark and utterly evil creatures lurching in the forbidden forest. This setting had the potential to have many sickly looking creatures popping out and attacking students. It would have been good to see that the movie didn't focus so much around the visual effects and more around the story of 'Harry Potter'.In many scenes in 'Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban' the music seemed just a little ???????.. wrong. For example when Harry flies the hippogriff over the Hogwarts and through the towers a soft opera sort of music played when it would have been far better to have action music as he weaved through the towers. But other than that the Music was fairly good. The SFX were excellent in this movie and just made it seem like it was actually happening. The Whomping Willows creaking just seemed like what a tree would sound like if it were to move. All up The sound effects were quite good.Tch! Tch! Tch! Tch! Michael Seresin I'm terribly sorry, but that was the worst cinematography I've ever seen. When I think of Harry Potter's cinematography I think of one scene in particular where Hagrid throws a rock into the water, you can here the splash but it makes no ripples (Amazing). Not to mention the blatant 'Titanic' rip-off. Try a little harder next time Michael.This Harry potter proved to be very dark, It would have looked so much better if in a couple of scenes they could have put a clear sky in. But a dark storyline calls for a dark movie so it was forgiven, Just.Many people would have you think that the Movie rivals 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy! But no need to fear, for I'm not one of them. Although this third Harry Potter was the best of the three I couldn't bring myself to say it was one of the best movies this millennia. But I predict that the series can only get better.Overall I give this a 3 out of 5 because the cinematography and the lack of comparison to the book were disgraceful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time travel story, my favorite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think that this is a film for little kids any more. It has gone beyond simple magic to some sophisticated logic comprehension. I think that this movie is the best among the three. It is no longer just about good versus evil. It actually has a twist, that made this whole movie so much more interesting and more enjoyable. I am especially interested in those films that have time travel, extra dimensions, etc. The director has done a good job describing the logic behind the time travel story, which could be confusing. And I did not get bored by watching the parallel story played out.I have never read any of the books. So I don't really know any of the magic names. There are quite a few new names that I can't understand. That is the only problem of this film. And I also had a little trouble understanding their English accent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was totally dumbfounded when we walked out of this movie. All the buildup and hype for THIS? Incredible. :-(It's awful, plain and simple. I hope the next one's better.The lack of continuity between this film and the previous two is jarring and unsettling. While the "new" Dumbledore was well-done, and his voice was extremely well done, there wasn't much to like in this installment. Well, other than Hermione's punching Draco.I assert that had I not read the book, I'd have been even more lost than I was having read the book in the week prior to seeing the movie. The Marauder's Map was not fully explained, nor was Harry's patronus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great...kind of disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw Harry Potter Three, I was utterly psyched. The first and second movies had been so good so that I thought the third would be awesome (especially because of the Dementors). Turns out the Dementors were quite different then in the book. I mean, they're not supposed to fly or freeze things over...and why did they skip so much other important stuff? Unless you've actually read the book, the movie makes no sense. In fact, I've read the book numerous times, and I was a little confused. It was not a bad movie. It was pretty good, actually, just not nearly up to par with the other HP movies. The directing was not great, and the transition from book to movie was TERRIBLE! They skipped some of the best parts, and frankly they should have done a better job. The acting was pretty decent, but the Hermione-Ron love thing was way too pronounced and defined at this point.One final word...if you've seen the Prisoner of Azkaban and you didn't like it, don't shy away from the books (if you haven't read them). In fact, read the third book! It will give you a whole new appreciation of the movie, and of the whole Harry Potter craze as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just say that i thought this movie was very good and entertaining. True it went by fast and left some things out but what you need to remember is that this is NOT the book it's a MOVIE. It's not going to be just like the book. That's why having the books is such a treasure because you have that extra bit of information and just ... more. Like i heard Stephen King say once "Movies and Books are like apples and oranges, they are both delicious, but in many ways are different" I've already seen it 3 times and tomorrow i'm going to see it again, and then next week with my grandmother. I have to say i LOVE this movie that much. I thought that the acting was wonderful by all the actors. And that Gary Oldman did a perfect job portraying Sirius. The new Dumbledore , i have to say, was nothing like the other one, but i don't think replacing what Richard Harris had done to the character was the plan. The new one did a good job making him his own Dumbledore, it's going to be hard to get used to him, and i think he needed to smile a bit more... but other than that he did well. I suggest anyone to see this movie ... HP fan or not, it's just that good of a movie. Better than the first two. Go HP!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what's up with this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thoroughly disappointed with Harry Potter 3. They didn't stick to the book at all! This movie missed so many important details and explanations of why things were the way they were. My dad, who has never read the books, said it went straight to the point, but he didn't understand why some things happened. I think one of the things he had trouble with was the time turner. It's hardly played up in the movie and it is one of the most important things because that's what saves the day. Another thing completely skipped is the whole Crookshanks feud. Sure, there was some mention, but definitely not to the point it's taken in the book. The feud between Ron and Hermione was mostly taken out of the movie, they were even flirting at points! Also, I was beginning to think that the broomstick wasn't even going to be mentioned. The book says that Ron and Hermione weren't even talking for the most part of the story because she had turned in the Firebolt to Professor McGonagal to check for jinxes because Harry receives the broom at Christmas from an unknown person who turns out to be Sirius. They changed so many things in this movie. Even the set was different! I was completely baffled at why there were so many differences. This movie is so different, it's like it isn't even part of the series. I know they had a new director and a new Dumbledore (I did like this Dumbledore better than the late one) but that is no excuse for veering so far away from the book. One thing that I did like about this movie compared to the others was the pacing of it. 1 &amp; 2, especially 1, was paced so slowly; the actors were slow, the scenes progressed slowly, everything took too long.This movie is said to be "darker" than the previous. This is no darker than any of the other ones. In fact, I think it's "lighter" that the first two. Harry is not faced with Voldemort, just dementors. And he didn't even face the dementors as much as in the book. This movie missed two more Quidditch games, one against Ravenclaw in which Malfoy and his cronies dress up as dementors. I would have loved to see that. And then the whole game against Slytherin where Griffyndor wins the house cup. The house cup was a big deal in the book. As long as I'm ranting, none of the beginning was shown. What about Sirius being even on Muggle news, they could have even shown it on the TV in the beginning in the background, but they didn't! And what was up with the practicing magic in the beginning? No magic off of school ground? Come on now, get the story straight, have the characters stop contradicting themselves (it is mentioned there is no magic allowed).Well, whatever. Make it your own, as they say nowadays, and this director certainly did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better 2nd time round</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see HP for the second time last night and I have to admit it grows on you. I think it could be because your expectations are more realistic second time round and so appreciate what is there rather than notice what is not. The kids aren't too bad. There are some dodgy moments, especially Harry's upset/angry scene ("He killed my parents!") which was appalling, but overall he has improved no end and is finally becoming the Harry that the books portray. Hermione ha also improved and there were moments when I really thought that she WAS Hermione, but there were still the odd wooden line or things that just didn't hold true for the character. Ron was excellent and definitely Ron for me, though I think it's a shame that his part was so limited. The Hermione/Ron love thing was developed well and the chemistry was excellent, but i still don't like it cus it's too obvious too soon (in the series). The setting was magical and magnificent and the effects were perfect. I loved the humour of the script, but hated the feeling that everything was being rushed for the purpose of time. I want to relax when i watch a film! The adults were superb, especially Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson, and Michael gambon was a better Dumbledore for me (no dis-respect to Harris). An all round huge improvement in the series, if only the first two had been that good. Getting better as an adaption but will never satisfy the hard-core book fans. Its on the right track, but I still feel that if I didn't love the books then the movies would be nothing. Its a good film of a truly fantastic book, so although the film is good, still doesn't do an amazing book 100% justice. Aside from that, a very good film, i would like to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not impressed *SPOILER*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After waiting with baited breath for the release of my favorite book in the series (so far), I was, to put it bluntly, disappointed. This is such an excellent literary work, with so many subtle nuances, and subplot stories which add so much to the whole of the story. The movie in comparison was choppy and ill handled. In fact I believe this is the worst transition from book to film I believe I have ever seen. I know that a director has 'creative' license. But when that creativity adds to his goal of creating a flashy special effects show with no regard to the book then I would suggest that a director with a passion for the series (or at least someone who has read them http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0190859/bio) is chosen.Just a small list of the things changed or left out totally- Why Snape hates James Potter and the others.- An explanation of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs- Ron turned into a 1-Dimensional moron who is in love with Hermione.- A removal of the drama between Ron and Hermione over Scabbers and Crookshanks- A total removal of Buckbeak's trial?except what isn't totally critically to the plot.- Malfoy is also turned into a 1-dimensional weakling, not nearly as vicious and cold-blooded as in the books- Adding the un-necessary scenes like Hermione throwing snails at Harry, Neville being attacked by his "Monster book of Monsters" book, and the segways with the clock and the whomping willow, just wasted time that could have been used on something more interesting and important to the plot.- Trelawney was kept to a minimum (Though I don't think I could have standed much more of her) and her classroom was totally wrong, should have been accessed by a trap-door and nauseatingly smoke filled.- Dementors fly now? (No wonder Malfoy and crew didn't bother to impersonate dementors in the movie. Flying without a broom would be hard.) Now dementors cause windows to frost over and ponds to freeze. And their kiss doesn't seem to involve coming close to their victim. - The 3 main characters (also Malfoy and friends, who pride themselves so much on their wizardness) nip off to their houses at every opportunity to switch to muggle clothes before going outside (I guess the dress code has exceptions for them now), and Hermione's trademark bushy hair isn't any more. Not to mention her clutching at Ron's hand in moments of stress.- Harry never gets in trouble once for anything, not even for his little 'appearance' in Hogsmeade.- The firebolt appears at the very end from nowhere, and Harry hops on and flies happily off into the credits. No suspicion of the broom being jinxed, no big Quidditch match, no Sir Caduggon? - The willow's job is of course to keep people away from the tunnel mouth. But instead it picks them up, waves them about a bit, then tosses them right down that hole. How convenient.- Consider how collapsed the confrontation in the shack is now. Rather a short time for Harry to go from hating Sirius to liking him.- Scabbers turns into Pettigrew-with-clothes. Then later turns back into Scabbers, leaving behind that pile of clothes. Sorry, that's just sloppy.- We saw Tom the Innkeeper of the Leaky Cauldron in the first movie. This time he looks like a nosferatu. Bad ale, I suppose.- Lupin says 'Someone' told people of lupin's condition. Another reason for us to hate Snape. Why change that for the movie? Well, um, maybe it saved a lot of footage to say 'someone' rather than 'Snape'.- In the book Lupin skips Harry in the boggart lesson when it becomes a dementor. Then apologizes to him for skipping him in sequence, because he assumed the boggart would become Voldemort. Then Harry tells him what he fears is a dementor, and Lupin says 'oh?' But I guess we just have to make sacrifices to make way for another dementor special effect, that's obviously what matters.- On the trip to Hagrid's, away from Hagrid's, then after the time-turner there is no use of the invisibility cloak. Hermoine stresses that they cannot be seen but if you look closely they run right past the executioner sharpening his axe. The list goes on and on but what's done is done. I hope they display better judgment when they do Goblet of Fire. That one will be harder to cut down properly, and if they do it no more skillfully than this one, it'll be really sad.Mauldin8302</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film in my point of view was not anywhere near as good as the first two. The director was different so i can understand the different ways of directing, but the entire set has changed, and so has everything in the castle. In the movie they wore "muggle" cloths most of the time, except for possibly two or three scenes, and Dan Radcliffe still does not have green eyes, which completely ruins no offense to dan the character harry potter who is supposed to have "briliant green eyes" and Dan has blue eyes.I love the harry potter books, and if they are going to make films about them they should stick to the book. Ron and Hermione aren't supposed to show any emotion towards each other other than hate. But in the third movie, hermione continually hugs, or grabs rons hand. Which ruins the whole effect of their "hate" towards each other. Other than the filming, set, and clothing differences the movie was semi good. It had a lot of funny parts, many of which were unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not as good as the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I thought was the highlight of the movie was the two scenes where Harry fights off all of the Dementors when they are attacking him and Sirius. Those scenes were incredible. The score in particular was amazing.There is definitely more humor in Azkaban than the previous two movies, and while a lot of it is genuinely funny, I did not much like the shrunken heads. I think that Cauron contributed some fine things, but he rushed a lot of plot scenes to focus on humor and stylistic changes. The character of Ron went backwards. He was a third wheel. In the first two movies there was more of a balance between all the elements. Radcliffe gave his best performances so far. Watson is clearly the best actor of the bunch. Grint was good. I am not sure why Malfoy was so hysterical and wimpy in this movie.With the new supporting characters Emma Thompson was fun as Professor Trelawney even if her big scene was rushed. The way Julie Christie was introduced as Madame Rosmerta was one of my favorite moments of the movie. David Thewlis was excellent as the scarred Professor Lupin. The scene on the bridge was a highlight. Gary Oldman was good, especially in his brief one-on-one scenes with Radcliffe. The whole scene in the shack was rushed. Oldman, Rickman, Thewlis are all good in the scene but I thought it was underdeveloped. I didn't like what they did with Pettigrew. I thought he would be more pathetic. Not pathetic so you laugh, but pathetic where you get angry. I thought Spall's performance as Pettigrew was off. Visually the movie is very impressive. The changing of the seasons using the Whomping Willow was a great idea. The radiating light around the wands was nice. The Shrieking Shack with its moving walls, the hippogriff (it was like its own character, one of the most impressive CGI/puppet creations I've seen), and the frightening dementors were all impressive technological achievements. Here I felt that the movie actually did seem longer than the previous two. I think that was largely because the time travel aspect of the plot. When Harry and Hermione sit down to wait, however briefly, the scene dragged.Also the final credits are worth watching. They are really well designed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Harry Potter Film Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie and I so want to see it again. The scenery was amazing, the Knight bus bit cracked me up, Buckbeak looked so real, the Dementors had a creepiness which was...um..creepy? The actors were really good as well. Rupert Grint did well as the confused Ron, Emma Watson was yet again perfect as brainy Hermione, Tom Felton was evilly good, though I hate his hair and Gary Oldman really shone as the murderer Sirius Black. But I have to say all major gratification goes to Daniel Radcliffe as Harry. Even though he's slightly older than his character, he still manages to express the emotion of a 13 year old. Harry also starts to develop a kind of moody side, like not being able to control his temper at times. I can relate to that in a different way, obviously coz I'm a girl! (He's also pretty fit, too!) On the whole, this movie was the best HP movie yet! Great job, Alfonso Cuaron!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me it was unfortunate that Richard Harris passed away and had to be replaced. I did not like how they changed Dumbledores personality, since they did that I was pleased he was not in the movie much. I also didn't like how they changed the scenery of the film compared to the other films. They put cliffs and rocky terrain in the 3rd movie where there wasn't in the other two. All in all it was a great film and story except for the things I listed above. I look forward to seeing Harry Potter and the Goblits of fire next year which I am currently reading and I believe will be the best so far. I do hope they take in consideration the changes they made and realize they were significant changes and in a sense changed the whole movie. It was also a mistake I think to have waited so long to make this film, the children are growing up and pretty soon they wont be looking like children in school any longer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing Harry Potter and the POA and I am UTTERLY MAD. The movie didn't do the book justice by a long shot! I think that that Alfonzo guy did a half asked job on the movie. I mean, it didn't follow the book worth crap! I mean common- if a movie is made after a book it should follow it pretty well - look at SS and COS. It skipped 4 chapters in the beginning and left out some major parts in the end. Not to mention all the foreshadowing that was supposed to be done that wasn't. And the set and Hogwarts grounds were completely different. Ugh it just all around ticked me off. And they should have done a butt load of coaching for Michael Gambon (the new Dumbledore). He didn't have the characteristics that were expected of Dumbledore. NOw for a TOTAL Harry Potter fan like me, this is like the apocalypse. WHY Didn't CHRIS COLOMBUS DO IT??? I thought that the actors were capable of a better job, so why didn't Alfonso give them that opportunity? AND WHERE DID THE TALKING HEAD COME FROM?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well first off the directing in this movie was brilliant! I really liked the way that he did his own thing but kind of kept some things that Chris Columbus would've done. The movie was okay but it didn't do any justice to the book because they cut out scenes that were needed. What happens if people who haven't read the book in there? Nothing is really explained. I think that I loved the movie only because I was waiting for it for such a long time so just seeing made me love it. The acting in it was fantastic though. Even Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton all did brilliant jobs. They all matured really and I think they just knew their characters the third time around. Overall on a scale to 1-10 I'd give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter and The prisoner of Azkaban ----- 9/10From a film viewers perspective this film was extremely entertaining. Definately the best of the 3. The characters have grown and seem quite comfortably playing their alter egos, fingers crossed they don't change actors. It was a pleasent change having director Alfonso Cauron take over the ropes from Chris Columbus who did a great job but didn't make the films his own, he was faithful to the books in all persepctives, which don't get me wrong is not a bad thing, but cutting certain scenes out and picking up the pace a little would've made the films far more enjoyable than what they were, they were still great films at that though. Cauron definately saw this film as a chance to show us his creativity and spin on the potter universe, he probably cut too many scenes out especially involving the scene where Harry is caught under the Whomping Willow with Sirius Black, i don't need to say more for those who have not seen the film, but this could've been done so the audience of non-book readers could've picked up the story alot easier. As noted before the film had opened, this third outing is much more darker than the first two. It darker than the darkest parts of 1 &amp; 2 combined and some scene may scare younger children, but made for a far more enjoyable experience for those older fans. The camera work is very stylish indeed and I was glad to see more artistic angles were taken during the production. Finally the quiddicth scene was so well done, you could actually belive this was a real game, shows how much CGI has advanced since 2001 when the first film was released.Overall, Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban was a well rounded, stylish, entertaining yet dark film. Extremly Recommended - 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long live the Potter series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J.K. Rowling has creating an amazing universe that Harry Potter and his friends occupy, and I'm fascinated at the way each movie has allowed Harry to grow and mature from childhood to now early teenage years. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson all are outstanding as the leads, with Alan Rickman and David Thewlis providing solid support. The special effects are once again spectacular, and I feel that CGI has never been put to better use than it has in the Potter series. I found myself missing Richard Harris, however. His world-weary hoarseness gave Dumbledore a type of regalness not achieved by replacement Michael Gambon. That aside, the growth given to the characters whets your appetite for more in the series, and I'm already anxious for the next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall: brilliant, beautiful.I can't blame the director for making the whole package so rushy. It is the limitation of duration that forces them to cut everything down. However, it would really REALLY help if the movie were not cut so much; a 3-4 hours movie would not be too long for Harry Potter fans to put up with. In fact, we would enjoy it more..As for critics, we all notice the barking Sirius against Harry while he is his godfather. And the magic attempt by Harry on the beginning of the movie.I don't object the last part where Harry mounts his new broom. It makes it all the more cheerful, closing up the whole movie beautifully.This movie is a work of art. The first two movies were a bit boring because it sticks to the books too much. Alfonso's creativity is well appreciated here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maturing cast, new director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest of Rowling's offerings to make the screen has all of the humor and interaction of the last two, but not as much of the magic (pardon the pun) of the previous editions. The new director, Alfonso Cuaron didn't pull off the same adolescent light-heartedness that Chris Columbus was able to portray in his two takes, adding a rather gloomy look to the film.The story line was parsed a bit too much and made the character relationships in the film hard to grasp, unless you: A)Read the book B)hold a degree in sociology or C)you were just there for the popcorn. And can someone please tell me why Harry hasn't fried Malfoy? The romantic tension b/w Hermione and Ron is overplayed and the interaction of Harry and Sirius Black jumps to far too many conclusions without any reason why. Harry goes from shock and fear about having an alleged psychotic killer-wizard out to finish the apparent job he did on his parents, to being reservedly giddy about moving in with him. The acting on almost all counts was stellar. The young troup is coming of age and have those problems to deal with, but Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch, as is Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson.I did enjoy the film and recommend it to both the avid Potter-ite as well as someone who simply wants to do the escapism thing for a few hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban is a great movie! It's my favorite book out of the series and i think Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton) and Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe)are really hot!! I thought they producers did a really great job but they kind of rushed the movie. It could have been better if they slowed down abit and made the movie longer. But other than that i thought the movie was really well. I also noticed that the actors have gotten better at acting and i thought that made the movie better than the rest. Also i like that in the movies they are older than they r supposed to be in the books. So all together the movie was BRILLIANT!! and the actors are really good looking except Tom and Daniel they aren't good looking they are HOT!! lol</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Progression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter is without a doubt the best contemporary fantasy today. The books are yes, better than the movies, but can be brought to life through the films. With that said, I must say that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the best film adaption of the current trilogy. The actors were amazing; the set, as much as it changed, was fulfilling; the story was faithful despite minor alterations; and lastly, the wizard world was greatly explored. I gave it a 10/10 for it lived up to all expectations quite dutifully.I highly recommend Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to anyone with imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time Travel Trimpossible !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time travel, the way it was presented in this movie, is completely impossible for the following reasons : Time is not a dimension, if anything, it's more of a ribbon. One side of the ribbon is still stuffed in the box, so as far as the present and the past is concerned, it does not exist, and while we can plan for the future, the future only exists as the present unfolds.Now the other part of this ribbon, is the past, whats left behind... problem with the past, is that its frozen, it happened, and it's impossible to change time, unless when in the present. The story suggests that we could through the concept of magic, go back in time, and change the way some things happened, which is ridiculous, because it would involve the characters to cease to exist in the present, and relive the past, which would mean death, since those who exist in the past and the present are alive, while those who only exist in the past, even if they plan to come back, they are dead, and they cease to be. Some would claim this to be a plot element, and in a way they would be right, so please don't e-mail saying I missed the point of the movie, time should be taken a bit more seriously, we never know when we will run out of ribbon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cinematography, disappointing plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the first two Harry Potter movies before I began reading the books (I know -- pretty lame, but oh, well!). Thank goodness I'd read Books 1, 2, 3 and 4 before seeing this movie! Out of the first 4 books, Book 3 was my favorite and I was so looking forward to the movie. Although the acting continues to improve and it is clear that these three have developed real friendships, not just screen friendships, I so wish that the screenwriter had chosen to stay more true to the book and not put in unnecessary changes.Although the cinematography was gorgeous, with many outdoor shots that are breathtaking, there were so many holes in the plot that I don't think I would have had a clue about what was going on if I hadn't read the book. I don't understand why they didn't explain who the four people were who wrote the Marauder's Map and how they were related to each other and to Harry. Not explaining that also makes it less clear why Harry first thought the stag came from his father. I was also very disappointed that they didn't float Severus out of the Shrieking Shack (like in the book) and that they didn't have Wormtail tied up with cords (like in the book). Also, they didn't explain at all why Severus Snapes hated Sirius Black so much. Leaving these things out just makes the movie more empty somehow. I also was disappointed that Crookshanks didn't push the place on the Whomping Willow to make it stop and that they never explained that it was planted at the same time Lupin was in school and why. Additionally, the werewolf didn't look very realistic at all -- I think they could have done a MUCH better job with him! And in the book, they explained the Shrieking Shack and that the other three had learned to change themselves into animals so they could stay with Lupin and not be attacked. In the movie, Lupin as a werewolf attacks Sirius when he's a dog -- that's opposite to the book. And they never explained the Shrieking Shack at all. Also, I was disappointed that they left out the Quiddich Match where Malfoy and his buddies pretended to be Dementors and Harry used the Petronum curse.That would have been great to see. I also didn't like the way they CHANGED the plot to have Sirius give Harry the Firebolt at the end when everyone knew it was coming from him. I don't understand why they couldn't have been faithful to the original plot -- why change things around and make them less cool?The highlight for me was the Hippogriff, especially the scene where Harry and the Hippogriff are flying over the water. So if you want to see a beautifully filmed movie that's going to be confusing, this is one to see! If you don't want to be confused, read the book first, but then I think you'll be disappointed by the movie.Linda</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan of the books. I have never read one of them. I am not mad at the changes or misses from it. Still a bad director is a bad director. Alfonso Cuaron proves to be another me too 'audiences are dumb' blockbuster director wannabe. One thing I admire from Columbus is how he can pick and direct children to be believable. Alfonso just makes kids overact and/or underact. One cannot forget at any point that Harry and friends are acting in a set. Never you can believe they are having fun, scared or sad or anything. Examples (SPOILERS HERE):Harry is standing in front of the licantropus about to attack him: He seems to be awaiting in front of the traffic lights in a Monday morning way to school. That's about the fear and tension he transmits.THE WORST: And I just hope that's not from the book. The bad blond guy and friends run scared a couple of times from weak Harry and nerdy friends!?!?! And they do it a la Harold Lloyd. Have you ever seen a bad guys school gang doing that? Ridiculous. Still the first hour is decent and Harry Potter story is not destroyed enough not to be entertaining. It is not Godzilla, but goes much closer than the first two. I love 3d effects. At Siggraph. When I watch a movie I expect an smart, believable story. This movies just doesn't succeed at it.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad bad bad, wait for the DVD !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not bad as a movie. Although... Over here it is rated 9 years and over, but I fail to see why. OK, the effects are a little scary, but all in all there is only one real shocker in the movie. And that happens all the way up front. I have to agree with the comments they made in the Netherlands. The movie is shot (too much) in the dark. I understand they can not do CGI and stuff in broad daylight, but it was actually very noticeable the special effects budget was waaaaaay lower than in lord of the rings, to name but one other series. At more than one moment it was very obvious something was edited in. Try to picture the bridge that leads to Hagrids house, it is painfully obvious it was painted into the scene. If Harry and Lupin are talking the bridges even looks different from close® up !I think the director made a huge mistake in the movie. He is assuming (demanding !) the viewer knows the Harry Potter series. Books or movies. If Potter-3 is your first encounter with Harry, you are going to be lost. Completely. As an example, Snape (who else) says somewhere in the middle of the movie "2 points deduction for Griffendor" . Without prior knowledge you would not have a clue what he is talking about. The other characters were completely not introduced. Who are those two blokes that look so much alike ? (I know they are twin brothers, and brothers of Ron, but imagine you had not read the book). Why on earth did they give the map to Harry ? I could give another 100 examples of where the director did wrong, but you get the point I hope.The big screen was used not once. It is obvious they want to release this movie on DVD, and are keeping in mind most people still don't have wide screen TV's. All, and I mean all action takes place within the center part of the screen. They should not even have bothered making a wide-screen version."Lately" there was something new introduced into movie theaters. It is called DOLBY surround. As an extra bonus there is this thing called THX. It is a quite good idea that allows for sounds and musical effects to "fly around" through the theaters giving the audience the idea to sit in the center of the movie (at least soundwise). It uses 4,5,6 or even 8 speakers. I watched the closing credits. It was used for Harry Potter 3. Once in the entire movie... The pace is slow. As in the first two movies, the movie "stops" at unexpected and unwanted moments. Inbetween shots with no particular intention, zoomouts where they could as well be left out. I think if the cutters had done their job well, the movie would have lasted 120 minutes, and not 141. And nobody would have noticed anything missing.--- All in all the movie was worth the trip, but I am happy we only paid one fee for the two of us. This one was not worth full money. I would advise everybody to wait for the DVD, and hope the extras make up for the movie itself. Sorry ~!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER--after seeing the movie a few times the little things make sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the scene where Professor Lupin is instructing the students on repelling the Bogget (shape shifter), its Harry Potter's turn to cast the ridiculous spell. The Bogget's power lies in the ability to assume the shape of the most feared object of the person's mind. Since Harry's fear is the Dementor, the Bogget changed into a Dementor. Harry is scared and can't throw the ridiculous spell, so prof Lupin stands in front of Harry. In doing so, he is now the focus of the Bogget and the fear that the professor is keeping deep inside is transformed by the Bogget. The fear? A full moon. Why? Because Professor Lupin is a Werewolf. You see this full moon picture again in the last part of the movie when the Professor, Harry, Sirus Black and crew are together at night on the hill. The full moon shines through the clouds and the Professor does his wolf thing.</fullReview>

Whoever thought that HP, HP2, and HP3 weren't good or even remotely worth watching a second time needs to read the books. So many people can relate to Harry Potter, that is why people like him. If you don't like HP and have/haven't read the books please tell me why, I would like to know. So I can't wait until the next movie comes out and I advise all people to see the movies and read the books. Happy reading and watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter...Kepp'em Coming!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alert The third installment in the book series-turned movie franchise was all around was excellent. Staying true to Rowling's mood in the third book, the movie is darker, scarier and has more complexity than the first two, which shows that the story is moving forward, that we are not just having a simple story of a boy wizard going through school at Hogwart's. I thought that director Alfonso Curalon did a fantastic job refacing the movie's feel and look. Even though I thought Chris Columbus did a good job with the last two films, with a on-going franchise like this, having the same director for all of the films would have gotten stale and stagnant. Curalon's direction for making this movie much darker, both in humor and in deepness of story, was right on the mark with what the author wanted for the third movie. The actors were incredible, as are always improving. Daniel Radcliffe shined as Harry Potter, and i thought he really put more of his own emotion into the character this time around. he's amazingly perceptive in gaining insight into a character for so young an actor. Emma Watson, also brilliant, yet i thought her attitude was a bit pushed, but that may be just me. I loved the way her bossiness comes through in this movie, and she really has settled into the role. The best improvement came from Rupert though in his reprisal of Ron. I thought that he was a little annoying in the C.O.S. and was completely spellbound by ron's much-needed charm. I wasn't sure of him then, but now he really stands out. Without him, the movie would not have had the proper balance of fun and dark mystery. As for the newcomers in the film, Including the actor, who's name escapes my memory, who filled in for the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, all were excellent. I give several props for Emma Thompson (one of my all-time favorite actresses) for her role as the crazy and whimiscal divination teacher. I thought she was marvelous and wanted to see more of her.Professor Lupin was good, although throughout the movie he left me with a sort of half disturbed feeling, maybe it was the intention of the director to do this, but i always got a chill. I was highly disappointed with Gary Oldman though, I have to say. (as tomatoes and cabbages are thrown at my face) I didn't think he was nearly scary enough. I expected a really dark, evil portrayal of the prisoner of askaban and all i got was a ticked off man in tatty clothes, though to give him some credit, the scene where he and lupin cornered pettigrew about how he had indeed betrayed Harry's parents to -You-know-Who was brilliant. Where Sirius says to Peter "i would have died, I would have died rather than betray my friends!" I was moved, and thought that Gary Oldman had finally shown the passion I knew the character had. I thought that Magonnagle (sorry spell check?) and Draco got seriously underplayed, and i really wanted more of them.As for the famous trio and their story, I am hugely disappointed the route the romantic angle is going. If you have read the books then maybe you have made yor peace with it, but those who have not (myself included) i think are getting mixed signals. The end of C.O.S. Hermione comes running down the hall, throws herself into harry's arms, and then Ron getting blubbery where you clearly get a sense that Ron digs this girl. But what about Hermione? I thought her feelings bent to Harry. I found to too confusing, and maybe film four will iron it all out for us. Things that bothered me in general: I still, to this day after having seen the film 3 times, have no clue why Harry fainted everytime he saw a dementor, even the bogget?? Was it just the thought of them being there enough to scare him so badly??? And, i'm sure everyone asked this, but WHY on earth, did a professor give Hermione a time-traveling necklace?? Was that the most responsible thing to do, Give a kid (even as one as mature as her) the power to move in and out of time like it was the public library?? How did Lupin know how to use the Maurader's Map?? If Snape couldn't figure it out, than why could he?? Why was the set completely moved from the last two films??.. I wanted to shout CONTINUITY! everytime I saw the scenery. I went to see this movie the first time with my cousin who is a very perceptive 11 yr old girl. Once the movie was over she said "The scene where Harry saves himself from the dementors, it was almost unearthly. I felt awed." She told me later that she had cried when the scene was going on. I have to say my feeling was exactly the same. I cannot wait for the next film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NO SPOILERSI read this book and saw the movie knowing full well if they couldn't fit everything from the other books into those movies they CERTIANLY wouldn't be able to fit the book into a two or three hour film. Generally I think they did well, I do worry however about their ability to continue to do the movies if they continually leave out "small" things in the movie that come back to be "big" things later. Casting is, as it was for the others, near perfect. When I read the books the characters look almost to a tee like the actors. The acting is good, Gary Oldman and the actor who plays Lupin do an especially good job. Buckbeak is better than I would have expected as is most of the magic effects. The patronus is the exception here and in general I thought that was lousy. All in all above my expectations but below the standard of the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best potter movie yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, first off, those of you who have read the books and are complaining that the movie doesn't follow the book, you all need to settle down and back off. Who cares if the movie didn't follow the book. The movie isn't a direct copy of the book, that would take too long and would cost much, much more. Instead, the movie, like most adaptations of books, is merely based on the book. Who cares that there wasn't as much Quidditch or there weren't as many fights between Ron and Hermione. It's only a movie, strictly for entertainment purposes. They weren't competing for a special reward for following the book word for word. YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN FILM!!! There are some things that are better expressed as actual objects instead of just words on a page. As for the movie, I thought that it was the best one of the trilogy. Cuarón is a much better director than Columbus. The third movie is full of more style than the previous two movies combined. Columbus relied more on the editing while Cuarón concentrates more on the Dogma95 aspect of cinematography (although it isn't true Dogma) Basically anyone who appreciates the true nature of film technique, not the Hollywood version chuck full of editing and special effects, will appreciate this movie more than the others. Anyone who wants to contact me and talk about the technical aspects of this film, feel free. For those who are going to complain about the story content of the movie shouldn't even bother.</fullReview>

However, it is not the surroundings which makes this film, it's the story, and although some of the scenes with Ron and Hermione arguing have been cut, it is a pretty good portrayal of the book.

		<shortDescription>From Hogwarts With Love, Some Of It Forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie 1 and 1/3 times; the 1/3 stemming from the fact that the first time the sound broke down to unacceptable quality due to some unsolvable technical glitch. So a week later, I tried again, and got to enjoy the entire movie.I was quite pleased with this episode of Rowlings saga. The story hobbles along at a nice pace, and the special effects are gorgeous. Even more importantly, they are strictly under control of the story, helping it along, instead of the story riding on the crest of a major CGI wave. ('Van Helsing' anyone?) The story has dark elements which young children will find downright scary, and at one point you can see quite clearly that the director took care to keep his little viewers from wetting themselves---a movie for grownups would have had an entirely different scene! The actors are relaxed and settle into their roles quite well, although you can see that some are unlikely to become great actors. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) is the clearest example. But hey, Rupert is still a teen, so let's cut the guy some slack. Speaking of teens, I pity Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy). Puberty has not been kind to him, he used to be such an angelic little devil... Oh well ;-). But.But indeed. For some unfathomable reason, the director saw fit to rip major elements out of the storyline, leaving people who have not read the book with lots of open questions. How come Lupin and Black know, and more importantly, trust each other? The latter is after all an escaped convict, a known and avid supporter of You-know-who! How come Lupin knows how to use the Marauders Map, obviously having seen it before? Why is Snape so keen on catching Black? Why is Harry so sure he saw his father conjuring up the Patronus? Why would anyone have the ratty and altogether unagreeable Pettigrew for a friend? What is with Trelawney's prediction? And so on. It would have been the work of a few minutes at most to have Lupin explain to Harry at one point that he, Black, Pettigrew and Potter sr. were very close friends despite his being a werewolf, that his friends learned to become Faunates so he wouldn't feel so alone, that the Map was created to help them crawl about, and explained that Snape was the butt of many of their jokes. There, in just one sentence, all major questions answered. So why didn't the director do this?I can only speculate to the answer, but I do know that answers are central to many elements in the Potter saga, and deserve to be depicted. Of course a director will always take some liberties with the original story, but in this case he went too far. As it stands now, the movie is just unsatisfyingly incomplete, and that is a great shame for such an enjoyable work. In the end, go see this movie if you like this sort of thing, and hope that the fourth episode doesn't make mistakes of this magnitude. An undeserved 7 out of 10, from a 9 out of 10 if the storyline had not been mangled.</fullReview>

I felt that it failed to expand on the story lines and on character's actions. Some parts of it made me feel as if i was only watching a "trailer" or a "tease". The plot and story telling in my estimation is more important to me than, the special effects. I felt short changed, because there was so little of the movie dealing with the interactions among the great characters in the book. The teachers were monotonous with their talk only of the "prisoner going to come and get Harry" and the interesting school and it's other students were almost completely ignored. My vote is a "boo" to this director for not holding my attention. His special effects were good, but the movie lacked a smooth story line and more character interactions in the daily school life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointment to Die-hards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers within.What can I say? I've only seen this film once, so I'll have to see it as least once more to fully judge it, but so far, it's been a disappointment.I'm well aware of the difficulties of converting a novel to film, but the mistakes made in this movie were novice, and often made no sense. Why on earth is it that a book which is longer than the first two has a shorter film? Logically, one would expect it to be somewhat longer, if not greatly.Instead, PoA is the shortest film, and it's obvious by the amount of information that is left out and jumbled up. Things are rarely given time to develop, and information is instead suddenly given with no apparent reason, making it awkward for the actors. Most surprisingly, things are often changed for absolutely no reason. For example, the scene in the book in which Harry, Ron, and Hermione overhear a discussion about Sirius Black and James Potter in the Three Broomsticks is now changed to Harry sneaking in with his invisibility cloak - Ron and Hermione are left outside, because they're "underage." The information given in this scene is incredibly jumbled, and I found it difficult to understand. For a person who has never read the book, it is likely even more confusing.The relationship between Black, Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, and James Potter is never really explained, and nor is any explanation of their abilities as animagi given. Worst of all, no explanation is given for the significance of Harry's stag Patronus. Quidditch is given little air-time in this movie - the one movie in which it should have been given the most. Oliver Wood fails to appear in his last year at Hogwarts, and the only match seen is the one in which Harry is attacked, not when they win the Quidditch cup. Joining Oliver Wood on the missing list is Cederic Diggory and Cho Chung, both of whom become important characters later.Most disappointing is the scene in the Shrieking Shack. The reason why they're in the Shrieking Shack is never given. The scene in the Shrieking Shack was the perfect moment for the confusing information from the rest of the movie to be sorted out, with Sirius and Lupin cooly explaining themselves. Instead, the entire scene consists of some yelling, wand waving, and Harry attacking Snape for no apparent reason. The acting in this film is fine - albeit somewhat awkward with all of the information the actors are expected to drop in a random conversation. However, for the first time, I'm disappointed with the choice of actor for a character. While Emma Thompson plays Sybil Trelawney perfectly, David Thewlis disappointed me as Remus Lupin. I found he looked nothing like I pictured him, and his acting was too forceful for the constantly quiet-and-ill Lupin. Also disappointing is the presence of Snape and McGonagall in this film - or lackthereof. Both almost completely fail to appear. While this film constantly has a confusing element within it, due to poor scriptwriting, even more confusing is how the Hogwarts grounds changed from their appearance in the first two films to the hilly mountains they are in this one. Did Hogarts suddenly change location without notifying the rest of us?Harry Potter &amp; the Prisoner of Azkaban isn't a BAD movie, but it's not the greatest either. By far the worst of the three Harry Potter books now on film, PoA is hurt by the director's attempt to cram the longest of the books so far into the shortest of films. It would have done better to have instead made PoA an incredibly long film - the number of children who went to Titanic proves that youth doesn't mean you can't withstand a long film. Let's just hope that the Goblet of Fire is put into two films, just for accuracies sake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a true lover of the book series and having read all of them (some more than once), I was disappointed in the film basically because I felt it was not true to the book. It deleted information that I felt was important and added scenes not in the book, or used elements from the book and put them together in a fashion that did not happen in the book. I may be boring, but I am the person who wants to see the "book come to life" the way the author wrote it, not just an interpretation of it. I also felt that if you had not previously read the book prior to seeing the movie, you would be confused as it was so chopped up. I would rather see more character interaction than special effects any day. I will indeed see the movie again, because most of it I spent thinking "That didn't happen like that" or "That wasn't in the book". The second time I see it I will be able to view it more of it's own accord, because I will be over my disappointment (and mild anger) by that time.Like other viewers have said, I too will get the DVD when available. So I guess the moviemakers will get their money out of me, even though the movie could have been so much better than it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, best yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, i have read all of the harry potter books to date and i think they are all amazing. With the first being introductory to the series and a bit confusing at first, but necessary. The second one i think was mainly filler, but it was still good, the movie wasn't that great, however. prisoners of Azkaban introduced the idea that the series was going to get darker and finally got the story moving and twisting into a spiral that leads to the last book. Goblet of fire was also a great book like the others, it became even darker and emphasized on prisoners of azkaban in the fact that harry potter isn't going to be a nice calm story about a wizard though. and finally the order of the pheonix introduced action and responsibility to the characters of harry potter. Wow i got a little of subject but its hard not to review everything thats out so far. Anyway, I highly recommend that fans and non-fans of harry potter go see this movie. It really hops back and makes up for what the chamber of secrets wasn't. Thankfully under a new director, alfonzo cuaron or however its spelled. I hope he does the 5th book because his idea of how the harry potter series should work is by far the best seen on the silver screen yet. It rivals with the first movie, but it improves on everything that everyone loved about the first one. Also, the characters are growing up, and so are the actors. I think they portray this very well with hermione getting a sense of style, even though shes not really supposed to look great until the 4th installment. I think the way the harry potter movies have slowly but surely made her more and more mature have done a great job in doing that. As Emma always been a great actor for hermione. Not to mention rons character, he was great in the first one, and annoying in the second one. But in prisoners of azkaban he really shows his color as hes learned more about the character. Rupert really got the character down this time. And Daniel playing harry, he has improved the character a lot, he still needs to show more emotion at times, but all in all he did a wonderful job of portraying harry in the prisoners of azkaban. All in all, this movie is by far the best installment in the series yet, the actors have gotten down the parts of their characters very well, while there still is room for improvement, the job they have done in this movie is excellent. I hope that the rest of the movies improve upon the awesomeness of the prisoners of azkaban. Which is looking to be i an fairly bright like right now, there's no more to complain about. They have it down and are ready to grow along with the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first two HP films are children's fairytales, but part three is a dark,mysterious thrill ride.[possible spoilers]The Good:--Daniel, Emma, and Rupert are great. They were charming kids in the first two films, and they are fascinating teenagers in this film.--More scenes with the "other" kids, notably the Weasely twins.--Alan Rickman gets a bit more to do as Snape, to great effect.--Gary Oldman is well-chosen to play Sirius Black, although the role is small.--The visual effects are brilliant, particularly the Dementors and the Hippogriff.--Lovely score by John Williams.The Bad:--Minerva McGonagall is largely absent.--The Quidditch is chopped way down.--Richard Harris' Dumbledore is sadly missed.--No explanation of the Marauder's Map's creators, or the significance of Harry's Patronus.The Ugly:--The opening scene resembles a home movie, with camera wobbles and unpleasant swoops, although Aunt Marge blew up quite nicely.--The film ends on an artificial "happy" note (as did Chamber of Secrets), strangely lacking in gloom and foreboding of evil, considering the dangerous events of the previous evening.All in all, it's entertaining and bears repeat viewings, despite the missing chunks of the story. I'll rate it 8 of 10, with a strong recommendation to read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban" is the third Harry Potter installment and is the best one yet. This movie was bloody brilliant! One of the best movies of the year. This was a awesome movie, greatly directed by the wonderful Mexican director, Alfanso Curaon. This should NOT be ignored by the Oscars, or at least the Golden Globes. This is a masterpiece!Again, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. They have grown up soooo much. They all did a great job, as they did in the last 2nd films. I thought David Thewlis did a excellent job as Professor Lupin, although while I was reading the book I am imagined him with longer hair, but David was awesome as Lupin. Gary Oldman did a wonderful job, and as I imagined in the book. And Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew did a great job too. The Dementors, the Hippogriff (sorry if I misspelled), and werewolve were just as I imagined. Michael Gambon did a great job as Dumbledore, since the last two films was played by Richard Harris, but he died in 2002, before they could do the 3rd one. Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Tom Felton, etc... did a great job also in the film. This movie had a mix of seriousness, scariness, suspense, drama, and humor all in it.This movie is appropriate for ALL ages. Although younger children might be scared of some of the scenes in the movie. They may be scared of the Dementors and werewolves and all of the other creatures in the film. There is some mild language, but it's not really that bad.This was an excellent film! I recommend it. If you haven't seen it yet, you should! I give it an A</fullReview>

The first movie was a pretty good translation and the second wasn't too bad, but the third movie was quite disappointing. The characters also didn't seem to keep they're usual dress routine and started wearing street clothes. I do say that the movie was really sped up much faster than the others as the biggest problem. Guessing how the book had 100 extra pages at least, they had to really squeeze the action to keep a balanced budget. (I wouldn't have minded a longer movie though). In the end, they completely threw out the part were Harry reads his godfather's letter and finds that there is quite a stronger hope for moving away from the Durselys after all. Instead, they put in a new scene were Harry gets the fire bolt (Supposed to be in the middle of the movie!) and flies towards the camera with a hilariously sad fade to credits...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally a Harry Potter film that seems like a real film. The two first movies, directed by Chris Columbus, weren't bad, but seeing them without having read the books was a confusing, and sometimes boring experience.This new installment is superior to its predecessors in many aspects: the plot is better explained from the first moment, and the script (by Steve Kloves, who also wrote "Philosopher's stone" and "Chamber of secrets") condenses better the story without missing capital points from the book. The CGI, which improved a lot from first to second movie, are even more polished, with astonishing new creatures as Buckbeak the hippogriff and things less sensational: the moving stairways are, to give an example, much more credible. The three principal actors have grown "a little", as their characters (or a little more), but this is always interesting. New themes are starting to develop that will transform those "kid's movies" into something more. Correct performance of Sirius black by Gary Oldman, and hilarious new teacher played by Emma Thompson. All the rest of the original cast are in this one too (excepting Richard Harris, of course, greatly replaced by Michael Gambon), but is a pity for a fan like me to have so few scenes with Maggie Smith. The atmosphere in the film is very creepy, so the younger audiences can be scared with it...a price we have to pay for a more adult, more complex, and a better Harry Potter film. P.S.: The Spanish dubbing is horrible! (almost as much as my written English...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the books, but I can't stand the movies. While the acting abilities of the lead actors have improved, the movies cannot be compared to the books. What's the use of making a movie, if you do not stick to the book. If you wanna make a movie appealing, at least follow the book in some manner. This movie deprives us of our right to watch a movie which actually gives us a sense of feeling that we are reading the book. While it shows the darker side of Harry, what else does it offer? If we want to see a film driven by a fantasy of art we will go and see it. Harry Potter is not driven by art, it is driven by compelling wizardry, teenage fantasy, and evil. Reading the books gave me pleasure, watching the movies make me cringe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a step forward for this franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I need to preface my comments by stating that I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter novels, which means my opinion of the films are somewhat colored by my opinion of the books. While I enjoyed "Sorcerer's Stone" as both a book and a film, they were both, at heart, stories for children. I thought Chris Columbus did a good job of capturing the essential nature of the book, and I appreciated the effort. I gave "Sorcerer's Stone" an 8."Chamber of Secrets" is my least favorite book of the five, and so I was not surprised to find that I didn't like the second film as much as the first, either. I give credit to Columbus for, once again, staying true to the spirit, and mostly to the word, of the book, but he was working with inferior material. I gave "Chamber of Secrets" a 6.In the books, "Prisoner of Azkaban" begins the maturing of the material. Author J.K. Rowling writes her novels in a more complex and adult style as the characters in them grow from children to young adults. As a result, I have found that I appreciate and enjoy the later books in the series more than the earlier ones. "Prisoner of Azkaban" is the first book to take that step toward more advanced storytelling, and it is my favorite of the first three books, but unfortunately that isn't true of the films.I found that "Prisoner of Azkaban" does not live up to the book in a number of ways, but that comparison may not be fair, as many films cannot address all the material in a book's pages and thus fall short. On its own merits as a film, however, I still find that this film is flawed. First of all, it felt rushed. Cuts between scenes were often harsh. The movie takes significant leaps in time that don't feel that way due to quick edits. This and certain unexplained plot and character changes left me thinking that a lot of film was left on the editing room floor. For example, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) seems to bond awfully quickly with the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), and I kept thinking that we were missing some scenes that included just how their relationship developed.Another problem I have is that some of the child actors aren't very good actors. I thought this really showed with Ron (Rupert Grint) and Draco (Tom Felton). While their talents sufficed in the two previous films, in this one, they fell short. In don't know if this is due to the difference in directors or if the actors aren't up to the task, but their performances in "Prisoner" were a distraction - not good.Third, the choice of Michael Gambon to replace the late Richard Harris in the role of Albus Dumbledore was an unfortunate one. Mr. Gambon is a fine actor, and he brings a vigor to the role that Harris could not have provided, but he lacks the screen presence of a legend, and the magic of Hogwarts seems somewhat diminished.Lastly, characters that were well established in the first two films got short shrift this time around. Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) has little more than a cameo appearance. The wonderfully creepy Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) plays a much reduced role, and we never see a potions class that I can remember. Ron's siblings are barely seen. All of these characters are a big part of Harry's world, and that world seems much changed without them.Then we have areas where the shortages from the book detract from the film for those, like me, that really enjoyed the printed version. For example, the origin of the Marauder's Map and the identities of "Messrs Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs" go unexplained. Dedicating five to ten minutes of footage to this might have gone a long way towards explaining Harry's relationship with Lupin and also why he warms so quickly to Sirius Black (Gary Oldman).Another issue is that the films are coming out too slowly, and the kids are thus aging faster than their characters. Harry and company are supposed to be 13 in this film, but they look more like 15. This will only get worse if they continue to have more than a year between films.Does anyone else find that the film version of Draco Malfoy is a wimp? He comes off as much more of a villain in the book. Maybe this is due to the shortcomings of Felton as an actor, but I blame it on the script and the direction. And his cronies Crabbe (Jamie Waylett) and Goyle (Josh Herdman) aren't near as threatening a physical presence as they ought to be.Enough complaining. There are still lots of things that are right and good here. The world is still magical, and in this film, more fully realized. Other reviewers have talked about the darker look, but I find this appealing and fitting to the nature of the story. Radcliffe and Emma Watson (Hermione) are fine young actors. (Watson is going to be a real beauty, too, and this is yet another departure from the book, as Hermione is supposed to be buck-toothed and frizzy-haired.) The wonderful adult supporting cast is still there, supplemented this time by Emma Thompson (as Sybil Trelawney) and Julie Christie (as Madame Rosmerta), along with Oldman and Thewlis. And the new version of the Whomping Willow is a fun bit of comic relief. Hogwarts is still a fun place to visit at the movie theaters.I give "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" a 7.</fullReview>

Again, good enough to see once, maybe even twice!If I do have one gripe, I would have liked it to be a bit longer, if for the simple reason that they could have given more time to the text material.

		<shortDescription>MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER TWO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty much anticipating the release of 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' especially to see how much Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint had grown since the first movie. As I watched the trailer, I had a feeling this would be better than the other two and I was right...it was better. This film had kept a more emotional feeling in the story which was pretty much lacking in the other two. The plot was densely packed with frightening sequences (I think the film should have been rated PG 13, not just PG). There were also some beautiful moments. I thought it breathtaking when Harry flew over the lake. This film managed to keep my interest put in it and an audience who hasn't read the books (like me) will understand it. I wish the previous movies had explained things a bit better to the audience.The music was good and the special effects were realistic. I liked that bird- horse creature (I'm sorry I don't quite know or remember the name). The werewolf that was actually Professor Lupin was not all that realistic looking though. I do think however that they deserve to get Oscar nominations this time, at least for special effects. I really enjoyed the time- travel thing; the way Hermoine and Harry watched themselves doing things a few hours ago and how they saved the day- and yes, I also enjoyed that part when Harry saves himself and Sirius Black from the Dementors (where he previously thought it was his father). The suspense was well kept and the scenes were more emotional. It's amazing to see those kids grown up and they are very good actors. The film has a talented cast and I think that is a major advantage. Overall, the movie was very good. I think I will watch it again when it comes out on DVD. And I would also recommend people to watch it?things seem to get darker and scarier?SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a very big fan of the HP books, and I greatly enjoyed the first 2 movies because they were so close to the source. However, 'Azkaban', the screenwriter and director chose to remove HUGE chunks of the plot, which rendered much of the movie unclear to anyone who has not read the book. They also chose to insert some much unneeded slapstick (Harry gets plastered on bus window, Hermione gets flung by tree) instead of the far superior humor already provided by JKR. I would have happily lost all the 'new material' to get back the scene where Ron and Harry are working on their Trellawny homework.

		<fullReview>The third Harry Potter installment begins fresh. For a moment one thinks: "oh, Cuarón wants to try something new, how brave of the lad". Indeed, the mandatory Dursley beginning is filmed in a gritty, faded color, real world like TV style. And there's tons of atmosphere, nice images, good acting, some humor, some excitement, some scares and some action. It's all there except...where's the story? Lucky me, I read all five Potter books more then once. But if I was to sit through Azkaban with no pre-knowledge what so ever I wouldn't know what I was looking at. To me it has been the Achilles heel of all installments. The movies are absolutely smashing to the Harry Potter readers cuz they know what they are looking at, they know how to place the actions, the "why does he do that" are crystal clear to them. They are just happy to watch the books come alive.Azkaban first half is a succession of semi-loose scenes, almost filler until the second half of the movie starts. This is centered on the timeturner. All charmingly done, no question, but where's the development of the overall story which J.K. Rowling has brilliantly developed for already five hefty novels. Almost no action is explained why it happens or where it is leading too. Or can anybody explain (without having read the books) how Professor Lupin knew the piece of parchment was the Marauder's Map? Or Professor Snape's dislike for Potter, Lupin and Black. How come Black knows Pettigrew is still alive? Without that last one Sirius has no reason to come to Hogwarts, has he?That's what makes the books so brilliant! More flesh is added to the bone each volume. Gradually J.K. Rowling is teaching us why the characters are what they are. Not in the movie series, mind you. What a pity. And the material is right there or has J.K. written the best pieces on Marauders Map parchment and shouts "Mischief Managed" every time a studio exec wants to have a peak?</fullReview>

Thus making it virtually impossible to include everything.Thirdly, each one of our imaginations as to whom looks like what and how the book is perceived differs. Not only by age, but by gender as well.Lastly, by viewing the movie with preconceptions from the book, you are not allowing yourself to fully acknowledge the art it took into making the third series, let alone missing "important" key information. Such as when Harry reads the map (part truth and part bogus), you can clearly hear whose names are read on it.Thus, saying all that I have, I refuse to give you my positive and negative points about the movie, merely to say that I have seen it two times now and intend to buy it on DVD when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third Harry Potter book is one of the best of the series. Many had hoped to believe that the movie would match the same criteria. But it has failed to show, in my opinion.Alfonso's work in making the movie darker did work in many aspects of the movie, but some parts were not needed to be so. The acting of the kids has gotten better, but Tom Felton's performance did not meet up. It was very unbelievable on how quickly he was frightened and ran away so quickly every time.Emma Watsons character becomes more important from this point on and the movie at least showed that. But they did not show much of the little quarrels the kids have in between. These fights show how the relationships between the characters lead to actions later on in the story.I was disappointed in seeing this movie. Others might think it good, but I would have liked to leave the movie and not have to analyze things in it especially when I have read the books. And as a final note, I would like to see this movie again, but not so soon after I have seen it the first time. The fact that is moves so quickly and does not explain much leaves me with such a migraine.</fullReview>

(Spoilers...I think)The new Dumbledore is far, far, far, more like the one than I imagined, the kids acting was fab, better than usual, a lot of people are slating Harry, but you have to admit, that's easily the hardest role to play.Timothy Spall was fantastic as the repulsive, creeping, grovelling Scabbers/Peter Pettigrew, David Thewlis is undoubtedly a good actor, but I found him a bit damp and weedy for the part of the werewolf Lupin, although he pulled the role off very well. Gary Oldman acted out Siruis' part magically, but has nobody heard of hair straighteners and black hairdye? One of his main features is matted, straight, BLACK hair. Since when did it become wavy and light brown? Also, the costume designer must have run out of ideas, because, a stripy convicts outfit and a trench coat? Uh-uh. Not a good Sirius look. It must be someone's idea of a bad joke.The Hippogriff and Werewolf were amazing. Buckbeak could have almost stepped out of the screen, and the werewolf was completely original, though the transformation looked rather painful and had quite a few sickening crunches in it. The story line was, for once, good, and while the script had a couple of let downs (Harry and Lupin on a bridge somewhere, discussing Harry's parents) it maintained a rather interesting, snappy standard. The plot line is a miracle. It fits together perfectly, taking just the right elements and fiddling with them slightly to avoid hassle, time-wasting and pointless bits without skipping huge chunks of the story.Well worth watching, far scarier than the other two put together, and I have to admit, if I was the parent of a young child who had loved the first two, I would be slightly annoyed at the fact that there was no warning about just how spooky those dementors were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, but edited poorly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is visually as stunning as anything I've seen in a long time. I'm excited to see it several more times, and I'm looking forward to Curon's handling of the next movie and more.However, I think Azkaban has been edited poorly. There are several dropped threads and essential information that is simply dropped. If you are not a fan of the books and have not read them, you will be, unfortunately, very confused during Azkkaban. If you've read the books, you can follow the plot, but you will similarly miss several important aspects.Dropped threads include: no explanation of who the makers of the Marauder's Map are, (so no explanation of why Harry's Patronus charm looks like a deer); Ron and Hermione's fights due to their pets is very minimal, although it is an essential aspect of the books. Lastly, Harry gets his Firebolt at the end of the movie, which seems a nice reward - but the book used this more as a plot device to push the relationships between the main three characters.The changes aren't all bad, and Curon has certainly tried to make his own movie, instead of just following the books by chapter and verse. However, I'm hoping Curon has followed Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings format - I hope he has another half-hour on his cutting-room floor that he can release on DVD as an "extended" edition. This movie sorely needs it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie and I still feel the same way about this one. It's just way too "Disney" for me. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the film, it just means I liked it as much as the other ones. The kids are doing a great job as usual. I also really enjoyed the actor they chose to play Dumbledore, even though he really didn't sound like him. However, I still liked the way Richard Harris played him best. I hope they decide to keep the same cast for the rest of the movies, but, if they do change certain actors, I understand that too. I recommend this film for those who have already seen the rest. I am looking forward to the next one coming out next year. I give this one a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new director is awesome. Not necessarily for kids.. The dementors kept you on the edge of your seat! I don't know why everyone says harry looks too old for his age. HE'S NOT AND DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT. Adam Lamberg from Lizzie McGuire was 16/17 and playing a 12/13 year old. It's a trend and true. Look at the people in their same grades in my school. A few have beards and mustaches growing! It's crazy. I loved had much darker it was. Very good! The new director would be wonderful for the fourth movie, but he's not going to direct it :frowns: Professor McGonnagol could have shown up more and some more humor could have been shown, but Ron had me laughing! SO did the shrunken heads. I want to ride the night bus! That rocked! I like how Harry is about the only hot guy there and Hermione is very pretty. The movie is good to not be based on good looking people, no offense because I love every character and wouldn't change them for the world. Good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From someone who loved the books</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this story and the books by J.K. Rowling but every time I see the next Harry Potter movie, something inside of me aches. I remember reading these books and feeling so surprised at the turn of events, but when you see it in a movie, it just seems so much more obvious. When (SPOILER) Harry sees someone across the lake conjuring the patronus, he assumes it's his father, but in the movie, it's so much more obvious that it's actually him! I mean, things such as Scabbers and Buckbeak and the Time Turner (to name a few) were so much more magical and surprising in the book. In the movie, they seem...well..mundane. I wish they would go into more details, I would still see these movies if they were three or four hours long! Intermissions, hello?! Titanic pulled it off! Stop sacrificing the story and magic for time and expenses. I'm so afraid of what's going to happen to the "Goblet of Fire". This book is over twice as long as the previous three. I must say, the direction in this movie has been my favorite, though. He took some liberties and changed a few things, but he knew which things could be changed, and which to leave alone. To wrap up and reiterate what I've said (because it's killing me) please, let the characters speak more and explain everything. It was so much better in the book when we finally saw Petunia explode, because she was so mean and awful to Harry. In the movie, she says approx. three mean comments and BOOM! Harry loses it. It just doesn't cut it. Let Harry, Ron and Hermione become vivid characters, not merely the shells of who we've read about. Take your time, Hollywood! (Or the British equivalent of Hollywood...lol) These are movies, not Cliffs Notes.P.S. Great job by the actors, by the way. The kids are truly growing as actors. P.P.S. Anyone else shocked at how much Neville has changed?~ Meg</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Harry Potter books used to be my favorites (until I discovered Tolkien), and like the books these movies can't hold a candle to the LOTR films. However, this was definitely a good film, the best so far. The Chamber of Secrets was my favorite in the series, but this movie is much more well done. Still, so many major details were omitted from the film, things that didn't necessarily confuse me, but disappointed me, especially more info on moony/wormtail/padfoot/prongs, because those names symbolize so much throughout the book (like Harry's stag patronus)and even more they are important in the fourth and fifth books too. Also,I thought Emma Thompson was awesome as Professor Trelawney (my favorite HP character), but was underused. The Quidditch Cup was a hilarious scene from the book, an extra 15 minutes or so wouldn't hurt the running time of this movie, so why not include it? Maybe I shouldn't, but I can't help but compare it to LOTR, which is unfair, but still. PJ's changes from the LOTR novels made relevant sense (except for the omission of Glorfindel) and didn't bother me but these HP changes are just too much. Also, in the books Hermione was mildly annoying yet amusing, but in the movie she was downright grating on my nerves. I wanted Malfoy to punch her instead. There was too much sexual innuendo as well...This is a good movie,very well done with nice scenery but I think you can appreciate it more if you HAVEN'T read the books, because then the omissions won't be as glaring and noticeable. Still, 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pendulum swings the other way - Columbus tried to cram too much in, whereas Cuaron cuts too much out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story: Harry Potter has returned to Hogwarts for his third year. However this year won't be all fun and games. A convicted murderer and supposed supporter of You-Know-Who called Sirius Black has escaped the wizard prison of Azkaban and is on the loose, supposedly to hunt down Harry and take revenge. As a result the mysterious Dementors, the wraith-like guards of Azkaban have been stationed at Hogwarts to look for Black and protect the students. But that is only the beginning ?Is this film better than the previous two or worse? I think it is neither ? but rather a completely different attempt at translating the 3rd Harry Potter novel to the big screen. Director Alfonso Cuaron has gone for a very different type of setting ? gone is the cheery comfort of the first two films and in its place we have a somewhat more threatening, scary and mature look.Many changes have been undertaken, most notably in the layout of Hogwarts which looks as though a mountain has grown up underneath it. Hagrid's hut is now located down the bottom of the hill (as opposed to being just out the front door as it appeared previously). Similarly the Whomping Willow (seen in the 2nd film) is now out by itself on the hillside and not in the middle of Hogwarts back lawn. Inside has also changed ? the Fat Lady looks completely different and the Gryffindor quarters are in a new location. Also Hogwarts now has a clock tower, whose pendulum swings inside one of the hallways (a bit dangerous ? what if a kid walked into it?). The end result is that Hogwarts no longer looks as welcome-like as well saw previously, instead appearing somewhat more cold, gritty and down-to-earth, in line with the overall feel of the storyline.How about the storyline? It should be known by now to all who have read the books that Cuaron did some major cutting of the novel, stating that he would only keep parts that actually had to do with the main storyline. As a result there's a lot of things missing ? the Quidditch Cup sub-plot has been abandoned entirely, and the only Quidditch we see in the movie is the scene where the Dementors decide to pay a visit. Similarly the feud between Ron and Hermione appears to have been left on the cutting room floor save for one or two quick comments from the actors. The most notable cut of all is the lack of explanation on the Marauder's Map and the identities of its creators. Even parts that were left in have been altered considerably ? Hermione now speaks about half of Ron's lines, leaving Ron with little to do but crack jokes and look scared. The new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin, becomes a sort of guide for Harry but the film curiously has nearly all the information regarding Lupin's relationship with Harry's father James cut and in what little time they have together Lupin instead talks about Harry's mother Lily (certainly not in the book). Only the end seems to have been more-or-less left alone, although again dialogue has been cut short and a bit more action thrown in instead (such as Hermione and Harry running from the werewolf).So how does it fare overall? I have to admit I'm hard to please when it comes to the Harry Potter films ? I felt that the first two probably followed the books *too* closely and probably should have trimmed them up a bit, whereas this time they've cut too much when they should have kept more of the story present. I do believe Cuaron has done well with the way the film looks compared to Columbus's previous efforts, though again I have to ask why Hogwarts suddenly needed to be rearranged after being the same in the earlier films?All in all I enjoyed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but it's not a scratch on the novel on which it is based (regarded by many as probably the best of the Harry Potter books so far), and I'm glad that Cuaron will not be directing the next film. I understand his decision on why he cut so much from the story but the end result is the film seemingly jumps from scene to scene with a somewhat lack of flow in the story until the last hour or so (unsurprising since the end of the film has the least cut out of it). Also while many parts of the novel might not relate to the main overall plot, it's those parts that help add character and style to the story (eg. Hermione's and Ron's ongoing feud helps with the development of their characters and their relationship with each other) which in its absence makes the story seem much blander as a result ? we're seeing the individual pictures but not the full richness of the tapestryI give it 3.5 out of 5. Hopefully Mike Newell will aim somewhere in between Columbus and Cuaron when he does Goblet of Fire ? not cramming in every little detail into the film but at the same time not ripping all the novel's guts out and leaving only the barest of details.</fullReview>

In the first 2 movies directed by Chris Columbus gave you an insite about what the book was about. They flowed smoothly from scene to scene and really established a connection to the characters. I've read all J.K.Rowlings books and was surprised to see that she accepted "The Prizoner of Azkaban" script. It didn't follow what we all have come to expect of the Harry Potter movies; the places we have all become familiar with, the grounds, Hogwarts and the Great Hall. It's as though you are going to the same school since your first year, you know the lay out and the grounds very well, then you attend the same school and your lost! The movie was very choppy and was directed as though the person didn't read the book at all, just did a little scene from each chapter and thought;let me get this over with as quickly as possible.

		<fullReview>Harry Potter &amp; the Prisoner of Azkaban a film directed by:Alfonso Cuaron,produced by:Chris Colombus(former director of HP),David Heyman &amp; Mark Radcliffe &amp; written by the talented J.K.Rowling.The Film is full of Adventure,Fantasy &amp; is comforting for the whole family to sit and watch.The film is set in a magical world full of witches &amp; wizards but the main place is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizadry.The main characters in the film are:Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Sirus Black and Professer R.J.Lupin. Harry is about to start his third year at Hogwarts but he accidentally blows up his aunt and runs away.He is picked up by a magical bus(Knight bus) &amp; meets the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge and he remains in the Leaky Cauldron.But he wasn't expelled from school because he used magic.Harry finds out that a convicted mad murderer named Sirus Black has escaped from Azkaban prison &amp; that he's possibly coming after him.Harry now is in great danger because Black is known to be one of the supporters of You Know Who(Lord Voldmeort).But this isn't Harry's only problem when going to Hogwarts school Harry discovers that the Dementors(guards of Azkaban prison)are guarding the school until Black is captured.The dementors are vicious,demonic creatures that suck your worst memories and fears.The dementors have great affect on Harry because of his past.So Professer Lupin,the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher,teaches Harry a spell to repel the dementors but we discover that Professer Lupin has some secrets of his own. The roles of Harry,Ron,Hermione,Sirus Black &amp; Professer Lupin are played by the magnificent Daniel Radcliffe,the humorus Rupert Grint,the brilliant Emma Watson,the talented Gary Oldman &amp; the wolf of movies David Thewlis.All actors were perfect especially Gary Oldman he really did a great effort,the movie was enjoyable though some people may be disappointed.The special &amp; visual effect were AWESOME,the sound,art &amp; costumes were great &amp; the scenes were magnificent.The best scene in the whole film is when Harry rides Buckbeak(the hippogriff) &amp; they fly over the lake. This is a really great movie but it was not like the book,the cast &amp; crew were brilliant,they did all what they were told to do.The only one left to blame for what happened is Alfonso Cuaron the director.He erased a lot of important scenes,left many parts un-explained and he also changed some parts.Lets hope that Newell(director of Mona Lisa Smile)dosen't repeat the same mistake.But the film is really fantastic I've watched it two times already and I'm willing to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie but could've even better. (Contains SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Liked it ! It's delightful, almost beautiful... I finally watched the movie after days of reading all the reviews (good and bad) here and around. I was affected initially when others posted that some of the more important parts of the book were not included such as the Marauder's Map story, the significance of the stag and a more detailed Shrieking Shack scene. With lower expectations, I enjoyed the movie a lot. It could have been better, missing some of the best parts in the book, but it is a great movie nonetheless. The director is definitely talented in film-making. He does however need to give more respect to the book and its readers. Afterall, the Harry Potter movies would not have attracted as many viewers if not for the books.I do hope that the movie was longer because some parts that left an impression after reading the book were left out. Besides the explanation of the Marauder's Map which everyone is talking about, other parts are -1. Stag - Prongs rode again last night. It would have been great if the movie included Dumbledore or at least someone, explaining to Harry the Stag represents his father, who was gone but lives on always in his heart. The Patronas came from within him. Imagine Prongs returning back to Harry after chasing away the Dementors, gazing at his son and bowing its antlered head before vanishing. Harry did see his father, the reverse of the idea that he thought he saw his father but it was actually he himself who produced the Patronas. That would have been a poignant scene.2. The guilt Sirius felt because he persuaded James and Lily to change the Secret-Keeper to Pettigrew. He knew Voldermort would suspect him as the Secret-Keeper rather than the useless Pettigrew. 3. The Shrieking Shack myth, the Whomping Willow and the tunnel were all created for Lupin. 4. Snape's schoolboy grudge that overshadowed everything else, even sending an innocent man to death by the Dementors. Another way is perhaps to make a longer movie and edit it into an adult version and a children version. The adult version would be darker and more emotional aspects of the book included. The children version would include more vibrance, colours and more happy scenes, like winning the Quidditch Cup.At the end of it all, I'm glad my favourite book of the Harry Potter series so far was brought to life on screen and I truly enjoyed the experience.</fullReview>

The scene where Lupin turns into a werewolf was great. I pictured him as more of a wolf though. And who else thinks that Ron and Hermione are going to start dating in the seventh or sixth book?

And i was right! Azkaban is a good film, made for all ages, not just 6 year olds, with well-timed (rather than ridiculous unnecessary over-the-top) action scenes countered by plenty of moody and intelligent dialogue. Cuaron manages to build the tension throughout the film, as do the books, and this time Cloves/Cuaron made a good job of condensing a long story into an exciting movie.See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, I sold my soul to Satan and took in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, adapted from the third novel of J. K. Rowling's blockbuster series of juvenile fantasy.Harry's third year at Hogwarts School of Wizarding and Wizardry is about to begin. After Harry loses his temper during dinner and causes his abusive Aunt Marge to inflate and float into the night, he decides that leaving is preferable to apologizing, packs his things, and heads out. On the street, Harry is picked up by a wizard bus that takes him to London and the Leaky Cauldron. En route he learns that notorious murderer Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison of Azkaban. To "protect" the students in case Black should come around, Hogwarts is now guarded by Dementors, the ghoulish and amoral guards of Azkaban. Dementors feed on human happiness, and unfortunately for Harry, they seem to take a liking to him. Thanks to Harry eavesdropping while under his invisibility cloak, we learn that Black is his godfather and his father's best friend, and that he betrayed Harry's parents to the evil Lord Voldemort. Harry resolves to have his revenge.After Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chris Columbus gave up the director's chair to Alfonso Cuaron. It shows. Stylistically this movie often differs dramatically from its predecessors. Visually the film is darker and more Gothic, as much of the action takes place outdoors, at night, or in the rain. We get to see more of the Hogwarts castle and the surrounding environs. Some of these establishing shots are stunning. Unfortunately some of the new visuals also offend established continuity, but not too badly.The acting is pretty solid. The three principal actors are maturing, and so are their characters. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry is taller and broader-shouldered. The rubber-faced Rupert Grint plays a more restrained Ron Weasley this time around. For some reason Emma Watson's Hermione Granger is played as more of a tomboy than a by-the-book student, but she's not terribly out of character.The redoubtable Robbie Coltrane returns as the slow-witted grounds keeper Hagrid, now promoted to teach Care of Magical Creatures. Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore; while the physical resemblance is there, Harris' kindly-grandfather interpretation of Dumbledore is gone. Alan Rickman again masters the sinister Professor Snape. However, Dame Maggie Smith is terribly underused as Professor McGonagall, having all of two or three lines in the entire film. David Thewlis joins the cast as Professor Remus Lupin, the Defense Against Dark Arts Professor du jour. The almost unrecognizable Emma Thompson chews scenery beautifully as Professor Trelawney, the flaky fraud who teaches Divination. Gary Oldman, who excels at portraying characters who are on the border of insanity, is a natural for Sirius Black, though he too is hard to recognize under his heavy beard.The Prisoner of Azkaban's two predecessors were straight, mostly faithful, adaptations of the source material. That wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but this time minimalism carries the day, and much of the novel's superfluous material disappears. Gone, for the most part, are classes and the Quidditch season, apart from one match that is crucial to the plot. Hagrid holds one Care of Magical Creatures class to introduce Buckbeak the Hippogriff; we don't get to see the students learning about Flobberworms or Salamanders. This undoubtedly rubs the Potter purists the wrong way, but it does make for a tighter plot. On the other hand, some of the deleted scenes provide information that explain the scenes that are left, and so a little more padding would have been nice.Many of the novel's crucial clues are revealed through exposition or dialogue. Here they are often shown visually. We are shown that Professor Lupus' greatest fear is a full moon. (Why?) Harry acquires a magic map authored by Messrs. Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, but their true identities are not revealed, nor is the reason Lupus knows the spell to reveal the map's secrets. But the answers are right there in plain sight, if you are paying attention. It's nice to watch a movie that doesn't insult your intelligence by assuming you have to be told everything up front.Final note: Take the time to sit through the end credits. Not that there are any surprises or secrets revealed, but they are well crafted and have a touch of humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very much a middle chapter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Azkaban is very much a middle chapter of a work in progress. It moves the Harry Potter story forward by introducing Sirius Black and filling in more of the back story. As a stand alone film though it has weaknesses summed up by Harry himself in the coda at the end of the film when he says that nothing that has happened has made very much difference. In the previous two films there was an identifiable bad guy who got his comeuppance, at least temporarily, giving the films a sense of closure. This chapter doesn't really close it just sets up the next film. As for the new director, Cuaron has made an excellent contribution to the Potterverse. The restraint of the CGI effects is a welcome relief after the heavy handed use of FX in the previous films. Let's hope Mike Newell continues in the same vein with Potter 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This will be short since everyone here pretty much has already said what I think also. The plot does not quite emphasize and skips over most of what the 3rd book was about.. I completely agree that Dumbledore did not possess that unique quality that made you fear nothing in his presence. He didn't make you feel AT ALL that he was the greatest wizard. They just skipped too many things. One thing I haven't heard too often was their trip to Hogsmeade... The person I went with never read the book and had no idea what Hogsmeade was, how important it was to the students, and why harry always had the cloak on him while he was there... I had to just about explain everything to her at the end.. If this director made all the HP movies, I would simply HAVE to read the book just to know what was going on.... It was a good visual, but the story lacks much desired by the fans, and by people just wanting to know why certain things were going on....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A radical departure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is obvious that the director of the latest Harry Potter is unaware of the proprietary attitude that fans have towards the books, it appears to me that he has cut and pasted the story to suit himself. Although the main story was faithful to the book the quirky details that make Harry Potter what it is are noticeable by there absence. Where's Peeves?? Where are the other ghosts especially Sir Nicolas? Why only one Hippogriff. I feel that it is a very well done and entertaining movie. but as a die hard Potter fan I think it is not a faithful rendition and is missing many of the fun elements that make Harry Potter such an original. Finally he made unnecessary changes to things such as scenery. Hagrid's Hut and the Whomping Willow are now outside the castle grounds. Fans feel comfortable with continuity and are upset when it is not maintained. The movie will be much enjoyed by people who haven't read the book, fans of the novel will not be as impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having been deeply disappointed by the first 2 films, which missed the mark utterly despite the great cast and attention to small details, i went in to Azkaban thinking that it couldn't get much worse.. And i was right! Azkaban is a good film, made for all ages, not just 6 year olds, with well-timed (rather than ridiculous unnecessary over-the-top) action scenes countered by plenty of moody and intelligent dialogue. Cuaron manages to build the tension throughout the film, as do the books, and this time Cloves/Cuaron made a good job of condensing a long story into an exciting movie.See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follow the Money with Warner Bros?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban is like having the suits in Hollywood tell you a bedtime story. --They always bring it back to the bottom line where THEY live happily ever after. It's not the story. It's not the art. It's certainly not the fans... It's just the money, the whole money and nothing but the money. Harry Potter is the biggest cash cow in the history of entertainment in any medium, and Warner Bros. has a good grip.It has only been a few years that the big studios have discovered that "value added" DVDs are the best thing for bottom lines since popcorn. This revelation has led to 3 (three!) separate releases of the Rings Trilogy (so far) -- each with successively more "value" treats: footage, making-of's, documentaries, voice-track commentaries, stills, etc.The first 2 HP movies have so far only been sold as the theatrical release DVD. But we have seen the ad photos of the "value added" versions. They'll be here soon. And we've seen a new edited version of SS/PS on NBC once (but not in their re-broadcast.) This means it is worth more $ as a DVD than NBC could afford. It also means that by movie 3 (and probably 2) they shot at least 1 and probably 3 hours of narrative footage to be re-edited into a PLATINUM or TITANIUM edition sometime in 2006. It means that the story holes in the theatrical release will be filled in to be enjoyed in the comfort of our own homes. It means the unexplained character shifts will be revealed as more deliberate and thoughtful acting choices. It means we might see Paul Whitehouse after all.. And it means Goblet of Fire will be shot as a 5-6 hour movie, released as a 2:20 movie with plot gaps and missing characters. It means we will all buy the theatrical release on DVD; then we will buy the Extended Version DVD; then we will buy the I-VII set on 23 DVDs in an album with ruminations and interviews with long dead or retired Brit actors. It means that the movies we stand in line to see in the theaters will never be the whole movies, or the "real" movies -- and certainly not the best Hollywood can do. Warners will save that for the Diamond Anniversary Collection in 2050.Did I enjoy PoA? The look was artful. The jack-in-a-box motif was arty and the stuff flying-monkey-nightmares are made of. The little bird was distracting. The kids are learning to act. The spectacle is spectacular and finally treats HP as something other than the mangey illegitimate cousin of the Lord of the Rings.And the actual story has been clipped so tight that many of the reasons we love Rowling's stories have ended up in the ash can -- or more likely, in carefully noted files waiting to be re-edited into the movie for another release on DVD. I don't mind Hollywood making money. I like it. It means more movies. More spectacle! More stories! Business really is a good thing. But in Hollywood, passion for profit is only as good as its passion for story-telling.I also don't mind a movie short enough that we can all sit through it without too many bathroom breaks. Nobody wants to miss an important scene.... but we wouldn't have traded a minute of the 3-hours-is-not-enough Battle for HelmsDeep. And I don't look forward to to trading bathroom-comfort for the whole Goblet of Fire Tri-Wizard Tournament, the Christmas Ball, or the Quidditch World Cup. Yet, somehow, we know that is what we can expect. Warners will spend more money on the next HP film than has ever been spent on a motion picture -- but when we go to the theater for its release, we will only see about half of what what intended to be the final film. The rest will require a second purchase -- and a third and fourth.If this were McDonalds, we would be buying the bun first, then going back and paying 3 times as much for the meat -- three times that for the cheese and pickles -- and then we'd need to drive through and pay double again to get katsup and onions. Or we could wait until tomorrow and buy it all again -- frozen -- and pay them again to slap it in the microwave. It sounds like a really good idea if all they're interested in is milking the cash cow for all they can get. But if they're out to make an honest dollar, to satisfy customers, to offer value for $, or to offer people something they can enjoy with a smile, then maybe they should reconsider. A great movie -- will get repeat customers. A great DVD of the full version of the movie with value-added treats will sell beyond expectation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Harry and Hermione crouch near the pumpkin patch, she in her light pink hoodie and he in his blue jacket, their microphone packs/ battery packs/ whatever they are can be seen on their backs. Watch carefully... it's in quite a few scenes, but not in all. I do wonder why they would have these packs on their backs, with ADR and boom operators, I didn't know they used packs like these. It upsets me that I noticed the packs, I was impressed with the film up to that point, but then I was taken out of the fantasy world right-quick and it had a negative affect on my viewing experience... although I was able to put it out of my mind for the duration of the film. It denotes a sloppiness that makes the movie less impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am clearly addicted to Harry Potter stories.This third film, however, leaves a great deal to be desired.It has many interesting small segments, but it is so choppy and lacks so much that it feels disjointed to watch it. Four of us went to see it, the two of us who had read the novels were very disappointed and the two who had not needed several sections of the film explained in order to really understand what they had seen.I feel that the biggest mistake was the new director, the direction he took the characters and the sets. It felt too sloppy. I didn't agree with the kids looking so disheveled with shirts sticking out, etc. This is a proper school and two previous films have shown us just how proper it is. They would not tolerate such sloppiness and would deduct points from the houses! The truly magical feel of Hogwarts in the previous films is lost in this one. The sets are great, but they are not magical! By the way ... why would we be happy with an entirely new location for Hagrid's house? I was prepared for a difference in the Dumbledore character, but not to the point of being a bumbling idiot. What scares me is that by the time of the release of this third film, the fourth one is already in the can. Although they may still be deep into the editing process, they can only edit what film they have shot. If they thought they were on the right track with the third film ... well, you can see what I am worried about ... they might go even farther out of character with the next one. I can only hope that they have had enough feedback that they can compromise in the final presentation of the fourth film. Yes, the kids are getting older and the plots darker, but why do we have to loose that magical feeling that makes adults wish they could be young and a student at Hogwarts??!!??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly praise the job well done by the new director of the third installment of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. Altho the plot stretched a bit thin at times, it is completely understandable considering the fact they only had 2 and a half hours to work with, given the length of the book. I have not read the 3rd book yet (in fact, I only bought the first book this past weekend) I did not feel lost at any point in this film. However, anyone watching this film without having either read the previous books or seen the previous movies will have a tougher time deciphering, but that's b/c this IS the third installment. (A friend of mine had that very problem.) I highly suggest that anyone slightly interested in Harry Potter go to see this film, b/c it is the best of the three. (I also find that each new movie is better than the preceding film.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right away, you can tell that a much more talented person directed this. I noticed the better performances from the kids, the camera-work, and the stylized way it ended. You just couldn't ask for a better director. We still get some of the good qualities that made the first two movies into entertaining adventures like the humor, special effects, the musical score, and some likable characters. My favorite character is still Snape but I went on to prefer Prof. Lupin instead, I felt sorry for him at the end. Another character that stood out for me was Buckbeat, he has to be one the most beautiful non-existent creatures to ever be made by CGI.Just when I thought the film was going to be over, there was still more left and it made everything more unpredictable. I was utterly mesmerized and impressed by the last scene with Harry and Hermoine. It made me think and it made me realize what a genius J.K. Rowling is. I really am missing out a lot by not reading these books. "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is almost a masterpiece and so far, it's the best of the series and also the most unforgettable.9.5/10Rated PG(scary moments, creature violence, and mild language.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is ridiculous. Hasn't it occurred to them to do the whole Volumes 1 and 2 like Tarrantino did for Kill Bill? They are cutting out HUGE amounts of information and not even bothering to explain how/why certain characters are aware of what they do know. Newsflash! The books are getting longer! It's only going to get worse...That said, I was much more pleased with the overall feel of PoA than I was with either SS or CoS. It was darker (right direction), a little more grown up, and the CGI was a nice departure from the old effects (the big spiders in CoS never looked real to me). They threw a lot of money at this one, only to come up short. It's a good thing that they are getting bigger name talent for the adult roles, so that the kids can have several someones to draw ideas and techniques from, but they are learning much too slowly, Radcliffe in particular.Personally I think that MOST of the shortcomings in this film could have been righted by the whole Volume idea. 5 hours of film would have dealt nicely with the holes in the story, and let's be honest, they could have made MORE MONEY by splitting it up, release one now and the second half during the holidays...Goblet of Fire is going to need at least 5 hours of film, perhaps 7...they need to get their acts together or NO ONE is going to want to see these....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely horrified - spoiler within</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? Let's start with the fact that this director has NO knowledge of Harry Potter, either the previous movies or the books. Some background knowledge would have gone a long way. I realize the issue and pressure put on by the time constraints of a movie; no one wants to sit through a five hour film. HOWEVER - why leave out all of the important threads that tie this story together and instead include elaborate scenes that do not pertain to the storyline nor enhance anything or did not happen at all? To J.K. Rowling I give my deepest sympathy that her "baby" has been massacred (I'm seeing a parallel between Voldemort killing Harry's parents and Cuaron destroying this book). As many others have said there is no continuity between the previous two movies and this one. Landscape changes, a random massive clock, the giant (or maybe he's changed to miniature for this film) squid's puddle of a lake and the small, insignificant dementors that are supposed to frighten all but instead look like wisps of cloth that a slight breeze would blow them to the moon. I feel pity for the actors, who in the previous movies portrayed happy-go-lucky youngsters who through courage and wits were able to come out victorious. In this movie it looks as if they all need some happy pills- where is the emotion? The acting seems forced - and if it were me I would be a little depressed too if the films that were my life suddenly took a turn towards a very large cliff. I could handle the changes and subtractions in the previous movies, as time is an issue, because Columbus made things work. The storyline was easy to follow in the previous movies and actually coexisted quite well with the books. This new installment does not follow the book, it almost seems as if the new director listened to someone (without that much knowledge of HP) give a summary of what happened and he went from there. It is hard to distinguish who the 'bad guy' is because Black was never seen as the mass murderer he was supposed to be. Characters, who will be important in following movies, are never introduced. Where did the shrunken heads come from? Also, very obvious contradictions lay within the movie itself. For instance, Harry using magic in the opening scene when not but five minutes later we here Uncle Vernon saying how he is not allowed to use magic outside of school. The entire movie had a very poor and dirty look to it, reminiscent of a 'B' movie. The buildings had the shabbiness that Lupin was supposed to have, but never did. One of the things the previous movies had that lacked in this one was the majestic feel to everything magical. This is supposed to be about his years in school to learn magic and his adventures that happen during those years. In this movie nothing is learned by the children and considering the fact they only seemed to have had a handful of classes throughout the entire year, how could they? One of the major elements that made the previous movies feel magical was the mystical music that pretty much went from beginning to end. During this movie you will hear a few choice big-band selections and one choir-sung song that should've been saved for the fifth movie, 'Something Wicked this Way Comes,' (nothing particularly wicked is actually coming, save it for Voldemort). All and all I wish I never went to see the movie and dearly hope that by the next one a new director is chosen and hopefully that person could pick up the pieces of this destroyed work of art that could've been but never was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cliff-Notes Version of the Book on Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings towards this new Harry Potter installment; while it is decidedly better then the first two it felt very rushed. Previosly Columbus would strive to include vital plot details and explore the many subplots that make the books interesting. In this version however the movie feels rushed. I read the book when it came out and do not remember every small detail but is was extremely obvious to me that the director was paying lipservice to many of the subplots by casually mentioning them. The main plot itself was not well explained was not well explained. The relationships between the characters was not explored, and there was very little development. The film just seemed to be a cliff-notes of the book; mention the important details, get a few wrong, and make sure it is done with in a couple of hours As usual the ensemble of British character actors was wonderful and the children seem to be getting better. One major compliant i had with the first two films is that the camera would somewhat stop and focus on a little piece of handiwork that the special effects team put together. This self appreciating habit has all but disappeared in this film except for several laughable gags with a extremely violent tree.</fullReview>

Each scene had about three sentences. That's my point of view at least I thought they had a lot more improve and that brought the film a nice touch.I'm relieved we have a new director for gof. I'd give the film a 6/7 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a great movie. The story line was great and the special effects were great as well, not just like the book but great still the same. I've seen it twice in the first week that it opened and still think it's a great movie. I don't understand all this stuff about people saying it's to scary for small kids and some of the content isn't for younger viewers. Watching the movie I didn't see anything that shouldn't have been there. I think people just ignore the fact that people in real life and characters in stories do grow up and change. That being said there still wasn't any offensive material in the movie or material that isn't fit for younger viewers. Sure there were events that were left out of the movie that were in the book but all and all it was a great movie and I recommend it for all to see. Another thing I liked was how from the first movie to the third you can see the actors who play the rolls get better and better. The casting for this movie couldn't have been better and I'm looking forward to the next and future installments that I hope continue to have the same actors playing the rolls!!! If I had to give this movie a letter grade it would get an A-, the A- because there is always room for improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Nice Transition, But still needs work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say I was very pleasantly surprised at this latest installment of the HarrY Potter series. I know that many Harry Potter Fans are pounding the table about not staying true to the first film or staying accurate to the book, but once again , this is NOT the book. It is very difficult to translate every single line, every single situation from the book to the screen. First off as many would wish to believe that the film needs to take the same route as the first two films I HEARTILY disagree. The first two films got Me interested in this series, but they seemed more like a "kiddie" film and I think this newest foray into Harry Potter, it its headed in the right direction making the film much more appealing to movie goers of ALL ages. Alfonso Cuarón did a magnificent job in bringing an edge to the film and to begin bringing the dark shadow of future events slowly into focus, but not delving too deeply into the darker edges just yet. If there is any issues that I have with the film is that in many spots the storyline did move a bit fast for Me. If I didn't know the films or the story that well, there are a number of explanations that were either very briefly visited or were insufficient to explain certain events farther into the film. I believe this is more a problem with a decision about how long the film would take and most likely many of these issues were edited out(hopefully) to keep the film's running time down. The explanation about the makers of the Marauder's map, more of an explanation of the events surroundings His parents death, the time traveling Hermione had been doing. Hopefully these explanations will make it to the DVD of this film and they take heade of this fact when putting together "Goblets of Fire". All in all a very good and promising film, much better atmosphere than the first two, but a more darker edge to them. After all the author of the book was also very pleased with the overall direction this film has taken, so that in itself is a good sign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technical Mistake!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Harry and Hermione crouch near the pumpkin patch, she in her light pink hoodie and he in his blue jacket, their microphone packs/ battery packs/ whatever they are can be seen on their backs. Watch carefully... it's in quite a few scenes, but not in all. I do wonder why they would have these packs on their backs, with ADR and boom operators, I didn't know they used packs like these. It upsets me that I noticed the packs, I was impressed with the film up to that point, but then I was taken out of the fantasy world right-quick and it had a negative affect on my viewing experience... although I was able to put it out of my mind for the duration of the film. It denotes a sloppiness that makes the movie less impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am clearly addicted to Harry Potter stories.This third film, however, leaves a great deal to be desired.It has many interesting small segments, but it is so choppy and lacks so much that it feels disjointed to watch it. Four of us went to see it, the two of us who had read the novels were very disappointed and the two who had not needed several sections of the film explained in order to really understand what they had seen.I feel that the biggest mistake was the new director, the direction he took the characters and the sets. It felt too sloppy. I didn't agree with the kids looking so disheveled with shirts sticking out, etc. This is a proper school and two previous films have shown us just how proper it is. They would not tolerate such sloppiness and would deduct points from the houses! The truly magical feel of Hogwarts in the previous films is lost in this one. The sets are great, but they are not magical! By the way ... why would we be happy with an entirely new location for Hagrid's house? I was prepared for a difference in the Dumbledore character, but not to the point of being a bumbling idiot. What scares me is that by the time of the release of this third film, the fourth one is already in the can. Although they may still be deep into the editing process, they can only edit what film they have shot. If they thought they were on the right track with the third film ... well, you can see what I am worried about ... they might go even farther out of character with the next one. I can only hope that they have had enough feedback that they can compromise in the final presentation of the fourth film. Yes, the kids are getting older and the plots darker, but why do we have to loose that magical feeling that makes adults wish they could be young and a student at Hogwarts??!!??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly praise the job well done by the new director of the third installment of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. Altho the plot stretched a bit thin at times, it is completely understandable considering the fact they only had 2 and a half hours to work with, given the length of the book. I have not read the 3rd book yet (in fact, I only bought the first book this past weekend) I did not feel lost at any point in this film. However, anyone watching this film without having either read the previous books or seen the previous movies will have a tougher time deciphering, but that's b/c this IS the third installment. (A friend of mine had that very problem.) I highly suggest that anyone slightly interested in Harry Potter go to see this film, b/c it is the best of the three. (I also find that each new movie is better than the preceding film.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right away, you can tell that a much more talented person directed this. I noticed the better performances from the kids, the camera-work, and the stylized way it ended. You just couldn't ask for a better director. We still get some of the good qualities that made the first two movies into entertaining adventures like the humor, special effects, the musical score, and some likable characters. My favorite character is still Snape but I went on to prefer Prof. Lupin instead, I felt sorry for him at the end. Another character that stood out for me was Buckbeat, he has to be one the most beautiful non-existent creatures to ever be made by CGI.Just when I thought the film was going to be over, there was still more left and it made everything more unpredictable. I was utterly mesmerized and impressed by the last scene with Harry and Hermoine. It made me think and it made me realize what a genius J.K. Rowling is. I really am missing out a lot by not reading these books. "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is almost a masterpiece and so far, it's the best of the series and also the most unforgettable.9.5/10Rated PG(scary moments, creature violence, and mild language.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i though this film was absolutely awesome! alfonso was directed the film exactly as it should have been from the book/film 1 to now. Chris columbus also did a great job and i can see good sides in both directors. I did however feel the time lapse in the first one, wheras in Azkaban i didn't look down at my watch. It lacked some of the detail which the book provides you with but so have the first ones and its a fact of life that you cannot fit all that detail in. We basically saw snapes hatred for Harry- however it wasn't so much shown for lupin, yet neither was any of the Mooney, Padfoot, Prongs and Wormtail scenario so it didn't need to be. it was great that we saw SO much more of hogwarts and the older characterisations suited the look and feel of the film. the humour was great as was the effects and brisk pace of the film. i absolutely adored it, however ican see other peoples views and accept them..i do however give Prisoner of Azkaban a 8.5/10 for a Harry Potter movie. great work guys</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS POSSIBLY AHEAD I was so ready to see the beautifully written PoA on screen. To see the enchanting vision that J.K.Rowling so aptly created. I could not wait to see; the village of Hogsmeade,prepare to meet Buckbeak and the tiny owl, who Sirius gives to Ron, experience the Knight bus, to be frightened by the Dementors, be thrilled by the Marauder's Map, and all of its secrets, just to be transported once again into that excellent world of magic where broomsticks fly and willows whomp,but alas the film fell flat. Some of the previous were addressed, but not in a fashion befitting this book, more like an episode of any gritty crime drama on T.V..The actors were great, this includes the new members as well.The world of Harry Potter has been set, or so I thought, until I saw an unrecognizable; Hogwarts, the grounds, the Forbidden Forest, Hagrids cabin,etc..The characters are growing up to be sure, as they should be, and as the book describes,but come on, the director Cuaron changes so much about this book and the characters, not to mention the world we have come to expect, that it is astounding. Yes this book does get darker, but is it necessary to change the entire look of the school and surroundings to get this across? Obviously yes. I so disagree. Is the movie better for it? I say a resounding NO!! Be darker, be gritter,but achieve it with your excellent actors not by making Hogwarts and the surroundings unfamiliar and downright depressing. I could go on and on. Let's just say that it is an o.k. film, not at all a magical film, and never are we transported to the beloved place Harry calls "home", instead we have been plunked down in a dark world that makes you glad you are not there rather than the reverse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a movie of Cuarón before, but it was definitely a good choice to let him direct the third movie. What Columbus did was a boring and annoyingly long illustration of the books, not noticing that the passionate Harry Potter readers had grown older, so the audience expected more than a nice and sweet Disney-like entertainment. Cuarón changed the whole look of the set and gave the characters a chance to play. He also used a lot of nice shots full of metaphoric quality. There are a lot of detail shots with huge parts of the picture out of focus, e.g freezing flowers. One of the best and innovative things he did, was to give symbolic materiality to a camera, that doesn't exist with respect to digital image generation. There is a viewing view (Sobchack) that flies through windows, the gigantic clockwork, ... . It is the best Harry Potter picture so far and I hope Newell will follow this path.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite all there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to start by saying how much I have loved the Harry Potter books; their growing complexity and J.K. Rowling's ability to have the characters mature is amazing. Unfortunately, the movie adaptations are falling away from quality of the original written work. The Prisoner of Azkaban is visually stunning and the casting is superb, but the filmmaker is assuming that the audience will have read the books before having seen the movie. This is probably a fair assumption, but it was in the omission of minor details that bothered me the most about this film. A few extra lines of exposition would have made all the difference in the world to the quality of the film and its continuity. For example, it was never explained why Sirius Black chose this particular time to escape from Azkaban, it was assumed that the audience would know. Also, how did Professor Lupin know how to use the Marauder's Map, only those who had read the book would know. Otherwise these two instances leave gaping continuity holes in the film. These would not have been difficult holes to patch and it would have been worthwhile for audience members new to the film. On the other hand, the time turner is dealt with quite well and the emotional impact of Harry creating the Patronus is heartfelt without being overwrought. I hope this is not an indication of what is to come for The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix, books that are even more complex and detailed.</fullReview>

In any case, the visuals, pacing and story are all tighter and focused than previous films.The casting changes, most notably Dumbledore, don't detract from the film. The young actors, who have grown quite a bit, are showing more edge and that's an improvement. It might be the change in directors that made the biggest difference.

		<shortDescription>Cuaron takes a new approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Alfonso Cuaron on board as the new director for the third Harry Potter movie, the movies start to make a turn-around. While Columbus's movies were good, he adapted every single part of the book into the movie, which caused them to be good adaptions, but without any original material. Cuaron's new approach allows this movie to have an equal balance of original material and adaptation.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban begins with Harry having a bad moment with the horrible Aunt Marge; and by "bad moment", I mean inflating Aunt Marge until she floats away. Harry then runs away, getting to the Leaky Cauldron by the Knight Bus (a purple triple decker bus) and begins his third year at Hogwarts. But things don't get better there. Harry learns that Sirius Black, who was sent to Azkaban jail for the murder of 13 people and the betrayal of Harry's parents, has just escaped from jail and is out looking for him. This causes the Ministry of Magic to send out the guards of Azkaban to guard Hogwarts for Black. However, the guards of Azkaban are actually Dementors (soul-sucking hooded monsters), and they are just as dangerous to Harry as they are to Black.New teachers include a mediocre Divination teacher, Proffesor Sibyll Trelawney (Emma Thompson), and an all new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Proffesor Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), who teaches Harry how to fend off Dementors. Even Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) becomes the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher, and introduces Harry to Buckbeak, a half-horse and half-eagle creature called a Hippogriff. Micheal Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Proffesor Albus Dumbledore, and while he acts a little less strict, he still captures the spirit that Harris had.Even though POA has a darker mood (the sky's always overcast and the ground is usually wet), it is definitely the best movie so far. It left out unnecessary scenes in the book and added more humor and extra parts. I would give it five stars out of five, but it does have its problems.Yes, POA left out unnecessary scenes, but it also left out important scenes. They also put a lot of things out of order, and a few of the scenes seem very rushed. I don't want to go into detail because I would spoil the movie if I did, but this may be a little annoying for people who have just read the book.Overall, though, Cuaron's adaptation is still very good, while not being TOO faithful to the book. I just have to say this: I can't wait till "Goblet of Fire"!****1/2 out of ***** Rated PG for startling moments, creature peril, and mild swearing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found that the movie was great! Alfonso Cuar??n seems like a great director, especially after hearing so many great things about him from interviews with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. Very different compared to the first two movies, but still very good. I honestly prefer Richard Harris as professor Dumbledore over Michael Gambon. It's a shame he passed away, because I'm sure he'll be missed greatly. However, the rest of the cast was amazing such as Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and David Thewlis. I'm unsure why, but Professor Lupin was, without a doubt, my favourite character in the movie. I really felt for him and Sirius Black. Overall, I strongly recommend this movie to anyone and ensure you'll love it. ^_^</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definite improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the previous two movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has improved drastically. Although many avid Harry Potter fans (one being myself) are a bit disappointed with the many changes, I think that those specific changes can be overlooked with how well this movie has been directed, written, and acted.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have all grown so wonderfully... and in only a year. If they can do that in a year... let's see what they can do in many years. Daniel Radcliffe was very tight and nonemotional in his two previous movies... yes he was very good... but again, not very emotional. In the third installment of the Harry Potter franchise, Radcliffe has really shown definite improvement. It's as if you can really relate to the character now. When he speaks in the movie, it isn't as if he is reading off the script... but actually adlibbing everything... which is very good. Emma Watson has definitely grown into a beautiful young woman. Even at a ripe age of 13/14... 16 year old boys (ahem my brother) are practically in love with her, and girls just love the way she presents herself. She is probably one of the only great young acting girls to come around (especially when you compare her to Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan who cannot act worth their life). Rupert Grint presents comic relief... and wow is he hilarious (Especially his dream scene). I love how oblivious he is to everything. And how laid back he is in interviews.This movie is finally almost doing justice to the books</fullReview>

It didn't have that much of the magical experiences but it was good.I like how the did the movie overall. Some people who pay attention to all the details will not like the movie since they did change a lot of the settings.i like how they were trying to show that something was going on between Ron and Hermione. I hate how they did leave out some things from the book.they did leave out some parts that they had in the book. That i thought personally they could have added.For the plot lie they did good even though they didn't put some things in.the graphics were good to Buckbeak was also very good for animation wise.But this movie was the best of the three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry, you guys blew it, big time!!!! This one is impossible to follow if you haven't read the book. Dumbledore looks more like he is wandering around in his pyjamas, which hardly befits the headmaster of such a school. Also, I seriously doubt that the kids would have been allowed to attend classes with their shirts poking out and looking like a bunch of slobs. Hogwarts has standards you know. Sorry, I doubt if I will see this one again. The first two movies, I saw a minimum of five times each while it was still in the theaters. Even my grandchildren found this film lack luster and have not asked to see it again. YOUR LOSS, literally. It might be a good idea if you tried to remember who your audience is. Please tell me that number 4 will not be "edgy" and "hip" as Azkaban was "suppose" to been. That would only turn off Potter fans and they are the ones that buy the tickets. Better luck with the next director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't much else to say than that this movie was awesome. Cuaron's vision and dark tones was the perfect setting for what is the beginning of Harry's dark, downward spiral to the end of the series. I loved the 1st two movies that Chris Columbus directed because they set the scenario and established the characters for the viewers to understand and fall in love with. HPPoA is a dark book and therefore needed to be a dark movie. The actors have grown into their characters and all of the new characters had only nominal face time; with the exception of Prof. Lupin and Sirius Black . These two characters, Black especially become as important to the series as Harry, Hermione and Ron. I look forward to seeing the next installment,Goblet of Fire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going back for more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually attend a movie like the Prisoner of Azkaban, a movie which has had a rather large buildup, with high expectations. Generally this is asking for trouble. However this time I left the cinema feeling more than content with what I had seen. The last movie I attended was the third part in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and I prayed that the Prisoner of Azkaban would not be a similar experience as I had spent the majority of the second half of the Return of the King worrying more about my numb bottom than the story. The Prisoner of Azkaban easily left me feeling more comfortable with spending my money at the cinemas than any movie I have seen for many years. It was quick paced, funny in parts, yet still darker as the books have described and did a great justice for the terrific ending that j.k rowling had created. Sure there were some parts of the third book totally ignored in the movie of the prisoner of azkaban but I didn't intend on seeing a 5 hour movie. I thought the director did a wonderful job and after almost falling asleep during the chamber of secrets I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the movie flowed. It is not often I return to the cinemas to see the same movie a second time but I think I may have to break that trend this time around!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Harry Potter 3 is better than it's predecessors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that the choice of having Alfonzo Cuaron as the new Harry Potter director was a smart one. Though Chris Columbus definitely directed two outstanding films himself, it seemed as if his directing style was slightly less organized than Alfonzo's. Alfonzo Cuaron's work on this film seemed to fit better with the atmosphere for the film. The acting was also sensationally better; the kids are getting better and better at what they do. Also, the quick-paced nature of the film keeps everyone interested. It touches even those who are not familiar with the books and is surprisingly true to them, despite having to squeeze all that information into a mere two-hour film. I recommend seeing it. It ROCKS!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely . . . book purists get off your high horses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely comment on movies, but the stupid backlash against this film by book purists is really making me angry, and I wanted to give them all a good, sound lecture. And I'm just as big a Harry Potter fan as any of you; and yes, Azkaban is my favorite book; and yes, I could quote you verbatim from almost any section of the book. So don't just sneer and dismiss what I'm about to say.So what if there were changes and deletions to the book? If any of you had seen A Little Princess you would have known that Cuaron made drastic changes to the story line there too (moving the book from London to New York, having Captain Crewe alive at the end, etc . . .) and it still made for an effective and moving film. A BOOK IS NOT A MOVIE! Sometimes changes fail completely (think the Count of Monte Cristo film version with Jim Caviezel), but many times they work amazingly (think Michael Mann's Last of the Mohicans). Granted, I was hoping to see flashbacks to Sirius' laughing in the street before Pettigrew's supposed remained, the scene where Harry bends down to tie his shoe so that Lupin won't see his tears, a more detailed pub scene with Madame Rosmerta, and a more in-depth Shrieking Shack. Still, even without these scenes, the heart and soul of Rowling's book was captured to perfection. Harry is becoming a more independent, angry, and less "gee-whiz!" boy. Hermione learns to put her foot down and stop playing by the rules so much. And Ron is . . . well, he's just Ron.Changes I Liked:Dumbledore: Gambon was RIGHT ON Rowling's depiction of the character. Not to speak ill of the dead, but Harris was just too SLOW. Dumbledore's mischievous and young-ish and, in Percy's words, "a little mad." Personally, I've always found Dumbledore to be somewhat unsettling, something more along the lines of Lewis' Aslan (not tame, but good) than the 'grandfather-figure' everyone else sees him to be. And what about that flash of triumph in his eyes at the end of book 4? Weird.Hagrid: Kudos to Kloves and Cuaron for making Hagrid less pathetic. He's probably my least favorite character from the books, but one of my favorite from the movie. I'm glad they made him a much more competent teacher and really stressed the fact that Malfoy was just being a git, as always.The Animal-Noises Scene: Priceless. I thought I was watching my brother and his friends goofing off as always. Big Band Music: Used AMAZINGLY in the Boggart scene, and also very well when Harry says goodbye to Lupin. It gave the movie a more real feel. Costumes: I'm glad Cuaron got rid of the robes. I re-watched Chamber of Secrets last night, and you wouldn't know that these were kids in the movie.Especially in the scene where Harry ends up in Knockturn Alley, he looks old, stuffy, and boring in that cape and sweater (isn't he hot?), instead of the spritely, mischievous boy we all know and love.Harry's Hair: Finally, a director who understands what messy means. I probably would've taken it even a step more beyond what Cuaron does. Think Tim Burton-esque style. Note for Warner: Has Burton been offered any of these movies? If not, you should. He would be amazing if he would do it (which I somewhat doubt, but hey, it's worth a shot).Quidditch: Wow, that was pretty intense! Loved the way Cuaron made the crowd more 'crazy' (painting Neville's face, etc. . .). Felt like a real NFL match. Loved the icy rain. Loved the fall. And one Quidditch scene is enough.Dementors: Looked like creepy jelly-fish. And since jelly fish really scare me and I thought the Ringwraiths in LOTR were fairly moronic (come on, people! These are supernatural beings who can sense the ring and yet can't find four hobbits right under their noses? And how in the world are hobbits supposed to outrun horses! Sheesh!), I think making them more fluid was a great idea. The soul-sucking technique was a little awkward, but how else would you have shown the dementors' effect physically? Viewers can't get inside Harry's head. Buckbeak's Flight: Incredible. Enough said.Werewolf Class: Loved Snape's slides showing the history of werewolves. Brought the whole thing into real-world, historical context. I'd never really thought of Anubis as a werewolf before. Interesting. Smart.Change/Omissions I didn't like:Okay, the shrunked head on the Knight Bus was just stupid. I'll give you that.Snape(kinda): The only scene in the movie where the omissions really hurt was when Snape simply appears in the Shrieking Shack. That really did need more exposition, and seemed too much like a deus ex machina device than it was in the book. My feeling here is that Cuaron wanted to cut Snape from the Shrieking Shack, but that Rowling wouldn't let him. (This goes of all the other omissions too. Apparently, Cuaron wanted to add 'little people' to the movie and also have a cemetery, but Rowling vetoed these changes. This gives me the feeling that whatever changes Cuaron made had to have her stamp of approval. So let's trust, JoRo on this one, she know what she's doing. Either they'll show up in later films, or they're not important to the final conclusion of the books.) Bottom Line: If you watched this movie and couldn't get past Cuaron's artistic liberties, I have a suggestion for you. Go watch the second/first movies, and then re-watch Azkaban. Keep an open mind, and enjoy the movie rather than watch for changes. You'll realize just how improved Azkaban is over the other two. The plot is leaner and meaner, the costumes snazzier, the acting better . . . hell, everything is better. And look at this as an expansion of the Potter universe. Instead of one brilliant Azkaban, now we have two. And there can never be too much of a good thing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is very good. I gave it an 8, but if you haven't read the book there are going to be parts where you won't know what's happening because they cut out some of the main points to make sure that the movie didn't run too long. So my suggestion is to read the book first or if you've already seen it and haven't read the book read it now. And the fact that the books keep getting longer is going to be a problem when making the movies because they, everyone involved with the film, have to cut out a lot of stuff so that people will be able to sit through the whole movie. Otherwise, and again, it was a very good movie and I recommend that you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was thoroughly disappointed with PoA. Maybe it's because I am 21, and I'm not into all the fun, silly stuff; or maybe because I like the dark stuff more than younger kids would. Either way, I just felt that this story and all the left out scenes were too important to the continuance of the whole Harry Potter story to have been left out or not explained. I actually enjoyed the first two movies a whole lot. GoF is nearly twice the size of PoA, and if anyone thinks they can fit the whole story into less than at least 3 1/2 hours, without making two movies of it, they must be mental. I liked Malfoy always being a bully, but I liked him being taught the hard way who was really in charge. I didn't like seeing him near tears though, it was kinda out of character. I also wanted to see Snape under the Mobilus Corpus, or whatever, spell; where he was purposely allowed to hit his head along the tunnel. And I didn't care to much for the Shrunken heads, but once again maybe it's because of my age. They need to get over the whole cheesy crap, the shortening films, and trying to sugarcoat the whole troublesome and dark reality of the great Harry Potter stories, even if they have to make it PG-13. Like that is a bad thing!!! I want to see some reall action like in the first two movies. I want to see Snape and Harry go at it. I want to see the Death Eaters show their faces once and for all. Am I wrong for wanting this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Missing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something about this movie that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Something about it didn't satisfy me. I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series whether we're talking about the books or the movies and I think this movie was great besides the fact something was missing. The first two movies were good too but not as good. I think the only better thing in the first two is that they were longer. The sets were brilliant, if only they had used them in the first two. Hagrids hut was excellent (not so sure about the pumpkins though) with it now set next to the lake that was featured in the book. The whomping willow too was good and was much more different to the one in the second movie.The original cast have returned with some new faces such as David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. Plus, we have Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris in the role of Albus Dumbledore. It is the third year at Hogwarts and Harry must face his deepest fears as he finds out that a prisoner from Azkaban has escaped and is presumably after him. The special effects are great. Especially Buckbeak and the dementors. The dementors may be similar to the Ring Wraths from LoTR but I consider the dementors much better. Besides the fact that it is very different to the first two, I still think this movie was better. If only the movie had been longer then it would've been great! Overall, this movie is definitely a must-see whether you are a Potter fan or not. Let's just hope that they add some more scenes onto the DVD. I give it a proud 8.5/10.- Nathan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit disappointing *spoilers, in a way*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, it was definitely not as creepy as the trailer made it seem. And secondly, I was a bit disappointed that the whole moral of this book seemed to have been lost in the writing of the script. What happened to Hagrid's talk to Harry and Ron about friends being more important than broomsticks or rats? I have nothing against the acting in this film, except for that of the man playing Pettigrew. Ugh. i couldn't wait for him to get off the screen. Partly because makeup had really overdone making him look like a rat, and partly because he just didn't make a great Wormtail in my eyes. Otherwise, great acting all around.What I disliked were the cuts from the book (better Marauder's Map explanation, Hagrid's lecture,Hermione and Harry fighting, etc), and the rearranging of scenes (like the Firebolt), as well as some of the building upon the book. What, may I ask, was the purpose of the shrunken heads? They became annoying very quickly, though I suppose some may find them funny. Just as the effects of the dementors was tiring after a bit. I realize that it was done to better convey the affect dementors have on living people, showing the iciness externally, since you can't really see the characters feeling it internally. But I'm sorry - it was used too much. And it wasn't too convincing when you realize that while the window on the train iced over and so did the flowers by the school, nothing iced or frosted over when the dementors attacked Harry and Sirius. Nothing.I did like the movie, for there were some creative additions (the candy, the clock and bridge, Hermione calling werewolf Lupin away). As a film, it was good. As an adaptation, it did a fairly poor job as it failed to capture the moral of the book, though it grasped the coming-of-age idea a bit, and failed to explain some things, leaving them instead to be done better in later films, thereby cutting time away from those plots.I would like to end with the statement that I think Micheal Gambon filled Dumbledore's shoes nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Harry Potter was a good solid film, the second Harry Potter was excellently done and very enjoyable. This Harry Potter really did not do it for me. Not that the movie is bad, it just did not live up to the second film. In this one we find Harry Potter is being sought out by a prisoner from Azkaban, a prison for wizards gone bad. Harry is naturally scared, and panic and mayhem persist at the Hogwarts school. There are some very good moments in this film, and Alan Rickman as always does an excellent job, stillyet there is something missing from this installment of Harry Potter. The first problem is that there is no real puzzle in this film, there really isn't something that needs to be solved, but the finale is somewhat intriguing. Mostly the film is mundane, nicely produced, but not remarkable in the least. Michael Gambon does a nice job filling the shoes of Richard Harris, who passed away before production began on this film. Other than that there is nothing really great about the film, but it's not bad, just not what you would expect from a Harry Potter film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was he thinking?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read all five books several times each and I just LOVE them. That's why, when the first film came, I just had to see it. At first I didn't really like it, but it grew on me and now I love the two first films. And then came the third...What was this new director thinking??? The first mistake he made was changing the scenery. You can't make the third film in a series and change almost everything there is! I sat through the film wondering if this was a joke, maybe a bad dream Harry had that I had missed in the book or something... But unfortunately not.The second mistake he made was chopping the film up so much it was difficult to follow the plot. I have, as I mentioned above, read the book several times, but I had a hard time following the story. There were so many things left out, and too many things just mentioned and then forgotten. Also, the adding of details which aren't even in the book is a bit dangerous I think. Like Hermione checking her hair when they travel back in time... Or maybe I just forgot about that part?The third mistake was to take away all the magic of Harry Potter. Yes, maybe the first two films were a bit too childish, but this was a far too big a step to take away from that. It was all too dark and sad compared to the first two films. Yes, the third book is different as well, but this much?The forth mistake was to make all the characters so vague. Yes, they were all there: Dumbledore, Magonagall, Snape, Sirius etc, but you could just as well leave them out all together in this film since we didn't get to see or get to know them any deeper in this film. They were there, but still they weren't.I understand a new director has to do his thing, but this was just too much.</fullReview>

Unfortunetley for all you Malfoy lovers out there this will be his last movie I believe. =(The whole movie in entertaining and very twisted. You'll be guessing what happened the whole movie.

		<shortDescription>Very Dark!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was the best so far.What a change from the last two films!!! This was really dark and scary! Brilliant! The main problem I thought was that the film gave very little explanation of surrounding events so if you have not read the book I think that you would find it quite confusing. It was very fast paced. There was no time to sit back and take in what was being said because it moved on to the next scene so quickly. I think this film needed to be fast paced though because so much happens in the book.... and it kept the excitement. It could have done with lightening up just a little bit though.... although Dawn French as the Fat Lady was brilliant.The three leading actors have really matured in their acting abilities, especially in my opinion Emma Watson, I thought she did a very good performance. Rupert Grint was superb as always! Michael Gambon was excellent as Dumbledore and took over from Harris very well. He didn't try to imitate Harris in any way but gave Dumbledore is own stamp. We didn't really see much of some of the other characters such as Snape, Malfoy, Neville or McGonagall which was a shame. I was quite worried about the casting choices for Lupin and Sirius. David Thewlis didn't really look the part for me... but he played the character of Lupin brilliantly. In my opinion he was the best actor there. Gary Oldman was excellent too... and I can't wait to see them both in future HP films.The special effects were excellent! The Hippogriff ride over the lake was amazing! I loved the design for the Marauders Map too.. not how I'd imagined it but better! I'm gutted that there was very little quidditch in the film because that was important in the book since it was the first year Gryffindor win the cup, but you can't have it all. The Dementors were interesting. I though the way they affected the people and atmosphere around them was portrayed very well but I was disappointed with the Dementors themselves.All in all an excellent film. I hope Cuaron does some more. I wonder if anyone noticed Harry's scar though! If you haven't watched the film look out for his scar! It doesn't seem to want to stay on the same place on his forehead!! But maybe its just me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darker, but better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third movie is darker than the past two, but it is better. Director Alfonso Cuarón shows his talents in this film, but I can't say that I honestly mean that he is the most suited director for a movie like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. My feel is that some of the books elements come out wrong, even though this is the best Harry Potter so far. Of course some of this can probably be blamed on scriptwriter Steve Kloves. Some parts of the film seems a bit long, but that's a bit like the book actually.The cast performs good, and I can't say the lack of humor makes the movie worse, I would rather say that it actually cranks it up a notch instead. I read another comment commenting that the Americans don't understand the spoken word in this film and rather wants it dubbed(!). That's in my opinion the worst thing you can do to a movie. Even though Americans seem to like it, along with several European countries (they should all learn to read subtitles). I'm from Norway and we all learn English as a second tongue, how often do we run around shouting to get films dubbed? (just a little statement)Back to the movie: The movie stands well on it's own feet, but if you have read the book the experience is a bit different (sadly, you also miss elements from the books, but when each book grows in size, things got to be cut from the script so the movie doesn't double in length from the previous one.Alfonso is claimed to be a more "emotional director", and that's something that shows through the movie, and actually seems to go home with the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ; this movie was not as childish as the others, and Alfonso Cuaron did a great job. I love the fact that it is darker than the other ones and the characters are more mature (haven't read the book.. i guess in the book it is like that). The only think I didn't like was some of the effects that seemed so fake considering the mega budget for a HP film. They really have to improve on it, specially on the animals. And there were some shots, specially in the ones when Hermione is held by the tree that look so horrible and in the room you could hear a big laugh for the horrible shot.Gary Oldman looks great on it, the best of actors in the movie. For sure this series of movies will not last forever but this one so far is the best of Harry Potter. In the script the characters, specially the teachers are complete clichés, they could have been more unique instead of abusing in clichés of wizards.</fullReview>

I love Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, and Emma Thompson, but they definitely could have been given better material than what they received.

		<fullReview>There is something about this movie that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Something about it didn't satisfy me. I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series whether we're talking about the books or the movies and I think this movie was great besides the fact something was missing. The first two movies were good too but not as good. I think the only better thing in the first two is that they were longer. The sets were brilliant, if only they had used them in the first two. Hagrids hut was excellent (not so sure about the pumpkins though) with it now set next to the lake that was featured in the book. The whomping willow too was good and was much more different to the one in the second movie.The original cast have returned with some new faces such as David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. Plus, we have Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris in the role of Albus Dumbledore. It is the third year at Hogwarts and Harry must face his deepest fears as he finds out that a prisoner from Azkaban has escaped and is presumably after him. The special effects are great. Especially Buckbeak and the dementors. The dementors may be similar to the Ring Wraths from LoTR but I consider the dementors much better. Besides the fact that it is very different to the first two, I still think this movie was better. If only the movie had been longer then it would've been great! Overall, this movie is definitely a must-see whether you are a Potter fan or not. Let's just hope that they add some more scenes onto the DVD. I give it a proud 8.5/10.- Nathan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but too much changed/left out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I didn't mind the movie. I mean, once again, the visual effects, acting etc. were very good. But the most disappointing part was the fact that they changed the set. For example, the books say the Whomping Willow is a tree by itself in the middle of the grounds, and it was in the 1st and 2nd movies, whereas here it was in the middle of the forbidden forest (and even that wasn't scary, eg. where they met Buckbeak). And since when did dementors fly?? Also, i can't believe that the director left out Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup, that is such an amazingly happy and brilliant part of the movie. The acting was once again excellent, however there certainly wasn't nearly enough teaching/classes. And what's with the Patronus being a sheet of white light? I mean, I know we saw Prongs near the end, before Harry goes back in time, but when Harry was actually producing the Patronus, there was no Stag. And speaking of things being left out, or put in in this case... where on earth did the Director get the idea for a choir, and seriously, wasn't Harry's flight on Buckbeak just a bit long. If he'd cut the choir and made the flight a bit shorter, perhaps there would have been more time for the more interesting parts of the movie.Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with The Prisoner of Azkaban. I was expecting the same set as the first, didn't happen (much to most ppl's disgust) and there was way too much information left out. I know they have a time limit, but still... I sincerely hope that for The Goblet of Fire, either 2 movies are made, or they find some way to squeeze all the info into one 2.5hr movie (i'd go the 2 movies myself)!!!Anyways, that's just my view... I did like the movie, but there was too much non-continuance from the first 2, and not enough fun.At a last thought, in the previews, i completely loved the hand of the dementor on the train... but i really didn't think that they were scary, if even a little too close the the Ringwraiths..

		<shortDescription>A lot went wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter 3 was not what I expected. Not even a tad better. The change in directors is probably the reason for this. Sure, its darker, with the softer lighting and the quick flash close ups whenever the moment for facial emotion changes to fear - even though many was uncalled for as it was too over dramatized in some areas. The movie gave the viewers nothing and I say this. If you had not read the book, you will truly never understand the movie. Columbus, though leaving out some partial essentials, was a good director, putting what he could into his movies while this new director has taken a new turn and has focused entirely on practically all the new characters and places. You hardly get a glimpse of a teacher, a proper class - the school in general is minimized completely and unlike when watching the Columbus movies, you feel that a year actually hasn't passed in Hogwarts. I really did want to fall asleep in this movie, but felt if I did, I'd have to watch it again to see the rest and I did not want to do that. You don't feel comfortable in the movie, there's no explanations set out, and its too quick. The camera passes over so many sub conversations, like when Malfoy broke his arm and is exaggerating its real pain in the dining hall, the camera passed over quickly hitting straight on the famous three, that you never truly received the humour of Malfoy. And personally I think that Dumbledore did a terrible job. He was no longer the gentle wizard who Harry warmed to - he was just another face that saved Harry from dropping. And Lupin, I did not seem to get anything from either, and it was definitely most sad as how the movie took away the explanations of the Maurauder's Map, Harry's Patronus, Padfoot, Prongs, Moony and Wormtail, etc etc, which was essential to tell. The only real part I enjoyed was from when they went to Hagrid's hut before Buckbeak's murder. That was when Cuaron's darker filming techniques were needed, to which he used to his advantage brilliantly. I do not think Cuaron was the best choice as he did not know how to add depth to the characters and let them grow for the audience to love. Many mistakes were made in this movie and I think him as the directing choice was only a small part of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was as I suspected a great movie, the camera man's fading in and out was a little strange, but good over all. The movie was wonderful, and Micheal Gambon as I suspected wasn't great at all, he was OK at best. That is probably why they gave him so few lines which was best for every one. I can't wait too buy it when it comes out to DVD. I wonder how many more movies they will have, but I will but and see all them in theaters. I hope the others keep getting better each one is better than the one before. People are worried because Daniel and rest of the cast are growing older, Daniel is taller than me supposedly and I'm 20 years old. I think it won't matter if they grow even more because they are great actors and actresses. Go see the movie if you haven't already. And I didn't spoil anything.</fullReview>

Dementors played a big part, which IS pretty good...Sirius was OK, "Expactro Patronum" sessions could've been extended between arrival of Firebolt...I dunno...I'm no expert...

		<shortDescription>NOT ONLY THE BEST OF THE THREE, BUT A HUGE ARTISTIC LEAP</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to read any of the Harry Potter books but I intend to eventually. My review is strictly based on the merits of the film, NOT the book.DIRECTING: Alfonso Cuaron is the single best thing to happen to this franchise since it began. What he's done with this film is nothing short of extraordinary. While it makes sense to bring him in at this stage in the characters' lives, his take on the world of Harry Potter is precisely what it should have been in the previous two. Not only is the magic presented in a more realistic fashion but the darker aspects of this world are shown in a truly terrifying manner. His take on all the characters are more grounded as well with the humor presented in a tasteful manner instead of the silly, goofy interpretations within the two previous films. Cuaron's use of irises to mark scene transitions is an aspiring touch as it works perfectly for this type of genre film. The use of camera movement really brings energy to the film and really shocked me at how well the technique was used. The reason I say this is because camera movement seems like it is seldomly used for artistic reasons anymore. It seems to be a gratuitous method most directors use in absence of truly creative means. Cuaron's opening shot is worth the price of admission alone.CAST: Every actor from the two previous Harry Potter films is so much better in this third installment it's just mind blowing. Daniel Radcliffe in particular is astounding in the amount of complexity and intensity he brings this time around. I'm a firm believer that the director is a monumental force in shaping an actor's performance. This is what Cuaron has been to Radcliffe. The fact that he made his young stars write essays on their characters proves my point. I've thought Emma Watson was a brilliant child actor since the very first film. In fact she pretty much stole both previous two films with her performances. She does so in this film as well as she as stepped up the bar for her character once again. Even Rupert Grint, who I felt was mishandled in the two previous film, shines. As far as the adult actors go, my favorite performance in this film was by David Thewlis. I love the charm and warmth he brings to this character. As usual, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are brilliant. I love Gary Oldman and liked his performance but his screentime was way, way too short. Emma Thompson rarely disappoints and I enjoyed her performance, but it was a little too over the top.SCORE: How can you go wrong with John Williams? While his score for the previous two films were great, his work is elevated way past his norm on this film. Whereas some of his work all sounds the same, he distinguishes this installment of Harry Potter from the previous two with truly creepy and catchy segments.EDITING: Personally, I believe that if a film is properly edited the story just flows and engrosses my imagination. The scenes just blend together. To their credit, the two previous Harry Potter films had good editing. However, on this film it is just superb.PRODUCTION DESIGN: Another area in which the film excels beyond what the two previous accomplished. Granted, the production designer is Stuart Craig, the same from the two previous Potter films. The production design for the franchise in general has been fabulous. However, under Cuaron's watchful eye, Hogwarts truly takes a larger than life approach. My problem with Hogwarts in the past was it seemed like nothing more than a miniature model. That is not the case this time around. The design of one scary set piece is so well done that it enthralls you. Just the surrounding woods themselves are given an eerie quality of beauty.CINEMATOGRAPHY: The work of Michael Seresin in this film is drop dead gorgeous. Using a lot of browns and neutral colors he creates a more grounded, gritty, and scary place that Harry Potter inhabits. Those scenes in the woods at night are salivatingly beautiful. And the take on the Quidditch game in this installment is just numbingly gorgeous. Also the use of visual effects as a light source is used to brilliant effect in this film.Again I have not read the Harry Potter books, but I don't see how any fan could not see what an accomplished piece of work this installment is. It's truly a FILM.My rating: ***1/2 out of **** stars</fullReview>

The use of camera movement really brings energy to the film and really shocked me at how well the technique was used. The reason I say this is because camera movement seems like it is seldomly used for artistic reasons anymore. It seems to be a gratuitous method most directors use in absence of truly creative means. Cuaron's opening shot is worth the price of admission alone.CAST: Every actor from the two previous Harry Potter films is so much better in this third installment it's just mind blowing. Daniel Radcliffe in particular is astounding in the amount of complexity and intensity he brings this time around. I'm a firm believer that the director is a monumental force in shaping an actor's performance. This is what Cuaron has been to Radcliffe. The fact that he made his young stars write essays on their characters proves my point. I've thought Emma Watson was a brilliant child actor since the very first film. In fact she pretty much stole both previous two films with her performances. She does so in this film as well as she as stepped up the bar for her character once again. Even Rupert Grint, who I felt was mishandled in the two previous film, shines. As far as the adult actors go, my favorite performance in this film was by David Thewlis. I love the charm and warmth he brings to this character. As usual, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are brilliant. I love Gary Oldman and liked his performance but his screentime was way, way too short. Emma Thompson rarely disappoints and I enjoyed her performance, but it was a little too over the top.SCORE: How can you go wrong with John Williams? While his score for the previous two films were great, his work is elevated way past his norm on this film. Whereas some of his work all sounds the same, he distinguishes this installment of Harry Potter from the previous two with truly creepy and catchy segments.EDITING: Personally, I believe that if a film is properly edited the story just flows and engrosses my imagination. The scenes just blend together. To their credit, the two previous Harry Potter films had good editing. However, on this film it is just superb.PRODUCTION DESIGN: Another area in which the film excels beyond what the two previous accomplished. Granted, the production designer is Stuart Craig, the same from the two previous Potter films. The production design for the franchise in general has been fabulous. However, under Cuaron's watchful eye, Hogwarts truly takes a larger than life approach. My problem with Hogwarts in the past was it seemed like nothing more than a miniature model. That is not the case this time around. The design of one scary set piece is so well done that it enthralls you. Just the surrounding woods themselves are given an eerie quality of beauty.CINEMATOGRAPHY: The work of Michael Seresin in this film is drop dead gorgeous. Using a lot of browns and neutral colors he creates a more grounded, gritty, and scary place that Harry Potter inhabits. Those scenes in the woods at night are salivatingly beautiful. And the take on the Quidditch game in this installment is just numbingly gorgeous. Also the use of visual effects as a light source is used to brilliant effect in this film.Again I have not read the Harry Potter books, but I don't see how any fan could not see what an accomplished piece of work this installment is. It's truly a FILM.My rating: ***1/2 out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To tell you the truth i wasn't expecting much from the film, i had always enjoyed the books so much more then i ever did the movies as i never felt they truly explored what it meant to be apart of the magical world that is Harry Potter. This film almost did it, and thats how close a film will ever get to it, because nothing will ever be able to compare to the books. The dark themes were right alongside the simplicity and beauty. It was much more streamlined which helped but at the same time there were the poignant scenes between harry and Lupin. I wish more of a relationship could have developed between Harry and Sirius as that was never really explored but other then that, it kept me captivated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of the shots were much too tight. It ruined any epic sense of the two previous movies. There was also the extremely short length of the shots which had the same effect on the epic sense.Without that epic sense, it lost most of it's wonderous and magical feel.The castle, which was made to feel enormous in the first two felt like a small closet in this one. Even the groundskeeper's grounds seemed reduced in scale on a now very steep hillside. But the movie really didn't need a big castle because there wasn't much focused on the experience. Any existential qualities were killed by the goal-orientedness of it's lack of well crafted transitions, and it's unnecessarily fast pace. (It is supposed to be a full year.)Gone too was a decent musical score. This really crippled any epic feel that the film might have had. This along with the uniforms, (or even non-muggle clothing!) are no longer worn most of the time, so any timeless feel to the movie is gone. This too ultimately killed the epic sense of the movie. Sprinkle in a few hand-held shots for that $159.95 effect and you got yourself something that should anger and offend nearly every Harry Potter fan. But the ending had to be the worst. A freeze-frame closeup on a smile? This is something out of Starsky and Hutch! I thought: "why the hell would any director want to do that?" I later read that he did that because it was part of his signature. It was so bad too me, it was as if his signature could of been ending with tap dancing hillbillies dancing and bowing, or maybe the porky pig cartoon ending. I remember the urge to stand up and shout "Nooooooooooo!" overwhelmed me. It was as if he urinated on the entire movie so that everyone would know that it was his. I personally would have used Alan Smithee's signature instead. Before Azkaban, I thought that there would never be a remake of the series. Now, I am sure that there will be one years from now. Chris Columbus deserves better than to have a spectacular start destroyed.This was by far the best book of the five, and so far, it is the worst movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag of bullseye's and humbugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With much anticipation I went to see PoA last night. Feelings mixed.What I liked.The movie has a darker Gothic feel to it. It sets up well the feel of a storm brewing (Voldermorts eventual rise to power). And darker days are ahead.The movie itself didn't have any part which made me look at my watch or think when is this going to end.The choir singing at the beginning of the movie, well the music has to come from somewhere (it reminds me of Mel Brooks. Bandstands in the dessert or a bus with an orchestra group in it driving by). Schools of this nature do have choirs. Showing that Hogwarts is more than Quidditch and study alone.The acting was good and the younger actors are developing well.Now What I didn't like or was lacking. SPOILERSMust agree with others that Peter Pettigrew was too rattish, An animagus is still a person and understand and can think, they do not have the animals instincts which would imprint on their mind. Which is what I felt was being portrayed.I am a lover of the book, and can well as many others have said. You cannot put everything into the movie from the book. However some key elements were dropped which are vital to the story going forward. Let face it. These are interrelated movies. Not one off projects even if you have signed on for just the one.We get a brief glimpse of Prongs (stag) shape then it basically pulsates in a white flash and exudes force wave that repels the dementors. Why couldn't the stag chase down and drive the dementors as in the book? Also it is important that the Stag then goes back to Harry who reaches out to touch it and ask it if it is Prongs? Others have said that the association of Mooney, Padfoot, Prongs and wormtail is an important omission. And the blatant lie that lupin gives. Which is backed up in the book by Ron running in and saying he bought it from zonko'sLack of explanation of why Sirus, James and Peter became animagus. Also why the shrieking shack was there in the first place.However my biggest Disappointment is that there were no flash backs when Harry dementor dazed of his parents death sequence apart from an initial scream in the first dementor encounter on the train. This is an important paradox it gives Harry a wish not to fight off the dementors in practice, as he wants more memories of his parents.It seemed to me (I could be wrong) that the director suffers from Homer Simpson attitude. There is only one type of fade out and fade in when cutting from one scene to another. For Homer it was star wipe. For Alfonso Cuarón its fade to black to the centre of the screen whether or not someone is passing out.When this comes out to DVD I will get it to watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even more so than the previous movies, tons of content from the book was completely ripped out for the movie. In addition, more content was added that was not in the book, which the other movies didn't even really do, and this movie had it in bucket loads. Some of the twists were interesting, but at the expense of some of the important scenes in the book, they were unjustified. Although, it may be possible there are many additional scenes on the DVD or something, many of my friends seem to think this was possibly the worst of their movies so far. Personally, I also felt the movie to be a bit shorter than it could have been (length wise) and due to the increasing age bracket they wish to target, I don't see any reason with making it a bit longer than it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So disappointed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched the film and I am so disappointed with what I saw. I am a huge Harry Potter fan as are my children. I think the books are fantastic and just keep getting better with each installment. I expected the movies to follow suit. I was disappointed with the first two movies as well as they seemed a little cheesy but they followed the books' story lines fairly well and I felt that was the most important thing. With a new director I had high hopes for the third movie, and in some ways it was better, but there were more ways in which it was worse.***Spoilers***I enjoyed the more mature feel of the film and thought Buckbeak looked great but where were we? How could Hogwarts have changed so much? Where were the wizards' robes? The fourth &amp; fifth books point out how much trouble some wizards have blending in with muggles because they don't know how to wear the same clothes. Where were the explainations needed to transition from one scene to the next? Harry Potter is a good wizard, but a Patronus charm in two attempts? All the supporting characters have disappeared! Even Ron's family, which are important characters in every book, have been mostly ignored. (Where was Percy?) Petigrew plays a very important role in the future but his introduction to the story was pretty sketchy. If you haven't read the books, can you even understand the movies? I could go on and on with the specifics of my disappointment but the point is that I feel this film was too choppy, too rushed and too far from the book. I understand that a movie cannot be an exact replica of a book but this is a part of a series and therefore requires continuity. How is the next film supposed to continue a storyline with so many holes in it? Where was J.K. Rowling? Did she approve, or have any input, in this chopping of her story? The Goblet of Fire is my favorite book of the series so far but I am hesitant to hope for a movie that might try to do it justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little disappointing after some of the really good reviews this film got. I saw it a week after Shrek 2 and it pales in comparison. The three main characters are a little older and instead of being impressive child actors they seem little more than average. By the next sequel the two boys will have trouble playing their characters ages. It really had the feel of a Walt Disney TV movie. Kind of a jazzed up Bednobs and Broomsticks. Still the demographic it is aimed at is 13 year olds and it should continue to impress that age group. I would still recommend it for 16 year olds and under but DO NOT GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HYPE! It is not as good as the first film and you will probably be disappointed if you go in expecting that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It FEELS like the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A guy walked straight up to me at the end of the movie and asked what I thought, and I answered right away that it had the exact 'feeling' of the book. It totally felt like 'Prisoner of Azkaban'! Yes, loads (lol) were missing, but I felt none of it during the film... unlike the jarring missing parts of 'Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone', which I still adore none-the-less. There's a part in this book called 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' that I remember my dad reading to me. Something along the lines of that it's hard to write a 100 word paper on an entire building, but one could write a 1,000 word essay on one of it's bricks. I think Cuaron applied this simple, yet very effective lesson to 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. He's done away with trying to cram as much in as possible and fleshed out what otherwise would have withered into faded memory. Just look at what he's done to Daniel Radcliffe. Before, his character was almost forgettable and the fangirls glommed onto Tom Felton and Sean Biggerstaff. Now that Cuaron was able to focus in on Harry and get a stronger performance out of Dan you see thread after thread of girls on the messageboards going completely ga ga over him. It's not just because puberty is unfairly kind to him; he was pleasing to look at even back in 'David Copperfield'. It's because Harry is now a character you can FEEL for. There's something sexy about a tortured character, no matter what their age, and in 'Prisoner of Azkaban' Harry's tortured soul has been amplified threefold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I've noticed is that every person who likes the movie always first says "the special effects were great!" When did special effects make a movie? I LOVE HARRY POTTER! And I HATE THIS MOVIE! I think it's the worst adaptation ever. I understand that the book can't be adapted directly but the moviemakers have to realize that if you please the readers, you'll probably please non-readers.I don't think that either director captured the magic of Harry Potter. Both directors have a good idea in certain ways. Columbus directed the pace and story of the film beautifully. But there was nothing really magical. The movies were really plain. His visuals were unoriginal and overdone.Cuaron had an incredible visual idea of Harry Potter. (So what if it's dark! THE BOOKS ARE SUPER DARK! What are people going to say about the ending of Goblet of Fire?!) However, his rushed scenes and lack of character growth totally destroyed the movie. I thought movies were about drawing emotions in people. Things rushed by so quickly I couldn't empathize with any characters. Also, the movie was beyond sappy. Ther were moments I wanted to scream. So many of these lines are sooooo unoriginal and unrealistic!So anyway... hopefully we can find a director that can combine both the visual and acting/character development/story development magically and everyone can enjoy the next movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, trimmed a touch too much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Below (especially if you haven't read the books)I finished watching this movie about half an hour ago and I'm still in awe. Cuaron did such an amazing job of adapting Azkaban, easily interweaving teen angst with the dramatic Rowling plot which captivated me besides the screaming brats in the cinema with me. As the end drew nearer I couldn't believe how beautiful the film was? the light from the Patronus charm blinding me as much as the Dementors.Having made my overall comment, I will now go to specifics?.The Dementors, you cannot go past commenting on what was the most hyped feature of the film? the teasers with the hand on the door drove me and others mad. They were superbly done, well done to the POA Special effects Crew. They were scary, dark disgusting creatures and after the scene by the lake at the end I will never look at a flock of birds' overhead the same way. The Quidditch scene was amazing and scary and phwoar?. It was a far cry from the lush green fields and obvious CGI of the 2 previous Quidditch scenes in the series.Gary Oldman was a magnificent Sirius Black, although in the shrieking shack he seemed quite insane at first but came around. Bravo for being the perfect Sirius, to me at least. Peter Pettigrew was not as I would have imagined, I always saw him as a grown up Neville Longbottom type person (their similarities always made me feel that Neville's future is not so bright) but the actor did the sucking up and desperate attempts at mercy to perfection, I must say. While still on characters, Michael Gambon (who I had only ever seen in Ali G) did such a good job of being Dumbledore I nearly forgot Richard Harris (RIP Albus) wasn't playing him anymore. It was amazing.Having listed all of the things I thought were Excellent about the film, I feel it pertinent to say what could have been better. I understand that anything longer would have seemed grandiose but he cut so much!!! Little things like the origin of the Stallion (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs) which were very important were missing. There were other things, but not worth mentioning as the film was amazing and captivating.One last comment. There has been a lot of speculation over the three of them playing the roles throughout the series, due to their age. Has everyone forgotten that the three of them are actually the same age as the characters within a year and that they look the age? If they want to keep going, I think they should because lets face it? Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter and no other kid could step into the role because Danny is forever in our minds as what Harry looks like. 9 stars out of 10, a ripper of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Details left aside</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This installment of the Harry Potter series had many highs and many lows. With the new director you could certainly sense a different feel for the movie. From the opening camera shot that wasn't as clean as the past two, to the beautiful camera angles throughout the movie, Harry Potter 3 had an independent film's artsy quality. The beautiful way in which it was shot aside, this movie was very rushed. I felt many of the important details were left aside and shouldn't have been. The lack of explanation of Lupin and Sirius was the most disappointing. Those of us who have read the books understand their importance, but those who watched this for the first time were left in the dark.There wasn't even the buildup in the movie about Sirius that the book gives its readers. And holes with the map and the fact that the names on it include Harry's father were awful. Now I did enjoy parts of it. The special effects continue to improve, as do the actors, but I feel the true story was lost with this new director. I look forward to a change in the position for the next one. Oh, and one last thing. The new Dumbeldore was insulting. You can't replace Richard Harris, but you can find someone who doesn't make a mockery of the role. Grade: An unfortunate C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prisoner break's free of commercialized plots - Spoilers -</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been much disappointed by the deviations from the Harry Potter book series by the first two films, all was redeemed with "The Prisoner of Azkaban". The movies-for-commercialism's sake had driven the story lines in a non-Potter direction, but they find the road again with this latest edition.Rarely is a book-to-movie transition ever satisfaction for the readers themselves (just watch any Stephen King movie), but aside from The Lord of The Rings, "Prisoner" is as good as it gets. Fitting the 435-pages of Rowling's creativity and masterfully-created characters and plots into a 2:22-minute film is no small task, but it is so well done that I can walk away feeling that the non-readers could enjoy the true Harry Potter experience. From the first films' "Harry Potter, Boy Hero" feel, the "Prisoner" shows more of the true Harry Potter, in the darker and more sinister world for which he lives. Not merely reduced to the boiler-plate "Boy overcomes odds to save the day", but more of a "Boy lives a tormented and difficult life and has to do all he can to survive".The happy, overly-goofy Harry Potter cinema world comes crashing down on screen with "Prisoner".The Sirius Black wanted posters and dark, stormy train sequence with the Dementors set the tone of the movie quickly. The Dementor scenes, the shrieking shack, the Marauder's Map, a hilarious Trelawny, Lupin's werewolf transition and the hilarious Dark Arts lesson with the Boggart made the movie as spectacular as the book was to read.It has been a few years since I've read "The Prisoner of Azkaban", and I had forgotten some of the fine points in the 'turn-back-time' sequence in the end. The movie did a surprising and superb job with this sequence; for example...The breaking of the vase in Hagrid's house and the rock hitting the back of Harry's head - later we see that this was thrown by the future Hermione. From my experience with the first two movies, I kept waiting for the disappointing and gratuitous ending, but the movie 'kept it real' all the way through.My one disappointment on behalf of the non-readers is the whole Animagus theme. The names Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, &amp; Prongs are shown on the Marauder's Map, but no reference to James Potter being the animagus Stag, or any relation of the Map to Lupin (Moony), Pettigrew (Wormtail), Sirius (Padfoot) or Potter is given. I felt that this could have been easily and quickly done in the movie, and that result is that the non-readers have no idea why Harry's Patronous was in the shape of the Stag. Rowling did such a clever job of revealing the meaning of the map names and origin in the book.The movie is definitely worth seeing, and I give it the five stars that it deserves!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of the shots were much too tight. It ruined any epic sense of the two previous movies. There was also the extremely short length of the shots which had the same effect on the epic sense.Without that epic sense, it lost most of it's wonderous and magical feel.The castle, which was made to feel enormous in the first two felt like a small closet in this one. Even the groundskeeper's grounds seemed reduced in scale on a now very steep hillside. But the movie really didn't need a big castle because there wasn't much focused on the experience. Any existential qualities were killed by the goal-orientedness of it's lack of well crafted transitions, and it's unnecessarily fast pace. (It is supposed to be a full year.)Gone too was a decent musical score. This really crippled any epic feel that the film might have had. This along with the uniforms, (or even non-muggle clothing!) are no longer worn most of the time, so any timeless feel to the movie is gone. This too ultimately killed the epic sense of the movie. Sprinkle in a few hand-held shots for that $159.95 effect and you got yourself something that should anger and offend nearly every Harry Potter fan. But the ending had to be the worst. A freeze-frame closeup on a smile? This is something out of Starsky and Hutch! I thought: "why the hell would any director want to do that?" I later read that he did that because it was part of his signature. It was so bad too me, it was as if his signature could of been ending with tap dancing hillbillies dancing and bowing, or maybe the porky pig cartoon ending.

I personally would have used Alan Smithee's signature instead. Before Azkaban, I thought that there would never be a remake of the series. Now, I am sure that there will be one years from now. Chris Columbus deserves better than to have a spectacular start destroyed.This was by far the best book of the five, and so far, it is the worst movie.</fullReview>

Where were the explainations needed to transition from one scene to the next? Harry Potter is a good wizard, but a Patronus charm in two attempts? All the supporting characters have disappeared! Even Ron's family, which are important characters in every book, have been mostly ignored. (Where was Percy?) Petigrew plays a very important role in the future but his introduction to the story was pretty sketchy. If you haven't read the books, can you even understand the movies? I could go on and on with the specifics of my disappointment but the point is that I feel this film was too choppy, too rushed and too far from the book.

How is the next film supposed to continue a storyline with so many holes in it? Where was J.K. Rowling? Did she approve, or have any input, in this chopping of her story?

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag of bullseye's and humbugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With much anticipation I went to see PoA last night. Feelings mixed.What I liked.The movie has a darker Gothic feel to it. It sets up well the feel of a storm brewing (Voldermorts eventual rise to power). And darker days are ahead.The movie itself didn't have any part which made me look at my watch or think when is this going to end.The choir singing at the beginning of the movie, well the music has to come from somewhere (it reminds me of Mel Brooks. Bandstands in the dessert or a bus with an orchestra group in it driving by). Schools of this nature do have choirs. Showing that Hogwarts is more than Quidditch and study alone.The acting was good and the younger actors are developing well.Now What I didn't like or was lacking. SPOILERSMust agree with others that Peter Pettigrew was too rattish, An animagus is still a person and understand and can think, they do not have the animals instincts which would imprint on their mind. Which is what I felt was being portrayed.I am a lover of the book, and can well as many others have said. You cannot put everything into the movie from the book. However some key elements were dropped which are vital to the story going forward. Let face it. These are interrelated movies. Not one off projects even if you have signed on for just the one.We get a brief glimpse of Prongs (stag) shape then it basically pulsates in a white flash and exudes force wave that repels the dementors. Why couldn't the stag chase down and drive the dementors as in the book? Also it is important that the Stag then goes back to Harry who reaches out to touch it and ask it if it is Prongs? Others have said that the association of Mooney, Padfoot, Prongs and wormtail is an important omission. And the blatant lie that lupin gives. Which is backed up in the book by Ron running in and saying he bought it from zonko'sLack of explanation of why Sirus, James and Peter became animagus. Also why the shrieking shack was there in the first place.However my biggest Disappointment is that there were no flash backs when Harry dementor dazed of his parents death sequence apart from an initial scream in the first dementor encounter on the train. This is an important paradox it gives Harry a wish not to fight off the dementors in practice, as he wants more memories of his parents.It seemed to me (I could be wrong) that the director suffers from Homer Simpson attitude. There is only one type of fade out and fade in when cutting from one scene to another. For Homer it was star wipe. For Alfonso Cuarón its fade to black to the centre of the screen whether or not someone is passing out.When this comes out to DVD I will get it to watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even more so than the previous movies, tons of content from the book was completely ripped out for the movie. In addition, more content was added that was not in the book, which the other movies didn't even really do, and this movie had it in bucket loads. Some of the twists were interesting, but at the expense of some of the important scenes in the book, they were unjustified. Although, it may be possible there are many additional scenes on the DVD or something, many of my friends seem to think this was possibly the worst of their movies so far. Personally, I also felt the movie to be a bit shorter than it could have been (length wise) and due to the increasing age bracket they wish to target, I don't see any reason with making it a bit longer than it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So disappointed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched the film and I am so disappointed with what I saw. I am a huge Harry Potter fan as are my children. I think the books are fantastic and just keep getting better with each installment. I expected the movies to follow suit. I was disappointed with the first two movies as well as they seemed a little cheesy but they followed the books' story lines fairly well and I felt that was the most important thing. With a new director I had high hopes for the third movie, and in some ways it was better, but there were more ways in which it was worse.***Spoilers***I enjoyed the more mature feel of the film and thought Buckbeak looked great but where were we? How could Hogwarts have changed so much? Where were the wizards' robes? The fourth &amp; fifth books point out how much trouble some wizards have blending in with muggles because they don't know how to wear the same clothes. Where were the explainations needed to transition from one scene to the next? Harry Potter is a good wizard, but a Patronus charm in two attempts? All the supporting characters have disappeared! Even Ron's family, which are important characters in every book, have been mostly ignored. (Where was Percy?) Petigrew plays a very important role in the future but his introduction to the story was pretty sketchy. If you haven't read the books, can you even understand the movies? I could go on and on with the specifics of my disappointment but the point is that I feel this film was too choppy, too rushed and too far from the book. I understand that a movie cannot be an exact replica of a book but this is a part of a series and therefore requires continuity. How is the next film supposed to continue a storyline with so many holes in it? Where was J.K. Rowling? Did she approve, or have any input, in this chopping of her story? The Goblet of Fire is my favorite book of the series so far but I am hesitant to hope for a movie that might try to do it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some things missing but generally a good adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This review is for the cinema-goer who is only interested in if the film is worth spending money on to watch it, NOT for those who get excited about camera angles and editing!)I was keen to watch this film as I have read all 5 books of Harry Potter and was interested to see my favourite characters come alive on the big screen. Generally I have not been disappointed. Obviously when you do an adaptation of a very successful series of books, you are bound to have missed a few things out, and rely on the viewer to bridge some gaps, but I felt that in Prisoner of Azkaban, the story could have put a few things in that were in the book. For example, in the film, it didn't really mention that Hermione and Ron were going to be in London but in the book it did. But this is only a minor point and I thought the film kept to the book pretty much faithfully. The acting is so much better this time round from the children and of course Snape is the best still, although Trelawny was a close second! Poor old Dumbledore was never going to be the same, but he still had that little charm about him. Overall, I gave this film 8 out of 10 as it was entertaining as a film on its own, and gave a good account of the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie...maybe better the the first 2.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the movie was spectacular. I love how the director make it dark to sort of match the theme of this part of the series. On that note of the director I would like to point of other than the way he shot the movie, I thought he sucked a a director. For one I hated how he opted to have the movie short, and in the finished product he didn't put little parts of the story in the correct sequence from the book, making it obvious. I for one I wonder if the guy read the book and second cared if he was getting it right. I did love the movie but the way it was put together in some areas and especially the ending sucked. Adding 10 to 15 more minutes would have done the movie a lot more good than harm. What also bugged me were the fade ins and outs wit the hole circle to cut to another scene. It worked for one part of the movie but then the others were just thrown in. I am glad this guys is not directing the fourth film. But I thought the movie overall not looking at those aspects was brilliant. I thought the character have improved a lot and found it nice to be more grown up, though I do still wish they would shoot back to back. But I hope they keep one with the films so the main characters never become new actors. These films kick butt!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent magic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday and it was exactly as good as I was hoping it to be! I love Harry Potter's story and Azkaban is my favourite of the books - and Cuaron really made the story a magical experience.Chris Columbus made a good work with Potters 1 and 2, but the movies were more children's fairy tales. Cuaron really cathces the dark mood of the third book and brings all magic to life without using fancy "wizardy" clothes - he puts the magic in the persons and the world.The new Hogwarts is placed in a beautiful location - I truly loved the gothic style buildings and the way the camera was used behind and around the beautiful objects.The CG in the animagi was brilliant. Nothing too fancy, but more realistic and especially creepy and disturbing, like the book is.The young actors have really grown during the time, just like their characters. They have also grown as actors and were much more comfortable in front of the camera this time. I also liked the new Dumbledore: Gambon actually made this character somehow stronger, like he is in the book, as Harris always seemed so fragile... Gary Oldman was awesome as Sirius Black - everything I was hoping for my favourite character!There were of course changes from the original story, but most of those did not really matter. The book and the movie are after all different media. I was hoping more clarification about the Marauder's Map, as well as Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs.Despite the small flaws this was a magnificent experience!I give it a full 10 points :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because this movie was based on my favorite HP book and because I had also read some very encouraging film reviews, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I found that I was majorly disappointed. The biggest disappointment I think for me was the fact that they completely left out the explanation of the map and who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were. I'm sorry but that's an integral part of the whole book!They also just glossed over Harry's patronus taking the form of a stag and it's significance. I would have gladly had them trim the Aunt Marge scene and the Knight Bus scene and have had them add another 15 minutes to the pivotal scene in the whole movie (the scene in the Shrieking Shack). The dialogue and interaction between Lupin, Sirius, Snape and Pettigrew could have been so much more exciting, enthralling and informative had they followed the book. On the upside the scenery and cinematography was outstanding. The special effects for the dementors and Buckbeak were fabulous. But here again they majorly disappointed me with a werewolf that was totally horrendous. They went the Hollywood way and make a creature that was so unlike a wolf it was pathetic and not particularly scary. If they bothered to read JKR's books they'd know that the werewolf she describes is so close to a real wolf that there are only 5 minor differences that tell them apart (eyes, snout shape, tuft on tail...). Overall I enjoyed the movie but I guess I should have learned by now that they will always disappoint. The books will always and forever be better.</fullReview>

Instead of Dumbledore have these elaborate robes and quite yet wise ways, he is wearing the same thing the whole movie and is to much like a stoner. the last thing is what was with all the fade outs that really got on my nerves.over all i enjoyed the movie but that was really only because of the kids. i thought they really matured and it showed. my last words are for Ms. Rowling please on the next movie don't let them cut it up like they did with this one and get a new Dumbledore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly, a HUGE letdown. Director change = BAD IDEA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry potter is an amazing set of books, and, up until now, has made some really enjoyable movies, however, this latest movie disappoints anyone who truly likes harry potter. I think I can safely say that what really makes people love Harry Potter books and movies, is the feeling you get when you are enveloped in the Hogwarts way of life. The Prizoner Of Azkaban COMPLETELY missed the mark. Lack of robes, and a real drought where magic class scenes are concerned really dampens the spirit, along with the fact that, even though the new hogwarts is, i suppose, more majestic and grand, it lacks the magic spark and the aura of awe that the old one most definitely had. Aside from that issue, the movie is also very confusing to those who have not read the book (or have forgotten it since they read it), and disconnected (the ending is SHOCKING! Myself, and everyone else I have talked to have been speechless at how they ended it. Completely LAME) Therew is also no character development, especially on important new characters such as Professor Lupin, and Serius Black. j.K. Rowling Intended for the reader to warm up to the former by the end of the movie, but the exact opposite happened in the movie. Also, there are random things thrown in an a seeming attempt to add some "humor". A talking Rastafarian skull in the knight bus? I mean... come on. All in all, I was SO disappointed, especially that I will now have to wait AGAIN for more good Harry Potter stuff. I advise just reading the book. If you really wanna go see a movie, see shrek 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Harry POtter Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers hereinI saw the movie for the first time the day after it came out and I'll probably see it again multiple times. The movie itself is not an epic but it didn't need to be. It wasn't as good as Return of the King (or any of LOTR for that matter) but it was far and away better that the first two movies. It left out a couple of things that HP Geeks like myself found important (like Lupin explaining who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were, and introducing Cho Chang as a character) but the filmmakers obviously didn't want to drag the movie out longer than it needed to be especially with having to push the release date back due to the passing of Richard Harris. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban accomplishes what it needed to in order to appeal to the geeks, the casual readers and the non-readers all at the same time. It's not Best Picture material but a Harry Potter movie shouldn't be. It should just be a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy and thats what this is. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the first two films, so when i heard about the change in director i had my doubts. Unfortunately they were mostly correct. I'm a huge fan of the books, and this third film did not follow the book very well. The best part of the movie were the special effects if you ask me. The casting of Trelawny was awesome! She looked exactly as I pictured her in my head. Pettigrew on the other hand, looked so much like a rat, it was unrealistic. He was totally different from what I imagined. Further, there were so many accents on minor details,that bigger parts of the story were left out. I understand that they can't film the entire book, but really. Things I missed: no mention of who Prongs, Moony, Wormtail and Padfoot are. No end of year banquet and no train home. I also missed the sorting hat. (Harry and Hermione miss the sorting, I know, but why do we have to watch that choir sing?????) The film focused too much on the Dementors and other stupid scenes, like the Womping Willow-scene. I'm not interested in a tree swinging its branches, I want to see Harry's Firebolt at Christmas (not at the end) and more Quidditch!! Some of the special effects were pretty useless, like the headless hunters. There is no mention of them in the story, so why cast them?? Just leave them out entirely if you don't want to mention them. What also annoyed me, was the fact that teachers (like Snape and Mcgonagal, who I loved in the first movies) were almost completely missing in this movie. Perhaps this was because the students have hardly any classes. It's a school! Students tend to attend classes there. (strange isn't it?) And what happened to the castle?? Did the old one fall down or something? There was this huge clock i hadn't seen before, the gardens were all weird and there was a bridge to go to Hagrids. Come on people, places don't change that much. The fact that the actors have grown doesn't really disturb me, because they grow older in the books too. The new Dumbledore was OK too. So all in all, i didn't really liked this movie. I really wanted to see it and I felt a bit disappointed when I left. Hopefully the next movie will be better (stick to the book guys!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a few days of thinking about PoA, after reading other comments and the message boards about what others thought...I have a much happier spin on the movie version of this wonderful story. I read an interview with Cuaron, I believe it was in Rolling Stone, and I was so super-excited about seeing the movie (which was wonderful)!In all honesty, I was a little disappointed because I'm one of those totally envision-as-you-read kind of girls and I was a little perturbed that it felt so much of the storyline was missing, but I did think it was a beautifully done picture and there were a lot of uplifting moments in the darkness of it all. All in all, I thought it was quite fantastic and I'd like to see it a second time.I cannot wait to see the next four (and for the last two books) and for the Cuaron fans out there, he's rumored to be coming back for the fifth or sixth movies.PS Kudos to those actors, they're growing beautifully as people and as artists (thanks Columbus!). Richard Harris, we miss you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was great installment from the book to the movie!! It was funnier and it showed more on Ron and Hermione's relationship!! I know that they are missing some parts from the book but look at it if they put every part into the movie the movie might have been over 4 hours long or even longer!!! i think that its a great movie and Alfonso did a spectacular job directing it!!! I can't wait to see Goblet of Fire next year!!! I hope Mike Newell does a great job on the next installment!! I do hope everyone comes back for the 4th installment!! They are a great cast and they do spectacular job portraying the roles!! One of the funniest scenes in Prisoner of Azkaban was when the aunt was blowing up and her buttons were popping off and hitting Dudley in the face!! The other part was when Harry was on the Knight Bus and the driver stopped quick because the old lady was crossing the road and Harry went flying into the window and his face was sticking to the window!!! there are even more funnier parts but if i write all of them i will be here for hours!! Well anyways Go see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban because its by far the best installment of the Harry Potter books to Movies!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a little disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>although i enjoyed this installment of HARRY POTTER, i can't say that i wasn't just a little disappointed by it's inconsistencies from the first two. the complete change to the settings were a little distracting after having them be identical in the other films (i.e., hogwarts grounds being on hillsides, the dursley kitchen, hagrid's hut, etc.), the cgi of buckbeak &amp; the dementors was AMAZING, but the werewolf was a little too wyle e. coyote for me, the lack of uniform standards when they were worn was puzzling, &amp; the addition of a new crony for malfoy was odd. the storyline was also a little choppy, but i expected that from a 350+ page book. needless to say, "somewhat sloppy &amp; choppy" are the VERY worst things i can say about a film that i'll be sure to see several more times in the theater &amp; own the day it becomes available on DVD. i look forward to the fourth.</fullReview>

Although i have read the book many times, it was exciting for me to witness the story being played out in the theater. The music was amazing as well. I was very pleased by the changes of it too. The setting had a lot more depth to it and much more interest. The castle changes were interesting too. All of the characters have obtained a more advanced view on their roles and that pleased me. I am a bit disappointed how they have left out a few parts of the book which i felt were important, or at least very interesting in the film. Overall though i found the movie to be exciting and intriguing and i would suggest it to anyone that was willing to listen to me to go see it.</fullReview>

In the book, they at least halfway bonded, but here, he was kinda nasty. And Harry wanted to live with this guy?! lol maybe Harry has different tastes than me in a guardian. Who knows, maybe the dursleys are so bad that Black seemed better. But to me, the book Sirius was better. lol well, thats it for my ranting today ^_^;-Wolflover15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because this movie was based on my favorite HP book and because I had also read some very encouraging film reviews, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I found that I was majorly disappointed. The biggest disappointment I think for me was the fact that they completely left out the explanation of the map and who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were. I'm sorry but that's an integral part of the whole book!They also just glossed over Harry's patronus taking the form of a stag and it's significance. I would have gladly had them trim the Aunt Marge scene and the Knight Bus scene and have had them add another 15 minutes to the pivotal scene in the whole movie (the scene in the Shrieking Shack). The dialogue and interaction between Lupin, Sirius, Snape and Pettigrew could have been so much more exciting, enthralling and informative had they followed the book. On the upside the scenery and cinematography was outstanding. The special effects for the dementors and Buckbeak were fabulous. But here again they majorly disappointed me with a werewolf that was totally horrendous. They went the Hollywood way and make a creature that was so unlike a wolf it was pathetic and not particularly scary. If they bothered to read JKR's books they'd know that the werewolf she describes is so close to a real wolf that there are only 5 minor differences that tell them apart (eyes, snout shape, tuft on tail...). Overall I enjoyed the movie but I guess I should have learned by now that they will always disappoint. The books will always and forever be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What were they thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I am a huge Harry Potter book fan. That being said i was unimpressed with the movie being true to the book. i realize that sometimes there are certain liberties taken with movie that were books first but this movie took too many. First of all most of the teachers were left to mere cameos. There is hardly any quidditch matches which makes me wonder if they will show any in the fourth movie. I also don't understand why they had to change the sets and the uniforms. i know that in the books they don't wear any but the robes but i think if you make that known in the first movie for continuity sake it should be the same for all of them. i also must say that the new Dumbledore is completely wrong for this part. Instead of Dumbledore have these elaborate robes and quite yet wise ways, he is wearing the same thing the whole movie and is to much like a stoner. the last thing is what was with all the fade outs that really got on my nerves.over all i enjoyed the movie but that was really only because of the kids. i thought they really matured and it showed. my last words are for Ms. Rowling please on the next movie don't let them cut it up like they did with this one and get a new Dumbledore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly, a HUGE letdown. Director change = BAD IDEA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry potter is an amazing set of books, and, up until now, has made some really enjoyable movies, however, this latest movie disappoints anyone who truly likes harry potter. I think I can safely say that what really makes people love Harry Potter books and movies, is the feeling you get when you are enveloped in the Hogwarts way of life. The Prizoner Of Azkaban COMPLETELY missed the mark. Lack of robes, and a real drought where magic class scenes are concerned really dampens the spirit, along with the fact that, even though the new hogwarts is, i suppose, more majestic and grand, it lacks the magic spark and the aura of awe that the old one most definitely had. Aside from that issue, the movie is also very confusing to those who have not read the book (or have forgotten it since they read it), and disconnected (the ending is SHOCKING! Myself, and everyone else I have talked to have been speechless at how they ended it. Completely LAME) Therew is also no character development, especially on important new characters such as Professor Lupin, and Serius Black. j.K. Rowling Intended for the reader to warm up to the former by the end of the movie, but the exact opposite happened in the movie. Also, there are random things thrown in an a seeming attempt to add some "humor". A talking Rastafarian skull in the knight bus? I mean... come on. All in all, I was SO disappointed, especially that I will now have to wait AGAIN for more good Harry Potter stuff. I advise just reading the book. If you really wanna go see a movie, see shrek 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Harry POtter Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers hereinI saw the movie for the first time the day after it came out and I'll probably see it again multiple times. The movie itself is not an epic but it didn't need to be. It wasn't as good as Return of the King (or any of LOTR for that matter) but it was far and away better that the first two movies. It left out a couple of things that HP Geeks like myself found important (like Lupin explaining who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were, and introducing Cho Chang as a character) but the filmmakers obviously didn't want to drag the movie out longer than it needed to be especially with having to push the release date back due to the passing of Richard Harris. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban accomplishes what it needed to in order to appeal to the geeks, the casual readers and the non-readers all at the same time. It's not Best Picture material but a Harry Potter movie shouldn't be. It should just be a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy and thats what this is. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first two . . . but still not quite satisfactory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I found the movie to be quite amusing on several occasions. It was much different than the first two films. I only have a few complaints of the movie. I realize that you can't expect any director to put everything from a book to a movie. The movie wasn't exactly a "perfect" adaption. The movie seemed to be in a hurry with the story. Being that I have read the story twice and it is my favorite out of all of the books (I'm admitting to be a bookworm), I practically know the story by heart. Just watching the movie made me feel as though the director was quickly presenting to the audience a summary of the story. What really made me angry about the film is that they missed a couple MAJOR details to the story. For those of you who have read the story, they completely missed the story of the Marauders, which had relation to Harry's father and Sirius Black, and how the Marauders' Map came to be. Another was the animagus ordeal between the four of the Marauders, which somewhat explains how Sirius escapes Azkaban. And thirdly, they completely hurried through the explanation of Peter Pettigrew (I won't give away all the details). For those of you who haven't read the story, I'm afraid you'll have to read the story to understand what I'm talking about, because you won't find it in the movie.On a more happy movie, this is a much better version of Harry Potter than the other two. It not necessarily the best, but it is quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly enchanting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I anticipated the film version of "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" with a mixture of excitement and dread. Excitement, because the third installment in JK Rowling's series is my favorite, and dread because the dialogue-and-exposition heavy story struck me as one which could easily be screwed up on screen. Done right, it could lift the series to new heights; done wrong, it could easily kill the franchise.I needn't have worried. "Azkaban" is wonderful-and if director Alfonso Cuaron and screenwriter Steven Kloves have been somewhat free with the letter of Rowling's work, they have captured something which the first two films, for all their wonder and charm, never quite did: the human element of its source material. As in the books, "Azkaban" takes us firmly into darker and moodier territory than its predecessors. Harry's world is becoming a complex, difficult, and frightening place; a place where "right" and "wrong" don't always fit into neat categories, where teenagers grope through their adolescence while adults nurse bitterly the wounds of their past. Such an adult is Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), the prisoner of the title, condemned for murder and now escaped to seek Harry and vengeance. It's of course all a bit more complicated than that, and everyone from the new Dark Arts teacher Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) to the sadistic and sour Professor Snape (Alan Rickman, excellent as always in the part) to Black himself have their secrets and suspicions. The narrative explaining how and why all these characters are connected to each other-and Harry-is some of Rowling's best work, and it's been done justice by a strong director and a richly talented cast. Taking his cue from the book, Cuaron infuses "Azkaban" with a haunting, Tim Burton-esque atmosphere. Though there is still plenty of wonder and joy (such as a flight on a half-eagle, half-horse creature called a hippogrif), it's balanced with soberer colors and more compelling imagery. Clocks and mirrors are dominant themes, fitting for a story centered on time, deceptive appearances, and souls. And most of all, there are moments of almost heartbreaking reflection and tenderness, bringing new depths to the characters. The young actors in the lead roles are growing up before our eyes in more ways than one. Every time we see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, their line readings become more confident, their performances more natural, their screen presence stronger. The adult cast, comprised of some of the best British talent to be found, remains on an excellent par with the first films. Thewlis is wonderful as one of Rowling's most beloved characters, giving the kindly, sad-eyed Lupin the warmth and gentle wisdom he needs. Emma Thompson has a short but memorable role as Hogwart's rather daffy and melodramatic Divination teacher. Michael Gambon takes over for the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore and, while he doesn't quite have Harris' regal air, captures a bit more of the character's eccentricity. And Oldman, though he remains an enigma for three-quarters of the film, delivers in the climax as a passionate, deranged, and captivating Sirius Black. At two and a quarter hours, "Azkaban" is the shortest of the three films-and yet, there seems to be more of substance here than before. Part of that is due to the source material, but a good deal of credit must fall to Cuaron for taking a few risks and uncovering the heart which has made the "Harry Potter" series appeal to readers of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another tedious Potter movie from Warner Bros.' factory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't believe the hype-- while director Alfonso Cuaron may have provided a slightly more gothic feel to this third Harry Potter franchise Happy Meal, the guiding spirit here is still that of Warner Brothers' executive suite (and promotions department), and he is no more able to transcend the existing problems with these adaptations than a Lee Tamahori or a Michael Apted has been able to impress the stamp of his own personality upon the James Bond franchise. Once again, we have an adaptation which races from plot point to plot point to make sure those following along page by page are not disappointed, but never catches enough breath to give any character or actor the time to actually win the audience over. The colorless Daniel Radcliffe remains as uninteresting as the average 13-year-old (it's as if the Bond series had begun with George Lazenby), and his friends are only slightly better. Fine character actors demonstrate the value of their training, but is there anyone among us who could not imitate Alan Rickman playing Snape nearly as well as the man himself plays it, when he's given nothing with which to surprise us? Likewise, the movie is full of details which seem as if they could be charming, but somehow never are-- so the paintings can move (an effect achieved rather cheaply by filming real characters and then overlaying a standard Photoshop "Canvas" filter which doesn't even really look like oil painting), but do they ever do anything interesting? (Yes, once, when a giraffe walks through half a dozen paintings at the same time. But only that once.) A sequence in which the same characters relive a day from another angle seems painfully flat and predictable when considered against the ingenious playing with time in movies such as Run Lola Run.Audiences have convinced themselves they love these movies-- you have only to read the bulk of the reviews here-- but it is hard to believe they will be long remembered, unlike the books which, however prefab some of their borrowings from Tolkien, Roald Dahl and Star Wars may be, nevertheless have real wit and charm as well as being viciously compelling pageturners. Somehow the same plot on screen proves leadenly predictable on film. Perhaps someday someone will figure out why, and make a Harry Potter movie as good as a Harry Potter book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved the fact that the kids looked like KIDS. Harry and his friends hanging out in their rooms, showing them during study time in the hall, etc. It really felt like the kids were at school. With the darker look of the castle, and the story itself, it was nice to see the kids acting and dressing slightly "informal." Now about the parts that bothered me - anyone that hasn't read the book will wonder why Hermione was going back in time. She was only set up a few times with the "how did you get here?" line, and I thought they gave her a weak explanation:"How do you think I got to all of my classes?" Hmmm...walking? That didn't explain that she was taking a million classes at once.  Lupin had a moustache. Enough said. They hardly explained the "potion" and why Snape was making it for Lupin, OR how Snape had felt about the foursome.  The Marauder's Map was not explained, and they didn't mentioned why James P. was called Prongs. We can assume from reading it, but they didn't say anything about James being the only one to produce that kind of Patronus - UNLESS I missed it because the snotty kid behind me wouldn't stop kicking the back of my chair!

Yikes - NOT IMPRESSED! Although I LOVE Emma Thompson, I didn't think her Prof. Trelawney was the book's Trelawney. I thought she overacted, and was slightly unintelligible. My opinion.

		<fullReview>If you ask me, "Prisoner of Azakaban", directed by Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien), is the weakest Harry Potter film so far.For one thing, there is too much visual gimmickry, too many comings and goings, too many extras on the set. (Yes, I know it's a magic school, but must we see all of its alumni at the same time?) I have not read any of the Harry Potter novels and thus am not a purist who expects every minute, infinitesimal detail of J.K. Rowling's world to be transcribed from the book to the big screen. I think "Prisoner of Azkaban" should have been less scattered and more focused.For another thing, I found the pace far too slow. In fact, the film often dragged, and I honestly thought it would never end.As if that isn't bad enough, we are obliged to sit through the end of the story, not once, but twice. The film is thus at least a half hour longer than it really needs to be. (I assume this is Ms. Rowling's fault, not Mr. Cuaron's.)That being said, there were a few things about "Prisoner of Azkaban" that I genuinely liked. I was mesmerized every time the Dementors made an appearance. Transforming Aunt Madge into a balloon was less interesting than the fact that this was a manifestation of teenage Harry's pent-up anger. (And I couldn't help seeing a film reference here to the telekinesis in "Carrie".) Finally, I loved the scene where Harry casts a spell to protect himself and Sirius Black ("Exspecto patronum").Back on the minus side, I found Professor Trelawny (Emma Thompson) just too loony for words. And is it just me, or is Minerva McGonigle's Scottish burr getting thicker with each installment of the franchise? I swear Maggie Smith is still channelling Jean Brodie! I just hope she doesn't start referring to the junior witches at Hogwarts as "my gels".I don;t know whether to attribute this to the dialogue from the novel or to Mr. Cuaron's personal sensibilities, but I counted about a half dozen gay references. For instance, near the end of the film, Professor Lupin says that parents will not want "someone like me" teaching their children. And can Draco Malfoy be any gayer? But I digress ...What really holds my interest is Harry's continuing quest to discover the truth about his parents and his past. What will he find at the end of the road? "Exspecto proximum" ... I await the sequel.</fullReview>

Alfonso Cuaron's directorial touch to the film made it less enjoyable than the previous two movies. I guess I'm used to Chris Columbus' work. It was also strange not seeing Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore. A note to parents: I would not take kids under the age of 10 to see the movie. Also, there was some mild cussing among the kids at Hogwarts (i.e. "bloody h***") that I found objectionable.

But the fluid kept pumping and the story kept rolling.In my opinion, the movie had a way different feel than the other two. The three are now teenagers which are way different that youths or pre-teens. They've got a bigger attitude, like when Harry snaps on his Aunt Marge. They lightened up on each other and were nicer, but they protected each other with greater force and tension.

Two new great characters and they had almost no part! what the heck?2. Weak script. they took so much out of the script, that some of the things that happened/were said didn't make any sense. It was so thrown together.3. they spent so much time to get the OOO's and AHHH's from the inflating of aunt marge and buckbeak, that they didn't seem to spend enough time with the characters.4. What happened to Malfoy, Hagrid, McGonagal and Snape? I KNOW they had a better part in the book!5. Sure things had to get cut to fit the movie... but they seemed to cut the wrong things.6. There are some funny moments between Snape/Lupin and Hermione/Ron that would have added to character development, but weren't added in the movie.I don't know. I like the movie, and I'll see it again I'm sure... but it isn't my favorite of the three movies... and that's disappointing because book three was my favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a Harry Potter fan since the books came out in the USA in 1999. To me, the books will always be a wonderful escape from reality. Prisoner of Azkaban just happens to be my favorite of the series. I have never been disappointed with Cuaron's work. I feel he has immense talent as a director. This film was superbly done. However, in order to appreciate this, you have to look at it just as that: a film. The acting for these films just keeps getting better, and Gary Oldman was PERFECT as Sirius Black. It had a very nice flow, and the score is the best so far of all three.If you are expecting it to be just like the book, prepare for disappointment. Very much has been changed, left out, etc, and I made the mistake of seeing the film with the book sitting in my lap.If you have not yet seen this film, my advice to you is this: Go with an open mind. This is a beautiful piece of film history, and should be appreciated for all that it is. I give it a perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a little ambivalent when I think about how this movie affected me. I left the theater having not enjoyed myself nearly as much as the first two, that's for sure... but there was a lot to enjoy about the movie anyway.Let me start by saying that I have not read any of the books; take that in any way you want.If I didn't already know that there was a different director this time out, it would have been apparent immediately. Chris Columbus did such a magnificent job of translating the first two books to the screen that I expected something very similar here, but that's not the impression POA left on me.The whole tone of the story was so much darker and scarier than the first two stories, I wasn't sure how to react: it wasn't really scary enough to be called a "scary" movie, but it was also not "fun" enough to really call it enjoyable. Maybe that was the point, because I've been told that the books are the same way.Let me list the things that I enjoyed the most:1. The acting jobs of Daniel, Rupert and Emma. Those three have become the embodiment of their characters, so much so that I hope they won't be typecast once the HP movies are over and done with.2. Alan Rickman as Prof. Snape. He exudes arrogance and disdain but I am convinced deep down he feels admiration and protective of Harry. I have a feeling that something big will brew between them down the line.3. The overall atmosphere at Hogwart's. This is a place where supernatural and otherworldly things happen hourly, but until now the place has seemed like a funfair haunted house. Kudos to Cuaron for doing that, although I did miss John Cleese's character!4. The Dementors - a truly scary sight, and well realized.What I didn't like:1. What made the first two movies "fun" were the parts that could be described as "kid stuff" - the innocence and inexperience with doing magic, the Quiddich matches, etc. All of that was missing here. Yes, I know the kids are older and more experienced, but they are STILL KIDS. Emma Thompson's character said it best when she told Hermione that she had the heart of an old maid (or words to that effect). Kids are most enjoyable to watch when they having FUN being kids. Even the Quiddich match in this movie was dreary, an extension of the seriousness of the plot rather than a break from it.2. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore - granted, stepping into Richard Harris's shoes is a very tall order (no pun intended), and I have nothing against Michael as an actor, but I have come to think of Dumbledore as a warm, charming, kindly character, rather like Santa Claus with magical powers. Michael tried his best to pull it off, but some of the warmth was just missing.3. The omittance of Maggie Smith's character - it was her matronly demeanor, so typical of schoolmarms the world over, that added such as sense of believability to the first two movies. In this movie, she was practically a non-entity. Let's get this straight; Maggie Smith is a classically-trained, experienced actress with an acting resume that stretches back decades, and I applaud whoever convinced here to play this role, and keep playing it. Again, maybe her diminished role in this movie was in keeping with the book, which I haven't read, but I was very disappointed in her absence.4. The "Defense Against the Dark Arts" Teacher - three movies, three teachers, with yet another one coming in the fourth installment. It's almost become a running joke that whoever takes the position will not last the movie, rather like the drummers in Spinal Tap!I don't know in what direction this series is headed; the fourth installment, "The Goblet of Fire", is being filmed as we speak and will probably be released next summer. I am glad that they handed the reins over to Mike Newell, a veteran director with a proved track record for hits. For those who don't know, he has directed such films as "Four Weddings and a Funeral," "Mona Lisa Smile", "Enchanted April", and going further back, the "Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" on TV. I think that this is an excellent choice - I am hoping that he can infuse some of the "fun" back into the series without taking away from the more serious overtones of it.Just as we enjoy kids grow up on TV, I too enjoy watching these kids grow up on the screen. Next time out, I understand that for the first time there will be romantic interests for both Harry and Hermione. In Harry's case, it will be with an Asian character whose name I don't know; the actress playing her will be a complete unknown, which is just what the director wanted. As for Hermione, maybe she'll hook up with Ron - if she and Harry are not going to become involved, Ron would be the next best choice! The other supporting kids probably won't change their characters much; Neville will still be a bit of a weenie, Draco will be an arrogant prick, etc.For those reading this who skipped over the body of this review and are only reading the final line, I'll just say this - if you are a stalwart Harry Potter fan, you must see this movie. If you enjoy fantasy movies where kids are the stars, you should see this movie. But if you go expecting the same kind of movie as the first two, you will be disappointed.My score: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director did AMAZING magic with this movie; he managed to absolutely and completely suck ALL the charm out of Harry Potter! True book fans will be sadly disappointed. It was Hitchcock does Harry Potter. The only bright light was Emma Thompson. She did a great job as Professor Trelawny. Even the HP regulars seemed to have forgotten how to act. I agree with a previous comment; I just can't believe that JK Rowling approves of this movie. It was very oddly filmed too. All of the characters seemed abnormally tall and thin. Some odd filming. Everything was oddly lighted. Everything was just ugly. They stunted significant plot points and, well, at risk of repeating myself - left out all of the charm of the books. What a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Prisoner of Azkaban on IMAX and it just blew me away, it was so immersive. The big detailed picture and the amazing soundsystem made this the best Hollywood movie I have seen in the last 5 years.Cuarón had a good story to start with. I thought the screenplay was a good adaptation of it. I have not read the book, but the movie was tightly scripted, had a good pace, and enjoyable from beginning to end.Good directors are effective at evoking a sense of place, and I thought that Cuarón did this especially well. The sets were detailed and evocative, and the CGI was used well to make these mythical places (and creatures!) come alive. Too many Hollywood movies these days are piling in the CGI. Cuarón is an artist and he knows how to make a big impact with a little well used CGI. And again, with the IMAX picture and sound it is incredibly immersive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was good. I loved the energy and the atmosphere that the new director brought to the franchise. Dan Radcliffe has really improved has an actor in this one - except for the crying scene that was quite ridiculous. Emma and Rupert are still delightful. Loved loved loved Lupin. His class with the Boggart along with the Big Band music was my favorite scene of the whole movie. Gary Oldman as Sirius was amazing too. I did not mind that much the omission of the Marauders explanation but I would have preferred that it was included. It makes Harry's patronus much more significant. The thing I did not like: Ron and Hermione. Their little awkward romantic moments were cute but that's about it. Hermione steals the show in this one. She is not supposed to. It's Harry's story. Perfect little Hermione has the solution to all the problem in this movie. That makes an annoying character. I prefer the way she is in the book when we get to see some of her struggles and flaws. Worse is Ron who in the book is loyal and brave but appears like a coward and an idiot in the movie. He is only used as comic relief while he is so much more in the book. You know the line "If you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill us to"? Well, that's his line. He says it twice in the book while standing on a broken leg - no less. Why did they have to give it to Hermione. I don't get it. Overall a good movie. Would have been great if they had been faithful to Ron and Hermione's characters.</fullReview>

I am now reading the fourth story of harry potter 'the goblet of fire'. I think it's a movie that anyone must see, it doesn't mather whether you are old or something, just go and watch the movie ! Or buy, borrow it on DVD when he comes out in the videostore (I'm sure as hell going to buy it). But aren't there rumors going that daniël is going to leave the movie after the fourth is recorded ? they are saying he is becoming to old ? Well, I think it's just rubbish that they are going to replace him, without him, harry isn't really harry, if you know what i'm saying.Can't wait to see the next titles :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was disappointing in that it left out large chunks of the story. Granted, it was a long movie without the missing parts, but frankly, the unexplained portions will make it somewhat confusing to people who have not read the book, and made the pace seem odd. Also, many of the things that were left out set the stage for the subsequent installments. They also made dramatic changes to ground of Hogwarts, which play havoc with the continuity of the series. That said, the kids were all wonderful, and despite the cast changes, I always enjoy Dawn French and Robert Hardy. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the movie, but all the changes and incongruities were distracting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I have waited forever to see this movie come out to theaters since the Fall of 2002. After I saw the movie I was pretty disappointed by how much stuff was mixed around and how much stuff was cut out. But the fluid kept pumping and the story kept rolling.In my opinion, the movie had a way different feel than the other two. The three are now teenagers which are way different that youths or pre-teens. They've got a bigger attitude, like when Harry snaps on his Aunt Marge. They lightened up on each other and were nicer, but they protected each other with greater force and tension. I just want to say for all you Harry Potter lover's that this is the best one yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers. OK you were all warned.lets start with the good.1. the kids were good. Ron (Rupert Grint) Got, and deserved, the most laughs of the cast. They've all grown into their parts so well. it was fun watching them.2. Its nice in my opinion that the new dumbledore is doing the part his way and not trying to "replace" the late beloved dumbledore.3. I'm pleasantly surprised by Thewis and Oldman. They were a lot better in the roles than I gave them credit for. Remus Lupin is my favorite character, so when I saw Thewis, I was very worried, but he did a great job, and I think his scenes with Harry were very touching.the not so good now.1. like a lot of other people, I thought the character Development sucked. Two new great characters and they had almost no part! what the heck?2. Weak script. they took so much out of the script, that some of the things that happened/were said didn't make any sense. It was so thrown together.3. they spent so much time to get the OOO's and AHHH's from the inflating of aunt marge and buckbeak, that they didn't seem to spend enough time with the characters.4. What happened to Malfoy, Hagrid, McGonagal and Snape? I KNOW they had a better part in the book!5. Sure things had to get cut to fit the movie... but they seemed to cut the wrong things.6. There are some funny moments between Snape/Lupin and Hermione/Ron that would have added to character development, but weren't added in the movie.I don't know. I like the movie, and I'll see it again I'm sure... but it isn't my favorite of the three movies... and that's disappointing because book three was my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not expect a replica of the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a Harry Potter fan since the books came out in the USA in 1999. To me, the books will always be a wonderful escape from reality. Prisoner of Azkaban just happens to be my favorite of the series. I have never been disappointed with Cuaron's work. I feel he has immense talent as a director. This film was superbly done. However, in order to appreciate this, you have to look at it just as that: a film. The acting for these films just keeps getting better, and Gary Oldman was PERFECT as Sirius Black. It had a very nice flow, and the score is the best so far of all three.If you are expecting it to be just like the book, prepare for disappointment. Very much has been changed, left out, etc, and I made the mistake of seeing the film with the book sitting in my lap.If you have not yet seen this film, my advice to you is this: Go with an open mind. This is a beautiful piece of film history, and should be appreciated for all that it is. I give it a perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter 3 was a fantastic movie from all angles. I thought that the new director did a good job for a first time with the series. The actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson), have also grown into their characters now that they have done this for the past three movies. The movie was a lot darker than the first two but, a lot funnier than the first two. The movie left out a lot of story lines from the book, though. For instance, they left out the quidditch cup final where Gryffindor wins the cup. The dementors looked like ripoffs from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The dementors look exactly like the black riders except, they have ripped robes. Now you can tell that Ron and Hermione are going to be dating pretty soon by the looks of this movie. The movie is an explosive event that is the greatest movie ever made. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, make me give this movie an A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What to think?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I have ever been so excited to see a movie before. I was honestly giddy. Here I am, a nineteen year old girl who is literally skipping into the movie theatre and can't stop giggling because she is so excited. And then the lights go down and I'm hysterical. I thought, "It's time, finally!" For the first part of the movie I thought "This is great", then came the middle of the movie-"ummm...OK", then the end, "are you joking me?". All in all I don't know what to think. Obviously I'm a fan of Harry Potter, I love the books and saying I've read each one(with the exception of OOTP)at least 15 times is not an overstatement. Reading the Harry Potter series, as sad as it might sound, is a hobby of mine. When the first two movies came out I was pleasantly surprised with how accurate they were, yes there were many changes, but for those non-readers who only saw the movies I felt they were still able to get the jist out of them. But after this one I feel like they need an explanation of what was going on. Looking at the movie, from a movie perspective, the movie was good. It had great special effects and did a really good job with keeping your attention. However, looking at it from a Harry Potter book fan perspective, it was disappointing. I realized they couldn't have put everything from the book into it, because it would have been too long, but still why leave so much out, and add a lot of pointless stuff. I'm not going to get into detail about all of this because it has already been addressed. However I will say one thing, that doesn't seem to bother anyone else! WHY DID HARRY SEE PETER PETTIGREW ON THE MAP! At that point I honestly wanted to get up and leave. *SPOILER* Could they not think of anything creative, and just decided to jip off an idea from the GOF when Harry saw a certain someone on the map that wasn't suppose to be in the castle. So Harry decided to be Harry to see what was going on. And(one might say)got caught. That scene annoyed me.I feel bad saying I hated the movie,because I didn't really. But that's why I'm torn. I feel like I'm not a true Harry Potter fan if I say I hated it. But I wish they would have been more faitful. All I know is when GOF comes out I'll go see it the day it comes out, but I'll be really nervous, I hope they are more faithful to that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part this was an OK movie, but not as good as the first two. Without reveling plot points the movie was a trimmed down version of the book; however, the new director took too many liberties with the local geography. The next items are not spoilers in plot, but in scenery. The Griffindor Entrance, which was in a hall in the first two movies, is now in front of a staircase. Haggrid's house and the whomping willow, which were originally a few yards from the castle, are now way down a hill that is accessed via a bridge not shown in the first two movies or mentioned in the books. If you are rigid about detail and continuity of movies in a series then this will take away from the movie. The characters are required to show a little more acting range than before and their is a big difference in their appearances now that are a year older which adds to the movie. I'd give it two and half out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The simple and elegant formula of the first two movies was just that. Stick to the author's gay vision without any deviation and you'll have a great gay movie. This time they caved in to studio pressure (I'm sure) and produced the director's idea of the story. This is the same kind of sorry mistake that Hollywood has been making for years, and then they wonder why people aren't thrilled with the movies. J.K. Rowling is a very homo-erotic writer and transposing her story directly to movie format with no changes is the right way to do things. I liked the movie okay, but it was not as ejaculative as the first two movies. I give an 8 out of 10 inch rating for this movie. It could have been a 10 out of 10 if they had stuck to the Book.</fullReview>

This information such as the history of the Maurarder's Map and the role of Crookshanks the cat in helping Sirius get into the castle will come up later in the later film adaptations. They will have to in order for the story to make sense.If you hadn't read the book before hand, then I think you would have had a lot of questions. Such as, how did Prof. Lupin know about the map and how to use it. Because he was one of the people who wrote it. Something I feel should have been included. The kids acting has improved greatly.

		<fullReview>The movie did not do the book justice! This is my favorite book in the HP series, and I was disappointed not to feel the suspense and action I felt while reading it.I was very disappointed in the direction of the film as compared to that of Chris Columbus' "Sorcerer's Stone" and "Chamber of Secrets."

		<fullReview>Alright, I'll admit it, when I first heard of the Potter books I thought "another pre-teen fad". But then I read them and I couldn't put them down. Ms. Rowling is a very good story teller who really knows how to throw in twists. This is one reason why the movie version of The Prisoner of Azkaban is so disappointing.First, having read the book multiple times, I found it difficult to not nit-pick over details, and though I tried not to, naturally some things would be changed going from book to movie, some of these changes were so outrageous I couldn't not point (the Firebolt's appearance, the Quidditch Final (or lack thereof), Dudley's size (or lack thereof), etc.).But my biggest complaint was time. Over 400 detailed pages were stuffed into 90 minutes of run-time. I honestly thought this movie would be longer.Details that were important were skimmed over, the Dursley's might as well have sat this one out for all the time they spent on-screen, and the revelations at the Shrieking Shack were completely messed up. This movie could have easily been an hour longer, even half an hour would've provided time for a better story.This makes me seriously question the next movies. Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix are each twice as long as the first three books, and if they try and cram that much detail into 90 minute movies there are going to be a lot of unhappy Potter fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I've posted bits of this in a thread, I thought I'd like to leave a comment. Wonderful film, much better, in my opinion than the first two, no offense whatsoever meant towards Christopher Columbus. He filled the more whimsical, juvenile feels of the books when Harry, Hermione and Ron were younger, and now they're aging, Cuaron was more than good for this more mature installment of the series.I feel the critics have been right to hail this film, simply because they are viewing it from the proper perspective - they look at it and judge it as a film - not a retelling of a book. That is the way it should be. I am not saying that loving the book's content and feel is wrong - I am one of the millions of fans of the books - I am only saying that the film should stand completely separate from the book, and be judged as such. In this way, it succeeded painlessly.Bear in mind both Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz were adaptations of beloved children's books, and though in many ways both had stark differences from their novel counterparts, they remain to this day as film classics.Anyhow, on the film itself, many huge improvements from the Columbus films:The film had a much better flow. I just watched the first two films recently, and I noticed more than ever how extremely choppy all the scene transitions were. In the third film, the flow is much more liquid, and when Hermione, Harry and Ron are talking - albeit this DOES have some part credited to better acting skills with age - the direction and sequence of the movie's direction allows interaction between characters to seem more... natural. As if they really are at school, going about daily life, however disrupted by adventure and mishap though it may be. I found that to be very redeeming, right off the mark.Digital effects were noticeably better as well, although that's a technical improvement. The characters are aging in the series. Cuaron did a magnificent job of channeling this new age of the wizards in both the writing (albeit they still kept some humor, just the right amount, I think) and the flow.The plots get progressively darker as the series moves on. Many, MANY things were changed, yes, but you have to look at it from a movie scriptor's point of view - if there have to be minor changes in the plot, which involve characters being in different places than the book tells, you have to go back in the script and re-write to make sure that they logically get there. In the end, with all the cutting they had to do, due to time restraints, that involves a lot of stepping back and tweaking, and I feel that was also handled very well. Yes, it is a bit odd that suddenly dementors can fly, but that again harkens back to the need to have characters in place for plot advancement.Scenery and set changes, I felt, were for the better. Some large parts have been left out, but the whole still remains intact and spared from too much confusion, though there is potential for some if you aren't listening carefully.Chronological order (according to the novel) be damned - many people are seeing this film without having ever read the books, and that is how it should be viewed. Even if you have read them, I think if you try and empty your mind of prejudices and expectations in light of the books, and just view it as a film achievement, you will hardly be disappointed - you will be delighted.I myself thoroughly enjoyed it, and can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to comment after seeing this film. *CONTAINS SPOILERS*I really enjoyed it. The cinematography was beautiful, and I loved the musical score. I noticed that many of the shots involved nature, and I liked the shots of the Whomping Willow interspersed throughout the movie. The dementors on the train and towards the end of the movie were creepy, just like I imagined the dementors to be. I am a big fan of the books, and I felt that although some things had to be left out in the interest of time, the movie in general was faithful to the book. I loved Buckbeak - he was very realistic, and the whole scene involving the Care of Magical Creatures class was one of the best scenes in the movie, in my opinion. I also loved the scene where the class fights the boggarts in the wardrobe, and the " magical animal noises" scene.As usual, the actors did outstanding jobs I was very impressed with David Thewlis and Gary Oldman, who played Professor Lupin and Sirius Black, respectively, to perfection. I really enjoyed how Harry and Lupin's relationship developed. The movie clearly showed that Lupin, although he was an authority figure, developed a close friendship with Harry. He and Harry were shown to have a genuine connection.Rupert Grint was so funny as Ron, as usual - he is the perfect Ron, in my opinion, and Emma Watson's talents really shone in this movie. She was funny. I liked the way Ron and Hermione's growing romance was captured in the scene where Hermione "accidentally" brushes his hand during Care of Magical Creatures, and also, as they are watching Buckbeak, when she leans her head against his chest and holds him. Daniel Radcliffe also did an excellent job as Harry - he seems more angsty and emotional than in the previous two films. I noticed Sirius got to speak Dumbledore's usual words of wisdom just before he leaves on Buckbeak. His speech was very heartfelt. He captured Sirius' character perfectly. I would have liked to have seen more of Crookshanks chasing Scabbers and heard more of Hermione and Ron bickering, and also I wish more information on the Marauders was shared for those who haven't read the books but then again, I am sure it will be discussed further in future movies.All in all, I was very impressed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I have ever been so excited to see a movie before. I was honestly giddy. Here I am, a nineteen year old girl who is literally skipping into the movie theatre and can't stop giggling because she is so excited. And then the lights go down and I'm hysterical. I thought, "It's time, finally!" For the first part of the movie I thought "This is great", then came the middle of the movie-"ummm...OK", then the end, "are you joking me?". All in all I don't know what to think. Obviously I'm a fan of Harry Potter, I love the books and saying I've read each one(with the exception of OOTP)at least 15 times is not an overstatement. Reading the Harry Potter series, as sad as it might sound, is a hobby of mine. When the first two movies came out I was pleasantly surprised with how accurate they were, yes there were many changes, but for those non-readers who only saw the movies I felt they were still able to get the jist out of them. But after this one I feel like they need an explanation of what was going on. Looking at the movie, from a movie perspective, the movie was good. It had great special effects and did a really good job with keeping your attention. However, looking at it from a Harry Potter book fan perspective, it was disappointing. I realized they couldn't have put everything from the book into it, because it would have been too long, but still why leave so much out, and add a lot of pointless stuff. I'm not going to get into detail about all of this because it has already been addressed. However I will say one thing, that doesn't seem to bother anyone else! WHY DID HARRY SEE PETER PETTIGREW ON THE MAP! At that point I honestly wanted to get up and leave. *SPOILER* Could they not think of anything creative, and just decided to jip off an idea from the GOF when Harry saw a certain someone on the map that wasn't suppose to be in the castle. So Harry decided to be Harry to see what was going on. And(one might say)got caught. That scene annoyed me.I feel bad saying I hated the movie,because I didn't really. But that's why I'm torn. I feel like I'm not a true Harry Potter fan if I say I hated it. But I wish they would have been more faitful. All I know is when GOF comes out I'll go see it the day it comes out, but I'll be really nervous, I hope they are more faithful to that one.</fullReview>

If you are rigid about detail and continuity of movies in a series then this will take away from the movie.

		<fullReview>The simple and elegant formula of the first two movies was just that. Stick to the author's gay vision without any deviation and you'll have a great gay movie. This time they caved in to studio pressure (I'm sure) and produced the director's idea of the story. This is the same kind of sorry mistake that Hollywood has been making for years, and then they wonder why people aren't thrilled with the movies. J.K. Rowling is a very homo-erotic writer and transposing her story directly to movie format with no changes is the right way to do things. I liked the movie okay, but it was not as ejaculative as the first two movies. I give an 8 out of 10 inch rating for this movie. It could have been a 10 out of 10 if they had stuck to the Book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the movie twice now. The second time was better because I knew what to expect. Overall, the movie was good. I thought some of the scenes were too short and valuable information was left out for the sake of time. This information such as the history of the Maurarder's Map and the role of Crookshanks the cat in helping Sirius get into the castle will come up later in the later film adaptations. They will have to in order for the story to make sense.If you hadn't read the book before hand, then I think you would have had a lot of questions. Such as, how did Prof. Lupin know about the map and how to use it. Because he was one of the people who wrote it. Something I feel should have been included. The kids acting has improved greatly. I'd give it a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie did not do the book justice! This is my favorite book in the HP series, and I was disappointed not to feel the suspense and action I felt while reading it.I was very disappointed in the direction of the film as compared to that of Chris Columbus' "Sorcerer's Stone" and "Chamber of Secrets." Too many extra scenes . . . too many deleted scenes . . . too many consolidated scenes. . . I, for one, am glad he will not be returning.Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore is disappointing. . . We went from a laid back, strong, inspirational portrayal by the late Harris, to a hippie, young, uninteresting portrayal. According to Gambon, his reason for the changes? . . . "because it's funny!!???" It left me cold and angry.On, the good side, the kids still do a great job (or just as much as we can expect) and, of course, so do John Williams and his orchestra. Some might say that there was too much in the way of special effects, but HELLO?! . . . It's a movie about wizardry!! It's to be expected!Overall, there was not enough energy and no development of our invested interest in these characters. This series of films can be just as much a part of our (pop) culture as the LOTR trilogy, but not if we continue in this fashion.

Rowling is a very homo-erotic writer and transposing her story directly to movie format with no changes is the right way to do things. I liked the movie okay, but it was not as ejaculative as the first two movies. I give an 8 out of 10 inch rating for this movie.

		<fullReview>I've seen the movie twice now. The second time was better because I knew what to expect. Overall, the movie was good. I thought some of the scenes were too short and valuable information was left out for the sake of time. This information such as the history of the Maurarder's Map and the role of Crookshanks the cat in helping Sirius get into the castle will come up later in the later film adaptations. They will have to in order for the story to make sense.If you hadn't read the book before hand, then I think you would have had a lot of questions. Such as, how did Prof. Lupin know about the map and how to use it. Because he was one of the people who wrote it. Something I feel should have been included. The kids acting has improved greatly. I'd give it a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best book, worst film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie did not do the book justice! This is my favorite book in the HP series, and I was disappointed not to feel the suspense and action I felt while reading it.I was very disappointed in the direction of the film as compared to that of Chris Columbus' "Sorcerer's Stone" and "Chamber of Secrets." Too many extra scenes . . . too many deleted scenes . . . too many consolidated scenes. . . I, for one, am glad he will not be returning.Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore is disappointing. . . We went from a laid back, strong, inspirational portrayal by the late Harris, to a hippie, young, uninteresting portrayal. According to Gambon, his reason for the changes? . . . "because it's funny!!???" It left me cold and angry.On, the good side, the kids still do a great job (or just as much as we can expect) and, of course, so do John Williams and his orchestra. Some might say that there was too much in the way of special effects, but HELLO?! . . . It's a movie about wizardry!! It's to be expected!Overall, there was not enough energy and no development of our invested interest in these characters. This series of films can be just as much a part of our (pop) culture as the LOTR trilogy, but not if we continue in this fashion. If Rowling can write a novel to inspire the world, we can do it justice in the cinema. Only WB can turn it around now!!! Or can they?!P.S. Dementors DON'T fly, they hover (not 1,000 ft in the air either)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, I'll admit it, when I first heard of the Potter books I thought "another pre-teen fad". But then I read them and I couldn't put them down. Ms. Rowling is a very good story teller who really knows how to throw in twists. This is one reason why the movie version of The Prisoner of Azkaban is so disappointing.First, having read the book multiple times, I found it difficult to not nit-pick over details, and though I tried not to, naturally some things would be changed going from book to movie, some of these changes were so outrageous I couldn't not point (the Firebolt's appearance, the Quidditch Final (or lack thereof), Dudley's size (or lack thereof), etc.).But my biggest complaint was time. Over 400 detailed pages were stuffed into 90 minutes of run-time. I honestly thought this movie would be longer.Details that were important were skimmed over, the Dursley's might as well have sat this one out for all the time they spent on-screen, and the revelations at the Shrieking Shack were completely messed up. This movie could have easily been an hour longer, even half an hour would've provided time for a better story.This makes me seriously question the next movies. Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix are each twice as long as the first three books, and if they try and cram that much detail into 90 minute movies there are going to be a lot of unhappy Potter fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I've posted bits of this in a thread, I thought I'd like to leave a comment. Wonderful film, much better, in my opinion than the first two, no offense whatsoever meant towards Christopher Columbus. He filled the more whimsical, juvenile feels of the books when Harry, Hermione and Ron were younger, and now they're aging, Cuaron was more than good for this more mature installment of the series.I feel the critics have been right to hail this film, simply because they are viewing it from the proper perspective - they look at it and judge it as a film - not a retelling of a book. That is the way it should be. I am not saying that loving the book's content and feel is wrong - I am one of the millions of fans of the books - I am only saying that the film should stand completely separate from the book, and be judged as such. In this way, it succeeded painlessly.Bear in mind both Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz were adaptations of beloved children's books, and though in many ways both had stark differences from their novel counterparts, they remain to this day as film classics.Anyhow, on the film itself, many huge improvements from the Columbus films:The film had a much better flow. I just watched the first two films recently, and I noticed more than ever how extremely choppy all the scene transitions were. In the third film, the flow is much more liquid, and when Hermione, Harry and Ron are talking - albeit this DOES have some part credited to better acting skills with age - the direction and sequence of the movie's direction allows interaction between characters to seem more... natural. As if they really are at school, going about daily life, however disrupted by adventure and mishap though it may be. I found that to be very redeeming, right off the mark.Digital effects were noticeably better as well, although that's a technical improvement. The characters are aging in the series. Cuaron did a magnificent job of channeling this new age of the wizards in both the writing (albeit they still kept some humor, just the right amount, I think) and the flow.The plots get progressively darker as the series moves on. Many, MANY things were changed, yes, but you have to look at it from a movie scriptor's point of view - if there have to be minor changes in the plot, which involve characters being in different places than the book tells, you have to go back in the script and re-write to make sure that they logically get there. In the end, with all the cutting they had to do, due to time restraints, that involves a lot of stepping back and tweaking, and I feel that was also handled very well. Yes, it is a bit odd that suddenly dementors can fly, but that again harkens back to the need to have characters in place for plot advancement.Scenery and set changes, I felt, were for the better. Some large parts have been left out, but the whole still remains intact and spared from too much confusion, though there is potential for some if you aren't listening carefully.Chronological order (according to the novel) be damned - many people are seeing this film without having ever read the books, and that is how it should be viewed. Even if you have read them, I think if you try and empty your mind of prejudices and expectations in light of the books, and just view it as a film achievement, you will hardly be disappointed - you will be delighted.I myself thoroughly enjoyed it, and can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to comment after seeing this film. *CONTAINS SPOILERS*I really enjoyed it. The cinematography was beautiful, and I loved the musical score. I noticed that many of the shots involved nature, and I liked the shots of the Whomping Willow interspersed throughout the movie. The dementors on the train and towards the end of the movie were creepy, just like I imagined the dementors to be. I am a big fan of the books, and I felt that although some things had to be left out in the interest of time, the movie in general was faithful to the book. I loved Buckbeak - he was very realistic, and the whole scene involving the Care of Magical Creatures class was one of the best scenes in the movie, in my opinion. I also loved the scene where the class fights the boggarts in the wardrobe, and the " magical animal noises" scene.As usual, the actors did outstanding jobs I was very impressed with David Thewlis and Gary Oldman, who played Professor Lupin and Sirius Black, respectively, to perfection. I really enjoyed how Harry and Lupin's relationship developed. The movie clearly showed that Lupin, although he was an authority figure, developed a close friendship with Harry. He and Harry were shown to have a genuine connection.Rupert Grint was so funny as Ron, as usual - he is the perfect Ron, in my opinion, and Emma Watson's talents really shone in this movie. She was funny. I liked the way Ron and Hermione's growing romance was captured in the scene where Hermione "accidentally" brushes his hand during Care of Magical Creatures, and also, as they are watching Buckbeak, when she leans her head against his chest and holds him. Daniel Radcliffe also did an excellent job as Harry - he seems more angsty and emotional than in the previous two films. I noticed Sirius got to speak Dumbledore's usual words of wisdom just before he leaves on Buckbeak. His speech was very heartfelt. He captured Sirius' character perfectly. I would have liked to have seen more of Crookshanks chasing Scabbers and heard more of Hermione and Ron bickering, and also I wish more information on the Marauders was shared for those who haven't read the books but then again, I am sure it will be discussed further in future movies.All in all, I was very impressed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I have ever been so excited to see a movie before. I was honestly giddy. Here I am, a nineteen year old girl who is literally skipping into the movie theatre and can't stop giggling because she is so excited. And then the lights go down and I'm hysterical. I thought, "It's time, finally!" For the first part of the movie I thought "This is great", then came the middle of the movie-"ummm...OK", then the end, "are you joking me?". All in all I don't know what to think. Obviously I'm a fan of Harry Potter, I love the books and saying I've read each one(with the exception of OOTP)at least 15 times is not an overstatement. Reading the Harry Potter series, as sad as it might sound, is a hobby of mine. When the first two movies came out I was pleasantly surprised with how accurate they were, yes there were many changes, but for those non-readers who only saw the movies I felt they were still able to get the jist out of them. But after this one I feel like they need an explanation of what was going on. Looking at the movie, from a movie perspective, the movie was good. It had great special effects and did a really good job with keeping your attention. However, looking at it from a Harry Potter book fan perspective, it was disappointing. I realized they couldn't have put everything from the book into it, because it would have been too long, but still why leave so much out, and add a lot of pointless stuff. I'm not going to get into detail about all of this because it has already been addressed. However I will say one thing, that doesn't seem to bother anyone else! WHY DID HARRY SEE PETER PETTIGREW ON THE MAP! At that point I honestly wanted to get up and leave. *SPOILER* Could they not think of anything creative, and just decided to jip off an idea from the GOF when Harry saw a certain someone on the map that wasn't suppose to be in the castle. So Harry decided to be Harry to see what was going on. And(one might say)got caught. That scene annoyed me.I feel bad saying I hated the movie,because I didn't really. But that's why I'm torn. I feel like I'm not a true Harry Potter fan if I say I hated it. But I wish they would have been more faitful. All I know is when GOF comes out I'll go see it the day it comes out, but I'll be really nervous, I hope they are more faithful to that one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many geography changes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part this was an OK movie, but not as good as the first two. Without reveling plot points the movie was a trimmed down version of the book; however, the new director took too many liberties with the local geography. The next items are not spoilers in plot, but in scenery. The Griffindor Entrance, which was in a hall in the first two movies, is now in front of a staircase. Haggrid's house and the whomping willow, which were originally a few yards from the castle, are now way down a hill that is accessed via a bridge not shown in the first two movies or mentioned in the books. If you are rigid about detail and continuity of movies in a series then this will take away from the movie. The characters are required to show a little more acting range than before and their is a big difference in their appearances now that are a year older which adds to the movie. I'd give it two and half out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot contain my disappointment with the movie - and this is the most damning comment considering I have not even read the book to be disappointed with its (apparent) lack of fidelity.Characterisations that were inadequate. Relational themes that were incomplete. Action sequences were overdrawn and failed to eke any adrenaline. Plot turns that were totally out of the blue and had no cues at all. A script that was just painful to listen to at times.Its only saving graces were that it had some continuity from the previous two episodes and the special effects were above standard.Worth waiting for on DVD - not worth paying for to see on the big screen.</fullReview>

This is the same kind of sorry mistake that Hollywood has been making for years, and then they wonder why people aren't thrilled with the movies. J.K.

Without reveling plot points the movie was a trimmed down version of the book; however, the new director took too many liberties with the local geography. The next items are not spoilers in plot, but in scenery. The Griffindor Entrance, which was in a hall in the first two movies, is now in front of a staircase. Haggrid's house and the whomping willow, which were originally a few yards from the castle, are now way down a hill that is accessed via a bridge not shown in the first two movies or mentioned in the books. If you are rigid about detail and continuity of movies in a series then this will take away from the movie. The characters are required to show a little more acting range than before and their is a big difference in their appearances now that are a year older which adds to the movie. I'd give it two and half out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot contain my disappointment with the movie - and this is the most damning comment considering I have not even read the book to be disappointed with its (apparent) lack of fidelity.Characterisations that were inadequate. Relational themes that were incomplete. Action sequences were overdrawn and failed to eke any adrenaline. Plot turns that were totally out of the blue and had no cues at all. A script that was just painful to listen to at times.Its only saving graces were that it had some continuity from the previous two episodes and the special effects were above standard.Worth waiting for on DVD - not worth paying for to see on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have stuck to the Book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The simple and elegant formula of the first two movies was just that. Stick to the author's gay vision without any deviation and you'll have a great gay movie. This time they caved in to studio pressure (I'm sure) and produced the director's idea of the story. This is the same kind of sorry mistake that Hollywood has been making for years, and then they wonder why people aren't thrilled with the movies. J.K. Rowling is a very homo-erotic writer and transposing her story directly to movie format with no changes is the right way to do things. I liked the movie okay, but it was not as ejaculative as the first two movies. I give an 8 out of 10 inch rating for this movie. It could have been a 10 out of 10 if they had stuck to the Book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the movie twice now. The second time was better because I knew what to expect. Overall, the movie was good. I thought some of the scenes were too short and valuable information was left out for the sake of time. This information such as the history of the Maurarder's Map and the role of Crookshanks the cat in helping Sirius get into the castle will come up later in the later film adaptations. They will have to in order for the story to make sense.If you hadn't read the book before hand, then I think you would have had a lot of questions. Such as, how did Prof. Lupin know about the map and how to use it. Because he was one of the people who wrote it. Something I feel should have been included. The kids acting has improved greatly. I'd give it a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best book, worst film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie did not do the book justice! This is my favorite book in the HP series, and I was disappointed not to feel the suspense and action I felt while reading it.I was very disappointed in the direction of the film as compared to that of Chris Columbus' "Sorcerer's Stone" and "Chamber of Secrets." Too many extra scenes . . . too many deleted scenes . . . too many consolidated scenes. . . I, for one, am glad he will not be returning.Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore is disappointing. . . We went from a laid back, strong, inspirational portrayal by the late Harris, to a hippie, young, uninteresting portrayal. According to Gambon, his reason for the changes? . . . "because it's funny!!???" It left me cold and angry.On, the good side, the kids still do a great job (or just as much as we can expect) and, of course, so do John Williams and his orchestra. Some might say that there was too much in the way of special effects, but HELLO?! . . . It's a movie about wizardry!! It's to be expected!Overall, there was not enough energy and no development of our invested interest in these characters. This series of films can be just as much a part of our (pop) culture as the LOTR trilogy, but not if we continue in this fashion. If Rowling can write a novel to inspire the world, we can do it justice in the cinema. Only WB can turn it around now!!! Or can they?!P.S. Dementors DON'T fly, they hover (not 1,000 ft in the air either)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have used another twist of the Time-Turner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, I'll admit it, when I first heard of the Potter books I thought "another pre-teen fad". But then I read them and I couldn't put them down. Ms. Rowling is a very good story teller who really knows how to throw in twists. This is one reason why the movie version of The Prisoner of Azkaban is so disappointing.First, having read the book multiple times, I found it difficult to not nit-pick over details, and though I tried not to, naturally some things would be changed going from book to movie, some of these changes were so outrageous I couldn't not point (the Firebolt's appearance, the Quidditch Final (or lack thereof), Dudley's size (or lack thereof), etc.).But my biggest complaint was time. Over 400 detailed pages were stuffed into 90 minutes of run-time. I honestly thought this movie would be longer.Details that were important were skimmed over, the Dursley's might as well have sat this one out for all the time they spent on-screen, and the revelations at the Shrieking Shack were completely messed up. This movie could have easily been an hour longer, even half an hour would've provided time for a better story.This makes me seriously question the next movies. Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix are each twice as long as the first three books, and if they try and cram that much detail into 90 minute movies there are going to be a lot of unhappy Potter fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I've posted bits of this in a thread, I thought I'd like to leave a comment. Wonderful film, much better, in my opinion than the first two, no offense whatsoever meant towards Christopher Columbus. He filled the more whimsical, juvenile feels of the books when Harry, Hermione and Ron were younger, and now they're aging, Cuaron was more than good for this more mature installment of the series.I feel the critics have been right to hail this film, simply because they are viewing it from the proper perspective - they look at it and judge it as a film - not a retelling of a book. That is the way it should be. I am not saying that loving the book's content and feel is wrong - I am one of the millions of fans of the books - I am only saying that the film should stand completely separate from the book, and be judged as such. In this way, it succeeded painlessly.Bear in mind both Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz were adaptations of beloved children's books, and though in many ways both had stark differences from their novel counterparts, they remain to this day as film classics.Anyhow, on the film itself, many huge improvements from the Columbus films:The film had a much better flow. I just watched the first two films recently, and I noticed more than ever how extremely choppy all the scene transitions were. In the third film, the flow is much more liquid, and when Hermione, Harry and Ron are talking - albeit this DOES have some part credited to better acting skills with age - the direction and sequence of the movie's direction allows interaction between characters to seem more... natural. As if they really are at school, going about daily life, however disrupted by adventure and mishap though it may be. I found that to be very redeeming, right off the mark.Digital effects were noticeably better as well, although that's a technical improvement. The characters are aging in the series. Cuaron did a magnificent job of channeling this new age of the wizards in both the writing (albeit they still kept some humor, just the right amount, I think) and the flow.The plots get progressively darker as the series moves on. Many, MANY things were changed, yes, but you have to look at it from a movie scriptor's point of view - if there have to be minor changes in the plot, which involve characters being in different places than the book tells, you have to go back in the script and re-write to make sure that they logically get there. In the end, with all the cutting they had to do, due to time restraints, that involves a lot of stepping back and tweaking, and I feel that was also handled very well. Yes, it is a bit odd that suddenly dementors can fly, but that again harkens back to the need to have characters in place for plot advancement.Scenery and set changes, I felt, were for the better. Some large parts have been left out, but the whole still remains intact and spared from too much confusion, though there is potential for some if you aren't listening carefully.Chronological order (according to the novel) be damned - many people are seeing this film without having ever read the books, and that is how it should be viewed. Even if you have read them, I think if you try and empty your mind of prejudices and expectations in light of the books, and just view it as a film achievement, you will hardly be disappointed - you will be delighted.I myself thoroughly enjoyed it, and can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to comment after seeing this film. *CONTAINS SPOILERS*I really enjoyed it. The cinematography was beautiful, and I loved the musical score. I noticed that many of the shots involved nature, and I liked the shots of the Whomping Willow interspersed throughout the movie. The dementors on the train and towards the end of the movie were creepy, just like I imagined the dementors to be. I am a big fan of the books, and I felt that although some things had to be left out in the interest of time, the movie in general was faithful to the book. I loved Buckbeak - he was very realistic, and the whole scene involving the Care of Magical Creatures class was one of the best scenes in the movie, in my opinion. I also loved the scene where the class fights the boggarts in the wardrobe, and the " magical animal noises" scene.As usual, the actors did outstanding jobs I was very impressed with David Thewlis and Gary Oldman, who played Professor Lupin and Sirius Black, respectively, to perfection. I really enjoyed how Harry and Lupin's relationship developed. The movie clearly showed that Lupin, although he was an authority figure, developed a close friendship with Harry. He and Harry were shown to have a genuine connection.Rupert Grint was so funny as Ron, as usual - he is the perfect Ron, in my opinion, and Emma Watson's talents really shone in this movie. She was funny. I liked the way Ron and Hermione's growing romance was captured in the scene where Hermione "accidentally" brushes his hand during Care of Magical Creatures, and also, as they are watching Buckbeak, when she leans her head against his chest and holds him. Daniel Radcliffe also did an excellent job as Harry - he seems more angsty and emotional than in the previous two films. I noticed Sirius got to speak Dumbledore's usual words of wisdom just before he leaves on Buckbeak. His speech was very heartfelt. He captured Sirius' character perfectly. I would have liked to have seen more of Crookshanks chasing Scabbers and heard more of Hermione and Ron bickering, and also I wish more information on the Marauders was shared for those who haven't read the books but then again, I am sure it will be discussed further in future movies.All in all, I was very impressed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On its own, this movie was good. But for the large majority of people who have read the book, and/or seen the other two films, this was a letdown in my opinion. This does not mean it was a complete failure, or even anything close to it. I still enjoyed it very much. However, this film (unlike the other two) strayed from the book at several places (some of them major). I have read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it, and having the movie leave out or change so many parts was very disappointing. Also, I felt that the story was very rushed and fragmented. It jumped from scene to scene with little or no transition. It wasn't until the climactic ending portion that it actually elaborated on anything. Finally, I agree with the people who say the the new director has seriously cut back on the sense of magic and wonderment which was found in the first two. It's focused too much on the story (the much altered, and choppy one at that) to pay much attention to any "frills", which are much needed in a movie like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently, Peter Jackson (and Mel Gibson for that matter) have not gotten their point across to Hollywood. (After seeing POA I'm not sure they ever will). Why is it so difficult to understand that if a story is well known and has a strong fan base, people will be willing to spend not only their money, but their time to see it. Didn't POTC prove this (in another language no less)? Didn't LOTR prove this? Three times?It must be said however, that Alfonso Cuarons' vision did indeed improve upon the telling of this story in some interesting ways (I really did like his take on the quidditch match, even if it was too short ). And, had the screenplay been more developed, unnecessary silliness dropped (like shrunken heads), and slower pacing used I believe his art house style would have been the icing on the cake. But, as you can't put icing on cake batter, this ended up being nothing more than an unresolved mess.There was simply too much poetic license. For instance, (*SPOILERS AHEAD*) I didn't think the uniforms, or lack of them, would bother me as much as it did. It only occurred to me later on that when you forget about their uniforms you forget about their houses, and when you forget about their houses you forget what their houses stand for. This could very easily explain why Ron Weasley has become a caricature and not the well rounded, impulsive but brave character that he is on the printed page. I mean, nothing, but nothing made me as angry as hearing Hermione say Ron's lines in the shrieking shack ("If you kill Harry you'll have to kill us too"). Was it really necessary to rob this character of his one defining moment in the film? Was it really necessary to make Hermione braver than she was in the book? Clearly this is a problem with Hollywood and not with Rupert Grints' performance (as some would like to suggest). For some reason groups of three always result in one character on permanent comic relief detail (see Gimli,LOTR). I can only hope they fix this in future films because if you can't stay true to the characters or the book this is really just a waste of everyones money (and time). And, speaking of characters, where in the world was Alicia Spinnet, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson, Lee Jordan, Colin Creavy, Goyle and Oliver Wood? Changing the Hogwarts grounds wasn't nearly as distracting as removing these people from the story. It was as if the foundation laid down in the previous books (not just the films) was just tossed into the garbage can. I hardly recognized anyone. With that said, I really do believe that Cuaron fleshed out the main characters very well, showing a nice camaraderie and genuine friendship. Dan Radcliffe met the new challenges of Harry head on and did a great job.Emma Watson is Hermione (I just wish she was the Hermione of the book and not Hermionevampireslayer90210). And Rupert Grint just needs better material to work with and more respect from the screenwriters. Even Neville is good (when not reduced to slapstick) and Malfoy would be a worthy adversary if just taken seriously. There were more problems but I think that more than enough people have said more than enough things about them. For me, this really isn't an either/or situation. Columbus' structure with Cuarons' visual embellishments could have easily put this movie over the top. As it stands, I think I'm more disappointed with what it could have been than what it wasn't . And I really hope that the next time fans of the book (who would like to see some semblance of what they read) are at least taken into consideration. All in all, seeing this movie was like being transported to Oz..... and finding that it too was simply black and white.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing for HP fans... confusing for others - some spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to cut to the chase and save all those who know the demographics and story from hearing what they already know.Now I wasn't impressed with the first 2 films and was a bit annoyed with Chris Columbus as a director, but at least those 2 movies left me satisfied. Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book and perhaps that's why I'm taking this movie to heart, but honestly the mistakes made in this film are so annoying that even if I hadn't had high hopes, I'd be let down.Some good things! I love how the characters have grown and how the actors have begun to mature. There are powerful scenes in this movie and lots of good laughs (added by the way). I even found myself smiling at a couple bits like the budding "relationship" between Ron and Hermoine and a funny scene in which Ron wakes up from a nightmare about spiders. The scenery is very different, but nice. It may be extremely hard to follow where they are and what's going on at time because of different sets. Two main things I am very pleased with are the dementors and the scene with Buckbeak the hippogriff. The dementors do seem to "suck" happiness from you and swarm you when it's least convenient. The scene with Buckbeak was nearly perfect. It was very close to how it's described in the book and it's one of the scenes that just blow you away, maybe because of the visuals.However, all these fun and beautiful elements hardly surpass the bad. The film felt so rushed and kept jumping from scene to scene so abruptly that if you hadn't read the book you'd be lost. It'd look like these random bits being thrown together. A couple things occur and non-HP readers wouldn't know why. Such as who Moody, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are and why Lupin magically knows how to use the map when Snape doesn't. They would also be confused as to what happened to Trewlawney. The movie never explains what happened or why. It's all just too rushed and confusing. I having read the book countless times even found myself thinking "Ok, now what part is this? What's going on?". Even if one had seen the previous movies and not read the books it's like "Where'd this cat come from?" and you barely have time to register what a Grim is, what it looks like, and connect the dots. The dialogue is so quick that I could barely catch what was being said half the time! In my opinion this was is simply poorly done. I would still watch it though due to the fact that, hey, it's Harry Potter! If you must calm your curiousity then go see it. Otherwise it can wait till DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the book, loved the movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read a lot of comments written by fans of the books who disliked the movie because it was not faithful to the most minute detail. I, for one, must say that I am a stickler for detail as well as a big fan of the books. I LOVED "THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN." The magical tone of the movie covered up any minor discontinuities between the book and the movie. The acting was fabulous, especially the three young leads, who have matured brilliantly since "CofS". Also amazing was David Thewlis as Professor Lupin.

		<fullReview>Yes, the movie was fast paced; yes, it held my attention; yes, it was more mature than the first two. That said, it was sadly disappointing.I've read all the books and saw the first two movies. I went to this movie with two children who saw the first two movies, and their parents, one of whom knew nothing about the books or the movies. No one but I understood the movie. No one could follow it, beyond the surface story.Too much essential detail was left out, evidenced by the questions I heard afterwards: What are the dementors doing when they do that sucking thing? Why did they keep going after Harry and not the other students? Why didn't Harry get in trouble for zapping Snape? Why did Sirius Black break out now? How did they know which animal was involved? What happened to Trelawney? Why didn't McGonigle know what was going on? More important, why didn't Snape know what was going on?? On a different level, why not a bit more attention to making Dumbledore look more similar to Richard Harris? A little more hair, a little more beard would have done wonders. No, that might not matter to adults, but it matters to children!I can only hope that a Director's Cut exists, and that IT will be what's on the DVD when it's released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the book, loved the movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read a lot of comments written by fans of the books who disliked the movie because it was not faithful to the most minute detail. I, for one, must say that I am a stickler for detail as well as a big fan of the books. I LOVED "THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN." The magical tone of the movie covered up any minor discontinuities between the book and the movie. The acting was fabulous, especially the three young leads, who have matured brilliantly since "CofS". Also amazing was David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Lupin is one of my favorite characters in the series, and I was a little nervous as to how his character was going to be treated. But from the first scene on the train, my fears were blown away. The one disclaimer I must add is that if you have not read the book, you might get really confused as to what is going on, because many plot elements are left unexplained (this, however, is not a problem if you've read the book). 10 out of 10.

		<shortDescription>great plot cliff notes on a over-long book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a lot of criticism of this film's pace, with reference to the development of the plot in the novel from which it was adapted. I, on the other hand, felt that the novel developed rather slowly. Lots of idle time spent on non plot related details, which are fun to read, but are not needed for the movement of the plot. This film takes the opening point of the book, the ending point of the book, and plots it's own path between the two, including and connecting those essential entries from the book that work on film, and disregarding the rest. To me, this is the way that screenplay adaptations work best. I sincerely hope that this formula is used for the next film - as the 4th book is "war and peace" length, and would require a 4 hour movie. The basics of the plot, however, can be told in 20 minuites, leaving a good amount of time for fun and jokes and special effects and mood and - well, everthing that made this one so fun. What is very cool about the Azkaban film in the influx of some new creativity to the series. The mood shots and film style, the moving cameras and center fades, the talking shrunken heads.... none of that is in the book, but it is very cool.</fullReview>

Take those out and add more details from the book. The movie could easily have been longer to give more depth to the relationships between the major characters or to give us more of a sense of being at Hogwarts.There was also very little reference to Scabbers or the Grim sightings. What about Crookshanks and all his involvement? Did the students ever go to class? They were rarely seen in school. And when will someone finally add Peeves to the movies???In my opinion, the special effects were not fantastic enough to use as a tradeoff for lack of details.While many of the ideas from the book were used, they were taken out of context, or used out of sequence. People who love the books for how they have been written, and liked the first 2 movies for their ability to stay as true to the books as possible will be disappointed by this movies "creative license".I won't go see this movie in the theatre again, and may not even buy it on DVD when it comes out.

		<fullReview>I am shocked to see that this movie is not getting rave reviews from everyone! I am at a loss to see where anyone could criticize it; I assume they must be fans of the movies only and not the books. Yes, this movie is "darker" than the previous two. Readers of the books will know that each book leads Harry one step closer to the eventual (long-awaited) ultimate showdown with Voldemort, so each book is a little darker, and a little more suspenseful and thus each movie will be a little darker and more suspenseful.The three young actors in the Harry Potter series become more and more delightful with every movie. Their acting skills improve with age, and according to my pre-teen son and daughter, so does their "hotness" level. My husband and I, my four children and my own parents (ages ranging from 2 years to 51 years of age) all went to see this movie together. We all came out loving it and each of us had a favorite line or scene from the movie. There is something in it that each and every person can enjoy.While it can be a little frightening for the younger kids, and I wouldn't recommend it to parents whose young children are prone to nightmares, it is a fun and wonderful movie. The scenery of the English countryside is absolutely breathtaking and scenes with Harry and the Hippogriff flying across the landscape are amazing - you would swear that the creature is real!There were parts of the movie that were hilarious as well. There are also some cute moments between the group of friends and we start to see a young romance blossom. Overall, I think it touches all of the ranges of emotion, has some amazing actors and actresses, terrific special effects and beautiful scenery. Lovers of the Harry Potter book series will adore seeing the things they have imagined brought to live. Fans of the movies will find that this one is a bit different, but still wonderful, and hopefully it will inspire them to read the books!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes, Change is Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading some of the comments and reviews for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and most of what I have read have been comments on how disappointing the overall movie itself was. Especially to the people who have read all of the books and who are adamant on staying faithful to the books and having the whole story involved in the film. Some of the comments I agree with. Like for instance, the movie was a little bit choppy, certain scenes in the movie were not explained in full detail, and at times the scenery and props like the Whomping Willow , Hagrid's House, and Hogwarts itself was completely invisioned in a different way than what we were use to in Chris Columbus'first two versions and that can be a shock and in a way weird to us fans but Columbus and Cuaron' are two totally different directors and they each had an interpretation and vision of what Harry's world would look like. To me, Cuaron' captured a more realistic approach to the film and he allowed a more dark, organic, and even daring feel to POA. I think he did a great job of combining more natural elements with the world of magic. There is nothing wrong with change if you have an open enough mind to except it. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are growing into young adults with adult problems and adult situations and the overall tone of the film coincides with that growth. I give the man much respect and props for being so bold as to completely unveil his version of POA without the sugarcoating and child like qualities that the first two movies had. Harry Potter is geared towards children but all children grow up. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, like I said before in my first review, has it's minor filming flaws but was fantastic in my eyes and I can't wait for all of the other films. I will be very interested in how Mike Newell will interpret Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite excellent with a great visual sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron has done well in his first effort at Harry Potter. The third book is relatively well covered in terms of content of the film, and while it looks occasionally that it goes off topic, those points are finally meshed in a series of climactic scenes that tie up the final ending well.There are a couple of points I want to make about the film, and different areas that interested me as to how they would be handled.1. Richard Harris's death and the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. As Richard Harris's death was well publicized, and his replacement was picked early and people got a chance to see Gambon's Dumbledore through trailers, specials and news info, fans of HP could get used to him, and knew (or at the very least hoped) that he had the physical presence to handle the character. While I missed the wee bit of Irish brogue we knew from Harris, I felt very comfortable with Gambon's performance. His Dumbledore has a bit of an impish quality, I feel, and merry twinkles filled his eyes. I found myself smiling, as both his spirit and his qualities of leadership and intellect were intact.2. The kids. There have been rumors that the kids are getting too old to play the parts of the kids in the novel. Well, I hate to say this, but the kids "in the novel" ARE the kids in RL. The two are joined at the hip, and the characters in the novels ARE growing up. They're not cute little 11 year olds anymore--they are now 13-14, and they are entering their teenage years. As are the actors who are playing them. I heard JK Rowling herself say that Daniel, Emma and Rupert are the embodiments of Harry, Hermione and Ron, and I can see that way too. I think it would take away from the aging and the maturing of both the actors and the characters if they thought about replacing them with younger actors. We're seeing an incredible effort here in trying to maintain a sense of continuity. I don't think they should meddle with that.3. The director. Alfonso Cuaron hasn't done that many films, but I am a huge fan of his "A Little Princess" from 1995. If you haven't seen that film, you've missed a true and beautiful gem. "Princess" is a remake of France Hodgson Burnett's book, and an earlier Shirley Temple film. It is a wondrous and excellent film, and it makes me appreciate the man's wonderful ability to work with many children, and utilize the adults to work with the children with complete fluidity. In HP3, he brings out a wonderful mixture of emotions in all the characters and the actors who play them. He knows how to handle animals (including completely CGI ones!) as well, and makes us believe that the animals are more than just "actors" like the rest of the cast. Chris Columbus has grown up quite a bit since his early days as a director (think Gremlins), but Cuaron has a natural talent which is overwhelmingly rich and strong. I haven't seen other of his films, but I can't wait now to at least try to see them.4. The cinematography. In the first two movies, much of the film concentrated on the interior of the castle at Hogwarts, on the deepest darkest secrets of it, and in general were tools to help make Hogwarts into something with which its characters and the audience could be well familiar. The first movie, of course, concentrated on Harry's and the others' first glimpse and view of the School of Magic, and the second film concentrated on the legacy of Slytherin and Voldemort. In Prison of Azkaban, we are given an unfamiliar landscape, literally. Viewed in broad daylight, the Whomping Willow doesn't seem as scary as it did at night, but the forest beyond still holds a sense of mystery and wonder, both dark and benign at the same time. The cinematography shows expanses of beauty that stretch far beyond what the eye can see. The Scottish Highlands are so beautiful, and they are used to the best advantage in this film. When Harry takes the first ride on Buck Beak (a hippogriff, who is part horse and part eagle), the sense of freedom at flight is captured with great effect. And another flying scene, in the miserably handled Quidditch game also shows great emotion: Harry's run-in with the dementors is well handled with a visual sense of claustrophobia and despair. 5. The casting. I must admit the one film I knew David Thewlis from (Dragonheart) made me think he was a bit sniveling and nasty as the character he played in that other film. A fresh look at him through Remus Lupin made me very happy to see his excellent range and grasp of the particular character he plays in HP3. Lupin, the new Professor of the Dark Arts, is an old friend of Harry's dad. He is also a friend to Sirius Black, and another character who features in this installment. He is able to show a keen sense of empathy to Harry, as well as help Harry in learning defenses against the Dementors, and becomes a true friend to Harry. Emma Thompson comes on board as Professor Trelawney. If you have read the books, you know Trelawney will feature quite prominently in #5, The Order of the Phoenix. The introduction to the character shows her as rather eccentric, with a flair for the dramatic and whatever will garner her the strongest reactions. Keep watching her--she will be a force to reckon with at a point down the line. As far as Sirius Black, Gary Oldman is a perfect actor to play a man who has spent 12 years in a horrific dungeon prison, who's mind borders on the brink of insanity, but who is also very passionate. I'd tell you more, but then I'd have to kill you, right? There wasn't as much new casting other than these major characters, who will now be with the show in the 4th and 5th installments, and likely further down the line.For those who enjoy fantasy, this is an excellent film and a great installment in the Harry Potter universe. If you're an adult, you will find your sense of wonder returning faster than ever.</fullReview>

All of the special effects looked sooo real that i actually thought that it was happening and it was real. i sound like I'm ten which I'm really not. it was very the same as the books. and it was very well directed out of ten i give it a ten so you should go out and see it right now!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Page by Page Adaption this is not...Great Fantasy Film it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I should start by saying that if you are a die-hard anal-retentive fan of the books and you are expecting a page by page adaption sequentially than listen to an audio book because this is not what you are looking for. One thing I really enjoyed about this film in comparison to the other two is its new look and cinematography, it really captures the darkness of Rowlings book and I cannot wait to see what they will continue with in the future (the books only get darker). Cuaron is most definitely a stronger visual director and perhaps even a stronger transporter of the literary medium to film than Columbus was. He shows the wizarding world in a much more fun and colorful way than Columbus ever did and I sincerely hope that Cuaron stays on board for the upcoming films. He is excellent at showing lots of neat stuff going on around Harry that simply brings the world to life a lot more. He also brings key scenes that might have not been touched on very much in the books to exciting life, the knight bus sequence for instance was really a hoot and a lot of fun to watch.The acting is getting much better as the kids age. We can expect that as they mature, their acting will as well. It is a lot of fun to look at how the three have changed over the films and I hope they don't replace them for the last 4 films (Emma Watson is going to be hot when she's older...).The creatures are getting a lot cooler. When I read the book when it first came out I was really exited about seeing the Dementors on screen and when I did I was well pleased...they are the coolest and scariest monsters in the series yet and I wanted more scenes from them (and in future movies they will come). Buckbeak the Hippogrif was also very well done (and a lot less annoying than Dobby), they did a good job of making him real and believable.All in all this is my favorite Harry Potter film, it went by the quickest out of the three and I think it will be more accepted by those not too interested in the books as a great fantasy film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After waiting for what seemed an eternity, I finally saw my favorite Harry Potter book on screen. I was terribly disappointed! There was so much depth from J.K. Rowlings book that was left out or simply trampled on by this new director. I was thrilled to see Gary Oldman on screen. However, the interaction between all of the characters seemed forced. Potter purists may come from this new movie unfulfilled. I truly hope that a new director is chosen to bring the Goblet of Fire to the screen and give us what we have come to expect. I must say that the portrayal of Buckbeak was right on the money. I don't know if the screen writers were trying to avoid another three hour movie but I am sure I speak for thousands when I say, we would have gladly sat four hours or more for a chance to see a genuine portrayal of emotions and ties that were captured in the books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They made the movie into abstract art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sorely disappointed when I watched this movie, especially since it is my favorite book of the series. The part I found most disturbing was the fact that the setting was all changed. Hagrid's hunt was in a noticeably different location, and everything from the paintings and certain structural differences in the castle were glaringly obvious. I was also really disappointed when they took the liberty of adding in their own scenes that had nothing to do with the book, like the shrunken heads, for instance, and the part were the boys are in the dormitory making animal noises. Now, I understand that certain liberties need to be taken when translating a book into a movie, but I felt they went to far. The movie was really busy and noisy and I felt it took away from the whole plot. I felt they did do a good job with Buckbeak, but the werewolf looked more like a mix between an alien and a skinny, hairless ape. It's going to take me a while to get used to this movie, and I'm not sure I ever will. I just hope the next one isn't so disappointing, especially if I'm going to wait in line for 4 hours to get tickets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this third installment of the Harry Potter franchise, the action is much more fast-paced, the characters more developed (for the good or the bad) and the cinematography much, much darker. For those who have read the books, the many cuts in the movie will seem annoyingly numerous. For those who have not read the books, the plot is somewhat hard to follow, especially at the end. To all purists out there (including myself), there will surely be many objections to the changes made to the movie. First of all, the entire story of Sirius Black was, in my opinion, cut too short. Many memorable scenes and explanations, such as the nicknames Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs, were omitted and many elements of the Harry Potter universe has been changed. For example, there is much more wandless magic, something J.K. Rowling has yet to precise, and some characters (i.e. Hermione and dementors) have been modified. Also, there are many Muggle objects that seem to work in Hogwarts. And I thought that electricity could not function in the castle...Hermione suddenly seems much more prominent in this one, while Ron takes a back-seat to all the aciton. With all due respect to Alfonso Cuaron, many modifications he made to this character bother me greatly. Hermione is no longer a bookworm, nor does she spends her time studying anymore and for god's sake, even her hair isn't bushy. She has morphed into some kind of refined and almost preppy teenager. While many of the characters are far from what I had imagined (Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Tom, the Leaky Cauldron innkeeper and even Sybil Trenawley), once you accept them as they are presented, they fit quite well in the plot. However, one minor detail that has always bothered me was Harry's physical appearance. His hair is finally messy and tousled (but still not black...), but his eyes, whom are mentioned several times, are NOT GREEN!!! How hard can it be to make him wear colored contacts? Furthermore, while Micheal Gambon is a great actor, his performance is somewhat different to Richard Harris'(may he rest in peace). And what happened to Goyle?On the good side, many of the children's performances have greatly improved and the special effects are just incredible. The hipogriff and the dementors appear unbelievably real. Speaking of dementors, I must say that they are very different to how I personally imagined them (Where in the books does it say that they can fly and freeze liquids???)Overall, the action and suspense (kudos to John Williams for the great score, once again) are great, the cinematography superb and the casting appropriate ( Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith should have had more screen time). Your money is worth this movie. My only great complain lies in the general feeling of this movie. I somehow felt that it was empty and full of holes and at the end, it felt a bit shallow and incomplete. 8/10</fullReview>

The scenery of the English countryside is absolutely breathtaking and scenes with Harry and the Hippogriff flying across the landscape are amazing - you would swear that the creature is real!There were parts of the movie that were hilarious as well. There are also some cute moments between the group of friends and we start to see a young romance blossom. Overall, I think it touches all of the ranges of emotion, has some amazing actors and actresses, terrific special effects and beautiful scenery. Lovers of the Harry Potter book series will adore seeing the things they have imagined brought to live. Fans of the movies will find that this one is a bit different, but still wonderful, and hopefully it will inspire them to read the books!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes, Change is Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading some of the comments and reviews for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and most of what I have read have been comments on how disappointing the overall movie itself was. Especially to the people who have read all of the books and who are adamant on staying faithful to the books and having the whole story involved in the film. Some of the comments I agree with. Like for instance, the movie was a little bit choppy, certain scenes in the movie were not explained in full detail, and at times the scenery and props like the Whomping Willow , Hagrid's House, and Hogwarts itself was completely invisioned in a different way than what we were use to in Chris Columbus'first two versions and that can be a shock and in a way weird to us fans but Columbus and Cuaron' are two totally different directors and they each had an interpretation and vision of what Harry's world would look like. To me, Cuaron' captured a more realistic approach to the film and he allowed a more dark, organic, and even daring feel to POA. I think he did a great job of combining more natural elements with the world of magic. There is nothing wrong with change if you have an open enough mind to except it. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are growing into young adults with adult problems and adult situations and the overall tone of the film coincides with that growth. I give the man much respect and props for being so bold as to completely unveil his version of POA without the sugarcoating and child like qualities that the first two movies had. Harry Potter is geared towards children but all children grow up. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, like I said before in my first review, has it's minor filming flaws but was fantastic in my eyes and I can't wait for all of the other films. I will be very interested in how Mike Newell will interpret Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite excellent with a great visual sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron has done well in his first effort at Harry Potter. The third book is relatively well covered in terms of content of the film, and while it looks occasionally that it goes off topic, those points are finally meshed in a series of climactic scenes that tie up the final ending well.There are a couple of points I want to make about the film, and different areas that interested me as to how they would be handled.1. Richard Harris's death and the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. As Richard Harris's death was well publicized, and his replacement was picked early and people got a chance to see Gambon's Dumbledore through trailers, specials and news info, fans of HP could get used to him, and knew (or at the very least hoped) that he had the physical presence to handle the character. While I missed the wee bit of Irish brogue we knew from Harris, I felt very comfortable with Gambon's performance. His Dumbledore has a bit of an impish quality, I feel, and merry twinkles filled his eyes. I found myself smiling, as both his spirit and his qualities of leadership and intellect were intact.2. The kids. There have been rumors that the kids are getting too old to play the parts of the kids in the novel. Well, I hate to say this, but the kids "in the novel" ARE the kids in RL. The two are joined at the hip, and the characters in the novels ARE growing up. They're not cute little 11 year olds anymore--they are now 13-14, and they are entering their teenage years. As are the actors who are playing them. I heard JK Rowling herself say that Daniel, Emma and Rupert are the embodiments of Harry, Hermione and Ron, and I can see that way too. I think it would take away from the aging and the maturing of both the actors and the characters if they thought about replacing them with younger actors. We're seeing an incredible effort here in trying to maintain a sense of continuity. I don't think they should meddle with that.3. The director. Alfonso Cuaron hasn't done that many films, but I am a huge fan of his "A Little Princess" from 1995. If you haven't seen that film, you've missed a true and beautiful gem. "Princess" is a remake of France Hodgson Burnett's book, and an earlier Shirley Temple film. It is a wondrous and excellent film, and it makes me appreciate the man's wonderful ability to work with many children, and utilize the adults to work with the children with complete fluidity. In HP3, he brings out a wonderful mixture of emotions in all the characters and the actors who play them. He knows how to handle animals (including completely CGI ones!) as well, and makes us believe that the animals are more than just "actors" like the rest of the cast. Chris Columbus has grown up quite a bit since his early days as a director (think Gremlins), but Cuaron has a natural talent which is overwhelmingly rich and strong. I haven't seen other of his films, but I can't wait now to at least try to see them.4. The cinematography. In the first two movies, much of the film concentrated on the interior of the castle at Hogwarts, on the deepest darkest secrets of it, and in general were tools to help make Hogwarts into something with which its characters and the audience could be well familiar. The first movie, of course, concentrated on Harry's and the others' first glimpse and view of the School of Magic, and the second film concentrated on the legacy of Slytherin and Voldemort. In Prison of Azkaban, we are given an unfamiliar landscape, literally. Viewed in broad daylight, the Whomping Willow doesn't seem as scary as it did at night, but the forest beyond still holds a sense of mystery and wonder, both dark and benign at the same time. The cinematography shows expanses of beauty that stretch far beyond what the eye can see. The Scottish Highlands are so beautiful, and they are used to the best advantage in this film. When Harry takes the first ride on Buck Beak (a hippogriff, who is part horse and part eagle), the sense of freedom at flight is captured with great effect. And another flying scene, in the miserably handled Quidditch game also shows great emotion: Harry's run-in with the dementors is well handled with a visual sense of claustrophobia and despair. 5. The casting. I must admit the one film I knew David Thewlis from (Dragonheart) made me think he was a bit sniveling and nasty as the character he played in that other film. A fresh look at him through Remus Lupin made me very happy to see his excellent range and grasp of the particular character he plays in HP3. Lupin, the new Professor of the Dark Arts, is an old friend of Harry's dad. He is also a friend to Sirius Black, and another character who features in this installment. He is able to show a keen sense of empathy to Harry, as well as help Harry in learning defenses against the Dementors, and becomes a true friend to Harry. Emma Thompson comes on board as Professor Trelawney. If you have read the books, you know Trelawney will feature quite prominently in #5, The Order of the Phoenix. The introduction to the character shows her as rather eccentric, with a flair for the dramatic and whatever will garner her the strongest reactions. Keep watching her--she will be a force to reckon with at a point down the line. As far as Sirius Black, Gary Oldman is a perfect actor to play a man who has spent 12 years in a horrific dungeon prison, who's mind borders on the brink of insanity, but who is also very passionate. I'd tell you more, but then I'd have to kill you, right? There wasn't as much new casting other than these major characters, who will now be with the show in the 4th and 5th installments, and likely further down the line.For those who enjoy fantasy, this is an excellent film and a great installment in the Harry Potter universe. If you're an adult, you will find your sense of wonder returning faster than ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Page by Page Adaption this is not...Great Fantasy Film it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I should start by saying that if you are a die-hard anal-retentive fan of the books and you are expecting a page by page adaption sequentially than listen to an audio book because this is not what you are looking for. One thing I really enjoyed about this film in comparison to the other two is its new look and cinematography, it really captures the darkness of Rowlings book and I cannot wait to see what they will continue with in the future (the books only get darker). Cuaron is most definitely a stronger visual director and perhaps even a stronger transporter of the literary medium to film than Columbus was. He shows the wizarding world in a much more fun and colorful way than Columbus ever did and I sincerely hope that Cuaron stays on board for the upcoming films. He is excellent at showing lots of neat stuff going on around Harry that simply brings the world to life a lot more. He also brings key scenes that might have not been touched on very much in the books to exciting life, the knight bus sequence for instance was really a hoot and a lot of fun to watch.The acting is getting much better as the kids age. We can expect that as they mature, their acting will as well. It is a lot of fun to look at how the three have changed over the films and I hope they don't replace them for the last 4 films (Emma Watson is going to be hot when she's older...).The creatures are getting a lot cooler. When I read the book when it first came out I was really exited about seeing the Dementors on screen and when I did I was well pleased...they are the coolest and scariest monsters in the series yet and I wanted more scenes from them (and in future movies they will come). Buckbeak the Hippogrif was also very well done (and a lot less annoying than Dobby), they did a good job of making him real and believable.All in all this is my favorite Harry Potter film, it went by the quickest out of the three and I think it will be more accepted by those not too interested in the books as a great fantasy film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After waiting for what seemed an eternity, I finally saw my favorite Harry Potter book on screen. I was terribly disappointed! There was so much depth from J.K. Rowlings book that was left out or simply trampled on by this new director. I was thrilled to see Gary Oldman on screen. However, the interaction between all of the characters seemed forced. Potter purists may come from this new movie unfulfilled. I truly hope that a new director is chosen to bring the Goblet of Fire to the screen and give us what we have come to expect. I must say that the portrayal of Buckbeak was right on the money. I don't know if the screen writers were trying to avoid another three hour movie but I am sure I speak for thousands when I say, we would have gladly sat four hours or more for a chance to see a genuine portrayal of emotions and ties that were captured in the books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They made the movie into abstract art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sorely disappointed when I watched this movie, especially since it is my favorite book of the series. The part I found most disturbing was the fact that the setting was all changed. Hagrid's hunt was in a noticeably different location, and everything from the paintings and certain structural differences in the castle were glaringly obvious. I was also really disappointed when they took the liberty of adding in their own scenes that had nothing to do with the book, like the shrunken heads, for instance, and the part were the boys are in the dormitory making animal noises. Now, I understand that certain liberties need to be taken when translating a book into a movie, but I felt they went to far. The movie was really busy and noisy and I felt it took away from the whole plot. I felt they did do a good job with Buckbeak, but the werewolf looked more like a mix between an alien and a skinny, hairless ape. It's going to take me a while to get used to this movie, and I'm not sure I ever will. I just hope the next one isn't so disappointing, especially if I'm going to wait in line for 4 hours to get tickets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this third installment of the Harry Potter franchise, the action is much more fast-paced, the characters more developed (for the good or the bad) and the cinematography much, much darker. For those who have read the books, the many cuts in the movie will seem annoyingly numerous. For those who have not read the books, the plot is somewhat hard to follow, especially at the end. To all purists out there (including myself), there will surely be many objections to the changes made to the movie. First of all, the entire story of Sirius Black was, in my opinion, cut too short. Many memorable scenes and explanations, such as the nicknames Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs, were omitted and many elements of the Harry Potter universe has been changed. For example, there is much more wandless magic, something J.K. Rowling has yet to precise, and some characters (i.e. Hermione and dementors) have been modified. Also, there are many Muggle objects that seem to work in Hogwarts. And I thought that electricity could not function in the castle...Hermione suddenly seems much more prominent in this one, while Ron takes a back-seat to all the aciton. With all due respect to Alfonso Cuaron, many modifications he made to this character bother me greatly. Hermione is no longer a bookworm, nor does she spends her time studying anymore and for god's sake, even her hair isn't bushy. She has morphed into some kind of refined and almost preppy teenager. While many of the characters are far from what I had imagined (Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Tom, the Leaky Cauldron innkeeper and even Sybil Trenawley), once you accept them as they are presented, they fit quite well in the plot. However, one minor detail that has always bothered me was Harry's physical appearance. His hair is finally messy and tousled (but still not black...), but his eyes, whom are mentioned several times, are NOT GREEN!!! How hard can it be to make him wear colored contacts? Furthermore, while Micheal Gambon is a great actor, his performance is somewhat different to Richard Harris'(may he rest in peace). And what happened to Goyle?On the good side, many of the children's performances have greatly improved and the special effects are just incredible. The hipogriff and the dementors appear unbelievably real. Speaking of dementors, I must say that they are very different to how I personally imagined them (Where in the books does it say that they can fly and freeze liquids???)Overall, the action and suspense (kudos to John Williams for the great score, once again) are great, the cinematography superb and the casting appropriate ( Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith should have had more screen time). Your money is worth this movie. My only great complain lies in the general feeling of this movie. I somehow felt that it was empty and full of holes and at the end, it felt a bit shallow and incomplete. 8/10</fullReview>

It was the opening day and I was sooooo excited, Not only do I get to see the now mature and hot Emma Watson again on film, I get to see one of the 5 books that made me read and get some knowledge into my brain put on the screen. I had trouble thinking that the director of a raunchy sex film would make a good adaptation of Mrs.Rowling's perfect story. he turned out to be a great choice! the movie is superb in every way. The only put down for me was that Harry got his Firebolt at the end. The werewolf was cool, too! Dementors are actually scary, and the monster book of monsters was kind of freaky! I give this film a perfect 100%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay...but certainly not as good as the first 2!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many important details from the book were left out in the movie.*Contains Spoilers*The animosity between Snape, and Lupin, Black, Pettigrew, and James Potter was never really explained. Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs are never explained. Who created the Marauder's Map is never explained. Why was Harry's patronus a stag??? These are all very important items in the book and should have been included somehow. I almost got the feeling that the person writing the screenplay breezed through book 3 and figured he could use the storyline as a basis for his version, especially by including many scenes that didn't happen...like the animal sounds scene and the bird/whomping willow scenes. Take those out and add more details from the book. The movie could easily have been longer to give more depth to the relationships between the major characters or to give us more of a sense of being at Hogwarts.There was also very little reference to Scabbers or the Grim sightings. What about Crookshanks and all his involvement? Did the students ever go to class? They were rarely seen in school. And when will someone finally add Peeves to the movies???In my opinion, the special effects were not fantastic enough to use as a tradeoff for lack of details.While many of the ideas from the book were used, they were taken out of context, or used out of sequence. People who love the books for how they have been written, and liked the first 2 movies for their ability to stay as true to the books as possible will be disappointed by this movies "creative license".I won't go see this movie in the theatre again, and may not even buy it on DVD when it comes out. I'd rather read the book a few more times.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am shocked to see that this movie is not getting rave reviews from everyone! I am at a loss to see where anyone could criticize it; I assume they must be fans of the movies only and not the books. Yes, this movie is "darker" than the previous two. Readers of the books will know that each book leads Harry one step closer to the eventual (long-awaited) ultimate showdown with Voldemort, so each book is a little darker, and a little more suspenseful and thus each movie will be a little darker and more suspenseful.The three young actors in the Harry Potter series become more and more delightful with every movie. Their acting skills improve with age, and according to my pre-teen son and daughter, so does their "hotness" level. My husband and I, my four children and my own parents (ages ranging from 2 years to 51 years of age) all went to see this movie together. We all came out loving it and each of us had a favorite line or scene from the movie. There is something in it that each and every person can enjoy.While it can be a little frightening for the younger kids, and I wouldn't recommend it to parents whose young children are prone to nightmares, it is a fun and wonderful movie.

He also brings key scenes that might have not been touched on very much in the books to exciting life, the knight bus sequence for instance was really a hoot and a lot of fun to watch.The acting is getting much better as the kids age. We can expect that as they mature, their acting will as well. It is a lot of fun to look at how the three have changed over the films and I hope they don't replace them for the last 4 films (Emma Watson is going to be hot when she's older...).The creatures are getting a lot cooler. When I read the book when it first came out I was really exited about seeing the Dementors on screen and when I did I was well pleased...they are the coolest and scariest monsters in the series yet and I wanted more scenes from them (and in future movies they will come). Buckbeak the Hippogrif was also very well done (and a lot less annoying than Dobby), they did a good job of making him real and believable.All in all this is my favorite Harry Potter film, it went by the quickest out of the three and I think it will be more accepted by those not too interested in the books as a great fantasy film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After waiting for what seemed an eternity, I finally saw my favorite Harry Potter book on screen. I was terribly disappointed! There was so much depth from J.K. Rowlings book that was left out or simply trampled on by this new director. I was thrilled to see Gary Oldman on screen. However, the interaction between all of the characters seemed forced. Potter purists may come from this new movie unfulfilled. I truly hope that a new director is chosen to bring the Goblet of Fire to the screen and give us what we have come to expect. I must say that the portrayal of Buckbeak was right on the money. I don't know if the screen writers were trying to avoid another three hour movie but I am sure I speak for thousands when I say, we would have gladly sat four hours or more for a chance to see a genuine portrayal of emotions and ties that were captured in the books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sorely disappointed when I watched this movie, especially since it is my favorite book of the series. The part I found most disturbing was the fact that the setting was all changed. Hagrid's hunt was in a noticeably different location, and everything from the paintings and certain structural differences in the castle were glaringly obvious. I was also really disappointed when they took the liberty of adding in their own scenes that had nothing to do with the book, like the shrunken heads, for instance, and the part were the boys are in the dormitory making animal noises. Now, I understand that certain liberties need to be taken when translating a book into a movie, but I felt they went to far. The movie was really busy and noisy and I felt it took away from the whole plot. I felt they did do a good job with Buckbeak, but the werewolf looked more like a mix between an alien and a skinny, hairless ape. It's going to take me a while to get used to this movie, and I'm not sure I ever will. I just hope the next one isn't so disappointing, especially if I'm going to wait in line for 4 hours to get tickets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this third installment of the Harry Potter franchise, the action is much more fast-paced, the characters more developed (for the good or the bad) and the cinematography much, much darker. For those who have read the books, the many cuts in the movie will seem annoyingly numerous. For those who have not read the books, the plot is somewhat hard to follow, especially at the end. To all purists out there (including myself), there will surely be many objections to the changes made to the movie. First of all, the entire story of Sirius Black was, in my opinion, cut too short. Many memorable scenes and explanations, such as the nicknames Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs, were omitted and many elements of the Harry Potter universe has been changed. For example, there is much more wandless magic, something J.K. Rowling has yet to precise, and some characters (i.e. Hermione and dementors) have been modified. Also, there are many Muggle objects that seem to work in Hogwarts. And I thought that electricity could not function in the castle...Hermione suddenly seems much more prominent in this one, while Ron takes a back-seat to all the aciton. With all due respect to Alfonso Cuaron, many modifications he made to this character bother me greatly. Hermione is no longer a bookworm, nor does she spends her time studying anymore and for god's sake, even her hair isn't bushy. She has morphed into some kind of refined and almost preppy teenager. While many of the characters are far from what I had imagined (Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Tom, the Leaky Cauldron innkeeper and even Sybil Trenawley), once you accept them as they are presented, they fit quite well in the plot. However, one minor detail that has always bothered me was Harry's physical appearance. His hair is finally messy and tousled (but still not black...), but his eyes, whom are mentioned several times, are NOT GREEN!!! How hard can it be to make him wear colored contacts? Furthermore, while Micheal Gambon is a great actor, his performance is somewhat different to Richard Harris'(may he rest in peace). And what happened to Goyle?On the good side, many of the children's performances have greatly improved and the special effects are just incredible. The hipogriff and the dementors appear unbelievably real. Speaking of dementors, I must say that they are very different to how I personally imagined them (Where in the books does it say that they can fly and freeze liquids???)Overall, the action and suspense (kudos to John Williams for the great score, once again) are great, the cinematography superb and the casting appropriate ( Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith should have had more screen time). Your money is worth this movie. My only great complain lies in the general feeling of this movie. I somehow felt that it was empty and full of holes and at the end, it felt a bit shallow and incomplete. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many important details from the book were left out in the movie.*Contains Spoilers*The animosity between Snape, and Lupin, Black, Pettigrew, and James Potter was never really explained. Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs are never explained. Who created the Marauder's Map is never explained. Why was Harry's patronus a stag??? These are all very important items in the book and should have been included somehow. I almost got the feeling that the person writing the screenplay breezed through book 3 and figured he could use the storyline as a basis for his version, especially by including many scenes that didn't happen...like the animal sounds scene and the bird/whomping willow scenes. Take those out and add more details from the book. The movie could easily have been longer to give more depth to the relationships between the major characters or to give us more of a sense of being at Hogwarts.There was also very little reference to Scabbers or the Grim sightings. What about Crookshanks and all his involvement? Did the students ever go to class? They were rarely seen in school. And when will someone finally add Peeves to the movies???In my opinion, the special effects were not fantastic enough to use as a tradeoff for lack of details.While many of the ideas from the book were used, they were taken out of context, or used out of sequence. People who love the books for how they have been written, and liked the first 2 movies for their ability to stay as true to the books as possible will be disappointed by this movies "creative license".I won't go see this movie in the theatre again, and may not even buy it on DVD when it comes out.

		<fullReview>I am shocked to see that this movie is not getting rave reviews from everyone! I am at a loss to see where anyone could criticize it; I assume they must be fans of the movies only and not the books. Yes, this movie is "darker" than the previous two. Readers of the books will know that each book leads Harry one step closer to the eventual (long-awaited) ultimate showdown with Voldemort, so each book is a little darker, and a little more suspenseful and thus each movie will be a little darker and more suspenseful.The three young actors in the Harry Potter series become more and more delightful with every movie. Their acting skills improve with age, and according to my pre-teen son and daughter, so does their "hotness" level. My husband and I, my four children and my own parents (ages ranging from 2 years to 51 years of age) all went to see this movie together. We all came out loving it and each of us had a favorite line or scene from the movie. There is something in it that each and every person can enjoy.While it can be a little frightening for the younger kids, and I wouldn't recommend it to parents whose young children are prone to nightmares, it is a fun and wonderful movie. The scenery of the English countryside is absolutely breathtaking and scenes with Harry and the Hippogriff flying across the landscape are amazing - you would swear that the creature is real!There were parts of the movie that were hilarious as well. There are also some cute moments between the group of friends and we start to see a young romance blossom. Overall, I think it touches all of the ranges of emotion, has some amazing actors and actresses, terrific special effects and beautiful scenery. Lovers of the Harry Potter book series will adore seeing the things they have imagined brought to live. Fans of the movies will find that this one is a bit different, but still wonderful, and hopefully it will inspire them to read the books!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes, Change is Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading some of the comments and reviews for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and most of what I have read have been comments on how disappointing the overall movie itself was. Especially to the people who have read all of the books and who are adamant on staying faithful to the books and having the whole story involved in the film. Some of the comments I agree with. Like for instance, the movie was a little bit choppy, certain scenes in the movie were not explained in full detail, and at times the scenery and props like the Whomping Willow , Hagrid's House, and Hogwarts itself was completely invisioned in a different way than what we were use to in Chris Columbus'first two versions and that can be a shock and in a way weird to us fans but Columbus and Cuaron' are two totally different directors and they each had an interpretation and vision of what Harry's world would look like. To me, Cuaron' captured a more realistic approach to the film and he allowed a more dark, organic, and even daring feel to POA. I think he did a great job of combining more natural elements with the world of magic. There is nothing wrong with change if you have an open enough mind to except it. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are growing into young adults with adult problems and adult situations and the overall tone of the film coincides with that growth. I give the man much respect and props for being so bold as to completely unveil his version of POA without the sugarcoating and child like qualities that the first two movies had. Harry Potter is geared towards children but all children grow up. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, like I said before in my first review, has it's minor filming flaws but was fantastic in my eyes and I can't wait for all of the other films. I will be very interested in how Mike Newell will interpret Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite excellent with a great visual sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron has done well in his first effort at Harry Potter. The third book is relatively well covered in terms of content of the film, and while it looks occasionally that it goes off topic, those points are finally meshed in a series of climactic scenes that tie up the final ending well.There are a couple of points I want to make about the film, and different areas that interested me as to how they would be handled.1. Richard Harris's death and the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. As Richard Harris's death was well publicized, and his replacement was picked early and people got a chance to see Gambon's Dumbledore through trailers, specials and news info, fans of HP could get used to him, and knew (or at the very least hoped) that he had the physical presence to handle the character. While I missed the wee bit of Irish brogue we knew from Harris, I felt very comfortable with Gambon's performance. His Dumbledore has a bit of an impish quality, I feel, and merry twinkles filled his eyes. I found myself smiling, as both his spirit and his qualities of leadership and intellect were intact.2. The kids. There have been rumors that the kids are getting too old to play the parts of the kids in the novel. Well, I hate to say this, but the kids "in the novel" ARE the kids in RL. The two are joined at the hip, and the characters in the novels ARE growing up. They're not cute little 11 year olds anymore--they are now 13-14, and they are entering their teenage years. As are the actors who are playing them. I heard JK Rowling herself say that Daniel, Emma and Rupert are the embodiments of Harry, Hermione and Ron, and I can see that way too. I think it would take away from the aging and the maturing of both the actors and the characters if they thought about replacing them with younger actors. We're seeing an incredible effort here in trying to maintain a sense of continuity. I don't think they should meddle with that.3. The director. Alfonso Cuaron hasn't done that many films, but I am a huge fan of his "A Little Princess" from 1995. If you haven't seen that film, you've missed a true and beautiful gem. "Princess" is a remake of France Hodgson Burnett's book, and an earlier Shirley Temple film. It is a wondrous and excellent film, and it makes me appreciate the man's wonderful ability to work with many children, and utilize the adults to work with the children with complete fluidity. In HP3, he brings out a wonderful mixture of emotions in all the characters and the actors who play them. He knows how to handle animals (including completely CGI ones!) as well, and makes us believe that the animals are more than just "actors" like the rest of the cast. Chris Columbus has grown up quite a bit since his early days as a director (think Gremlins), but Cuaron has a natural talent which is overwhelmingly rich and strong. I haven't seen other of his films, but I can't wait now to at least try to see them.4. The cinematography. In the first two movies, much of the film concentrated on the interior of the castle at Hogwarts, on the deepest darkest secrets of it, and in general were tools to help make Hogwarts into something with which its characters and the audience could be well familiar. The first movie, of course, concentrated on Harry's and the others' first glimpse and view of the School of Magic, and the second film concentrated on the legacy of Slytherin and Voldemort. In Prison of Azkaban, we are given an unfamiliar landscape, literally. Viewed in broad daylight, the Whomping Willow doesn't seem as scary as it did at night, but the forest beyond still holds a sense of mystery and wonder, both dark and benign at the same time. The cinematography shows expanses of beauty that stretch far beyond what the eye can see. The Scottish Highlands are so beautiful, and they are used to the best advantage in this film. When Harry takes the first ride on Buck Beak (a hippogriff, who is part horse and part eagle), the sense of freedom at flight is captured with great effect. And another flying scene, in the miserably handled Quidditch game also shows great emotion: Harry's run-in with the dementors is well handled with a visual sense of claustrophobia and despair. 5. The casting. I must admit the one film I knew David Thewlis from (Dragonheart) made me think he was a bit sniveling and nasty as the character he played in that other film. A fresh look at him through Remus Lupin made me very happy to see his excellent range and grasp of the particular character he plays in HP3. Lupin, the new Professor of the Dark Arts, is an old friend of Harry's dad. He is also a friend to Sirius Black, and another character who features in this installment. He is able to show a keen sense of empathy to Harry, as well as help Harry in learning defenses against the Dementors, and becomes a true friend to Harry. Emma Thompson comes on board as Professor Trelawney. If you have read the books, you know Trelawney will feature quite prominently in #5, The Order of the Phoenix. The introduction to the character shows her as rather eccentric, with a flair for the dramatic and whatever will garner her the strongest reactions. Keep watching her--she will be a force to reckon with at a point down the line. As far as Sirius Black, Gary Oldman is a perfect actor to play a man who has spent 12 years in a horrific dungeon prison, who's mind borders on the brink of insanity, but who is also very passionate. I'd tell you more, but then I'd have to kill you, right? There wasn't as much new casting other than these major characters, who will now be with the show in the 4th and 5th installments, and likely further down the line.For those who enjoy fantasy, this is an excellent film and a great installment in the Harry Potter universe. If you're an adult, you will find your sense of wonder returning faster than ever.</fullReview>

All of the special effects looked sooo real that i actually thought that it was happening and it was real. i sound like I'm ten which I'm really not. it was very the same as the books. and it was very well directed out of ten i give it a ten so you should go out and see it right now!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Page by Page Adaption this is not...Great Fantasy Film it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I should start by saying that if you are a die-hard anal-retentive fan of the books and you are expecting a page by page adaption sequentially than listen to an audio book because this is not what you are looking for. One thing I really enjoyed about this film in comparison to the other two is its new look and cinematography, it really captures the darkness of Rowlings book and I cannot wait to see what they will continue with in the future (the books only get darker). Cuaron is most definitely a stronger visual director and perhaps even a stronger transporter of the literary medium to film than Columbus was. He shows the wizarding world in a much more fun and colorful way than Columbus ever did and I sincerely hope that Cuaron stays on board for the upcoming films. He is excellent at showing lots of neat stuff going on around Harry that simply brings the world to life a lot more. He also brings key scenes that might have not been touched on very much in the books to exciting life, the knight bus sequence for instance was really a hoot and a lot of fun to watch.The acting is getting much better as the kids age.

We all came out loving it and each of us had a favorite line or scene from the movie. There is something in it that each and every person can enjoy.While it can be a little frightening for the younger kids, and I wouldn't recommend it to parents whose young children are prone to nightmares, it is a fun and wonderful movie. The scenery of the English countryside is absolutely breathtaking and scenes with Harry and the Hippogriff flying across the landscape are amazing - you would swear that the creature is real!There were parts of the movie that were hilarious as well. There are also some cute moments between the group of friends and we start to see a young romance blossom. Overall, I think it touches all of the ranges of emotion, has some amazing actors and actresses, terrific special effects and beautiful scenery. Lovers of the Harry Potter book series will adore seeing the things they have imagined brought to live. Fans of the movies will find that this one is a bit different, but still wonderful, and hopefully it will inspire them to read the books!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes, Change is Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading some of the comments and reviews for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and most of what I have read have been comments on how disappointing the overall movie itself was. Especially to the people who have read all of the books and who are adamant on staying faithful to the books and having the whole story involved in the film. Some of the comments I agree with. Like for instance, the movie was a little bit choppy, certain scenes in the movie were not explained in full detail, and at times the scenery and props like the Whomping Willow , Hagrid's House, and Hogwarts itself was completely invisioned in a different way than what we were use to in Chris Columbus'first two versions and that can be a shock and in a way weird to us fans but Columbus and Cuaron' are two totally different directors and they each had an interpretation and vision of what Harry's world would look like. To me, Cuaron' captured a more realistic approach to the film and he allowed a more dark, organic, and even daring feel to POA. I think he did a great job of combining more natural elements with the world of magic. There is nothing wrong with change if you have an open enough mind to except it. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are growing into young adults with adult problems and adult situations and the overall tone of the film coincides with that growth. I give the man much respect and props for being so bold as to completely unveil his version of POA without the sugarcoating and child like qualities that the first two movies had. Harry Potter is geared towards children but all children grow up. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, like I said before in my first review, has it's minor filming flaws but was fantastic in my eyes and I can't wait for all of the other films. I will be very interested in how Mike Newell will interpret Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite excellent with a great visual sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron has done well in his first effort at Harry Potter. The third book is relatively well covered in terms of content of the film, and while it looks occasionally that it goes off topic, those points are finally meshed in a series of climactic scenes that tie up the final ending well.There are a couple of points I want to make about the film, and different areas that interested me as to how they would be handled.1. Richard Harris's death and the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. As Richard Harris's death was well publicized, and his replacement was picked early and people got a chance to see Gambon's Dumbledore through trailers, specials and news info, fans of HP could get used to him, and knew (or at the very least hoped) that he had the physical presence to handle the character. While I missed the wee bit of Irish brogue we knew from Harris, I felt very comfortable with Gambon's performance. His Dumbledore has a bit of an impish quality, I feel, and merry twinkles filled his eyes. I found myself smiling, as both his spirit and his qualities of leadership and intellect were intact.2. The kids. There have been rumors that the kids are getting too old to play the parts of the kids in the novel. Well, I hate to say this, but the kids "in the novel" ARE the kids in RL. The two are joined at the hip, and the characters in the novels ARE growing up. They're not cute little 11 year olds anymore--they are now 13-14, and they are entering their teenage years. As are the actors who are playing them. I heard JK Rowling herself say that Daniel, Emma and Rupert are the embodiments of Harry, Hermione and Ron, and I can see that way too. I think it would take away from the aging and the maturing of both the actors and the characters if they thought about replacing them with younger actors. We're seeing an incredible effort here in trying to maintain a sense of continuity. I don't think they should meddle with that.3. The director. Alfonso Cuaron hasn't done that many films, but I am a huge fan of his "A Little Princess" from 1995. If you haven't seen that film, you've missed a true and beautiful gem. "Princess" is a remake of France Hodgson Burnett's book, and an earlier Shirley Temple film. It is a wondrous and excellent film, and it makes me appreciate the man's wonderful ability to work with many children, and utilize the adults to work with the children with complete fluidity. In HP3, he brings out a wonderful mixture of emotions in all the characters and the actors who play them. He knows how to handle animals (including completely CGI ones!) as well, and makes us believe that the animals are more than just "actors" like the rest of the cast. Chris Columbus has grown up quite a bit since his early days as a director (think Gremlins), but Cuaron has a natural talent which is overwhelmingly rich and strong. I haven't seen other of his films, but I can't wait now to at least try to see them.4. The cinematography. In the first two movies, much of the film concentrated on the interior of the castle at Hogwarts, on the deepest darkest secrets of it, and in general were tools to help make Hogwarts into something with which its characters and the audience could be well familiar. The first movie, of course, concentrated on Harry's and the others' first glimpse and view of the School of Magic, and the second film concentrated on the legacy of Slytherin and Voldemort. In Prison of Azkaban, we are given an unfamiliar landscape, literally. Viewed in broad daylight, the Whomping Willow doesn't seem as scary as it did at night, but the forest beyond still holds a sense of mystery and wonder, both dark and benign at the same time. The cinematography shows expanses of beauty that stretch far beyond what the eye can see. The Scottish Highlands are so beautiful, and they are used to the best advantage in this film. When Harry takes the first ride on Buck Beak (a hippogriff, who is part horse and part eagle), the sense of freedom at flight is captured with great effect. And another flying scene, in the miserably handled Quidditch game also shows great emotion: Harry's run-in with the dementors is well handled with a visual sense of claustrophobia and despair. 5. The casting. I must admit the one film I knew David Thewlis from (Dragonheart) made me think he was a bit sniveling and nasty as the character he played in that other film. A fresh look at him through Remus Lupin made me very happy to see his excellent range and grasp of the particular character he plays in HP3. Lupin, the new Professor of the Dark Arts, is an old friend of Harry's dad. He is also a friend to Sirius Black, and another character who features in this installment. He is able to show a keen sense of empathy to Harry, as well as help Harry in learning defenses against the Dementors, and becomes a true friend to Harry. Emma Thompson comes on board as Professor Trelawney. If you have read the books, you know Trelawney will feature quite prominently in #5, The Order of the Phoenix. The introduction to the character shows her as rather eccentric, with a flair for the dramatic and whatever will garner her the strongest reactions. Keep watching her--she will be a force to reckon with at a point down the line. As far as Sirius Black, Gary Oldman is a perfect actor to play a man who has spent 12 years in a horrific dungeon prison, who's mind borders on the brink of insanity, but who is also very passionate. I'd tell you more, but then I'd have to kill you, right? There wasn't as much new casting other than these major characters, who will now be with the show in the 4th and 5th installments, and likely further down the line.For those who enjoy fantasy, this is an excellent film and a great installment in the Harry Potter universe. If you're an adult, you will find your sense of wonder returning faster than ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Page by Page Adaption this is not...Great Fantasy Film it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I should start by saying that if you are a die-hard anal-retentive fan of the books and you are expecting a page by page adaption sequentially than listen to an audio book because this is not what you are looking for. One thing I really enjoyed about this film in comparison to the other two is its new look and cinematography, it really captures the darkness of Rowlings book and I cannot wait to see what they will continue with in the future (the books only get darker). Cuaron is most definitely a stronger visual director and perhaps even a stronger transporter of the literary medium to film than Columbus was. He shows the wizarding world in a much more fun and colorful way than Columbus ever did and I sincerely hope that Cuaron stays on board for the upcoming films. He is excellent at showing lots of neat stuff going on around Harry that simply brings the world to life a lot more. He also brings key scenes that might have not been touched on very much in the books to exciting life, the knight bus sequence for instance was really a hoot and a lot of fun to watch.The acting is getting much better as the kids age. We can expect that as they mature, their acting will as well. It is a lot of fun to look at how the three have changed over the films and I hope they don't replace them for the last 4 films (Emma Watson is going to be hot when she's older...).The creatures are getting a lot cooler. When I read the book when it first came out I was really exited about seeing the Dementors on screen and when I did I was well pleased...they are the coolest and scariest monsters in the series yet and I wanted more scenes from them (and in future movies they will come). Buckbeak the Hippogrif was also very well done (and a lot less annoying than Dobby), they did a good job of making him real and believable.All in all this is my favorite Harry Potter film, it went by the quickest out of the three and I think it will be more accepted by those not too interested in the books as a great fantasy film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay...but certainly not as good as the first 2!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many important details from the book were left out in the movie.*Contains Spoilers*The animosity between Snape, and Lupin, Black, Pettigrew, and James Potter was never really explained. Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs are never explained. Who created the Marauder's Map is never explained. Why was Harry's patronus a stag??? These are all very important items in the book and should have been included somehow. I almost got the feeling that the person writing the screenplay breezed through book 3 and figured he could use the storyline as a basis for his version, especially by including many scenes that didn't happen...like the animal sounds scene and the bird/whomping willow scenes. Take those out and add more details from the book. The movie could easily have been longer to give more depth to the relationships between the major characters or to give us more of a sense of being at Hogwarts.There was also very little reference to Scabbers or the Grim sightings. What about Crookshanks and all his involvement? Did the students ever go to class? They were rarely seen in school. And when will someone finally add Peeves to the movies???In my opinion, the special effects were not fantastic enough to use as a tradeoff for lack of details.While many of the ideas from the book were used, they were taken out of context, or used out of sequence. People who love the books for how they have been written, and liked the first 2 movies for their ability to stay as true to the books as possible will be disappointed by this movies "creative license".I won't go see this movie in the theatre again, and may not even buy it on DVD when it comes out. I'd rather read the book a few more times.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am shocked to see that this movie is not getting rave reviews from everyone! I am at a loss to see where anyone could criticize it; I assume they must be fans of the movies only and not the books. Yes, this movie is "darker" than the previous two. Readers of the books will know that each book leads Harry one step closer to the eventual (long-awaited) ultimate showdown with Voldemort, so each book is a little darker, and a little more suspenseful and thus each movie will be a little darker and more suspenseful.The three young actors in the Harry Potter series become more and more delightful with every movie. Their acting skills improve with age, and according to my pre-teen son and daughter, so does their "hotness" level.

		<shortDescription>WHAT WAS ONCE GOLD IS NOW LEAD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the travesty that was supposed to be the jewel of the Harry Potter series. I don't know where they got the director from but it was the biggest mistake ever. I loved the book and very much disliked this movie.The story was very rushed, left out a great deal of plot (and the story)and provided very little character development. After looking at the other reviews, I was glad to see that I was not alone in my total displeasure with this movie.The transitions between scenes were sloppy and I don't know about anyone else, but I found that whole "fade to the center" camera thing annoying to look at. The movements were very choppy and disconcerting. There was too much editing for cinematic "moments". So much time wasted on birds flying into trees and leaves falling. This is upsetting when you know how much of the actual story they cut to show you these "art house" moments. Why did he do the annoying shot under Robbie Coltrane's (Hagrid) nose. I felt like I was watching a hidden camera special...What was with the costumes? Hogwarts used to look like a place you paid to send your kids...now it's students look like they're in public school...I wonder if there is now graffiti in the bathrooms? It's supposed to be modeled on a British boarding school! Where were the fantastic supporting-actors that made this series a success. Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and the other highly contributing actors were exiled to the background. Chris Columbus was able to make "time" for everyone else and not lose the momentum on the plot.Why did the director have to mess with everything? Sets and historical locations included...Was his ego so big that he needed to make his mark on everything. He couldn't even keep the story straight. When a book is adapted to film, the true art, the magic, is when the fans watch the movie and it is as it was seen in their mind's eye when they read it. J.K. Rowlings made magic when she wrote the books and Chris Columbus showed us the magic. What was once the gold created by Chris Columbus has now become lead.No offense to the actors, who did their best regardless of the direction from a complete hack. I'm glad to see that the director was replaced for the fourth film. Hopefully his replacement can salvage this franchise, so we can ensure all the films will be made.ALL FANS..REGARDLESS OF THESE COMMENTS, SEE THE MOVIE! ONLY BY HAVING THESE MOVIES MAKE MONEY WILL THEIR SEQUELS BE MADE.MY REVIEW: 2 STARS AS A MOVIE - 0 STARS AS AN ADAPTATIONSAD, SAD, SAD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit disappointed, as The Prisoner of Azkaban was my favorite book, but, inevitably, as we progress into longer and more complicated books, more andmore will need to be cut out in order to condense them into feature-length films. The cinematography and music were better in this movie; the use of a hand- held camera feeling was particularly effective in the "muggle-world" scenes, and the atmosphere throughout the film was nicely and artistically constructed. The scenes themselves, however, had a very distinct feeling of disjointedness,which led to a less powerful climax than desired. The plot, of course, is excellent, quite closely following Ms. Rowling's writings, although it seemed that many details (especially concerning Mooney WormtailProngs and Padfoot) were tossed to the wayside. As I said earlier, it is inevitable of course that details are abandoned in the condensation process, but I havethe feeling that someone who has not read the books would not entirelyunderstand this movie. This may or may not be a huge problem, as most of itspatrons will most likely be in fact fans of the books, but it remains a bit of a problem. My biggest qualm was with the portrayal of characters. It was not a problem of acting, per se-- David Thewes and Michael Gambon were acceptable, AlanRickman was splendid as usual-- but rather a combination of writing, acting, and casting. Lupin in particular seemed an entirely different character than the one read about in the books-- he was a mentor/father figure, yes, but in the film seemed to lack any other traits. In general, the character seemed to be played rather blandly. Michael Gambon was fine as Dumbledore, and Richard Harris'sshoes are large ones to fill indeed, but left a little something to be desired. Alan Rickman is fantastic, but the character of Snape becomes a bit snively and loses a bit of his power in this film, which is unfortunate. A wonderful performance was given, however, by the lovely Emma Thompson in the role of the superstitiousdivination professor Trelawny; I only would've liked to see more of her. Thethree students (Potter, Granger, and Weasely) were perfectly well-played, with good performances around, especially by Miss Emma Watson. The three youngactors, whose slightly weak performances and immaturity I questioned in earlier films, have obviously grown tremendously as actors and are coming into theirown quite nicely. All in all, The Prisoner of Azkaban was all right. Each individual scene was well- made-- visually, acting-wise, music-wise, even in the writing-- but the film simply did not flow. There enlies the problem with forcing a quite-long book into asingle movie: crucial information must either be skipped or awkwardlycondensed, and the result is a movie that is choppy, confusing, and disorienting. Micro-examined, it was a good film, but the big picture just didn't add up. 6/10.</fullReview>

It lacked continuity.Of the 5 books, my personal favourite is the 3rd book. So I naturally had high expectations from this movie. But I must admit, I was not excited about the movie after watching it.The movie not only skipped a LOT of stuff, probably for time allotment I think, but also changed some stuff. For example, seeing Padfoot in the Marauder's map or Professor Snape showing up too early in the wimping willow showdown etc were not depicted as in the book.Finally the kids are obviously growing up and it shows. We are used to seeing their childish faces and it seems like they are all grown ups now.I also must add that Malfoy seemed to have almost no role in this 3rd movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first say that I love the books, so I know automatically that the movies aren't going to satisfy me as well, but I loved the first two movies, and I was not satisfied with this one. First of all, and the biggest flaw, was the adaptation from book to movie. The book had rich detail in the new things readers discover at Hogwarts, while the movie talks about them for 2 minutes and forgets about them. To me, the books were so good because Rowling used amazing atmosphere to drive the story. Around every corner there is something new and fascinating happening, she describes happenings in the book in a way that lets you SEE what you are reading. Rowling succeeds more in giving us a visual picture by reading than the whole movie put together gives us. half of the movie is not like I imagined it in the book. Also, they shortened the dialogue I believe to keep the children's attention, and made the pace of the movie far too fast. Some people would consider this a great thing, but for me, after reading a 300 page book with great dialogue, I want to see some good conversations to further develop the characters. Ron Weasley, one of the main stars in the books(and previous movies) is given maybe, and that's just maybe, 6 or 7 lines in the entire movie!! The rest of the time he stands around holding Scabbers. Professor Mconagall is given one line and Dumbledore is given one good scene, and then completely disregarded. No one can replace Richard Harris as Dumbledore properly. So, I may be the only one that sees this, but making a movie that is fast paced like this, and forgetting about the characters is pointless. I would have rather had a 3 hour long movie with an actual plot intact than this 2 hour 20 minute mess. However there are some good things about this movie that force me to give a higher rating than you would expect. The opening of the movie is just right, and is exteremely funny to watch. Alfonso Cauron's vision for the movie is amazing as well. He has his own visual style for this one that is atmospheric most of the time. Some of the scenes are like I imagined in the book, but unfortunately many of the scenes were not, especially the demontors attack.  So, after it is all said and done I have to give this movie a B-. It may sound surprising after all the bad talk, but Cauron's vision is remarkable and compelling at times, and Sirius Black was portrayed perfectly. So everyone enjoy, but I just hope you won't be as dissappointed with the treatment of the characters and storyline as I was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far and Away, the Best of the Three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the only criteria you have for a Harry Potter movie is absolute fidelity to the book, then you will be disappointed in this one. But if you understand that the filmmakers (especially screenwriter Steve Kloves) need to condense the increasingly long novels into acceptable screen time while preserving their essence, then you are at the right stating point.They condense and take some liberties, but this movie looks and feels like Hogwarts in a way that the first two never did. It has a beautiful texture and look. The film is content to let magical things happen along the edges and the background without having to land heavily on each moment. The result is that you feel so much more a part of this world then you did previously. The three leads have improved wonderfully and I can now imagine them having post-Potter careers. There is no point in recapping the plot. If you are interested in the movie you no doubt read the book. Accept some differences from the sources, however, and you will enjoy the best Otter yet.</fullReview>

When I was watching the scene at the end with the package for Harry which was his new broom I was like, "That was supposed to happen at the second Quidditch match." It's not a must see movie but I have to admit that the special effects were pretty cool.I also have to admit that it was very different and I liked the new director's new interpretation of the story. But still, like the second one, there could of been scenes from the book that would have made this movie more special. I conclude with this, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is inadequate and is not the movie of the year."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different spin (possible plot spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I gotta say, I enjoyed it. Probably not as much as I thought I would, but I'd definitely see it again. It was everything I expected and yet not at all.Cuaron definitely brought a new spin to the wonderful world of Potter with a darker, more serious spin on an enchanting tale. There is however, just enough whimsy to let you know you are indeed watching a Harry Potter film. I don't know if it was Klove's writing or Cuaron's direction, but there is a definite growth of the characters and in the story telling. While the first two films matched closely to the book, deviating only a little the third film makes it known that this is an adaptation not a recreation. There is definitely a change of focus in that it is not on the overall story, but on one main event. In doing so, there is something reminiscent of M. Knight Shamalan's 'The Sixth Sense'. I gotta say I liked that. The characters themselves have grown and you can see that. There are also times when you look at all of them and say: yeah, these are real kids. They could be your own kids or the kids next door. In that alone, you can almost forget they're at a school for witchcraft and there are flying fantasy creatures carrying them about. The movie like the books takes the more serious darker spin and runs with it. I truly did enjoy the film, but unlike Chamber of Secrets, I didn't entirely know what I was getting into. The formula was discarded and we had to begin again. My fear would be that people will see this film with the first two in mind and be left shell-shocked or disgusted. The differences are like night and day. It's like going to into an ice cream shop and ordering the pink ice cream assuming it must be strawberry and finding out it's lemon. Lemon's a good flavor, but it's just not what you expected and quite possibly wanted. There were children in the theater younger than 8 years old, and if the film were more like the first two, I wouldn't have been bothered, but for me, this film is perhaps a little too dark and scary and a bit above their heads. The more I think about it, the more I love this film, but as I feel with the books, the films are entering times that are not necessarily suitable for younger viewers. All in all though, it was quite enjoyable and I'd see it again. My only advice is that no one see the film expecting anything. Just go in and enjoy!</fullReview>

These are probably the same people who were complaining that things were left out of 'The Lord of the Rings'.If they tried to film the third book the way it was written, it would be a five hour movie!All I can say is, get used to it people, because as the books get longer and longer, they are going to have to cut more and more to make the movies.Just enjoy the books and the movies seperately and you will be fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was much less faithful to the book than the earlier movies. Many details were left out and others were changed. The changes were well done, though, as they made the movie flow smoothly and be much more dramatic. On the whole, this was the best of the three.The actors playing Harry, Ron &amp; Hermione are really coming into their own. They do a great job together. The new actor playing Dumbledore is better than the earlier one. Of course, it's sad that the first one died, but it's nice that we've got this actor now.Unfortunately, if you haven't read the book, you're not going to understand some of what happened, because critical linking facts were left out. But, well, you should read the book.One thing that was interesting was that the book was much sunnier than the movie. The movie is dark, suspenseful, and frightening, while the book was still in the more cheerful mode of the earlier two. Perhaps the director realized, from reading the fifth book, that the series as a whole was going to get darker, and figured it would be better to foreshadow that, rather than making the change of mood so abrupt as it actually is in the books.Another interesting thing is that the marketing people are clearly positioning this as a teenage movie rather than a kids movie. All the previews at the beginning were for teenage type movies.I also noticed, by the way, that there was much more than the usual amount of advertizing before the movie started. They must have realized in advance that they had a great captive audience.I am a bit concerned about what they're going to do for the fourth book. They had to leave out so much to make this movie. The fourth book is almost twice as long as this one. What massacre of the story will be involved, do you suppose? Perhaps they'll have the foresight to make the fourth book into 2 movies. I've often thought that Rowling herself ought to be dividing up these later books into more than one volume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit disappointed, as The Prisoner of Azkaban was my favorite book, but, inevitably, as we progress into longer and more complicated books, more andmore will need to be cut out in order to condense them into feature-length films. The cinematography and music were better in this movie; the use of a hand- held camera feeling was particularly effective in the "muggle-world" scenes, and the atmosphere throughout the film was nicely and artistically constructed. The scenes themselves, however, had a very distinct feeling of disjointedness,which led to a less powerful climax than desired. The plot, of course, is excellent, quite closely following Ms. Rowling's writings, although it seemed that many details (especially concerning Mooney WormtailProngs and Padfoot) were tossed to the wayside. As I said earlier, it is inevitable of course that details are abandoned in the condensation process, but I havethe feeling that someone who has not read the books would not entirelyunderstand this movie. This may or may not be a huge problem, as most of itspatrons will most likely be in fact fans of the books, but it remains a bit of a problem. My biggest qualm was with the portrayal of characters. It was not a problem of acting, per se-- David Thewes and Michael Gambon were acceptable, AlanRickman was splendid as usual-- but rather a combination of writing, acting, and casting. Lupin in particular seemed an entirely different character than the one read about in the books-- he was a mentor/father figure, yes, but in the film seemed to lack any other traits. In general, the character seemed to be played rather blandly. Michael Gambon was fine as Dumbledore, and Richard Harris'sshoes are large ones to fill indeed, but left a little something to be desired. Alan Rickman is fantastic, but the character of Snape becomes a bit snively and loses a bit of his power in this film, which is unfortunate. A wonderful performance was given, however, by the lovely Emma Thompson in the role of the superstitiousdivination professor Trelawny; I only would've liked to see more of her. Thethree students (Potter, Granger, and Weasely) were perfectly well-played, with good performances around, especially by Miss Emma Watson. The three youngactors, whose slightly weak performances and immaturity I questioned in earlier films, have obviously grown tremendously as actors and are coming into theirown quite nicely.

		<shortDescription>Now we're getting somewhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love the Harry Potter books (can't convert my friends, but that's alright) and have read all 5 of them, and the 3rd is far and away my favorite. I mean, they're all great, but for me the third just falls together so perfectly, it felt a little like a reward for reading the first two books. And now I feel the same way about "Prisoner of Azkaban," it's like a reward for sitting through the first two movies.Don't get me wrong, Chris Columbus did a fantastic job with the first two. Much like Harry himself, I watched in awe as he wandered around Hogwarts, every little detail was perfect. But while I really liked it, my friend who hadn't read the book fell asleep. Same with the second, I stared in awe, my friend kept asking when it was over.I was more than skeptical that the director of the sex-romp, Y Tu Mama Tambien, was directing my beloved Harry, but now I kind of wish he would direct them from here on out. Harry was finally able to break out of the idealized little boy, worshipped by 10 year old around the world, who kind of beat the bad guys out of dumb luck in the first two movies and became more real. He's hotheaded sometimes, but also very insecure about who he is and where he came from, and really faces his fears.This movie is only 10 minutes shorter than the first, and 20 shorted than the second, but it felt like it was 45 minutes shorter. The pace really picked up (by getting rid of some of the pomp and circumstance the first two sometimes focused on) the tone is darker, and even though I knew what happened I was still very excited. And my friend (same friend) only asked if it was almost over once, and there was only 10 minutes left.As much as I liked the first two movies, it's nice to see a Harry Potter movie get over itself and not play like the longest kids ad ever. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the new Harry Potter movie today, and although I liked it, it had a very different feel to it. Even my son noted that Hagrids Hut had been moved, the area surrounding the school looked very different, etc...I own all the books and the first 2 movies on DVD and have watched them numerous times, and it was strange to see Hermione, Harry and Ron in street clothes as opposed to their school robes. The quidditch match was VERY short, and Cho was not mentioned at all. The way one would stop the Whomping Willow was changed from pushing a stump to using a spell and wand, and Draco went from being a villain worthy of Harry to a wimp in one film. I felt the time travel aspect of the film was reminiscent of Back To The Future II, whereas I didn't get that feeling reading the book. I'll always be a fan, but I enjoyed the look and feel of the first 2 films more than this one, and hope the author retains the control for the fourth film that she obviously didn't for this one, as Goblet of Fire was my favorite harry potter book so far, and I'd hate to see it condensed to the extent that this one was.</fullReview>

But the film lacked a great story. There was so much left out of what happened in the book, and it went way too fast! I don't see how the longest book can turn into the shortest movie. I would have gladly sat through an extra half-hour to further develop the details of the story and characters. As I read in a magazine before I saw the film, Columbus is storyteller, and Cuaron is an artist. It's so true. Give me a great story any day!</fullReview>

Like the whomping willow it went from enormous car killing tree to this thing that looks like its no larger than Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid). Another thing about Hagrid is his home seems quite nomadic these days and move around quite well. I think the new characters had very good actors to play out there rolls including the new Dumbledore. But speaking of new characters I kind of missed Sir Cadogan's comedic sarcasm and witicism. I also believe we all missed a good little stroll down Diagon Alley and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's little argument. As others here have already explained the relationships between the adults in the book were missing, which not only thickened the plot but it helped some others know what is going on. I also wish to believe that I did see the great Quidditch Cup match with the FIREBOLT somewhere in the middle of the story, but no we had to see it at the end and not enjoy....ARGh</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The color palette of this movie is cold and spooky, starting from the metallic WB logo at the outset. The use of silver and gray made the film look sharp and less over-blown than the first two in the series. I liked the use of several key sets of Hogwarts, JK Rowling-approved additions of a courtyard, a bridge and a move down a hill for Hagrid's cabin. The story remained blissfully faithful (as near as I could remember) to the time-travel shenanigans of the book. Harry and Hermione actually seemed to act and not just react. The wizards-in-training seem to spend more time in jeans than in robes, which I found a bit jarring. Quite a good little movie!</fullReview>

This movie could have been great, but instead, this director with a total lack of talent butchered one of the better Potter stories. Its understandable that pieces will have to be cut out, but this was just terribly done. It was like he didn't even read the story, he just wanted to show everyone that he knows how to use special effects and different camera angles. From the very start, important pieces of the plot of the story were missing, and in their place were shaky-shots (which were intended to be shaky, but looked terrible nonetheless) and attempted uses of dramatic effects. This movie had absolutely NO continuity with the last two movies whatsoever. It appeared that it wasn't even attempted. The movie lost a lot of its "magical" feel with the lack of proper costume, owing again, to the lack of continuity. So, the movie is here, we all waited for it with great excitement and anticipation, and it was a total disappointment. I guess the only good thing to look forward to in the next movie of the series is that they changed directors.. thank goodness. *PLEASE make the next movie(s) follow the path of the first two... please!!*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to the story and characters?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was seriously excited for this movie and was really disappointed. I didn't mind the differences. I didn't care that the Firebolt was thrown out at the end, the dementors froze stuff and flew, the school looked different.Whatever... there's only so much time and I like the new look. But what I will not excuse is the poor story-telling and character development. I am seriously obsessed with the series. This was my favorite book until book five. But I really felt that this movie was boring. Half-way through it I was seriously tired. It lagged but it was RUSHED?! How does a director do this?! The story and lines were sappy and crappy. I felt nothing for the characters. It was like I was dragged through something.What I hate was that there were scenes included that didn't need to be in there! What's with the lame jokes? Use this time to develop the story and characters better! And why was it so sappy?! I almost wanted to tear my hair out! This was a serious insult to J.K. Rowling's wit, humor, and writing. Even to Harry. Just look at how Harry reacts to Rita Skeeter's article in book four.What I do have to say for the director was that the children were much better in their roles. But the adults?! In the two previous movies their characters were flawless. They added depth to them. But now... they're just muddled, one-dimensional, and overacting. Why is Hagrid a stupid oaf? Why is Dumbledore so goofy? Why is Lupin so sleazy?My biggest gripe is the scene with Madam Rosmerta. This is where Harry finds out what happens to his parents! His parents best friend betrayed them and thus left him parentless and almost killed! WHY RUSH THIS SCENE?!?! This is one of the best stories from Harry's past that seriously affects him. The anger and betrayal. They totally destroyed one of my favorite scenes of the series.BAD, BAD, BAD!!! I hated the movie. I go see movies for a good story. Special effects, cinematography, sets, costumes, etc. are supposed to enhance the movie, not hold it together. Look at Lord of the Rings. They had everything together. They pleased everyone, readers and non-readers. Why can't you do this for a series that so many people love?! And this is the third book! Even J.K. Rowling said that if she had to choose one it would be the third.All in all, I really, really hated it. I'm so sad he butchered one of the best books in the series. I really hope they choose a better director who understands that Harry Potter isn't really about the monsters and magic but about how multi-dimensional the characters are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3rd movie was good, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be overly critical seeing as for me and many others the 3rd book is the favorite of the so far 5 book series. It was well casted and the information was given in a good way, and let's be honest, the special effects were great. The 3rd book being my favorite, and having read it many times, I knew what was going on at every instant of the 2hr 21min film. There were times though, when I was a bit perplexed. There were many things put out of order (there is my overly-critical side kicking up again) and there were things that weren't in the book that could have been omitted to make room for several scenes that I think to be crucial. My examples and reasons are as follows:1. My favorite part of the book is when Snape tries to reveal the true purpose of the Marauder's Map. And there is a message from each member of the club (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs) This was really funny in the book, I was dying to see it in the movie2. The letter from Sirius: On the train home from Hogwarts Harry recieves a letter from Sirius explaining the origin of the firebolt, and Sirius' status, Ron also recieves an owl named Pigwidgeon, seeing as the owl shows up in book four it might have been a good idea to present him in movie 33. The debriefing from Lupin: near the end, Prof. Lupin explains who Moony Padfoot Prongs and Wormtail were. he explains a little bit more about James too4. Finally, the debriefing from Dumbledore: This is supposed to be a constant in every single book, so I thought the movies might have wanted to be the same. He explains about his patronus and more about Harry.These were the only things I think that could have made the 3rd movie go from really good to really great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first HP movie that lived up to the books - really great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that the movies keep getting better. The first was a dog. This one was really great. The Hippogryph was unbelievable. I don't think i've ever seen a non-humanoid monster look so real. There were some shortcuts in the story line that, had i not read the book, might have left me a little bewildered. But i did, and i loved it! Very exciting! Hope the rest turn out this good..There have been some posts that claim this movie is too dark, i would agree that it's not as "zany" as the first movie. But at this stage of the book series, the story gets darker. If you want Zany go watch an Adam Sandler movie. This was a very good portrayal of the book.- Matt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that as the books get longer there is more and more that needs to be condensed into the typical two and a half hour movie, but when such crucial characters and story lines that are pivotal for future movies are left out, i have to wonder if there even planning on finishing The Goblet of Fire. Daniel, Emma, and Rupert did yet again an amazing job, but after hearing there E! interviews, and how excited for this movie, i'm left guessing if they ever read the books. ARGH!, they left out Cedric Diggory, they didn't explain why Harry Patronum is a stag, they barely explained Hermione's schedule conflicts, and David Thewlis is a wonderful Prof. Lupin, but they cut his role in half!But i think what i have to say irked me the most, and i know its stupid but i'm a costume fan, is that Fudge's hat isn't green! Such a simple thing, and they forgot it! enough ranting, if you love the books, the movie will leave you fuming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Brilliant!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using our previous knowledge of the Harry Potter universe to his advantage, Alfonso Cuaron has created the first sophisticated film foray into the world of wizards, witches, werewolves and hippogriffs. Cuaron benefits from the experience his lead actors have in performing these roles in two prior films. Dan Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron have all become these characters before our eyes, and it is wonderful to watch.Michael Gambon does a fine job replacing Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson hams it up as the spaced-out Divination teacher, Professor Trelawny.Gary Oldman is good as escaped-prisoner Sirius Black. He doesn't have much to do, but what he does works well. I look forward to seeing more of him as the series continues.Of all the adult actors, my highest praise must go to David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Thewlis was assigned the task of bringing to life one of the best-loved characters of the Rowling books, and has done so magnificently.This review wouldn't be complete without mention of the overall tone of the film. This of course is due to the amazing direction of Alfonso Cuaron. Everything about this film is in stark contrast to the first two offerings by Chris Columbus. By no means does this belittle Columbus' two Potter films. I enjoyed them very much. However, I must say that this third chapter was the most satisfying of the three. I believe it's because, as strange as this may sound, everything felt more "real." There wasn't this sense of wonderment that was ever-present during the first two films. In "Azkaban," everything in the wizarding world is just matter-of-fact, and that in itself is magical.Also of note is the fine special effects in the film. Buckbeak, the hippogriff, looked absolutely amazing - like a real animal. Those horrifying guards of Azkaban, the Dementors, were just the right touch of scary. It's tough to keep them from looking like the Black Riders from Lord Of The Rings, but their mouths are all their own and are truly frightening!In all, an absolutely fantastic film, and one that I am sure to see several times over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This had a different feel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the new Harry Potter movie today, and although I liked it, it had a very different feel to it. Even my son noted that Hagrids Hut had been moved, the area surrounding the school looked very different, etc...I own all the books and the first 2 movies on DVD and have watched them numerous times, and it was strange to see Hermione, Harry and Ron in street clothes as opposed to their school robes. The quidditch match was VERY short, and Cho was not mentioned at all. The way one would stop the Whomping Willow was changed from pushing a stump to using a spell and wand, and Draco went from being a villain worthy of Harry to a wimp in one film. I felt the time travel aspect of the film was reminiscent of Back To The Future II, whereas I didn't get that feeling reading the book. I'll always be a fan, but I enjoyed the look and feel of the first 2 films more than this one, and hope the author retains the control for the fourth film that she obviously didn't for this one, as Goblet of Fire was my favorite harry potter book so far, and I'd hate to see it condensed to the extent that this one was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I so wanted to love this movie! But it's not nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. Parts of the movie have improved over the other two films, but it also lost something they had. The acting was awesome--the kids have so much improved, and Alan Rickman and Gary Oldman were superb, as usual. And the visuals, the camera work, and the scenery were fantastic. But the film lacked a great story. There was so much left out of what happened in the book, and it went way too fast! I don't see how the longest book can turn into the shortest movie. I would have gladly sat through an extra half-hour to further develop the details of the story and characters. As I read in a magazine before I saw the film, Columbus is storyteller, and Cuaron is an artist. It's so true. Give me a great story any day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!!SPOILERS!!!!I would like to say that I think Alfonso Cuaron did a good job and didn't butcher it too bad. One thing he should've done was not mess with the set. Like the whomping willow it went from enormous car killing tree to this thing that looks like its no larger than Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid). Another thing about Hagrid is his home seems quite nomadic these days and move around quite well. I think the new characters had very good actors to play out there rolls including the new Dumbledore. But speaking of new characters I kind of missed Sir Cadogan's comedic sarcasm and witicism. I also believe we all missed a good little stroll down Diagon Alley and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's little argument. As others here have already explained the relationships between the adults in the book were missing, which not only thickened the plot but it helped some others know what is going on. I also wish to believe that I did see the great Quidditch Cup match with the FIREBOLT somewhere in the middle of the story, but no we had to see it at the end and not enjoy....ARGh</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The color palette of this movie is cold and spooky, starting from the metallic WB logo at the outset. The use of silver and gray made the film look sharp and less over-blown than the first two in the series. I liked the use of several key sets of Hogwarts, JK Rowling-approved additions of a courtyard, a bridge and a move down a hill for Hagrid's cabin. The story remained blissfully faithful (as near as I could remember) to the time-travel shenanigans of the book. Harry and Hermione actually seemed to act and not just react. The wizards-in-training seem to spend more time in jeans than in robes, which I found a bit jarring. Quite a good little movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to the story and characters?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was seriously excited for this movie and was really disappointed. I didn't mind the differences. I didn't care that the Firebolt was thrown out at the end, the dementors froze stuff and flew, the school looked different.Whatever... there's only so much time and I like the new look. But what I will not excuse is the poor story-telling and character development. I am seriously obsessed with the series. This was my favorite book until book five. But I really felt that this movie was boring. Half-way through it I was seriously tired. It lagged but it was RUSHED?! How does a director do this?! The story and lines were sappy and crappy. I felt nothing for the characters. It was like I was dragged through something.What I hate was that there were scenes included that didn't need to be in there! What's with the lame jokes? Use this time to develop the story and characters better! And why was it so sappy?! I almost wanted to tear my hair out! This was a serious insult to J.K. Rowling's wit, humor, and writing. Even to Harry. Just look at how Harry reacts to Rita Skeeter's article in book four.What I do have to say for the director was that the children were much better in their roles. But the adults?! In the two previous movies their characters were flawless. They added depth to them. But now... they're just muddled, one-dimensional, and overacting. Why is Hagrid a stupid oaf? Why is Dumbledore so goofy? Why is Lupin so sleazy?My biggest gripe is the scene with Madam Rosmerta. This is where Harry finds out what happens to his parents! His parents best friend betrayed them and thus left him parentless and almost killed! WHY RUSH THIS SCENE?!?! This is one of the best stories from Harry's past that seriously affects him. The anger and betrayal. They totally destroyed one of my favorite scenes of the series.BAD, BAD, BAD!!! I hated the movie. I go see movies for a good story. Special effects, cinematography, sets, costumes, etc. are supposed to enhance the movie, not hold it together. Look at Lord of the Rings. They had everything together. They pleased everyone, readers and non-readers. Why can't you do this for a series that so many people love?! And this is the third book! Even J.K. Rowling said that if she had to choose one it would be the third.All in all, I really, really hated it. I'm so sad he butchered one of the best books in the series. I really hope they choose a better director who understands that Harry Potter isn't really about the monsters and magic but about how multi-dimensional the characters are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3rd movie was good, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be overly critical seeing as for me and many others the 3rd book is the favorite of the so far 5 book series. It was well casted and the information was given in a good way, and let's be honest, the special effects were great. The 3rd book being my favorite, and having read it many times, I knew what was going on at every instant of the 2hr 21min film. There were times though, when I was a bit perplexed. There were many things put out of order (there is my overly-critical side kicking up again) and there were things that weren't in the book that could have been omitted to make room for several scenes that I think to be crucial. My examples and reasons are as follows:1. My favorite part of the book is when Snape tries to reveal the true purpose of the Marauder's Map. And there is a message from each member of the club (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs) This was really funny in the book, I was dying to see it in the movie2. The letter from Sirius: On the train home from Hogwarts Harry recieves a letter from Sirius explaining the origin of the firebolt, and Sirius' status, Ron also recieves an owl named Pigwidgeon, seeing as the owl shows up in book four it might have been a good idea to present him in movie 33. The debriefing from Lupin: near the end, Prof. Lupin explains who Moony Padfoot Prongs and Wormtail were. he explains a little bit more about James too4. Finally, the debriefing from Dumbledore: This is supposed to be a constant in every single book, so I thought the movies might have wanted to be the same. He explains about his patronus and more about Harry.These were the only things I think that could have made the 3rd movie go from really good to really great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first HP movie that lived up to the books - really great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that the movies keep getting better. The first was a dog. This one was really great. The Hippogryph was unbelievable. I don't think i've ever seen a non-humanoid monster look so real. There were some shortcuts in the story line that, had i not read the book, might have left me a little bewildered. But i did, and i loved it! Very exciting! Hope the rest turn out this good..There have been some posts that claim this movie is too dark, i would agree that it's not as "zany" as the first movie. But at this stage of the book series, the story gets darker. If you want Zany go watch an Adam Sandler movie. This was a very good portrayal of the book.- Matt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that as the books get longer there is more and more that needs to be condensed into the typical two and a half hour movie, but when such crucial characters and story lines that are pivotal for future movies are left out, i have to wonder if there even planning on finishing The Goblet of Fire. Daniel, Emma, and Rupert did yet again an amazing job, but after hearing there E! interviews, and how excited for this movie, i'm left guessing if they ever read the books. ARGH!, they left out Cedric Diggory, they didn't explain why Harry Patronum is a stag, they barely explained Hermione's schedule conflicts, and David Thewlis is a wonderful Prof. Lupin, but they cut his role in half!But i think what i have to say irked me the most, and i know its stupid but i'm a costume fan, is that Fudge's hat isn't green! Such a simple thing, and they forgot it! enough ranting, if you love the books, the movie will leave you fuming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Brilliant!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using our previous knowledge of the Harry Potter universe to his advantage, Alfonso Cuaron has created the first sophisticated film foray into the world of wizards, witches, werewolves and hippogriffs. Cuaron benefits from the experience his lead actors have in performing these roles in two prior films. Dan Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron have all become these characters before our eyes, and it is wonderful to watch.Michael Gambon does a fine job replacing Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson hams it up as the spaced-out Divination teacher, Professor Trelawny.Gary Oldman is good as escaped-prisoner Sirius Black. He doesn't have much to do, but what he does works well. I look forward to seeing more of him as the series continues.Of all the adult actors, my highest praise must go to David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Thewlis was assigned the task of bringing to life one of the best-loved characters of the Rowling books, and has done so magnificently.This review wouldn't be complete without mention of the overall tone of the film. This of course is due to the amazing direction of Alfonso Cuaron. Everything about this film is in stark contrast to the first two offerings by Chris Columbus. By no means does this belittle Columbus' two Potter films. I enjoyed them very much. However, I must say that this third chapter was the most satisfying of the three. I believe it's because, as strange as this may sound, everything felt more "real." There wasn't this sense of wonderment that was ever-present during the first two films. In "Azkaban," everything in the wizarding world is just matter-of-fact, and that in itself is magical.Also of note is the fine special effects in the film. Buckbeak, the hippogriff, looked absolutely amazing - like a real animal. Those horrifying guards of Azkaban, the Dementors, were just the right touch of scary. It's tough to keep them from looking like the Black Riders from Lord Of The Rings, but their mouths are all their own and are truly frightening!In all, an absolutely fantastic film, and one that I am sure to see several times over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This had a different feel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the new Harry Potter movie today, and although I liked it, it had a very different feel to it. Even my son noted that Hagrids Hut had been moved, the area surrounding the school looked very different, etc...I own all the books and the first 2 movies on DVD and have watched them numerous times, and it was strange to see Hermione, Harry and Ron in street clothes as opposed to their school robes. The quidditch match was VERY short, and Cho was not mentioned at all. The way one would stop the Whomping Willow was changed from pushing a stump to using a spell and wand, and Draco went from being a villain worthy of Harry to a wimp in one film. I felt the time travel aspect of the film was reminiscent of Back To The Future II, whereas I didn't get that feeling reading the book. I'll always be a fan, but I enjoyed the look and feel of the first 2 films more than this one, and hope the author retains the control for the fourth film that she obviously didn't for this one, as Goblet of Fire was my favorite harry potter book so far, and I'd hate to see it condensed to the extent that this one was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, lousy story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I so wanted to love this movie! But it's not nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. Parts of the movie have improved over the other two films, but it also lost something they had. The acting was awesome--the kids have so much improved, and Alan Rickman and Gary Oldman were superb, as usual. And the visuals, the camera work, and the scenery were fantastic. But the film lacked a great story. There was so much left out of what happened in the book, and it went way too fast! I don't see how the longest book can turn into the shortest movie. I would have gladly sat through an extra half-hour to further develop the details of the story and characters. As I read in a magazine before I saw the film, Columbus is storyteller, and Cuaron is an artist. It's so true. Give me a great story any day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!!SPOILERS!!!!I would like to say that I think Alfonso Cuaron did a good job and didn't butcher it too bad. One thing he should've done was not mess with the set. Like the whomping willow it went from enormous car killing tree to this thing that looks like its no larger than Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid). Another thing about Hagrid is his home seems quite nomadic these days and move around quite well. I think the new characters had very good actors to play out there rolls including the new Dumbledore. But speaking of new characters I kind of missed Sir Cadogan's comedic sarcasm and witicism. I also believe we all missed a good little stroll down Diagon Alley and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's little argument. As others here have already explained the relationships between the adults in the book were missing, which not only thickened the plot but it helped some others know what is going on. I also wish to believe that I did see the great Quidditch Cup match with the FIREBOLT somewhere in the middle of the story, but no we had to see it at the end and not enjoy....ARGh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Stunning in Silver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The color palette of this movie is cold and spooky, starting from the metallic WB logo at the outset. The use of silver and gray made the film look sharp and less over-blown than the first two in the series. I liked the use of several key sets of Hogwarts, JK Rowling-approved additions of a courtyard, a bridge and a move down a hill for Hagrid's cabin. The story remained blissfully faithful (as near as I could remember) to the time-travel shenanigans of the book. Harry and Hermione actually seemed to act and not just react. The wizards-in-training seem to spend more time in jeans than in robes, which I found a bit jarring. Quite a good little movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is a BIG disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been so excited to see this movie. I was so excited. From about 5 minutes into the movie until the credit roll, i had my mouth open, and a look of shock on my face. This movie could have been great, but instead, this director with a total lack of talent butchered one of the better Potter stories. Its understandable that pieces will have to be cut out, but this was just terribly done. It was like he didn't even read the story, he just wanted to show everyone that he knows how to use special effects and different camera angles. From the very start, important pieces of the plot of the story were missing, and in their place were shaky-shots (which were intended to be shaky, but looked terrible nonetheless) and attempted uses of dramatic effects. This movie had absolutely NO continuity with the last two movies whatsoever. It appeared that it wasn't even attempted. The movie lost a lot of its "magical" feel with the lack of proper costume, owing again, to the lack of continuity. So, the movie is here, we all waited for it with great excitement and anticipation, and it was a total disappointment. I guess the only good thing to look forward to in the next movie of the series is that they changed directors.. thank goodness. *PLEASE make the next movie(s) follow the path of the first two... please!!*</fullReview>

Even to Harry. Just look at how Harry reacts to Rita Skeeter's article in book four.What I do have to say for the director was that the children were much better in their roles. But the adults?! In the two previous movies their characters were flawless. They added depth to them. But now... they're just muddled, one-dimensional, and overacting. Why is Hagrid a stupid oaf? Why is Dumbledore so goofy? Why is Lupin so sleazy?My biggest gripe is the scene with Madam Rosmerta. This is where Harry finds out what happens to his parents! His parents best friend betrayed them and thus left him parentless and almost killed! WHY RUSH THIS SCENE?!?! This is one of the best stories from Harry's past that seriously affects him. The anger and betrayal. They totally destroyed one of my favorite scenes of the series.BAD, BAD, BAD!!! I hated the movie. I go see movies for a good story. Special effects, cinematography, sets, costumes, etc. are supposed to enhance the movie, not hold it together. Look at Lord of the Rings. They had everything together. They pleased everyone, readers and non-readers. Why can't you do this for a series that so many people love?! And this is the third book! Even J.K. Rowling said that if she had to choose one it would be the third.All in all, I really, really hated it. I'm so sad he butchered one of the best books in the series. I really hope they choose a better director who understands that Harry Potter isn't really about the monsters and magic but about how multi-dimensional the characters are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3rd movie was good, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be overly critical seeing as for me and many others the 3rd book is the favorite of the so far 5 book series. It was well casted and the information was given in a good way, and let's be honest, the special effects were great. The 3rd book being my favorite, and having read it many times, I knew what was going on at every instant of the 2hr 21min film. There were times though, when I was a bit perplexed. There were many things put out of order (there is my overly-critical side kicking up again) and there were things that weren't in the book that could have been omitted to make room for several scenes that I think to be crucial. My examples and reasons are as follows:1. My favorite part of the book is when Snape tries to reveal the true purpose of the Marauder's Map. And there is a message from each member of the club (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs) This was really funny in the book, I was dying to see it in the movie2. The letter from Sirius: On the train home from Hogwarts Harry recieves a letter from Sirius explaining the origin of the firebolt, and Sirius' status, Ron also recieves an owl named Pigwidgeon, seeing as the owl shows up in book four it might have been a good idea to present him in movie 33. The debriefing from Lupin: near the end, Prof. Lupin explains who Moony Padfoot Prongs and Wormtail were. he explains a little bit more about James too4. Finally, the debriefing from Dumbledore: This is supposed to be a constant in every single book, so I thought the movies might have wanted to be the same. He explains about his patronus and more about Harry.These were the only things I think that could have made the 3rd movie go from really good to really great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first HP movie that lived up to the books - really great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that the movies keep getting better. The first was a dog. This one was really great. The Hippogryph was unbelievable. I don't think i've ever seen a non-humanoid monster look so real. There were some shortcuts in the story line that, had i not read the book, might have left me a little bewildered. But i did, and i loved it! Very exciting! Hope the rest turn out this good..There have been some posts that claim this movie is too dark, i would agree that it's not as "zany" as the first movie. But at this stage of the book series, the story gets darker. If you want Zany go watch an Adam Sandler movie. This was a very good portrayal of the book.- Matt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that as the books get longer there is more and more that needs to be condensed into the typical two and a half hour movie, but when such crucial characters and story lines that are pivotal for future movies are left out, i have to wonder if there even planning on finishing The Goblet of Fire. Daniel, Emma, and Rupert did yet again an amazing job, but after hearing there E! interviews, and how excited for this movie, i'm left guessing if they ever read the books. ARGH!, they left out Cedric Diggory, they didn't explain why Harry Patronum is a stag, they barely explained Hermione's schedule conflicts, and David Thewlis is a wonderful Prof. Lupin, but they cut his role in half!But i think what i have to say irked me the most, and i know its stupid but i'm a costume fan, is that Fudge's hat isn't green! Such a simple thing, and they forgot it! enough ranting, if you love the books, the movie will leave you fuming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Brilliant!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using our previous knowledge of the Harry Potter universe to his advantage, Alfonso Cuaron has created the first sophisticated film foray into the world of wizards, witches, werewolves and hippogriffs. Cuaron benefits from the experience his lead actors have in performing these roles in two prior films. Dan Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron have all become these characters before our eyes, and it is wonderful to watch.Michael Gambon does a fine job replacing Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson hams it up as the spaced-out Divination teacher, Professor Trelawny.Gary Oldman is good as escaped-prisoner Sirius Black. He doesn't have much to do, but what he does works well. I look forward to seeing more of him as the series continues.Of all the adult actors, my highest praise must go to David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Thewlis was assigned the task of bringing to life one of the best-loved characters of the Rowling books, and has done so magnificently.This review wouldn't be complete without mention of the overall tone of the film. This of course is due to the amazing direction of Alfonso Cuaron. Everything about this film is in stark contrast to the first two offerings by Chris Columbus. By no means does this belittle Columbus' two Potter films. I enjoyed them very much. However, I must say that this third chapter was the most satisfying of the three. I believe it's because, as strange as this may sound, everything felt more "real." There wasn't this sense of wonderment that was ever-present during the first two films. In "Azkaban," everything in the wizarding world is just matter-of-fact, and that in itself is magical.Also of note is the fine special effects in the film. Buckbeak, the hippogriff, looked absolutely amazing - like a real animal. Those horrifying guards of Azkaban, the Dementors, were just the right touch of scary. It's tough to keep them from looking like the Black Riders from Lord Of The Rings, but their mouths are all their own and are truly frightening!In all, an absolutely fantastic film, and one that I am sure to see several times over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This had a different feel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the new Harry Potter movie today, and although I liked it, it had a very different feel to it. Even my son noted that Hagrids Hut had been moved, the area surrounding the school looked very different, etc...I own all the books and the first 2 movies on DVD and have watched them numerous times, and it was strange to see Hermione, Harry and Ron in street clothes as opposed to their school robes. The quidditch match was VERY short, and Cho was not mentioned at all. The way one would stop the Whomping Willow was changed from pushing a stump to using a spell and wand, and Draco went from being a villain worthy of Harry to a wimp in one film. I felt the time travel aspect of the film was reminiscent of Back To The Future II, whereas I didn't get that feeling reading the book. I'll always be a fan, but I enjoyed the look and feel of the first 2 films more than this one, and hope the author retains the control for the fourth film that she obviously didn't for this one, as Goblet of Fire was my favorite harry potter book so far, and I'd hate to see it condensed to the extent that this one was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, lousy story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I so wanted to love this movie! But it's not nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. Parts of the movie have improved over the other two films, but it also lost something they had. The acting was awesome--the kids have so much improved, and Alan Rickman and Gary Oldman were superb, as usual. And the visuals, the camera work, and the scenery were fantastic. But the film lacked a great story. There was so much left out of what happened in the book, and it went way too fast! I don't see how the longest book can turn into the shortest movie. I would have gladly sat through an extra half-hour to further develop the details of the story and characters. As I read in a magazine before I saw the film, Columbus is storyteller, and Cuaron is an artist. It's so true. Give me a great story any day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!!SPOILERS!!!!I would like to say that I think Alfonso Cuaron did a good job and didn't butcher it too bad. One thing he should've done was not mess with the set. Like the whomping willow it went from enormous car killing tree to this thing that looks like its no larger than Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid). Another thing about Hagrid is his home seems quite nomadic these days and move around quite well. I think the new characters had very good actors to play out there rolls including the new Dumbledore. But speaking of new characters I kind of missed Sir Cadogan's comedic sarcasm and witicism. I also believe we all missed a good little stroll down Diagon Alley and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's little argument. As others here have already explained the relationships between the adults in the book were missing, which not only thickened the plot but it helped some others know what is going on. I also wish to believe that I did see the great Quidditch Cup match with the FIREBOLT somewhere in the middle of the story, but no we had to see it at the end and not enjoy....ARGh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Stunning in Silver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The color palette of this movie is cold and spooky, starting from the metallic WB logo at the outset. The use of silver and gray made the film look sharp and less over-blown than the first two in the series. I liked the use of several key sets of Hogwarts, JK Rowling-approved additions of a courtyard, a bridge and a move down a hill for Hagrid's cabin. The story remained blissfully faithful (as near as I could remember) to the time-travel shenanigans of the book. Harry and Hermione actually seemed to act and not just react. The wizards-in-training seem to spend more time in jeans than in robes, which I found a bit jarring. Quite a good little movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is a BIG disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been so excited to see this movie. I was so excited. From about 5 minutes into the movie until the credit roll, i had my mouth open, and a look of shock on my face. This movie could have been great, but instead, this director with a total lack of talent butchered one of the better Potter stories. Its understandable that pieces will have to be cut out, but this was just terribly done. It was like he didn't even read the story, he just wanted to show everyone that he knows how to use special effects and different camera angles. From the very start, important pieces of the plot of the story were missing, and in their place were shaky-shots (which were intended to be shaky, but looked terrible nonetheless) and attempted uses of dramatic effects. This movie had absolutely NO continuity with the last two movies whatsoever. It appeared that it wasn't even attempted. The movie lost a lot of its "magical" feel with the lack of proper costume, owing again, to the lack of continuity. So, the movie is here, we all waited for it with great excitement and anticipation, and it was a total disappointment. I guess the only good thing to look forward to in the next movie of the series is that they changed directors.. thank goodness. *PLEASE make the next movie(s) follow the path of the first two... please!!*</fullReview>

Special effects, cinematography, sets, costumes, etc. are supposed to enhance the movie, not hold it together. Look at Lord of the Rings. They had everything together. They pleased everyone, readers and non-readers. Why can't you do this for a series that so many people love?! And this is the third book! Even J.K. Rowling said that if she had to choose one it would be the third.All in all, I really, really hated it. I'm so sad he butchered one of the best books in the series. I really hope they choose a better director who understands that Harry Potter isn't really about the monsters and magic but about how multi-dimensional the characters are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3rd movie was good, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be overly critical seeing as for me and many others the 3rd book is the favorite of the so far 5 book series. It was well casted and the information was given in a good way, and let's be honest, the special effects were great. The 3rd book being my favorite, and having read it many times, I knew what was going on at every instant of the 2hr 21min film. There were times though, when I was a bit perplexed. There were many things put out of order (there is my overly-critical side kicking up again) and there were things that weren't in the book that could have been omitted to make room for several scenes that I think to be crucial. My examples and reasons are as follows:1. My favorite part of the book is when Snape tries to reveal the true purpose of the Marauder's Map. And there is a message from each member of the club (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs) This was really funny in the book, I was dying to see it in the movie2. The letter from Sirius: On the train home from Hogwarts Harry recieves a letter from Sirius explaining the origin of the firebolt, and Sirius' status, Ron also recieves an owl named Pigwidgeon, seeing as the owl shows up in book four it might have been a good idea to present him in movie 33. The debriefing from Lupin: near the end, Prof. Lupin explains who Moony Padfoot Prongs and Wormtail were. he explains a little bit more about James too4. Finally, the debriefing from Dumbledore: This is supposed to be a constant in every single book, so I thought the movies might have wanted to be the same. He explains about his patronus and more about Harry.These were the only things I think that could have made the 3rd movie go from really good to really great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roll on the DVD with director's cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by a distance the best of the Harry Potter films so far. The performances of the three young principals are maturing, especially Emma Watson, who marvellously conveys the essence of Hermione, although she looks nothing like the character, because, well, Hermione is a plain-looking girl with buck teeth. Perhaps Emma Watson could be "plained up" for the fourth film, because two key scenes involve Hermione's appearance, one where Malfoy makes her teeth even longer, and the scene where she arrives at the Champions' Ball as Viktor Krum's partner and her new appearance (closer to what Emma Watson looks like) turns heads.As for the other performances, I was delighted that there were fewer examples of adult performers playing their parts as pantomime characters. Gary Oldman was perfect as Sirius Black, as was David Thewlis as Lupin. Emma Thompson provided a wonderful turn as Trelawney. Timothy Spall I felt was too big for the snivelling Pettigrew, and Michael Gambon suffers, since anyone playing Dumbledore was never going to match Richard Harris's sense of a calm, protective, authority figure.Unlike the last two films, especially the Chamber of Secrets, this film did not drag. In fact the action moved very quickly, perhaps a little too quickly. I can understand how there can be loose ends for anyone who has not read the book (who were Moony - note the spelling - Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs; why was Lupin able to read the Marauder's Map, but Snape couldn't). I also noticed that Paul Whitehouse - who Americans may not know is a British comedian - was cast in the role of Sir Cadogan, bit you only saw a very brief glimpse of a suit of armour in a scene stolen by Dawn French as the Fat Lady (what happened to Elizabeth Spriggs, the original Fat Lady?).If my comments seem a bit pernickety, that doesn't alter my view that Alfonso Cuaron has succeeded wher Chris Columbus failed, and I wish that he could have been retained for later films, where the story gets even darker. What I would say, however, is that I truly hope that the DVD release will have not just deleted scenes, but the chance of seeing a "director's cut", including scenes which perhaps could have been left in the final cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Wicked This Way Came!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to think that ?Harry Potter' couldn't be taken seriously. I thought that only inexperienced children could read and love these books. I had no doubt about it until last summer I saw my own 10-year-old niece intently reading ?Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'. I was amazed as she had never read a book on her own will. `Ok then' I said to myself, `I must have my own opinion'. So when everybody went to sleep I took the book from the table, went to my room and started reading.I came to myself at about 5.30 in the morning when the last words had been read. That's when I could put the book away, still too excited to fall asleep. I couldn't believe that I hadn't read it earlier.That's why when I got to know that the movie was ?coming soon' I made a decision not to miss it. And I didn't.When my friend and I entered the cinema this morning, we felt a bit embarrassed as we seemed to be the oldest persons there. But all those happy children were too busy with their own discussion about Harry and everything, that they didn't pay any attention to us. So we crept into the hall and the lights went out.Well, the main thing I have to say is `We shouldn't have watched all the teasers and trailers!' Almost every moment of the movie was familiar to us and we were not surprised at all (leave alone the fact that both of us had read the book!). The pace of the movie was a bit unequal ? I mean the 1st half was kinda measured and the ending seemed to me very crumpled, as if the director suddenly realized he didn't have enough time to end the story in detail.Nevertheless I liked `The Prisoner...' because of its fantastic cast. I liked all the actors' performance! And the movie itself was beautiful and charming with funny and scary moments. Visual effects were fascinating! Whatever I say, the truth is I wasn't bored at all, I spent a very nice time, I laughed and was frightened, and I was feeling myself as a child when I left the cinema. Now I'm looking forward to watching `The Goblet of Fire'. Oh my God how long shall I wait for?!All in all, 8 out of 10... or maybe I'm too greedy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a film worth Rowling's Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title says it all. This episode, when seen through the eyes of Alfonso Cuarón, is finally what the previous two films should have been. Chris Columbus can make a pretty Hollywood film, but he's best in the producer's chair. He doesn't have the vision of Alfonso. While Chris was busy showing pretty scenes, Alfonso draws a tight story. The new director has made all the difference in the world. Especially interesting is that Hogwarts is FINALLY a multi-racial school. In other films, all the students were caucasian. And Harry interacts with different races, which is interesting.You will notice some casting changes -- at least I did, especially of Cornelius Fudge and the Fat Lady. Additionally, the geographic location of some places, especially The Whomping Willow and Hargrid's house have moved.You will quickly notice that the cast is growing up. Neville Longbottom is certainly growing. He lost all of his baby fat. I had to take a double look to ensure I was looking at the same person! The acting ability is growing with age, like a fine wine. Dan Radcliffe is finally given a chance to show his true talent, especially in the Dursley's house.The character of Snape finally develops to show his hatred of Harry. I was a bit concerned about the casting of Lupin, but it comes out fine.Be prepared for some cuts and unusual additions. The second Sirius Black attack is missing. The relationship between Crookshanks and animagus Sirius is gone as well. Watch the film and you will see that the spirit of the film is there (albeit with "flying dementors"), even though Alfonso altered it a bit. But his vision is dead on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And to think I once hated the whole Harry Potter phenomenon.I hated how I couldn't turn around without seeing something Potter-related. Mugs, t-shirts, soft drinks, posters, you name it. I made the pompous mistake that most people make about Stephen King: popular equals bad.Of course, I hadn't read the books. I didn't need to. It had to be bad; look at how many people love it. I then saw `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' and murmured a five-star review about how it was one of the best children's films ever made, hoping no one would notice the change of heart, and not point out my pretentions (they did).Now comes `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,' the third film in the series. It comes with a new director, Alfonso Cuarón, the man behind the infinitely different film `Y Tu Mama Tambien,' which was also about growing lads, but had more sex and booze than the Hogwarts rulebooks would allow. A year has passed since the last film ended, and the kids have grown up a bit (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint being the leads). Soon Harry will have to find out how to perform the magical art of shaving.This is the darkest of the stories filmed so far, and has an altogether less jolly feel (but you already know that from all the other reviews). A prisoner of Azkaban prison, Sirius Black, has escaped and is looking for Harry (we find out that he was a spy for the villain of the series, Voldermort). With Harry gone, Voldermort can take over again, and that can't be good, so Harry takes it upon himself to get Sirius before Sirius gets him.There are, of course, twists in the tale that you'll either know or will have to find out. I can say that, knowing the story, I was not disappointed: as always, the images on the screen did not match the ones in my head, but I didn't care. The film is exhilarating, and stands up easily beside the first two.And yet it's? different. The whole film is just less colourful than the first two. Literally. There is an early shot in the Great Hall, and it looked almost sepia. Very young viewers will probably find it more frightening than the earlier ones, what with those scary Dementors, who surround the school to protect it from Sirius Black, and will suck your soul out if you get on their bad side. They look a bit like cousins of the Ring Wraiths from the `Lord of the Rings' films.If you don't know much about Harry Potter, you won't have a clue what I'm talking about. I'd advise you to see the other movies first: you can watch the second before the first, as I did, but I think you'd feel a smidgen confused by this one if you went in with a blank slate. Many characters from the earlier films (Maggie Smith's Jean Brodie-esque Professor McGonagall, Headmaster Dumbeldore, now played by Michael Gambon, who is given fortune-cookie-philosophy dialogue that he manages to sell with ease) are given less screen time, although Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) is still striding about, and, as nasty-but-fun characters go, he's still up there with Hannibal Lecter.To make up for it, however, a lot of new characters are introduced. Emma Thompson plays the eccentric Professor Trelawny, who teaches Divination (reading tea leaves, predicting deaths etc.), and Gary Oldman plays Sirius Black with a slightly manic edge. That invaluable British actor Timothy Spall also has a small part, and David Thewlis plays the new Dark Arts teacher, who has a few dark secrets himself. If there's one thing these movies get right, it's casting.This film is, as I said before, tinged with a certain melancholy, right from the start. It has many moments of humour, certainly. My favourite was when the children had to defend themselves from the things they fear most by turning them into things that they laugh at, and seeing Alan Rickman in drag is a sight I will not quickly forget (to achieve this, by the way, you just flick your wand and say ?ridikulus'). But there is also that Quidditch match in the rain with the Dementors circling ominously overhead, and the werewolf, and the execution of the Hippogriff, which is a majestic creature somewhere between a horse and an eagle.It's also perhaps worth noting that this film is 142 minutes in length, which may seem quite long, but it's actually the shortest of the films yet made, despite being based on the longest book. It's tighter than the first too, and maybe just a little too tight. Cuarón gets in moments of wit, fun characters and even a sequence with a certain beauty to it (when Harry rides the Hippogriff), but perhaps it is just that little bit too story-driven. It unfolds as well as any great story, but when I am in Hogwarts, I don't like to be rushed along.But I am nit-picking. The film is excellent, perhaps not as fun as the second one, but just as exciting. This film is definitely taking a slightly different path from the earlier ones, but that's probably a blessing. I saw J.K. Rowling on television the other day saying how ?this is Alfonso's baby.' Odd, for a writer to give her story totally to a director and let him do with it what he pleases. I admire her for it; it means the stories are alive and evolving under different hands.I love the way this series fills the whole canvas with details (just look at those portraits on the walls), and its ability to make even me, a cynical teenager, believe in the characters. They fly off on broomsticks, and battle with wands, and get involved in a fight with a tree (yes, a tree)? yet it never feels as ridikulus as it sounds.****? (out of 5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>whole new world of potter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the most amazing thing about cuaron's stab at the hp series is the new world that he creates for potter and gang to live in. the atmosphere is one with hints of fear and danger. it is shadowy, obscure. lost is the wide-eyed idealism of columbus' films. these are not children coming for the first time to the magical world of hogwarts, these are adolescents who, being accustomed to seeing magic around them, are beginning to understand the potential danger of their craft. the cinematography and camera work are outstanding in this movie. cuaron is able to communicate visually to the audience about the uncertainty of coming-of-age, the danger amidst the beauty in the real world, and the way that cross gender relationships can become uncomfortable when one is coming into their own body and sexuality. a lot of the camera work seems to be shot on hand-helds and even what is not seems closer to the cast, more personal. the kind of direction that cuaron imposes on the cast makes them better actors. the movie, from a solely cinematic perspective, probably deserves a ten score. however, as a fan of the novel, there are some gaps in storytelling that are almost unforgivable. ***SPOILERS*** certain things seem just plain wrong for the avid hp reader. for instance, in conversation with harry, lupin makes reference to lily potter in a way to suggest that he had a sort of "special" friendship that is never alluded to in the books. similarly, all the talk of lupin's closeness to james potter almost vanishes from the dialog. if i had never read the book (as my friend who went to see it with me hadn't), i would have thought potter stole lupin's girlfriend, who would become lily potter, and that lupin was still resentful for it. one of the most endearing things about the Prisoner story is the way it sheds light on the harry's parent's lives--adds humanity and color to the dead family. the screenplay here doesn't deliver that and, truthfully, i don't think it wanted to. another clencher is that the identities of moony, wormail, padfoot, and prongs are never revealed. neither is an explanation for harry's stag-shaped patronus. this is the real pity because there is ample opportunity to have done it in merely fifteen added minutes worth of time. it is a real shame because at least i feel (and from what i heard from the crowds after the movie let out) that it is integral to the story both dramatically and emotionally. even i could think of a way to put that stuff in. ***SPOILERS OVER***all in all, as an hp fan (book 3 being my fave) i give the movie an 8 1/2, but as a moviegoer and filmfan, i give it an astounding 10*.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. The credits should have read "LOOSELY based on the novel by J.K. Rowling." If you're a fan of the books, don't waste your money on this film. The film itself was okay, but VERY different from the book and VERY different from the first two films. Sure, the first two films were a little different from the books, but nothing like the most recent film. There are many big differences between the film &amp; the book (i.e. how/when Harry acquires the Firebolt). The sequence of events &amp; how things happen are quite messed up. Harry didn't face the boggart during class (in the book), so why does he in the movie? Also, whatever happened to Crookshanks later in the movie? Chris Columbus should have played a bigger part in the making of this film. The change in location was very apparent as was the change in director. The layout of the Hogwarts grounds were very different from the first two films. For example, the Whomping Willow moved from level ground near the castle to the side of a hill with the castle no where in sight. The film also should have been a bit longer to better explain some things and allow the sequence of events to match the book more. The first two films were MUCH better.</fullReview>

The director obviously just used the name of Harry Potter and cut and pasted what he thought would sell. This director (what's his mane) is not a Potter fan and it would seem by his work he only read the 3rd book. Not to mention the grounds are totally different and shows a lack of consistency in the movies. By the way, this movie did not have to be as dark as everyone says, He purposely made it that way. The 3rd book is the best of the series, in my opinion, and the previous director Columbus should have done this one as well. You know it is sad that the best Harry Potter book, The Prisoner of Azkaban, which had the best story, mystery, suspense and twisting of plot, has to be the worst of ALL the Harry Potter movies!</fullReview>

My favorite character brought to life just made me really happy ^^ At first I wasn't really to happy with the casting of Lupin, but he really grew on me.I didn't like the fact that they seemed to be trying to add more funny to the film instead of keeping with the dark storyline.

		<shortDescription>Good Visuals, Spirit Missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry for my poor English, I will be trying to do my best to be as clear and understandable as possible...I don't know how to start... The movie looks much more professional then the previous two of the series with more convincing visuals, now the hogwarts looks more real, halfhorse creature (hippogriff), werevolf (Lupin), Dementors (although they are flying in the movie, it fits the movie and storyline), but missing some essential parts as the competition between the houses of the Hogwarts, Quidditch matchs lacking the excitement, lacking conversations between the characters (although Lupin and Harry conversations are doing well to explain about Harry's family background).The storyline advances really quick that you start feeling watching an action movie, characters running from one scene to another to catch bad guys/solve problems. If you ignore the speeches between Lupin and Harry's, I find life in Hogwarts is missing from the movie. For example what happened to the houses of Hogwarts? Quidditch? Malfoy being coward??? Where is Hermione struggling to catch her tight schedule for her many lessons (this will solve the nonconvincing one sentence explanation for the time rewinding charm Hermione is carrying)? Why can't Snape reveal the contents of the map but Lupin can, and why Harry is not surprised when Lupin can instantly reveal the secret of the map? Where are the other characters of the Hogwarts? They only appear in one or two scenes. Most of the characters appear only once or twice, and you watch a movie acted by 10 actors (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Snapes, James, Lupin, Sirius, Peter, Dumbledore, Haggards) NOTE: May be I am expecting too much from a movie, you can not have all the details from the book? Where are the details about the friendship between James, Lupin, Sirius and Peter? How did Sirius escaped from Ascaban? Hermione and Ron argues through the whole story because of crookshanks and making Harry's life more hard to live, but this is almost skipped in the movie.But there are great good things to talk about the movie also: The camera angles, movements, darkness of the scenes, details of Hippogliff (Buckbeak), werewolf and Dementors are great, primary actors (Harry/Rone/Hermione) are much better being grown ups now, and you really feel that you are watching now grownup teenagers (all reflecting that psychology also) instead of children which suits well, Snapes is again great, Prof Trelawney is a perfect fit, knight bus, defence against dark arts lessons are expressed almost flawlessly.Also I can say that there is enough humour in the film balancing the dark scenes although sometimes at unexpected times (wild tree catching blue bird).Dumbledore replacement Michael Gambon is much more OK than I expected, Severus Snape and Sybil Trelawney are perfect fit. Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley are much better in this movie, especially Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron.SUMMARY: Really good movie lacking some essential details and spirit, I would give 10/10 if it was 10-15 minutes longer to fill in some missing essential details in the storyline and giving more depth to characters, I didn't like seeing action at all the times, I like to see real life like thing as arguments between characters, suffering because of anger, friendship, competition between characters... I give this movie 7/10, the others were 5/10 by the way... This movie is still not comparable with LOTR series, but now there is hope for the oncoming one(s?). Following movies can be just perfect if they can make the movie(s) before characters start shaving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How dare someone give this movie a good review without having read the book! In short, seeing this movie is like reading the cliff notes on the book. I can't believe that JKR allowed this screenwriter to butcher her work in this manner! The film is disjointed, merely randomly hitting the "high points" of the book without paying any attention to the subtle details that tie into Harry's past. This screenwriter completely ignored all the wonderfully rich details concerning the Marauders' Map. This movie is so lacking that it never even ties the stag to Harry's father. In fact, the significance of the stag is never even mentioned. The film, in comparison to the two previous ones, is a sad sad SAD disappointment. The reason that the first two were successful is that they respected the readers and fans of the Harry Potter series enough to show the complete story. (with the exception of the dead-day party in book two). This movie is an insult. It was written apparently in a short form to "hold the attention" of viewers. Alas, the idiotic screenwriter forgot the important fact that the people paying to see the movie actually read the books -- and expect them to be done in a manner that pays homage to the genius of JKR. If you go to this movie expecting the excellence of the first two, don't bother. No matter how this failure is presented with "excellent" cinematography, and beautiful "changing of the seasons," it is still nothing more than a glorious failure. I wish JKR more success in the future with the choice of screenwriters. (And how could Draco Malfoy be given such a teeny tiny part? Give me a break!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I guess the third time really is the charm eh? Now, I've read all three books, with PoA being my favorite. I've always thought that they've been a good read, although I haven't really felt the need to bow down to J.K. Rowling like some out there. The books always had an magical atmosphere, obviously. They were great adventures, and the world was astounding and beautiful, although not exactly original. But they've also been about friendship, love and all those other warm fuzzy feelings.Now, with Christopher Columbus' movies, you got the blow by blow adventure onto the screen. But, somehow, even though the literal translation made it onto the big screen, little else did. The actors were wooden, the sets beautiful-don't get me wrong, but seemingly almost a little too polished and perfect. The quidditch scenes seemed to take up over half the movies, and the endings? Left me with a big,g aping hole of disappointment. The movies had lost that feeling of magic and mysticism, and seemed..well, almost campy. Like there was really nothing to be afraid of. They were about as magical as a two hour bus ride-- and about as interesting as well.And then Alfonso Cuaron came along. And finally he makes a Harry Potter film actually worth watching. And not just worth watching, but one that I highly enjoyed as well. The trio are no longer cardboard cutouts of their characters, they actually are their characters. Admittedly, they still have a long way to go, but now they can actually convey emotions! The casting was on spot with Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson and David Thewlis. They fit perfectly into their roles, unlike other casting decisions in the past. The CGI was phenomenal and writing and tone of the movie no longer campy, but darker and creepier, thank God. Some fans will complain of the deviations from the book. Oh please, get over it you book elitists. If you want it to be exactly like the book, please..turn around, go home and just read the books. I'm sure your imagination works just fine. What Cuaron made was not just an adaptation of the book, but an actual FILM, and a damn enjoyable one at that.I only wish it was longer, so that they could've fleshed out the story and characters a little more. Ah well, I guess you gotta keep it short if your movie is catered for the 12 and under crowd. 8/10. Not flawless, but a helluva lot better than Columbus ever did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I thought.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night at midnight. so no matter what I say , go and see the movie for yourself, because I was very tired.I thought that the movie was OK but I was angry about a few things : 1 . That the Layout of the castle was changed so much . (ex: hagrids hut being moved across a bridge and down a hill)2. The ending seen was very disappointing . (the firebolt shouldve been introduced much earlier)3. I never knew that dementors could fly. 4. That Draco and friends never dresses up as dementors. 5. I thought that Harry's little shield thing (cant spell patronis) couldve been better.Everything else was very well done. The Hippogriff was amazingly real looking. The castle looks great. and me and my friends couldn't help noticing that Hermione now has .............. a better figure.Go and see it it's great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too dark. Too dreary. Too choppy. Too artsyfartsy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron did exactly what I feared he would do to the Harry Pottery story. He created a dark, dreary world with mediocre special effects, a choppy story, and art-house cinematography that almost ruined the movie for me. Harry Potter is not about gratuitous and grainy close-ups of the actors saying their lines. It's not about rearranging the story to fit an artistic vision. It's a children's film franchise that, in the hands of Cuaron, came dangerously close to becoming a big budget mess. First, Cuaron paced the movie too quickly. Having read the books, I knew what was happening. But for people who have not read the books and the young kids who go to see this movie, they will be utterly confused. In addition, I often felt that the actors were looking to Cuaron behind the camera during scenes when they should have been concentrating on their performances instead. But then, when the Heroic Trio and the visiting faculty and enemies are emphasized at the expense of franchise regulars (with the exception of Snape), it is not surprising that the adult actors seem wooden at best.Secondly, Cuaron had a tendency to combine several scenes into one in the interests of time. This necessitated rearranging key points of the story and resulted in a failure to explain several key elements of the story.Third the emotional content of the movie was off. Cuaron added sappy scenes into the film that did not exist in the book, which dealt with Harry's sentimental feelings about his parents. This film was virtually devoid of humor (save for the over-used "where did she come from" trope in reference to Hermione's course schedule) and some ridiculous scenes involving characters in the paintings. The film merely references the growing tension between Ron, Harry, and Hermione that was in the book, having left most of it on the editing room floor.The movie was fun. It was well-acted. The dementors were scary. And what little quidditch that was in the film was exciting. But Cuaron should stick to his borderline softcore porn indie flicks and leave children's films to somebody else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had waited months for this movie to come out. I even took the day off with a couple of friends so that we may be able to see it at the first showing at the Cine Capri. We all re-read the book the week before just to make sure we were up-to-date on all the pertinent information.Well maybe the screen writer and director should have re-read the book. The first two movies were very true to the book's storyline. This movie was not. For starters, this movie did not flow as far as events were concerned. You did not introduce the Firebolt until the end of the movie. If one would follow the story better, one would have realized that the Firebolt was an important storyline that should have been brought in sooner as it was in the book. The way the movie jumped from segment to segment was unclear. The viewer has no idea what is actually going on because information was left out. Why was chocolate so important after an episode with a dementor? The movie did not say. Why did Professor Lupin know about the Marauder's Map? This was not explained. Why was it not explained about Ron and Hermonie's fights? This was very important in regards to their relationship. These are just a few of the discrepancies that we found in the movie. It was almost like watching a movie through Cliff Notes. J.K. Rowling should have retained control of the creative force of this movie. I wonder if she is as disappointed as we were. If this is the direction that the future movies are heading, I know that I will have to skip them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who is a true harry potter fan will find this movie to be very little like the book. The director obviously just used the name of Harry Potter and cut and pasted what he thought would sell. This director (what's his mane) is not a Potter fan and it would seem by his work he only read the 3rd book. Not to mention the grounds are totally different and shows a lack of consistency in the movies. By the way, this movie did not have to be as dark as everyone says, He purposely made it that way. The 3rd book is the best of the series, in my opinion, and the previous director Columbus should have done this one as well. You know it is sad that the best Harry Potter book, The Prisoner of Azkaban, which had the best story, mystery, suspense and twisting of plot, has to be the worst of ALL the Harry Potter movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie I personally thought was better than the first two. It had a lot more humor, better filming, and yes, almost every single guy was A LOT hotter! Malfoy, Harry, Ron, the Weasley twins... Need I mention more? I think in some ways this movie was better but in other ways it wasn't. One thing I didn't like was that there wasn't as much music in the background and it didn't follow the books as much as the first two did. There were also a lot of scary scenes. The first two were okay for little kids but I definitely wouldn't recommend this one! I'm even debating whether to take my 9 year old sister or not! I definitely think this was an awesome movie and I hope you think the same!!!!!!</fullReview>

I think what upset me more was that he got the firebolt at the end of the movie. No...not right.I love Oldman as Sirius Black. My favorite character brought to life just made me really happy ^^ At first I wasn't really to happy with the casting of Lupin, but he really grew on me.I didn't like the fact that they seemed to be trying to add more funny to the film instead of keeping with the dark storyline. I understand that you can't have it TO dark for the little kiddies. But that's the way the series will continue to move in the books, the movies might as well keep up with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Visuals, Spirit Missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry for my poor English, I will be trying to do my best to be as clear and understandable as possible...I don't know how to start... The movie looks much more professional then the previous two of the series with more convincing visuals, now the hogwarts looks more real, halfhorse creature (hippogriff), werevolf (Lupin), Dementors (although they are flying in the movie, it fits the movie and storyline), but missing some essential parts as the competition between the houses of the Hogwarts, Quidditch matchs lacking the excitement, lacking conversations between the characters (although Lupin and Harry conversations are doing well to explain about Harry's family background).The storyline advances really quick that you start feeling watching an action movie, characters running from one scene to another to catch bad guys/solve problems. If you ignore the speeches between Lupin and Harry's, I find life in Hogwarts is missing from the movie. For example what happened to the houses of Hogwarts? Quidditch? Malfoy being coward??? Where is Hermione struggling to catch her tight schedule for her many lessons (this will solve the nonconvincing one sentence explanation for the time rewinding charm Hermione is carrying)? Why can't Snape reveal the contents of the map but Lupin can, and why Harry is not surprised when Lupin can instantly reveal the secret of the map? Where are the other characters of the Hogwarts? They only appear in one or two scenes. Most of the characters appear only once or twice, and you watch a movie acted by 10 actors (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Snapes, James, Lupin, Sirius, Peter, Dumbledore, Haggards) NOTE: May be I am expecting too much from a movie, you can not have all the details from the book? Where are the details about the friendship between James, Lupin, Sirius and Peter? How did Sirius escaped from Ascaban? Hermione and Ron argues through the whole story because of crookshanks and making Harry's life more hard to live, but this is almost skipped in the movie.But there are great good things to talk about the movie also: The camera angles, movements, darkness of the scenes, details of Hippogliff (Buckbeak), werewolf and Dementors are great, primary actors (Harry/Rone/Hermione) are much better being grown ups now, and you really feel that you are watching now grownup teenagers (all reflecting that psychology also) instead of children which suits well, Snapes is again great, Prof Trelawney is a perfect fit, knight bus, defence against dark arts lessons are expressed almost flawlessly.Also I can say that there is enough humour in the film balancing the dark scenes although sometimes at unexpected times (wild tree catching blue bird).Dumbledore replacement Michael Gambon is much more OK than I expected, Severus Snape and Sybil Trelawney are perfect fit. Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley are much better in this movie, especially Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron.SUMMARY: Really good movie lacking some essential details and spirit, I would give 10/10 if it was 10-15 minutes longer to fill in some missing essential details in the storyline and giving more depth to characters, I didn't like seeing action at all the times, I like to see real life like thing as arguments between characters, suffering because of anger, friendship, competition between characters... I give this movie 7/10, the others were 5/10 by the way... This movie is still not comparable with LOTR series, but now there is hope for the oncoming one(s?). Following movies can be just perfect if they can make the movie(s) before characters start shaving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not bother seeing this if you are a fan of the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How dare someone give this movie a good review without having read the book! In short, seeing this movie is like reading the cliff notes on the book. I can't believe that JKR allowed this screenwriter to butcher her work in this manner! The film is disjointed, merely randomly hitting the "high points" of the book without paying any attention to the subtle details that tie into Harry's past. This screenwriter completely ignored all the wonderfully rich details concerning the Marauders' Map. This movie is so lacking that it never even ties the stag to Harry's father. In fact, the significance of the stag is never even mentioned. The film, in comparison to the two previous ones, is a sad sad SAD disappointment. The reason that the first two were successful is that they respected the readers and fans of the Harry Potter series enough to show the complete story. (with the exception of the dead-day party in book two). This movie is an insult. It was written apparently in a short form to "hold the attention" of viewers. Alas, the idiotic screenwriter forgot the important fact that the people paying to see the movie actually read the books -- and expect them to be done in a manner that pays homage to the genius of JKR. If you go to this movie expecting the excellence of the first two, don't bother. No matter how this failure is presented with "excellent" cinematography, and beautiful "changing of the seasons," it is still nothing more than a glorious failure. I wish JKR more success in the future with the choice of screenwriters. (And how could Draco Malfoy be given such a teeny tiny part? Give me a break!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a Harry Potter film worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I guess the third time really is the charm eh? Now, I've read all three books, with PoA being my favorite. I've always thought that they've been a good read, although I haven't really felt the need to bow down to J.K. Rowling like some out there. The books always had an magical atmosphere, obviously. They were great adventures, and the world was astounding and beautiful, although not exactly original. But they've also been about friendship, love and all those other warm fuzzy feelings.Now, with Christopher Columbus' movies, you got the blow by blow adventure onto the screen. But, somehow, even though the literal translation made it onto the big screen, little else did. The actors were wooden, the sets beautiful-don't get me wrong, but seemingly almost a little too polished and perfect. The quidditch scenes seemed to take up over half the movies, and the endings? Left me with a big,g aping hole of disappointment. The movies had lost that feeling of magic and mysticism, and seemed..well, almost campy. Like there was really nothing to be afraid of. They were about as magical as a two hour bus ride-- and about as interesting as well.And then Alfonso Cuaron came along. And finally he makes a Harry Potter film actually worth watching. And not just worth watching, but one that I highly enjoyed as well. The trio are no longer cardboard cutouts of their characters, they actually are their characters. Admittedly, they still have a long way to go, but now they can actually convey emotions! The casting was on spot with Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson and David Thewlis. They fit perfectly into their roles, unlike other casting decisions in the past. The CGI was phenomenal and writing and tone of the movie no longer campy, but darker and creepier, thank God. Some fans will complain of the deviations from the book. Oh please, get over it you book elitists. If you want it to be exactly like the book, please..turn around, go home and just read the books.

This screenwriter completely ignored all the wonderfully rich details concerning the Marauders' Map. This movie is so lacking that it never even ties the stag to Harry's father. In fact, the significance of the stag is never even mentioned. The film, in comparison to the two previous ones, is a sad sad SAD disappointment. The reason that the first two were successful is that they respected the readers and fans of the Harry Potter series enough to show the complete story. (with the exception of the dead-day party in book two). This movie is an insult. It was written apparently in a short form to "hold the attention" of viewers. Alas, the idiotic screenwriter forgot the important fact that the people paying to see the movie actually read the books -- and expect them to be done in a manner that pays homage to the genius of JKR. If you go to this movie expecting the excellence of the first two, don't bother. No matter how this failure is presented with "excellent" cinematography, and beautiful "changing of the seasons," it is still nothing more than a glorious failure. I wish JKR more success in the future with the choice of screenwriters. (And how could Draco Malfoy be given such a teeny tiny part? Give me a break!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a Harry Potter film worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I guess the third time really is the charm eh? Now, I've read all three books, with PoA being my favorite. I've always thought that they've been a good read, although I haven't really felt the need to bow down to J.K. Rowling like some out there. The books always had an magical atmosphere, obviously. They were great adventures, and the world was astounding and beautiful, although not exactly original. But they've also been about friendship, love and all those other warm fuzzy feelings.Now, with Christopher Columbus' movies, you got the blow by blow adventure onto the screen. But, somehow, even though the literal translation made it onto the big screen, little else did. The actors were wooden, the sets beautiful-don't get me wrong, but seemingly almost a little too polished and perfect. The quidditch scenes seemed to take up over half the movies, and the endings? Left me with a big,g aping hole of disappointment. The movies had lost that feeling of magic and mysticism, and seemed..well, almost campy. Like there was really nothing to be afraid of. They were about as magical as a two hour bus ride-- and about as interesting as well.And then Alfonso Cuaron came along. And finally he makes a Harry Potter film actually worth watching. And not just worth watching, but one that I highly enjoyed as well. The trio are no longer cardboard cutouts of their characters, they actually are their characters. Admittedly, they still have a long way to go, but now they can actually convey emotions! The casting was on spot with Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson and David Thewlis. They fit perfectly into their roles, unlike other casting decisions in the past. The CGI was phenomenal and writing and tone of the movie no longer campy, but darker and creepier, thank God. Some fans will complain of the deviations from the book. Oh please, get over it you book elitists. If you want it to be exactly like the book, please..turn around, go home and just read the books. I'm sure your imagination works just fine. What Cuaron made was not just an adaptation of the book, but an actual FILM, and a damn enjoyable one at that.I only wish it was longer, so that they could've fleshed out the story and characters a little more. Ah well, I guess you gotta keep it short if your movie is catered for the 12 and under crowd. 8/10. Not flawless, but a helluva lot better than Columbus ever did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I thought.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night at midnight. so no matter what I say , go and see the movie for yourself, because I was very tired.I thought that the movie was OK but I was angry about a few things : 1 . That the Layout of the castle was changed so much . (ex: hagrids hut being moved across a bridge and down a hill)2. The ending seen was very disappointing . (the firebolt shouldve been introduced much earlier)3. I never knew that dementors could fly. 4. That Draco and friends never dresses up as dementors. 5. I thought that Harry's little shield thing (cant spell patronis) couldve been better.Everything else was very well done. The Hippogriff was amazingly real looking. The castle looks great. and me and my friends couldn't help noticing that Hermione now has .............. a better figure.Go and see it it's great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too dark. Too dreary. Too choppy. Too artsyfartsy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron did exactly what I feared he would do to the Harry Pottery story. He created a dark, dreary world with mediocre special effects, a choppy story, and art-house cinematography that almost ruined the movie for me. Harry Potter is not about gratuitous and grainy close-ups of the actors saying their lines. It's not about rearranging the story to fit an artistic vision. It's a children's film franchise that, in the hands of Cuaron, came dangerously close to becoming a big budget mess. First, Cuaron paced the movie too quickly. Having read the books, I knew what was happening. But for people who have not read the books and the young kids who go to see this movie, they will be utterly confused. In addition, I often felt that the actors were looking to Cuaron behind the camera during scenes when they should have been concentrating on their performances instead. But then, when the Heroic Trio and the visiting faculty and enemies are emphasized at the expense of franchise regulars (with the exception of Snape), it is not surprising that the adult actors seem wooden at best.Secondly, Cuaron had a tendency to combine several scenes into one in the interests of time. This necessitated rearranging key points of the story and resulted in a failure to explain several key elements of the story.Third the emotional content of the movie was off. Cuaron added sappy scenes into the film that did not exist in the book, which dealt with Harry's sentimental feelings about his parents. This film was virtually devoid of humor (save for the over-used "where did she come from" trope in reference to Hermione's course schedule) and some ridiculous scenes involving characters in the paintings. The film merely references the growing tension between Ron, Harry, and Hermione that was in the book, having left most of it on the editing room floor.The movie was fun. It was well-acted. The dementors were scary. And what little quidditch that was in the film was exciting. But Cuaron should stick to his borderline softcore porn indie flicks and leave children's films to somebody else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had waited months for this movie to come out. I even took the day off with a couple of friends so that we may be able to see it at the first showing at the Cine Capri. We all re-read the book the week before just to make sure we were up-to-date on all the pertinent information.Well maybe the screen writer and director should have re-read the book. The first two movies were very true to the book's storyline. This movie was not. For starters, this movie did not flow as far as events were concerned. You did not introduce the Firebolt until the end of the movie. If one would follow the story better, one would have realized that the Firebolt was an important storyline that should have been brought in sooner as it was in the book. The way the movie jumped from segment to segment was unclear. The viewer has no idea what is actually going on because information was left out. Why was chocolate so important after an episode with a dementor? The movie did not say. Why did Professor Lupin know about the Marauder's Map? This was not explained. Why was it not explained about Ron and Hermonie's fights? This was very important in regards to their relationship. These are just a few of the discrepancies that we found in the movie. It was almost like watching a movie through Cliff Notes. J.K. Rowling should have retained control of the creative force of this movie. I wonder if she is as disappointed as we were. If this is the direction that the future movies are heading, I know that I will have to skip them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who is a true harry potter fan will find this movie to be very little like the book. The director obviously just used the name of Harry Potter and cut and pasted what he thought would sell. This director (what's his mane) is not a Potter fan and it would seem by his work he only read the 3rd book. Not to mention the grounds are totally different and shows a lack of consistency in the movies. By the way, this movie did not have to be as dark as everyone says, He purposely made it that way. The 3rd book is the best of the series, in my opinion, and the previous director Columbus should have done this one as well. You know it is sad that the best Harry Potter book, The Prisoner of Azkaban, which had the best story, mystery, suspense and twisting of plot, has to be the worst of ALL the Harry Potter movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first two in some ways...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie I personally thought was better than the first two. It had a lot more humor, better filming, and yes, almost every single guy was A LOT hotter! Malfoy, Harry, Ron, the Weasley twins... Need I mention more? I think in some ways this movie was better but in other ways it wasn't. One thing I didn't like was that there wasn't as much music in the background and it didn't follow the books as much as the first two did. There were also a lot of scary scenes. The first two were okay for little kids but I definitely wouldn't recommend this one! I'm even debating whether to take my 9 year old sister or not! I definitely think this was an awesome movie and I hope you think the same!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I did love the movie but they did make some pretty drastic changes in the transition from book to movie. Most them involved the sequence events that revolved around Harry.Where normally the thing that would upset me the most was that Harry faced off against the Boggart. I think what upset me more was that he got the firebolt at the end of the movie. No...not right.I love Oldman as Sirius Black. My favorite character brought to life just made me really happy ^^ At first I wasn't really to happy with the casting of Lupin, but he really grew on me.I didn't like the fact that they seemed to be trying to add more funny to the film instead of keeping with the dark storyline. I understand that you can't have it TO dark for the little kiddies. But that's the way the series will continue to move in the books, the movies might as well keep up with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Visuals, Spirit Missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry for my poor English, I will be trying to do my best to be as clear and understandable as possible...I don't know how to start... The movie looks much more professional then the previous two of the series with more convincing visuals, now the hogwarts looks more real, halfhorse creature (hippogriff), werevolf (Lupin), Dementors (although they are flying in the movie, it fits the movie and storyline), but missing some essential parts as the competition between the houses of the Hogwarts, Quidditch matchs lacking the excitement, lacking conversations between the characters (although Lupin and Harry conversations are doing well to explain about Harry's family background).The storyline advances really quick that you start feeling watching an action movie, characters running from one scene to another to catch bad guys/solve problems. If you ignore the speeches between Lupin and Harry's, I find life in Hogwarts is missing from the movie. For example what happened to the houses of Hogwarts? Quidditch? Malfoy being coward??? Where is Hermione struggling to catch her tight schedule for her many lessons (this will solve the nonconvincing one sentence explanation for the time rewinding charm Hermione is carrying)? Why can't Snape reveal the contents of the map but Lupin can, and why Harry is not surprised when Lupin can instantly reveal the secret of the map? Where are the other characters of the Hogwarts? They only appear in one or two scenes. Most of the characters appear only once or twice, and you watch a movie acted by 10 actors (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Snapes, James, Lupin, Sirius, Peter, Dumbledore, Haggards) NOTE: May be I am expecting too much from a movie, you can not have all the details from the book? Where are the details about the friendship between James, Lupin, Sirius and Peter? How did Sirius escaped from Ascaban? Hermione and Ron argues through the whole story because of crookshanks and making Harry's life more hard to live, but this is almost skipped in the movie.But there are great good things to talk about the movie also: The camera angles, movements, darkness of the scenes, details of Hippogliff (Buckbeak), werewolf and Dementors are great, primary actors (Harry/Rone/Hermione) are much better being grown ups now, and you really feel that you are watching now grownup teenagers (all reflecting that psychology also) instead of children which suits well, Snapes is again great, Prof Trelawney is a perfect fit, knight bus, defence against dark arts lessons are expressed almost flawlessly.Also I can say that there is enough humour in the film balancing the dark scenes although sometimes at unexpected times (wild tree catching blue bird).Dumbledore replacement Michael Gambon is much more OK than I expected, Severus Snape and Sybil Trelawney are perfect fit. Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley are much better in this movie, especially Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron.SUMMARY: Really good movie lacking some essential details and spirit, I would give 10/10 if it was 10-15 minutes longer to fill in some missing essential details in the storyline and giving more depth to characters, I didn't like seeing action at all the times, I like to see real life like thing as arguments between characters, suffering because of anger, friendship, competition between characters... I give this movie 7/10, the others were 5/10 by the way... This movie is still not comparable with LOTR series, but now there is hope for the oncoming one(s?). Following movies can be just perfect if they can make the movie(s) before characters start shaving.</fullReview>

I give this movie 7/10, the others were 5/10 by the way... This movie is still not comparable with LOTR series, but now there is hope for the oncoming one(s?). Following movies can be just perfect if they can make the movie(s) before characters start shaving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not bother seeing this if you are a fan of the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How dare someone give this movie a good review without having read the book! In short, seeing this movie is like reading the cliff notes on the book. I can't believe that JKR allowed this screenwriter to butcher her work in this manner! The film is disjointed, merely randomly hitting the "high points" of the book without paying any attention to the subtle details that tie into Harry's past. This screenwriter completely ignored all the wonderfully rich details concerning the Marauders' Map. This movie is so lacking that it never even ties the stag to Harry's father. In fact, the significance of the stag is never even mentioned. The film, in comparison to the two previous ones, is a sad sad SAD disappointment. The reason that the first two were successful is that they respected the readers and fans of the Harry Potter series enough to show the complete story. (with the exception of the dead-day party in book two). This movie is an insult. It was written apparently in a short form to "hold the attention" of viewers. Alas, the idiotic screenwriter forgot the important fact that the people paying to see the movie actually read the books -- and expect them to be done in a manner that pays homage to the genius of JKR. If you go to this movie expecting the excellence of the first two, don't bother. No matter how this failure is presented with "excellent" cinematography, and beautiful "changing of the seasons," it is still nothing more than a glorious failure. I wish JKR more success in the future with the choice of screenwriters. (And how could Draco Malfoy be given such a teeny tiny part? Give me a break!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a Harry Potter film worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I guess the third time really is the charm eh? Now, I've read all three books, with PoA being my favorite. I've always thought that they've been a good read, although I haven't really felt the need to bow down to J.K. Rowling like some out there. The books always had an magical atmosphere, obviously. They were great adventures, and the world was astounding and beautiful, although not exactly original. But they've also been about friendship, love and all those other warm fuzzy feelings.Now, with Christopher Columbus' movies, you got the blow by blow adventure onto the screen. But, somehow, even though the literal translation made it onto the big screen, little else did. The actors were wooden, the sets beautiful-don't get me wrong, but seemingly almost a little too polished and perfect. The quidditch scenes seemed to take up over half the movies, and the endings? Left me with a big,g aping hole of disappointment. The movies had lost that feeling of magic and mysticism, and seemed..well, almost campy. Like there was really nothing to be afraid of. They were about as magical as a two hour bus ride-- and about as interesting as well.And then Alfonso Cuaron came along. And finally he makes a Harry Potter film actually worth watching. And not just worth watching, but one that I highly enjoyed as well. The trio are no longer cardboard cutouts of their characters, they actually are their characters. Admittedly, they still have a long way to go, but now they can actually convey emotions! The casting was on spot with Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson and David Thewlis. They fit perfectly into their roles, unlike other casting decisions in the past. The CGI was phenomenal and writing and tone of the movie no longer campy, but darker and creepier, thank God. Some fans will complain of the deviations from the book. Oh please, get over it you book elitists. If you want it to be exactly like the book, please..turn around, go home and just read the books. I'm sure your imagination works just fine. What Cuaron made was not just an adaptation of the book, but an actual FILM, and a damn enjoyable one at that.I only wish it was longer, so that they could've fleshed out the story and characters a little more. Ah well, I guess you gotta keep it short if your movie is catered for the 12 and under crowd. 8/10. Not flawless, but a helluva lot better than Columbus ever did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I thought.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night at midnight. so no matter what I say , go and see the movie for yourself, because I was very tired.I thought that the movie was OK but I was angry about a few things : 1 . That the Layout of the castle was changed so much . (ex: hagrids hut being moved across a bridge and down a hill)2. The ending seen was very disappointing . (the firebolt shouldve been introduced much earlier)3. I never knew that dementors could fly. 4. That Draco and friends never dresses up as dementors. 5. I thought that Harry's little shield thing (cant spell patronis) couldve been better.Everything else was very well done. The Hippogriff was amazingly real looking. The castle looks great. and me and my friends couldn't help noticing that Hermione now has .............. a better figure.Go and see it it's great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too dark. Too dreary. Too choppy. Too artsyfartsy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron did exactly what I feared he would do to the Harry Pottery story. He created a dark, dreary world with mediocre special effects, a choppy story, and art-house cinematography that almost ruined the movie for me. Harry Potter is not about gratuitous and grainy close-ups of the actors saying their lines. It's not about rearranging the story to fit an artistic vision. It's a children's film franchise that, in the hands of Cuaron, came dangerously close to becoming a big budget mess. First, Cuaron paced the movie too quickly. Having read the books, I knew what was happening. But for people who have not read the books and the young kids who go to see this movie, they will be utterly confused. In addition, I often felt that the actors were looking to Cuaron behind the camera during scenes when they should have been concentrating on their performances instead. But then, when the Heroic Trio and the visiting faculty and enemies are emphasized at the expense of franchise regulars (with the exception of Snape), it is not surprising that the adult actors seem wooden at best.Secondly, Cuaron had a tendency to combine several scenes into one in the interests of time. This necessitated rearranging key points of the story and resulted in a failure to explain several key elements of the story.Third the emotional content of the movie was off. Cuaron added sappy scenes into the film that did not exist in the book, which dealt with Harry's sentimental feelings about his parents. This film was virtually devoid of humor (save for the over-used "where did she come from" trope in reference to Hermione's course schedule) and some ridiculous scenes involving characters in the paintings. The film merely references the growing tension between Ron, Harry, and Hermione that was in the book, having left most of it on the editing room floor.The movie was fun. It was well-acted. The dementors were scary. And what little quidditch that was in the film was exciting. But Cuaron should stick to his borderline softcore porn indie flicks and leave children's films to somebody else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed and Betrayed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had waited months for this movie to come out. I even took the day off with a couple of friends so that we may be able to see it at the first showing at the Cine Capri. We all re-read the book the week before just to make sure we were up-to-date on all the pertinent information.Well maybe the screen writer and director should have re-read the book. The first two movies were very true to the book's storyline. This movie was not. For starters, this movie did not flow as far as events were concerned. You did not introduce the Firebolt until the end of the movie. If one would follow the story better, one would have realized that the Firebolt was an important storyline that should have been brought in sooner as it was in the book. The way the movie jumped from segment to segment was unclear. The viewer has no idea what is actually going on because information was left out. Why was chocolate so important after an episode with a dementor? The movie did not say. Why did Professor Lupin know about the Marauder's Map? This was not explained. Why was it not explained about Ron and Hermonie's fights? This was very important in regards to their relationship. These are just a few of the discrepancies that we found in the movie. It was almost like watching a movie through Cliff Notes. J.K. Rowling should have retained control of the creative force of this movie. I wonder if she is as disappointed as we were. If this is the direction that the future movies are heading, I know that I will have to skip them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moose Hole - Review of Harry Potter &amp; the Prisoner of Azkaban</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first time a film adaptation of one of the series of wildly popular Harry Potter books is presented with the most unaccustomed challenges, ones the previous two ventures had not met up with. First, Chris Columbus, who had directed both the Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets, has moved into the producer's chair in order to give Alfonso Cuaron, director of Y Tu Mama Tambien, a chance to take a stab at the fantasy series. Secondly, though the previous feature films had enjoyed fruitful success at the box office during the Thanksgiving holiday, the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first film in the series to open during the summer. Perhaps WB is trying to prove Harry Potter can have just as much success at changing venues as Pixar did last summer with Finding Nemo? Maybe ? The most notable change for the series of film adaptations is the particular demographic it is attempting to play to. Though the first film was aimed mainly at the tweener and teenage crowds, the third movie will shift swiftly by aiming for a more mature audience, namely teens and young adults. Will too many changes all at once be too much for this film to handle? There is no doubt its opening weekend will bring in big numbers, so its final evaluation will depend mainly on the reaction of movie-goers and, of most concern to WB executives, the fans.The story once again follows the adventures of young Harry Potter, now a teenager, just as he is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After an incident in which Mr. Dursley's snobbish sister, Marge, is blown up like a balloon after angering Harry, the wizard in training goes on the run and catches a ride aboard a bus, on which he hears about the new danger that threatens his life. For the first time, a man has escaped from Azkaban prison, the place where the wizardry world's most notorious criminals are held and Sirius Black is no different. Word going around was that he was once a trusted friend of the Potter family but unbeknownst to them he was following the dark path of Lord Voldemort, which led him to betray the Potters and reveal to the dark lord their whereabouts. Though Voldemort's following is long since disbanded, his time in Azkaban prison has led him to go mad, swearing to return to the wizard world and finish the task that his master was unable to do ? by killing Harry Potter. With Black on the loose and young Harry attending school, dementors, evil creatures which guard Azkaban prison, have descended upon Hogwarts in an effort to capture the madman. But instead of presenting Harry with a finer sense of security, they present a darker threat to him, one in which he must find the light within himself to uncover additional clues needed to unlock his mysterious past. The story for Harry Potter &amp; the Prisoner of Azkaban presents not only a continuation of the Harry Potter plot line but is successfully able to mature its stylization and atmosphere along the same lines as the series' continually aging audience. As with the previous two films, the Prisoner of Azkaban never once feels dragged on longer then it should or hurried up too quickly. It leaves the audience feeling at the end as it should, not longing to continue this particular storyline, but anticipating an entirely new adventure in the next adaptation.Though a considerable amount of the cast members from the previous two Potter outings have returned, the younger actors and actresses have gone through a considerable change, namely puberty. This doesn't hurt their performances in any way and actually contributes significantly to the idea of the series of films maturing along with its characters and audience. Daniel Radcliffe's performance will obviously be the one most critics will focus on out of all of the children and they should see a heightening sense of his acting abilities especially as he becomes ever more accustomed to the character he is playing. Depending on whether he will stick around or not, as well as the question of whether there will be, a seventh film, Radcliffe should be able to present one hell of a performance then and his maturing actions can be seen in this film. The most notable addition to the cast, at least to fans of the film series, would Michael Gambon taking on the role of Professor Dumbledore after the recent passing of venerable acting talent Richard Harris. Though his performance doesn't quite match up to Harris', Gambon gives it his best shot and maintains a certain level of charm about the character that had been seen in the previous features. Gary Oldman, notorious for his villainous roles in movies like Bram Stoker's Dracula and Air Force One, slips perfectly into the role of Sirius Black. The only disappointing aspect to his character is that not nearly enough of him is shown in the film as much as the advertisements imply. This isn't necessarily a bad mark against the film, it's actually quite reasonable considering the source on which the film is based on ? it's just an annoyance. And Alan Rickman, reprising the role of Professor Snape, presents another amusing performance, though not as seen as the character had been in the previous features.Overall, director Alfonso Cuaron picks up right where Columbus left off but, in the process, stylizes the third adaptation to his own specifications and presents the most mature and darkly toned Potter film yet to grace the screen, which, in the end, makes it all the more spellbinding. With that in mind, those parents whose younger children were little more then skittish through Chamber of Secrets will have greater difficulty getting them through Prisoner of Azkaban despite the shorter time length. The best option is to view the film for yourself prior to finalizing a decision as to whether your child should see it in theaters or wait for them to mature and catch when it arrives on DVD over Christmas break. The dementors alone are enough to creep out even the most confident of adult viewers ? what do you think they will do to a sensitive six year old? The rest of the film comes complete with 'jump' moments, murky atmosphere, and ominous musical score which are more then enough to set a little child up for some sleepless nights. So for the most beneficial viewing experience for both the child and the movie-going audience around them please take proper precautions prior to venturing out to the local Cineplex this summer. This is not to say that the film is a horribly frightful experience ? in fact for teenagers and young adults it should be quite an entertaining film, with a wonderful blend of slight humor, eerie chills and whimsical fantasy. The only major flaw seen in the film is the level of confusion that is presented when all the pieces of the puzzle come together and the truth about Sirius Black is revealed. It's hard to describe without giving anything away but when it does appear in the film, relatively near the end, be sure to pay attention to details and actions of the characters or else it will leave slightly confused as to what is exactly going on. Other then that, Harry Potter &amp; the Prisoner of Azkaban fails in its attempt at being one of the bigger surprises of the summer, especially for those who enjoyed the previous two films, but succeeds at being one of the more enjoyable experiences of the season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, despite some changes and omissions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid fan of the books, and of the first two films, I went to see "Azkaban" at the very first available showing in my area (as I did with the first two). I came away excited, and a little disappointed, too.Let me pontificate a moment, regarding other reviews I have read. The first two movies (and books) introduce us to the set of characters that are crucial to the whole series. That introduction begins when Harry turns eleven. He is a child. He's thrown into a world he knows nothing about and has to cope with some pretty amazing things that others seem to take for granted. A wonderful story. He meets other children of the same age and they all act like ... children ! What else would one expect? He begins to learn about his past, his parents, the events surrounding their deaths. The information trickles in very slowly and continues throughout all the books. We learn along with Harry. The first two movies stick very close to the books, and in both of the books, these kids are pre-adolescents.In the third book and movie, the kids are growing up. They act more mature because they ARE more mature. One should expect to see better acting from the actors, and their characters appear more "meaty" because the actors are more mature, too. The third movie is "darker" than the other two because the third book is "darker" and is the foundation for books four and five (and presumably six and seven as well). The third book reveals a whole lot more about Harry's parents, about the events surrounding their murders and about their relationships with other characters in the story. Notice that there are few references to Voldemort, unlike in the first two tales. Right there is a clue to the fact that this story is a brief respite from the conflict between Harry and Voldemort, in order to lay down a foundation.The new director made some changes to the Hogwarts scenery. Folks have complained about that, but think for a moment: Chris Columbus set the whomping willow near the buildings and in an open field. That makes it very difficult for someone to hide and overhear conversations that take place near it. Much better if it's on a side hill with some trees and rocks and bushes for cover. Maybe the problem was in the second movie and not in the third.The book has the children going down the hill to Hagrid's cottage. The third movie sets it down the hill. The first two make it appear to be fairly close to the castle and down a knoll - not much of a hill at all. I like the new location better, and it prepares things for the next books, where Hagrid's cottage and the dark forest play important roles. You can't have the cottage too close to the Hogwarts castle. Another minor goof by the director of the first two films, corrected by director Cuaron.Now for my criticism of Cuaron's interpretation of "Azkaban". I was very disappointed that Lupin didn't explain the meaning of "Mooney, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs" as authors of the Marauder's Map. I thought that was a crucial fact that built upon James Potter's character for Harry, and it would have been so easy to put into the movie (maybe it was, and wound up on the cutting room floor, but if so, what a shame).I was disappointed by the almost complete omission of the adolescent spat between Hermione and Ron over Crookshanks and his apparent "eating" of Scabbers. The kids are now adolescents, with raging hormones, and that spat was very significant, but was brushed over by Cuaron with only token reference at best. At least he did get in the explanation of the rat's long life (because it wasn't a rat at all - but Peter Pettigrew). Pettigrew, by the way, looked rat-like, didn't he?Where was the humor regarding Percy's insufferable pomposity at being named head boy, and the twins' constant tweaking him? We only heard Percy once in the movie - if the pomposity was to be overlooked, we didn't need to even hear from him at all. And I missed the humor generated by the Weasley twins.The patronus charm that Harry cast at the lake was in the shape of a stag. But Cuaron did nothing to explain WHY it was a stag. If he had only had Lupin explain "Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs" in the first place, then maybe it would have been easy for Lupin to explain to Harry why the patronus looked like a stag. I think the entire audience would have liked to know who those four were, as it is highly significant and Ms Rowling put it in there to enlighten us all. For those who did not read the book, Mooney was Lupin, Wormtail was Peter Pettigrew (betrayer of Harry's parents), Padfoot was Sirius Black, and Prongs was none other than James Potter, Harry's father. The four friends were inseparable during their days at Hogwarts. Three of them were animagi (wizards who could change into animals) and the fourth, Lupin, was a werewolf (called Mooney because of the effect of the full moon on him). These facts were a crucial piece left out of the film, in my opinion. They would have enlightened the audience members who never read the books, and it wouldn't have added much time to the film.I don't recall the Dementors flying in the book, but I give the director some room for "poetic license". However, in this third book, despite losing the first match of the Quidditch season, Griffindor comes back to defeat Slytherin and win the Quidditch cup for the first time in years, with Harry on his "Firebolt" broom. We got to see the "Firebolt" but its significance was totally lost in the movie, and might just as well have been left out altogether if it wasn't to be used to win that cup. We all (I speak for the audience) wanted to see more Quidditch, and it was there, in the book.Cuaron also glossed over the manipulation of time that Hermione was using to take a double class load the whole year. Yes, he had her popping into classes and Ron several times commenting on it, but a more obvious explanation of what she was doing BEFORE the end of the movie would have been helpful. When she finally did the "three turns" to run time backward, I'm thinking that a lot of the audience had no idea what she was doing or why she had that necklace in the first place. A tiny bit more explaining would have cleared that up. I cannot criticize Michael Gambon for his portrayal of Dumbledore. Unfortunately, Richard Harris died, and someone had to replace him. Credit Gambon for NOT trying to play Richard Harris, but instead playing Albus Dumbledore. It's a bit of a shock to those of us used to Harris, but hey, the show must go on, and I don't think Harris would have wanted someone to play HIM instead of Dumbledore, so Gambon's performance was fine, and hopefully he'll continue with the part in the remaining set of movies and we'll all like him and forget the differences.All in all, I liked the directing, the tone of the movie, the set changes and most of all the maturing of the young actors in their roles and in the story itself. Azkaban sets the stage for the stuff to come next. Harry is learning more about his family, his heritage and at the same time, about himself, and is gaining confidence without losing his humility and sense of loyalty. The character is growing just as he did in the books, and I can't wait for the next set of challenges he must face up to in "Goblet of Fire".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed when i recently went to go see the hp3 movie. i Have read all the hp books and know my potter pretty well. The movie did not do the book justice. It came off as confusing to a lot of my friends that went to go see it, and i was left trying to fill everyone in. I was feeling nauseous while watching it just knowing everything they were leaving out. The whole origin of the map and that it was everybodys nicknames is one thing i thought to be the coolest part of the book, and they talked nothing of it. they did not Show much of crookshanks either, who was a big part in the book. My favorite teacher Hagrid was not shown nor was any other professor really given a chance to shine. The third book was my favhp book and to me they ruined it. I had a picture in my mind of how it was and they did not depict it right to me anyways. Don't get me wrong the movie had great effects, and you can see the actors maturing before your eyes, but the whole story was just jumbled up and made into a something that "hollywood" would like. it was as if they did not care about how to make a good movie based on the book, but rather how to make a "cool" movie and sell the most copies. i was VERY disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though the special effects and actors' performances in this film are quite good, this film seems to lack nearly all of the subtleties and nuances that made the book an enjoyable read. Granted, it would be impossible to capture all the wit and plot twists of the novel, but the writers and director seem to have sucked much of the fun and suspense out of the storyline. The result is a film that feels hurried, leaves several annoying loose-ends, and is peppered with humor that is stale rather than fun.Perhaps the most glaring example of a worn-out joke added to the script was the pseudo-operatic performance of the Fat Lady (the portrait that served as a gateway to the Gryffindor common room), a performance that the movie's plot (and audience) could have easily done without. Though the director saw fit to include this feeble joke in the final cut, he and the writers missed several opportunities to flesh-out the film's characters and explain more about the wizarding world.Despite these shortcomings, this is an entertaining film that is buoyed up by the performances of several of the actors. Moviegoers who have not read the novel will likely enjoy Prisoner of Azkaban. As for those people who have read the book?let's hope there will be some substantial deleted scenes on the VHS and DVD versions of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No Spoilers.First off, I didn't read this book. Therefore, you won't hear me harshly ridiculing the screenplay writer or director for "changing this" or "it wasn't like that in the book". Guess what people, you are watching a M O V I E that a bunch of low-attention span kids will be watching. Of course you can't stuff an entire book's plot evolution into a movie. Just look at what Peter Jackson faced with Lord of the Rings (which I did read and watch).I LOVED THIS MOVIE. In general, this was one of the better movies I've seen in a long time. &gt;From the superbly done special effects that didn't take away from a scene to the clever plot twists and its unfolding. I loved how the viewer was able to see MORE of the outside landscape. It added a richness and believability to the surroundings and storyline.I would not recommend this movie for children under 10. Some of the scarier parts had my wife jumping for my arm. The "Dementors" and the Werewolf were awesomely done but could provide ample material for nightmares.As a whole, this was a well done 'FILM' worth enjoying once and seeing again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is such a thrill to see a fine book become a fine film -- more so in this than even in the previous two films in this series. The kids are becoming quality screen performers, and the adult actors are uniformly of high quality. The look and feel of the film are very true to the book, and yet it is clearly very cinematic, not literary, in plotting and style. Our whole family, all fans of the books, enjoyed it immensely.David Thewlis and Gary Oldman really captured the spirit of their characters, their relationship with Harry, and the sense of their relationship with Harry's parents. Emma Thompson is a delight as Professor Trelawney -- one hopes that all of these fine actors will still be available when their characters return in later films. Michael Gambon had some big shoes to fill as Albus Dumbledore, and (speaking as a true fan of the late Richard Harris) Gambon did an excellent job making Dumbledore his own while maintaining the continuity of the character from the previous films.

		<fullReview>In case you didn't know.Yes, there was a lot missing, but I think that is a great thing. What Chris Columbus did was tell the whole story of the books. That was great with the first one, Chris struggled with the second one because he can't do dark material.I think the leaving out was a good idea because if someone decides to read the book then they will be greatly rewarded with a more complete story. What Alfonso Cuarón did was take the Prisoner of Azkaban book and made a great movie. Choosing to leave out the bits that drags down the story.The best part of it was that it wasn't a continuation of Chris' vision, but it took all the new players and allowed them to put there own twist on it.I hope that the next one presents a more complete story, and that Order of the Phoenix has more than one freggin' Quidditch match.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an admitted Potter-phile....however, my boyfriend is not. He has not read the books, but enjoyed the first two movies. The third however, is another story. The first two movies took the extra couple of minutes to explain a new concept, so that when it would be referred to later in the movie, the audience would be able to fit the pieces of the puzzle together. In the Prisoner of Azkaban, however, much of the information was skipped over.Spoiler alert: Example, in the books, Professor McGonagall takes the time to explain the concept of an Animagus in her classroom. In the movie, it is skipped. At the end when we find out that Sirius is an unregistered animagus, we understand why he was so difficult to find. However, in the movie, it is never explained to the audience members who did not read the books about registering or how James, Peter, &amp; Sirius became Animagi....or for that matter WHY they learned to become Animagi in the first place. Then the movie even skips over the explanation of who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are and the true significance of the Marauders Map....To the non Potter reader, it was an ending that left way too many questions unanswered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, despite some changes and omissions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid fan of the books, and of the first two films, I went to see "Azkaban" at the very first available showing in my area (as I did with the first two). I came away excited, and a little disappointed, too.Let me pontificate a moment, regarding other reviews I have read. The first two movies (and books) introduce us to the set of characters that are crucial to the whole series. That introduction begins when Harry turns eleven. He is a child. He's thrown into a world he knows nothing about and has to cope with some pretty amazing things that others seem to take for granted. A wonderful story. He meets other children of the same age and they all act like ... children ! What else would one expect? He begins to learn about his past, his parents, the events surrounding their deaths. The information trickles in very slowly and continues throughout all the books. We learn along with Harry. The first two movies stick very close to the books, and in both of the books, these kids are pre-adolescents.In the third book and movie, the kids are growing up. They act more mature because they ARE more mature. One should expect to see better acting from the actors, and their characters appear more "meaty" because the actors are more mature, too. The third movie is "darker" than the other two because the third book is "darker" and is the foundation for books four and five (and presumably six and seven as well). The third book reveals a whole lot more about Harry's parents, about the events surrounding their murders and about their relationships with other characters in the story. Notice that there are few references to Voldemort, unlike in the first two tales. Right there is a clue to the fact that this story is a brief respite from the conflict between Harry and Voldemort, in order to lay down a foundation.The new director made some changes to the Hogwarts scenery. Folks have complained about that, but think for a moment: Chris Columbus set the whomping willow near the buildings and in an open field. That makes it very difficult for someone to hide and overhear conversations that take place near it. Much better if it's on a side hill with some trees and rocks and bushes for cover. Maybe the problem was in the second movie and not in the third.The book has the children going down the hill to Hagrid's cottage. The third movie sets it down the hill. The first two make it appear to be fairly close to the castle and down a knoll - not much of a hill at all. I like the new location better, and it prepares things for the next books, where Hagrid's cottage and the dark forest play important roles. You can't have the cottage too close to the Hogwarts castle. Another minor goof by the director of the first two films, corrected by director Cuaron.Now for my criticism of Cuaron's interpretation of "Azkaban". I was very disappointed that Lupin didn't explain the meaning of "Mooney, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs" as authors of the Marauder's Map. I thought that was a crucial fact that built upon James Potter's character for Harry, and it would have been so easy to put into the movie (maybe it was, and wound up on the cutting room floor, but if so, what a shame).I was disappointed by the almost complete omission of the adolescent spat between Hermione and Ron over Crookshanks and his apparent "eating" of Scabbers. The kids are now adolescents, with raging hormones, and that spat was very significant, but was brushed over by Cuaron with only token reference at best. At least he did get in the explanation of the rat's long life (because it wasn't a rat at all - but Peter Pettigrew). Pettigrew, by the way, looked rat-like, didn't he?Where was the humor regarding Percy's insufferable pomposity at being named head boy, and the twins' constant tweaking him? We only heard Percy once in the movie - if the pomposity was to be overlooked, we didn't need to even hear from him at all. And I missed the humor generated by the Weasley twins.The patronus charm that Harry cast at the lake was in the shape of a stag. But Cuaron did nothing to explain WHY it was a stag. If he had only had Lupin explain "Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs" in the first place, then maybe it would have been easy for Lupin to explain to Harry why the patronus looked like a stag.

		<shortDescription>Best movie...but lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Caution: Spoilers if you haven't seen it yet***This was easily the best of the three HP movies so far but it was also the best book of the first three so this was to be expected. The only thing that bothered me is that too much was left out about the origin of the Marauder's Map and how Lupin, Sirius and Peter all grew up with Harry's parents. They never divulged that Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were James and his friends and even why they were animagi and why the Whomping Willow was on Hogwarts grounds. Also, Cuaron seemed to care more about making breath taking shots and memorable moments than telling the story Rowling had written. Overall I think that this was harder for him in comparison to the other movies for Columbus in that SS and COS do not have near as much going on in them. In any case, I give the movie a 10 as movies go but I think you would have to have read the book to fully enjoy the story that is behind it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical in an amazingly dark way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the Harry Potter books and have read all that have been released so far. However, the last two movies, I have utterly despised because in my opinion they did not capture the real magic of Harry Potter. Instead they were filled with what I like to call "false innocence". Chris Columbus made them too childish for my liking, and I seriously thought Daniel Radcliffe was BAD.However, the third movie I was looking quite forward to, having heard that a different man was directing it, and upon seeing the trailer alone I felt it would be a great movie. Indeed it was.Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book out of all Harry Potter books so far, and Alfonso Cuaron did not disappoint me.Acting/Characters: I have to say everyone's acting seems to have improved... Finally! Daniel Radcliffe was ten times better here, though I still have a couple of criticisms for him. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson just brought Ron and Hermione to life for me. :) And I loved Professor Trelawney; she was exactly like I pictured her. However, I don't know what to say about Draco Malfoy. :/ Tom Felton did a good job, but they turned him into a coward! Not the Malfoy I knew in the book! And at first I didn't recognize Neville because of his... err... eyebrows. And I wanted more Snape and Gonagall!!!!! :OI was a bit iffy about how they made Sirius and Lupin look... Not exactly how I pictured them, but I eventually came to accept and love them at the end. :) As for Dumbledore, wow, I was shocked at how different he is! I loved Richard Harris's Dumbledore more, though Gambon's seemed to fit this film better. Oh yeah, and Peter Pettigrew seemed to... rat-like? But otherwise, acting was spot-on.Story/Changes: I was shocked to see how... Different Hogwarts was! And the Dursleys' house changed too. But I like the changes. I was also glad that there were some slight changes from the book. Though, I feel they should have expanded on the friendship of James/Lupin/Sirius/Peter. And there was just a splash of the Ron-Hermione argument. It seemed like there was no point in putting in Crookshanks. They also didn't explain a lot of stuff about Sirius, like how he escaped, etc., which may confuse others. And I didn't know dementors could fly, or if they can literally FREEZE stuff. Hmm...CGI: Awesome!!! Buckbeak was downright lovable! I think he needed more feathers, though... And Lupin's werewolf was more man than wolf. But otherwise, definite improvement from the second one (Fawkes: u-g-l-y) Still prefer LOTR's though (Sorry about the comparison!!!)In general: Just plain awesome. I enjoyed this one. Had to be longer though! But anyway, cool. Now I wonder how Goblet of Fire'll turn out...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potter grows up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far, I think I have to say that this episode of the Harry Potter series is my favourite. Radcliffe has obviously gained more experience in acting and it shows on the screen. A lot of Rowling's imaginative material has been portrayed excellently on the screen, for the film is visually striking. This is a very tightly made film and everything makes sense, even at points where you think it might falter.Some of Cuaron's visual themes are maintained consistently throughout the film - innovative camera angles, imaginative shots, Looney-Tunes type fades between scenes - this all makes for a pleasant night's viewing. John Williams' music is as dependable as ever, the effects are excellent and the characters are well portrayed, although I have to say at certain times major plot points were rushed past us and I couldn't take them all in (2 points in particular) so I was a little befuddled with the specifics but I at least got the general idea. I suppose if I said that to someone who has read the book I would get a bit of ridicule...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close...but no cigar (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a fun film, well told. The change to a darker, more adult theme is set up from the start with grainy film and hand-held camera work (two Columbus no-nos). It is interesting to compare it to Y Tu Mama Tambien. The themes of growing up, leaving one's parents, the inevitability of fate, the possibility of glimpsing the future... it's all in the two of them. Some of the visual stuff is great: the train icing up when the Dementers appear for example. BUT, but - as so many have said, and I have to enter my ha'penneth - this cuts too much from the book. There needs to be more dialogue - difficult when the director obviously was trying to keep something visual and pacy. But so much was left out that is intrinsic to the wonder of the book, which is so moving and wise (yes, really!) The connections between Pettigrew (Wormtail), Lupin (Mooney), Black (Padfoot), and James Potter (Prongs) are not touched on in the film AT ALL. And Dumbledore's final conversation with Harry, when he says it is our choices as much as our abilities that determine who we are. I know that a film can't be a book, but sometimes, just sometimes, you can do something even better. This falls between two stools - too faithful to be a complete re-imagining, too faithless to fully convey the reason why the books are so successful. Timothy Spall was a good rat though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This latest book conversion in the series lives up to expectations. While the other characters retain a sense of whit and live up to what you would expect, harry reveals more to both sides of himself - his flaws as a child and depth as a growing person. That aside, this movie works quite well independantly - I saw it with 2 people who had no interest in seeing the previous movies and they admired the films other good points: Nice special effects &amp; constant plot twists. A lot of plot detail exists here to attempt to make us think but for me, this is where the movie flounders as an offering for adults as the more intelligent and critical of us will predict crutial plot points quite easily and lead to self awareness, Saying that - the plot points retain their emotion and fight off boredom. Child Acting, Plot (too fast to retain depth, restrained to one location), One very lord of the rings comparable creature &amp; obvious CGI in moments sum up my gripes. The score is top notch and the OST worth an independant listen (- John Williams usual amazing standard).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honest review from a non-fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel obligated to preface this review by saying I'm not a big Harry Potter fan. I haven't read any of the books, and this may surprise you, but I haven't seen either of the first two movies. So I'm asking all you Harry Potter marks not to cry too hard at the fact that this review won't be a total praise-fest. OK, now that I've gotten that out of the way, we may proceed.For me, this is what I would consider mild entertainment. It's not a bad movie. In fact, I thought it was quite entertaining in parts. Case in point, the special effects are very good. I thought the Dementors were pretty cool, and I was especially impressed with the half-horse, half-eagle hippogriff. That thing looked surprisingly real. And there were some nice moments of humor as well - particularly when Harry made his Aunt Marge puff up and float away like a big balloon. But to be honest, after all the hype I was really hoping to be blown away, and I just wasn't. It's hard not to have high expectations when this is the typical conversation I have with a Harry Potter fan:Harry Potter mark: Whoa, wait a minute, you mean you haven't seen either of the Harry Potter movies? What's your problem?Johnny: I don't have a problem; I just don't have much interest inHarry Potter.Harry Potter mark: BUT THEY'RE GOOD MOVIES YOU JERK!Johnny: Fine, give me $4 and I'll rent one of 'em.Harry Potter mark: *shakes head and walks away*I must admit, reactions such as the above led me to believe I must be missing out on the next Star Wars or something, but now that I've seen a Harry Potter movie I know I wasn't missing a life-altering event. A lot of adults love the Harry Potter movies, but for me this just had a little too much of a "kid's movie" feel to it. The story just didn't grab me.Harry Potter is the type of movie I probably would've enjoyed a LOT more when I was young, and especially if I had read the books. I think my biggest hang-up is the characters. My type of fantasy movie is Star Wars. I like a tough guy hero (or anti-hero) like Han Solo, and I want a vicious, unmerciful bad guy like Darth Vader. Harry Potter, as a hero, just doesn't do it for me. Radcliffe doesn't do a bad job, but the fact that he looks like SNL's Rachel Dratch really doesn't pump me up to root for him. And Ronald the red-headed kid, man, his incessant whining and frowning annoyed me more than watching an episode of Oprah.It sounds like I'm being pretty harsh, but I know the Harry Potter fans are rabidly loyal, and I just love poking fun at things the fanboys love so passionately. If you're a Harry Potter fan, then you'll love this movie. My brother liked it a lot and said he thought it was better than the Sorcerer's Stone (he hasn't seen the Chamber of Secrets yet), and most everybody in the theater enjoyed it as well. So don't take my fun-loving jabs too personally. Go see the movie and have a good time.THE GIST"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is sure to give fans of the series exactly what they want, especially in regard to the top-notch special effects. I'm not a Harry Potter fan, and this movie didn't do enough to make me a convert, but I still found it mildly entertaining if not mind-blowing. If you loved the previous two movies then you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay needless to say that the visuals are striking,the performances of the now wellknown cast are better then ever but...what about the story...or lack of it? It seems like the director has taken a few parts of the book,filmed them wonderfully but never thought about the people watching the movie without having read the book first.Is this "the best of"? The whole Lupin,Black,Pettigrew,Snape situation in the end kept my friends guessing to what was going on,Crookshanks(my favourite)wasn't given the time of day,the struggle between Hermione and Ron that actually continues throughout the book because of the rat scabbers so called being eaten by Crookshanks is nowhere to be noticed. The ending changed so the hippogriff has a heroic thing going on by shaking off Lupin as a weerwolf.What about Harry's head showing in Hogsmeade and thus having problems with Snape... Yes I think this is a big problem and I do hope the DVD will remedy this. Greetz from Ghent,BelgiumGert</fullReview>

The film is well made and is darker than the previous two films,but there is also a lot of humour in it.Be prepared not to see all of what is in the book! The acting is very good but is a different style to the other two films and takes a while to get used to.Some parts of the story can be a bit slow but the main part of the story is very well made and the special effects are brilliant. the story always has you on the edge of your seat and some scenes may be frightening for younger children -definatly worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darker And More Grown Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry potter returns to our screens in the magnificent "Harry Potter &amp; The Prisoner Of Azkaban". Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison, and is heading towards Hogwarts... Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint reprise their roles of Harry, Hermione and Ron. Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith continue as Severus Snape, Rubius Hagrid and Professor McGonnagall. Sadly, Micheal Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris in the role of the wise old headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Newcomers to the movie include Emma Thompson as Divinations teacher Professor Trelawney, and David Thewlis as Proffessor Remus Lupin. With new director Alfonsó Caurón behind the helm, what we have here, is a faster and much darker movie, light years ahead of the child like magic weaved into the first two movies by Chris Columbus. The third movie is all about trust, friendship and love, with harry learning the truth about his parents, and discovering you cannot always trust the people you think you know. The special effects, were as usual, top notch, with extra marks being given for the delightful "Hippogriff" (as a fan of the books, it was just as i imagined it). There are some genuine tense moments, which some younger viewers of the series, may find a little frightening (The Dementors and the prescence of a werewolf).The young actors and actresses of this movie have put on a magnificent performance. Emma Watson is blossoming as an actress, and her portrayal of Hermione is a lot more sincere and believable. Rupert Grint continues to play Ron, and very well, catching Weasly's clumsiness and slight stupidity rather well. Daniel Radcliffe got the chance to show how emotional these characters can get, and gives a truly emotional performance (ok, thats a little much, but it was still v.good).There are some amusing moments, in particular the scene with the students tackling a boggart in a defence against the dark arts lesson (readers of the book will know what I'm talking about - newcomers can wait and be surprised), and the scene with the Knight Bus. Dawn French makes a wonderful Cameo as The portrait of the fat lady.The only snag i have about the movie, is the ending, which is completely different to the novel. I know movie makers cannot stick to the book page by page, but these little plot difference will play on the minds of the readers. IF you are seeing it fresh without reading the book, "Prisoner of Azkaban" is a truly magical movie, and a fine addition to this movie series.**** out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers)Where do I start with this movie? Well, I suppose I should start by telling you that I am a huge fan of the books, especially this one and so I may be slightly biased. From start to finish I found my self on the edge of the seat, taking in every inch of the screen not wanting to miss a second. The movie flowed smoothly with everything in a perfect order. We would have great scenes with the actors in and then panoramic views of the area surrounding Hogwarts, especially the crucial Womping Willow.The movie starts with our hero practicing magic back at the Dursleys and from then on we are on a roller coaster ride of emotions. From the high points, especially Ron's (Grint) comments to the more sentimental and slightly 'mad' moments of the thought to be evil, Black (Oldman). Thelwis made a wonderful job of portraying the mysterious Lupin as did Oldman with Sirius, both exactly as I personally imagined. The Dementors were a rather creepy moment, helping to introduce the more darker and serious side to the stories.Yes, Alfonso has made an absolutely wonderful job with this movie, sticking to most of the plot. There were a few things which were missed out which to a non-reader may be come confusing but if thought are obvious. He introduced many wonderful extras into the films whilst sticking to the basics. Lupin's 'jazzy' music had a wonderful down to Earth feel bringing this character to life and his and Harry's one on ones allowed to gain a back story to everyone. An extremely enjoyable movie for all the family, with some wonderful additions to the cast, from Emma Thomspson to Dawn French. Acting has improved greatly as has the atmosphere and effects are superb.A must see for fans and non-fans alike.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical in an amazingly dark way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the Harry Potter books and have read all that have been released so far. However, the last two movies, I have utterly despised because in my opinion they did not capture the real magic of Harry Potter. Instead they were filled with what I like to call "false innocence". Chris Columbus made them too childish for my liking, and I seriously thought Daniel Radcliffe was BAD.However, the third movie I was looking quite forward to, having heard that a different man was directing it, and upon seeing the trailer alone I felt it would be a great movie. Indeed it was.Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book out of all Harry Potter books so far, and Alfonso Cuaron did not disappoint me.Acting/Characters: I have to say everyone's acting seems to have improved... Finally! Daniel Radcliffe was ten times better here, though I still have a couple of criticisms for him. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson just brought Ron and Hermione to life for me. :) And I loved Professor Trelawney; she was exactly like I pictured her. However, I don't know what to say about Draco Malfoy. :/ Tom Felton did a good job, but they turned him into a coward! Not the Malfoy I knew in the book! And at first I didn't recognize Neville because of his... err... eyebrows. And I wanted more Snape and Gonagall!!!!! :OI was a bit iffy about how they made Sirius and Lupin look... Not exactly how I pictured them, but I eventually came to accept and love them at the end. :) As for Dumbledore, wow, I was shocked at how different he is! I loved Richard Harris's Dumbledore more, though Gambon's seemed to fit this film better. Oh yeah, and Peter Pettigrew seemed to... rat-like? But otherwise, acting was spot-on.Story/Changes: I was shocked to see how... Different Hogwarts was! And the Dursleys' house changed too. But I like the changes. I was also glad that there were some slight changes from the book. Though, I feel they should have expanded on the friendship of James/Lupin/Sirius/Peter. And there was just a splash of the Ron-Hermione argument. It seemed like there was no point in putting in Crookshanks. They also didn't explain a lot of stuff about Sirius, like how he escaped, etc., which may confuse others. And I didn't know dementors could fly, or if they can literally FREEZE stuff. Hmm...CGI: Awesome!!! Buckbeak was downright lovable! I think he needed more feathers, though... And Lupin's werewolf was more man than wolf. But otherwise, definite improvement from the second one (Fawkes: u-g-l-y) Still prefer LOTR's though (Sorry about the comparison!!!)In general: Just plain awesome. I enjoyed this one. Had to be longer though! But anyway, cool. Now I wonder how Goblet of Fire'll turn out...?</fullReview>

Not exactly how I pictured them, but I eventually came to accept and love them at the end. :) As for Dumbledore, wow, I was shocked at how different he is! I loved Richard Harris's Dumbledore more, though Gambon's seemed to fit this film better. Oh yeah, and Peter Pettigrew seemed to... rat-like? But otherwise, acting was spot-on.Story/Changes: I was shocked to see how... Different Hogwarts was! And the Dursleys' house changed too. But I like the changes. I was also glad that there were some slight changes from the book. Though, I feel they should have expanded on the friendship of James/Lupin/Sirius/Peter. And there was just a splash of the Ron-Hermione argument. It seemed like there was no point in putting in Crookshanks. They also didn't explain a lot of stuff about Sirius, like how he escaped, etc., which may confuse others. And I didn't know dementors could fly, or if they can literally FREEZE stuff. Hmm...CGI: Awesome!!! Buckbeak was downright lovable! I think he needed more feathers, though... And Lupin's werewolf was more man than wolf. But otherwise, definite improvement from the second one (Fawkes: u-g-l-y) Still prefer LOTR's though (Sorry about the comparison!!!)In general: Just plain awesome. I enjoyed this one. Had to be longer though! But anyway, cool. Now I wonder how Goblet of Fire'll turn out...?</fullReview>

Cuaron did his best to be as faithful as possible to the book (Nevertheless, hardcore book fans will not like it), and I think that this is the best adaptation so far. Kudos to Se?or Cuaron, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, the Weasley twins(I don't know their true names), Gary Oldman, and the whole cast. Just Amazing!!!10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! This one's really good, by far the best of the three Harry Potter movies. Criticising a film based on a book is always difficult. After all, there are two ways to look at it: you can compare it with the book, or you can look at it forgetting about the book and rate is as a film as such (which, of course, is almost impossible if you have read the book). This one turns out very good either way. Whereas in The Chamber of Secrets it looked like possibly all the wrong choices had been made concerning what to include and - most of all - what to exclude from the film, here this very difficult task is done perfectly. The film would become a couple of hours longer if the director should choose to include everything (we're not even talking about the next two parts...), so you have to make choices. And yes, this means that a lot about the classes, the yearly competition, the frictions between our main characters, Hagrid's creatures, the trips to Hogsmeade etc is left out, the director concentrates on the plot. And this he does in an excellent way. Although it is a rather complicated story, it is brought to you as clear as, well, anything. Even the time travel part, which is done perfectly. OK, one remark: the whole story about Potter sr and his friends could or should have gotten a little more attention and explication. There are a couple of points where the film deviates from the book, but always in a supportive and OK manner. Two more compliments. Harry Potter in the books starts to become a more and more annoying teenager, not to say an insufferable jerk (is it adult's eyes reading a children's book?); here there's nothing of that, he remains sympathetic all the way. Although I must say that this gets worse especially in the next books, and certainly in the Phoenix-one. Secondly, and more important. I hate - and I mean HATE - digital effects. That has got nothing - and I repeat myself: NOTHING - to do with making a film. Just a cheap trick, and that was a bad (and commercial) band in the seventies already... Of course it's unavoidable here, and I must say that it is done in a brilliant way. The effects really are perfect. Well, you can see it is fake (how could you not?), but it's not disturbing, even nice to see. So even as you look at it as just a film and forget about the book it's a pleasure to watch. Can't imagine that little children have any fun when watching it, though. But that is not my problem...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Improvement From Prequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the book, Azkaban has been the best of the 5 series. So far it is too in screen. Alfonso Cuaron deserves the credit. The 3rd installment of the book as we know has been the longest compared to the 2 first and as we have also known they cut a lot of scenes to fit into the 150 mins screening. When still losing some touches, Azkaban has got the best cutting and replacing and modifying some scenes. I enjoy the superb visual effects especially when Harry riding on Buckbeak.When grown to become extremely hot, Radcliffe still needs a lot of polishing in his acting. Overall the movie deserves slightly higher than 7.5 so 8 comes close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Harry Potter? You'll Like The Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first time posting a review, so bare with me. I also have a 1,000 word limit, and that hurts me to because of how much there is to talk about in regards to this movie.But, getting on with it. The point I want to address is the general adaptation of it. It basically works like this. Either you are expecting a 100% literal translation of book into film, something that has a similar feel but is very new and interesting, or a mixture of the both. In my opinion, PoA is the mixture of both.If you are looking for the exact story in a motion picture format, you'll be disappointed. Likewise, if you are looking for something only vaguely like the book, you'll be disappointed to.The movie captures all the biggest parts, but does leave a lot out. Many fans will be disappointed several important things are left out, in my opinion, namely the history behind the Marauders Map.Overall, though, as a movie, it was pretty good. Special Effects were top notch, acting was better, the story was good. Not looking at it as a book, but simply as a movie, it does alright!My rating? If you like Harry Potter in general, you'll probably like the movie. Non-Fans probably won't get much out of it and may have a hard time keeping up. So, I give it an 8/10. Also I think it's better than the first two.One final note. Even though it is PG rated, I thought that the entire movie was geared for a slightly older audience than the first two. So, know your kids before taking them and leave the really young ones at home perhaps!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What spoiled it for me......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well.. I went to see the movie yesterday. Being someone who has read and re-read the books several times (although I don't claim to be an obsessive), I have to say I left the cinema rather disappointed. It's not that I thought the movie itself as a whole was so bad.. but for this budget I didn't feel it made the grade. The quality of the shooting felt to me almost like a low budget British movie from the 1970's, where as the darkened tone of colours may have been effective in parts, it was overkill using it through the entire movie. Personally I LIKED the more colourful fantasy world feel Chris Columbus gave. As well this the movie seemed as though it cut so fast from scene to scene it felt almost as though Harry's school year was over in a few days!The Dementors seemed far too CGI based to be truly scary, and aren't they supposed to glide? I can't remember them flying in the book... Also, wasn't it supposed to be Cedric Diggory playing (seeker) against Harry in the Quidditch match featured in the film. If so then Cedric got struck by lightning? (It will be interesting to see if the same actor gets cast as Cedric)Michael Gambon I felt barely passed as Dumbledore, it's all very well wanting to put his own perspective into the character but personally I preferred Richard Harris' wise and regal portrayal as this gave the character a far greater sense of power. Although yes Gambon played up to the bumbling side of Dumbledore to good effect at times (which in truth Harris didn't do enough of), there wasn't enough of it to make me appreciate it.The fact that no mention was made as to how Lupin or Sirius knew what the Marauder's map did was also annoying (I can imagine for those who haven't read the books it would be yet another puzzling factor of the filmI also felt that Harry's mastering of the Patronus (over in two seconds) and the way the Patronus was portrayed (in terms of CGI) were poor, where was the galloping stag! Even when Harry shot the patronus across the lake, I felt as though there should have been more 'oomph' to it, but instead there was nice ambient light and twinkly flute music. The one thing that annoyed me most about the movie was the complete change of set from the previous two films. I don't mean to seem neurotic about it or anything, but I feel as though anyone watching the films in series on DVD or whatever years from now, will think it surely strange. Not only did the scenery change but it went from lovely English countryside to rugged highlands of Scotland. Although I read the first book before the movie came out. When I saw the first movie it kind of gave me an impression of how I at least thought JK Rowling must have wanted Hogwarts to look, and in this movie, I felt as though it was a completely different place. Not to mention the fact they seem to hang around that outdoor bit with the clock and the bridge all the time (and kids playing the flute?) which has never appeared before. Dawn French as the fat lady. Another cast change, don't get me wrong, I quite like Dawn French, but is it just me or does it seem like every British actor who is remotely any good or famous is trying to get in on this franchise. Rumours of Kate Winslet wanting the part as Fleur Delecour etc. Sigh.....Also, did anyone else also notice that Professor Flitwick was different, and, Crabbe, or is it Goyle... changed to a different boy half way through the film). Also, they pronounce animagus wrong, magus should be pronounced phonetically as may-jus? According to my dictionary anyway... In conclusion, the film wasn't bad, but it just didn't feel like Harry Potter to me, more like an episode of Grange Hill with magic. I thought the quality, style, and scene timing poor. There was not enough from great characters like Dumbledore, Hagrid, Malfoy and McGonagall. (Did anyone else also notice that Professor Flitwick was different, and, Crabbe, or is it Goyle... changed to a different boy half way through the film). The soundtrack was a bit poor, especially considering it was John Williams, the only good thing really was the choir and the revamped Harry Potter theme. I also felt strongly that the film relied too much on the fact that people need to have knowledge of the books to understand it properly. Credit to the actors though, Daniel Radcliffe was more expressive and more natural this time round - he still needs work though, hopefully he'll continue to get better.... Well... that's the end of my rant.. one other thing though.. how are they EVER going to fit GOF and OOTP into single films without making them basically mirages of 10 second scenes briefly outlining Harry's year......?! :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best So Far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's most definitely the best one in the series of film adaptations so far. The humor throughout the film, makes the 2 hour and 19 minute running time fly by. It helps that the young actors, Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, are all developing into very fine actors. The whole cast is wonderful and Alfonso Cuaron should be proud. He did a magnificent directing job. The film takes the heart of the novel and portrays it well on-screen. Though, die-hard Potter fans may notice some major scenes missing from the film that were in the book, they will not be disappointed by the film. From beginning to end, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a funny, suspenseful, enjoyable ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI saw the movie last night at a 10pm showing. I had read reviews and was expecting anything from a gamut of so terrible I would storm out and so wonderful I'd melt. I think I feel more of the latter. OK, so I could drone on that the movie didn't follow the exact guidelines of the books, but I think that Cuarón captured the heart of the book perfectly.As a fan of the books it is amazing to see your thoughts become real, I was especially pleased to not only see Hermione thump Malfoy, but also that his head hit the stone behind him!The most touching part on the movie were the scenes with Harry and Sirius, both Daniel Radcliffe and Gary Oldman play their parts spectacularly. I had tears in my eyes when Harry said that he would like to live with Sirius in the country so he could see the sky. It was made even more touching by knowing what happens in OotP.While the scenes at the Dursleys were short they were what they have been in the past two films, the performances are pleasant, though not a very integral part of the film. Bravo to Pam Ferris for getting just right the horridness of Aunt Marge.It is quite amazing to see how the Hogwarts students have grown since Chamber of Secrets, I was particularly stuck by Radcliffe's aging in the quidditch scene (and is it me, or does he resemble slightly Elijah Wood?!) It is good to see the actors grow with their characters, I honestly can't imagine them being replaced as no one else would "fit".Michael Gambon gives a good performance as Dumbledore given the few scenes he is actually in.Alan Rickman has managed to make Snape even eviler, despite spending a minute dressed in drag! He captured the spitefulness of Snape in this movie, which grows - if possible - even more.David Thewlis did an extraordinary job of playing Lupin, I could easily believe the part was written just for him. One thing I noticed was when he was packing up to leave the way he talked about "people like him" reminded me of the bigotry surrounding gay people, it seemed to me that was what they were aiming for so the the moral of the part of the story line was don't judge people on what they are but on *who* they are.For some light comic relief Lenny Henry - as the shrunken head in the Knight Bus - and Dawn French - as the new Fat Lady - were hilarious. And Emma Thompson as Trelawney had me laughing non-stop. I found also that Rupert Grint did an excellent job at Ron's mostly unintentional humour.Timothy Spall was OK as Pettigrew, I feel they could have let his scene extend a little, but he worked well with the time he had.I did enjoy the whole time-travel part, it wasn't confusing but did actually make sense, what with the stone-throwing and Hermiones "I thought I just saw...never mind."I saw the movie with my brother and mum, my brother like me has read the books and felt the movie justified them, my mum has not read the books, but was able to follow the story line and intricacies of the plot to the letter, I didn't even tell her about the bits the movie left out of the story (which I had done with the first two books) because I really do feel that this movie really did get the book and turn it into the ideal movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the World Premiere of Azkaban, and I thought it was very impressive. The highly anticipated appearances of Black (Oldman) and Lupin (Thewlis) did not disappoint, as I was afraid, but rather gave me new insights into what seem to be clichéd characters.The camera-work and art direction seem much more solid in this film; it is noticeably darker than the previous films. (Although there were a few bright spots, I found the lack of color somewhat overdone.)The acting from the young leads is much better now that they're older, and their characters have obviously grown from the previous years, making them more realistic and enjoyable to watch.The supporting cast, as always, was superb. Especially Rickman, Oldman, and Gambon replacing the late Harris.The only real criticism I have is this: Azkaban suffers from what I like to call "'Lord of the Rings'itis." By this I mean the filmmakers have decided that, for some reason, elements of the main plot should be cut out in order to shorten the length of the movie. Which is perfectly fine for those who have read the books and follow the story, but makes the film confusing for those who don't know or remember the intimate details.There were a few parts of the book that I feel convey very important pieces of information (back story, motivation for characters' actions) that were seemingly hacked from the movie's script. Many of these scenes I didn't even notice until after leaving the theater, but they are CRUCIAL to understanding the story.Azkaban, the book, was surely the most in-depth about the older characters in the series -- and it seems to me a terrible mistake for them to have neglected this very important aspect of the book. (The movie-viewing audience does not even know yet that Lupin, Black, or even Snape attended Hogwarts!) The tension between these characters in the movie is left unexplained and seemingly unwarranted.I would have to rate this movie an 8/10 instead of 9/10, simply because these scenes were not included. I recommend the film highly, however, I would advise the skimming of the novel before going to the theater. I would also like to note that I dislike the Harry Potter books, although I find that they make great "fun" films, so my review is not based on any fan-inflation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great book, bat movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off all I like the movie but i think it could be much better. Alfonso Cuarón Orozco should at least read the book 20 times. Just to get in the mood of the Harry potter world. Then he had to see at the previous movies, so that he knew how that it looked like, you just can't change the castle and the grounds, you got to work with the seem things.What I think was the saddest thing he could do is the patronus of Harry instead of a dear it is a little white line white a big cloud of white smoke, in the book its a dear that took the demontors on his head and throw them away.I hope that Chris Columbus can make it al better whit the Goblet of Fire next year, Alfonso Cuarón Orozco can learn something from him. Not that the first two movies's where perfect but at least they wear better than this one.Alfonso Cuarón Orozco chanced the story so that it would fix in his wicked way of things. I thing he didn't even took the time to read the book preparedly.And I could be longer than 147 min for telling the whole story. 180 min like lord of the rings for example, just so that we could get into the magic world of Harry Potter.But the cast was great Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) did it very well. Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid) was greater than in the first two movies'. Alan Rickman (Professor Serveus Snape) did his thing as snape and i must say, nobody could do it better than him.If you haven't read the book, you don't understand the movie. So a tip first read the book and then go and see the movie, just to get a idea of the world of harry potter, but don't get your hopes to high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was SO excited to watch the third HARRY POTTER film.. mainly because of the cast, the story, and everything else that comes with it..I think it IS safe to say that it differs a little if compared to the first films, because of the new director and the much mature actors and actresses. I mean, look at Daniel, Emma, and Rupert... they look SO much cooler and SO much mature now...The plot in this movie is also better than the other two (in my opinion)... The excellent acting of the three main actors ARE exceptional.. Daniel, Emma, and Rupert have improved a lot.. they're getting SO good at these films... i mean, SO good at it.. Daniel is having a little problem though.. His good looks are noticeable in all the films.. And it IS noticeable, TOO.. that Emma is getting prettier-and- prettier as time passes.. Rupert, on the other hand, has not changed his excellent way of acting.. Anybody can see the humor in his lines..They have chosen a poor replacement for Dumbledore though.. Not even Michael Gambon can deliver as well as Richard Harris.. I'm not saying that I didn't like Gambon's performance, it's just that I miss Harris' accent and his way of acting.I've heard some people complaining about certain differences in the film and in the book.. I, too wanted to complain.. not because of the differences, because of the lack of explanation of the Marauders Map's history.. All in all, I'm gonna give the third movie a whopping 9/10.all together now, WICKED!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You expect to be disappointed by a much awaited and hyped new release, but 10 minutes in and I knew this was a great film. Radcliffe really can act, depending on the situation he appears like a young boy, someone bearing a heavy burden, an angry teenager...It's fairly creepy, I would be wary of taking young children, particularly if they haven't read the book. The film is liberated from the confines of the school, very little happening in the classroom. Cuaron certainly wields his own magic on the film even doing well incorporating the effects (something he is not known for) smoothly. The Knight Bus sequence is fun and thrilling, and there is a lot to laugh at without breaking the mystery. This is my favourite Potter book, but the film did not let me down. The plot concentrates on the more important characters, most of the other pupils are just background. I would quite happily have sat in the cinema all day. Mike Newell, you have a hard act to follow.</fullReview>

I, myself love the books; the way that Rowling manages to create a completely enthralling world of magic and mystery's through the eyes of a young boy, but the films- although they are mildly amusing they are completely ruined by the need to constantly compare them to the books. i realize this is going to be a problem with any book transformed into a film (just look at Alex Garland's The Beach) but its just made even worse by the knowledge that Rowlings books get even longer and the hope that they won't continue to try and fit them all into the regulation 2 1/2 hours. having said all that i do think that this film is the best of the bunch, the new angsty/dark style of Alfonso Cauron make the films more 'realistic' if you can use that word for a wizarding film! The renowned director of Y Tu Mama Tambien really makes his mark on main stream cinema with this sure to be summer blockbuster!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing new take on the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third installment to the Harry Potter series just got better. With a new director on the helm (among other things) the movie and its cast has grown out of its shell and into maturity.The movie is now no longer slow and is no longer trying to impress its audience. It is now more direct and less dragging, with much better and impressive shots from falling leaves to flying umbrellas to silly little blue jays. Almost every detail is rich with color and brilliance, nothing too distracting or too droned out. Each shot has a point and it is sure to make something of it. The film then proceeds to take hold of you for the next two hours and you won't even notice the time fly by.Most of the actors have also improved their presence. With the new director it was refreshing to see the cast do a splendid performance - a performance which definitely surpassed the previous film. Alas, we can't help but feel the absence of several actors in this film but the additions of new ones was thoroughly exciting.Their more relaxed outfits were also a pleasant scene than the previous films which often shows the cast in their ever so black school clothes. Here, the sexuality and maturity of the actors are accented by their clothes and by the complexity of their costumes. Growing out of its shell, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is one very delightful journey. A refreshing new take on the series and a brilliant follow up on which Alfonso Cuarón did a magnificent job and surely deserves another take on the helm in the up coming chapters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cuaron delivers a more believable Potter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possibly some spoilers)There's something refreshing about letting a new director take the helm of a series of movies. Although Chris Columbus' schmaltzy vision of the world of wizards was a gratifying, if slightly condescending, experience, the darker tone of the later books needed someone else to give the films a new twist. And Alfonso Cuaron's post-"Y u mama tambien" experience is a welcome addition to the Harry Potter franchise. From the start, Cuaron transports us into a far moodier and broodier Hogwarts than Columbus could have ever dreamed of. After all, Harry and co. are hitting puberty and the myriad of emotions and confusion that comes with it, so the backdrops to the narrative have been set to reflect the change. The jingling feel-good factor of "Philospher's Stone" and "Chamber of Secrets" is in scant supply, as the gloominess of identity crisis seeps in to the young hero's world. Ideas of time and identity are ever-present throughout the film, with plenty of poignant, reflective passages for Harry to traverse. Furthermore Cuaron has decided to place the ever-present threat of notorious criminal Sirius Black and the other-worldly dementors as the focal point to the film's drive, but with a decent balance of fear and tension inherant in the tale. Unlike most standard popcorn fare, the young director actually builds up his monsters in the same way as Spielberg managed in Jaws - by showing as little as possible of them until he absolutely has to - which saves them from suffering a "Van Helsing"-like fate.Of course, critics will point to obvious flaws in the film to discredit it. For example, the kids are now too old to play the parts, Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is a far cry from Richard Harris' performance, too much detail has been left out of the books - and so on. But this is just nitpicking. In terms of acting, all of the children have quickly developed and grown into their characters, and it is a welcome return for all of the Hogwarts misfits. With an ever-growing crop of British thespians loitering the hallowed halls there was never going to be enough time to incorporate them all, but each one of them shows up to play their part. Once again Robbie Coltrane embodies the enormity of Hagrid flawlessly and Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore will no doubt grow in stature in later installments, whilst Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and new arrival Emma Thompson are now nicely nestled into their supporting roles.Most surprising, on the other hand, is David Thewlis' Professor Lupin who steals the show. Toe-ing the line between flawed, tragic would-be hero and kindly mentor, his performance gives resonance to the story without letting it drift into intolerable cheesiness. (An achievement in itself when you have to contend with Gary Oldman in the hamminess stakes) Of course, condensing a four-hour book into a two-and-a-half hour film was always going to lose some of the sub plots, and there are a few loose ends that Mike Newell's Goblet of Fire will have to address. Harry's father's involvement with the Marauder's Map, for example, as well as the importance of the stag shape of Harry's patronus charm. But as far as adaptations go, "Prisoner of Azkaban" is a respectable offering that has broken the franchise mold nicely. With further teenage angst, death, destruction and confusion to come in the series, lets hope that future Potter films don't revert back to the cute-and-cuddly vision that preceded them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best So Far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's most definitely the best one in the series of film adaptations so far. The humor throughout the film, makes the 2 hour and 19 minute running time fly by. It helps that the young actors, Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, are all developing into very fine actors. The whole cast is wonderful and Alfonso Cuaron should be proud. He did a magnificent directing job. The film takes the heart of the novel and portrays it well on-screen. Though, die-hard Potter fans may notice some major scenes missing from the film that were in the book, they will not be disappointed by the film. From beginning to end, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a funny, suspenseful, enjoyable ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI saw the movie last night at a 10pm showing. I had read reviews and was expecting anything from a gamut of so terrible I would storm out and so wonderful I'd melt. I think I feel more of the latter. OK, so I could drone on that the movie didn't follow the exact guidelines of the books, but I think that Cuarón captured the heart of the book perfectly.As a fan of the books it is amazing to see your thoughts become real, I was especially pleased to not only see Hermione thump Malfoy, but also that his head hit the stone behind him!The most touching part on the movie were the scenes with Harry and Sirius, both Daniel Radcliffe and Gary Oldman play their parts spectacularly. I had tears in my eyes when Harry said that he would like to live with Sirius in the country so he could see the sky. It was made even more touching by knowing what happens in OotP.While the scenes at the Dursleys were short they were what they have been in the past two films, the performances are pleasant, though not a very integral part of the film. Bravo to Pam Ferris for getting just right the horridness of Aunt Marge.It is quite amazing to see how the Hogwarts students have grown since Chamber of Secrets, I was particularly stuck by Radcliffe's aging in the quidditch scene (and is it me, or does he resemble slightly Elijah Wood?!) It is good to see the actors grow with their characters, I honestly can't imagine them being replaced as no one else would "fit".Michael Gambon gives a good performance as Dumbledore given the few scenes he is actually in.Alan Rickman has managed to make Snape even eviler, despite spending a minute dressed in drag! He captured the spitefulness of Snape in this movie, which grows - if possible - even more.David Thewlis did an extraordinary job of playing Lupin, I could easily believe the part was written just for him.

By this I mean the filmmakers have decided that, for some reason, elements of the main plot should be cut out in order to shorten the length of the movie. Which is perfectly fine for those who have read the books and follow the story, but makes the film confusing for those who don't know or remember the intimate details.There were a few parts of the book that I feel convey very important pieces of information (back story, motivation for characters' actions) that were seemingly hacked from the movie's script.

		<fullReview>They are very different when you compare the first two movies and this third one. I just saw it and must say that I will have to see it at least once more to appreciate it fully. But non the less it is a good movie with a very different scenery this time. Although I think a few comments are in place. Like the new Dumbledore, now of course a replacement is always hard to find and I do hope that for the coming movies they won't have to replace anyone else. Michael Gambon does try very well even though he doesn't have the charisma Richard Harris had. But Tom the landlord? He is supposed to be a gentle man like we saw in part one, not a hunchback, dark type.On the one hand it is a shame that they didn't look at the previous movies more but on the other hand Harry is growing up and becoming more angrier.Even though my comments are not that positive I still think it is a brilliant movie and I can't wait for the next one. But first.....part six, I want to read it, when is it coming?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SpoilerPlot It was good but flawed if you know the book well since so many important scenes are missing like no-one explained to Harry how James Potter, Remus and Sirius were best friends nor the meaning behind their nicknames so Harry has no idea why his patronus is a stag. Nor do we see why Snape hates Sirius and Lupin. Also, the ending was too cheesy with Harry flying at the screen on his new Firebolt broom and then freezing on him smiling. I'd have preferred the book's ending, much funnier.It was all a bit rushed. However, several lines were lifted directly from the book and it flowed far better. It seemed more likely a movie and less like a straight transfer of the book to film like the last two. Some people won't like that every scene wasn't included, but it really helps the movie feel more cinematic. The scriptwriters just need to ensure they include every crucial scene as leaving out such important parts as detailed earlier is extremely noticeable to book readers (especially because they are important to the overall series plot) Basically, another 10 minutes of screen time would have solved these errors and I can only hope the DVD comes with deleted scenes!Acting The Pupils Hermione. She's a high point on her own; she stands out the best of all the young actors. She's just spotless in her acting; she balances humour and emotion just right and is generally enjoyable. As is Ron, who was very funny and more like he is in the books. I'm glad these two are gradually being set-up as a couple; they are a cute duo and fun to watch spar/spark.Sadly, Harry is still letting them down... he was chosen for his resemblance to the character and it's obvious. His acting is slightly better this time round, but he's still not terribly good. Draco was also a disappointment in this movie; he was reduced to comic relief as a total cry-baby/sap. The menace of his character was totally absent. Fred and George were just right in this movie; a lot of the characterisation of these two was lost previously and it was good to see the humour and generally mischievous nature of these two portrayed properly.The Teachers The new Dumbledore was good, I can't distinguish if I prefer the first actor or this new one but I didn't notice any real change. This is good. I don't recall McGonagall having any relevant part to play at all in the movie. But Snape provided his usual intimidation, new teacher Trelawney was suitably batty but a lot of the humour involved with her was lost. Personally, I always love Harry and Ron's mocking of her lessons, a funny highlight of the books. Hagrid was enjoyable in this film; I liked his new interactions as a teacher and his chance to do a bit of serious acting in the scenes involving the execution of Buckbeak. And finally, Lupin was a good addition to the cast. I enjoyed his lessons of Defence Against the Dark Arts more than all previous ones shown and still found him to be my favourite teacher of this subject as in the books. Only drawback was I felt he was a little mean and some crucial dialogue he should have shared with Harry was cut leaving me with a sense of disappointment.Special Effects Special effects were good, aside from the Patronus, which I wasn't a fan of. Buckbeak was good. The Lupin werewolf was cool though not really scary, compared the Sirius dog was actually much creepier and looked much better stylistically. Quidditch was the same old stuff, though it didn't get much screen time this time round so there isn't an awful lot to judge.The Whomping Willow was a nice device used in the movie to show the changing of seasons as well as being surprisingly funny. Oh, and the big thing people care about... The Dementors. At times I thought they were slightly scary but most of the time i just wound up thinking the Nazgul in LOTR were much creepier.The Knight Bus was good, but not how I imagined it to be. However they achieved a good effect in showing how fast the bus travels and the overall design was impressive.Finally, the paintings in the school were wonderful. We get to see many of them up close this time round and it's a treat seeing the sheer variety of characters contained within. Plus, Dawn French as the Fat Lady of Gryffindor is a hoot. I loved her. General Stuff * The entire Hogwarts scenery has been changed. Some will complain but I think it's much better, it seems much more like a castle in the Scottish Highlands, which is what Hogwarts is meant to be, and because the majority of the film is set outdoors it helps add a feeling of depth and scope to the locale around.* Speaking of Buckbeak, I love this creature. The special effects were beautiful, the scenes with it in glowed and I got a sense of the power and beauty of this creature. They did an excellent job creating the Hippogriff but more importantly giving it life. * Personally, I liked the darker tone of the movie. The book was dark and it was suitable that the film was too, allowing the characters more depth and as said earlier affording the whole movie a much more cinematic feeling. It felt grown up and as our heroes are getting older this was just what the film needed. Wrapping Up Despite what anyone says, Azkaban IS worth watching and in my opinion it is the best of the movies so far. Don't miss out on a movie that by its own merits is good, even if it pales slightly in comparison with the novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's meaner, it's darker...but is it better?- SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a lovely hour queuing together with three year olds on sugar high,yesterday I have seen Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. As this is the movie version of my favourite of the HP books so far, I had great expectations and couldn't wait to finally see it...So what's it like? I think it's one of the most frustrating movie I have ever seen!!! The fact that it is extraordinarily good in some things, and terribly bad in others made me feel a bit strange all the way through. I'll explain... On the production side, the movie is a gem: dark, stark and un-disneyish. Also the actors have improved and the new characters are quite impressively played by the likes of David Thewlis, Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson. Also, theunderlying moods of the movie have "grown up" since its predecessors. I haveenjoyed how the director plays with themes such as time (a strong element inthe whole HP series, related to Harry growing up, his past and his future) and Harry's perception of himself. BUT these great features are undermined by the huge cuts that the booksuffered when transposed to screenplay, mostly at the expense of characterdevelopment and tension build-up...Watching the movie you realise the climaxof the story has arrived and you have kind of missed how you got there!!! Also, the cuts mean that the audience never gets to hear why Snape hates Lupin andBlack so much, who the hell Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are, howdoes Lupin know that the Marauder map is indeed a map, why Harry is soobsessed by his fate and by dark omens, why cats, rats and dogs don't like each other, why Professor Trelawney prediction is so important, etc etc etc...I'll stop here! There's quite a lot left out, clearly, and sometimes I wondered if people who haven't read the book could actually understand what was going on. With the movie being so good in other respects, it's frustrating to see the story butchered and the characters thinned so much...The scene with Snape (AlanRickman is excellent...wish there was more of him), Lupin and Sirius in theShrieking Shack is so bloody brilliant that you wish it didn't last only 30 seconds, but that it were faithful to the book! You only get to see a spark of the hatred, recriminations and deceit that run among them...But then again, you only about this if you've read the book... So, in conclusion, go and see the movie for some good moments and for finally seeing some of your fantasies of POA represented on screen (Hogsmeade,Buckbeak, the Marauders Map)...But for story, pathos and greatcharacters...Stick to the book!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more adult Harry Potter movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban went on general release in the UK yesterday and I caught a late-night showing. This movie is a phenomenal addition to the series, very much darker both figuratively and literally, the child actors are really developing nicely (Grint, for example, is far better than he was in Chamber of Secrets) and director Cuaron put in lots of little visual touches that wouldn't have occurred to Chris Columbus in a million years. One strange thing is that the entire geography of Hogwarts has entirely changed. Both Hagrid's cottage and the Whomping Willow are in totally different places from the previous movie. However, this is not to denigrate the art direction which seems to be better than ever. One major addition to the general set is the workings of the giant Hogwarts Clock, used as a backdrop or for fly-through again and again, to great effect. Also notable is the bridge from the castle to Hagrid's cottage, a fine example of distressed woodwork.Atmospherically the movie is almost totally different from its predecessors. The colours are muted and the sky is always overcast, actually sometimes to a fault - the emotional involvement one should have felt when Harry was first riding Buckbeak was muted by the gunmetal tones of the landscape he was flying over. Beautiful indeed, but not in a "children's fantasy film" way. This is a quibble. Really the style absolutely suited the much darker ways of the plot. The Quidditch match, which takes place, as in the book, in a driving rainstorm, is an absolute tour-de-force of terror without the gimmicky camera-work prevalent in the first two films. The Dementors, in particular, are extremely well handled and are the backbone, to me, to what I found the most terrifying sequences in the whole Harry Potter saga so far. However, there are also fun parts - particularly the Knight Bus, beautifully translated from the description of Harry's nightmare journey in the book, and a brilliant piece of design in the bus itself. The book is followed almost too faithfully, resulting in little for the much-anticipated Gary Oldman to do as the mad, bad and dangerous to know Sirius Black. But David Thewlis very effectively fills in the void as Lupin. Michael Gambon has stepped so seamlessly into Richard Harris's shoes as Dumbledore that I never remotely thought of comparing their performances. Gambon is no less Dumbledore than Harris was ... in fact he might be a little better.One does hope, however, that when the DVD comes out, they make an "Extended Edition" rather than put the deleted scenes in a separate section as they have hitherto. In the released film it is all too evident, on occasion, where cuts have been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was SO looking forward to the 3rd Harry Potter film. The story was a big step forward from the two previous books and they made some great additions to the cast. Unfortunately this film badly needed an extra 20-30 minutes to flesh out the story and add character depth. I feel they cut it down far too much and it has suffered as a result. Please let there be an extended version on DVD in the future.I've read some say its dark and magical - Dark yes and rightly so, but certainly lacking magic (except for the flying scene with buckbeak). The scenery and Hogwart's are very stark and dreary, not magical at all. Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is 'grey' in every sense - clothes, beard, persona (great actor wasted) - where did the character and his splendor go?Someone also thought it a good idea to cast Dawn French as the fat lady and wasted valuable screen time on her. The minister for magic is now human and another bit of magic goes with this re-casting. The relationship with professor Lupin and Harry at the core of the book was never developed - the patronus spell Harry fought hard to learn was managed in 2 attempts in the film. And when he uses the spell at the lake it becomes a big pond in the film. So much of the book is lost in the film!A wasted opportunity to bring Harry Potter to a different level. I cringe at the thought of how they will cut down and ruin the even longer and more complex Goblet of Fire. Please go the LOTR 3 hour film route or make two films per book. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK ! I had the pleasure of watching this at the Odeon in Leicester Square on the 31st, part of the reason I enjoyed the film was down to the excellent atmosphere created by so many fans in one place, and the sheer scale of this old theatre.I've read the books so many times, but wouldn't really call myself a potter nut, and found the film to be good, but not as good as I thought it could be. The acting is great at the whole atmosphere of the film is spot on, a lot darker than the previous two but it fits in with plot line perfectly. The bad points all stem from the sheer length of this book compared to the previous two. Where as they were fairly short books and therefore translated into scripts without loosing to much plot, obvious sacrifices had to be made to squeeze it all in. You really need to stop thinking ahead in this film, and don't assume you know what sort of dialogue or scene you are going to see next just because its that way in the book.A great film none the less, and heres hoping that the next film will be just as good .. who knows though, after all the books keep getting longer ..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not utterly rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In which Harry escapes from his relatives, goes somewhere a bit weird, gets told the plot, goes to school, sorts everything out. The usual, in other words. Except, hang on a second, this time around something is different. My eyelids are not feeling incredibly heavy. Soul-crushing boredom is not infusing every fibre of my being. I'm not spending most of the film's running-time staring at the back of someone's head in an effort to get them to turn round. What on earth has happened? Until now the HP franchise was a guaranteed insomnia cure. What has gone wrong? Slick direction, a not-appalling script, even - gadzooks - tolerable performances from the kids, all are present in this latest instalment. True, the usual ingredients are also there - an endless roll-call of loveable Brit thesps (Emma, Dawn, Robbie, Maggie, etc.), banal plotting in the early stages that doesn't really make much sense, Daniel Radcliffe's impossible-to-like hero, computer-generated sequences that don't fit into the rest of the movie at all. But somehow this thing actually works. The director, Alfonso Cuaron, might be partly to blame. Cuaron has managed to bring a certain sense of threat and menace to the whole affair. The camera (or its computerised counterpart) glides eerily through a snow-bound Hogwarts school, the plot rattles along at a decent pace, the performers acquit themselves reasonably well, and one or two scenes actually look a little informal, a little relaxed, as though the people involved are perhaps even enjoying themselves. That sense of relaxed enjoyment was always missing from HP movies before - everything was spectacular and over-the-top and energetic, but none of it looked like fun to be involved in, and certainly none of it was fun to watch. But with HP 3 the performers seem more realistic and relaxed while the plot (always a conspicuous absentee from the previous movies) is tightened-up and, to a certain extent, makes sense. In fact I am not ashamed to say that the last twenty minutes are actually pretty good. "It's Quidditch tomorrow". Three words that strike fear in the hardest of hearts. Oh joy - Quidditch, with its pointless farting around, its endlessly-fake computerised imagery, its ability to bring HP films grinding to a halt for what seems like hours. Even here things have improved. This Quidditch match is short and even a little dramatic: Harry zooms up through rain and clouds to be met by the genuinely horrible Dementors. The special effects are a dramatic improvement, on the whole. The integration of computerised creatures with real ones is just about perfect. It's only when everything is computerised that things go awry - the colours are all wrong, the human figures look ludicrous, suspension of disbelief is impossible. But we should be grateful that this is not a completely tedious mess. It's by no means perfect, but it's the first HP film to work as a film. The others may work as animated illustrations of the books (I haven't read them) but they don't work as films. This one does. That's progress. One final question: Have special effects been used on Daniel Radcliffe's face to make him look less like he's repressing a grin all the time? There is one close up where that definitely seems to be the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good...finally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least...something wicked this way comes! finally, a good movie from an Harry Potter books. I live in England at the moment and yesterday I had the possibility to see the pictures. Best things about it: THE DIRECTOR: finally someone that's not scared to change something from the book! Oh don't worry, not BIG changes but that movie isn't only a replicant of the book and this takes the possibility to see the director' s point of view. I don't hate the Columbus' movies but they're TOO stuck on the books! No personality was in the first two movies! THE ACTING: especially daniel Radcliffe, that was very believable, particularly in the anger scenes. Nothing to say about Emma and Rupert: they were good also in the others. Bravo to Gary Oldman and to Twhelis: their characters are well playe by both of them. THE EFFECTS: after the disappointing phoenix of the Chamber I was very frightened about Buckbeak but the special effects team doesn't disappoint me this time. They were also good in creating the Dementors, especially, in making some differences from the Ringwraiths of LOTR THE MUSIC: John Williams knows that something is changed in the story and in the characters so he was able to create some marvellous new theme. THE CINEMATOGRAPHY: the third book is the one where the story grow and it makes in a very dark way...and so the photography of the picture. A very little scene were illuminated by sun; it' s always grey or dark because the story becomes so! This has a reflection also in the location. Hogwarts wasn-'t never so scary! there are also some lacks; I prefer to see more Ron and hermione scenes, especially when the two were quarrel in the books: it's a clear signal of the changing of their feeling for the other one. I hope to explore a little bit more Hogsmeade but this isn't a great mistake. Maybe also the Lumos effect to end a scene is too abused by the director but also this one is a little lack. So enjoy the movie. I gave it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interpretation Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start at the beginning or the lack there of, as the film started some 45 minutes into the book missing out all the muggle news casts that Vernon rants about. OK we can forgive them for jumping in and starting filming there. But what happened to the rest of the book, Harry spends two weeks in diagon ally but its not in the film, Harry gets the firebult for Christmas in the film he gets it at the end. Hagrid's cabin has moved and so has the whole school. The quiddich match Harry uses the Protrinus charm on Drako not in the film. Drako Telling Snape that he saw Harry's head at the shack not in the film. The train ride back were Pigwidgen brings Harry his letter and were at the station Harry tells Vernon that Black is his godfather, not in the film, Blacks story of his escape not in the film. In the film Harry sees Worm tail ? in the book its Loopin. The film Jumps around from chapter to chapter missing out vital parts that give us the insight into the life of Harry and his friends. Three books down and three books destroyed, the 3rd book was almost 12 hours long on audio cd the film was just over 2 hours. With the 4th film waiting in the wings and it being 20 hours long what savagery can we expect to bring this film in less than 3 hours? OK enough of the bad now for the good the special effects were out standing Buck beak looked amazing, the Protrinus could have done with a little more time spent on it. All in all the film would be OK for the younger of us under 13's anyway but for all of us that have read the book and loved the way the story was told the film is to us a let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of Harry Potter. I read the first book and it was fairly enjoyable but by the time I got halfway through the second I had experienced too many feelings of deja vu to want to continue. I saw the first two movies with the kids and was distinctly underwhelmed by the experience. Again, the first much hyped film struggled to be average and the second film felt like a rehash of the first. Before going to see this one my hopes were raised by the reviews, but I was still skeptical. I'm glad to say the reviews were correct, this has to be three or four times better than the first two Potter outings. Yes, I was confused in places, such as when Sirius Black turned from lethal enemy to friend, but on the whole I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Better acting, better script, better plot, better cinematography, great special effects and so on. One or two minutes of Quiddich was more than enough for me! What's more, the film actually ended when it felt like it should end, no endless scenes in the Great Hall. Hurrah!! I'm giving this a 9, the others I gave 5 and 3 so I don't give my high scores lightly...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film last night and I was extremely disappointed. The film was extremely light on plot and was comic in parts where a more sober tone was called for. The child actors have improved a great deal since the first film but Malfoy has become a caricature and his hair is now a scarily un-natural shade of platinum, which really doesn't make him more believable. I felt really let-down watching this film - the pace was slow and I constantly had a feeling that something was missing.However, having said that, the effects were good, Buckbeak was just as I imagined, and David Thewlis played a marvelously ethereal Professor Lupin.Still worth the price of the ticket - just forget what you've read in the book and you'll probably enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review, saw it last night.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilerPlot It was good but flawed if you know the book well since so many important scenes are missing like no-one explained to Harry how James Potter, Remus and Sirius were best friends nor the meaning behind their nicknames so Harry has no idea why his patronus is a stag. Nor do we see why Snape hates Sirius and Lupin. Also, the ending was too cheesy with Harry flying at the screen on his new Firebolt broom and then freezing on him smiling. I'd have preferred the book's ending, much funnier.It was all a bit rushed. However, several lines were lifted directly from the book and it flowed far better. It seemed more likely a movie and less like a straight transfer of the book to film like the last two. Some people won't like that every scene wasn't included, but it really helps the movie feel more cinematic. The scriptwriters just need to ensure they include every crucial scene as leaving out such important parts as detailed earlier is extremely noticeable to book readers (especially because they are important to the overall series plot) Basically, another 10 minutes of screen time would have solved these errors and I can only hope the DVD comes with deleted scenes!Acting The Pupils Hermione. She's a high point on her own; she stands out the best of all the young actors. She's just spotless in her acting; she balances humour and emotion just right and is generally enjoyable. As is Ron, who was very funny and more like he is in the books. I'm glad these two are gradually being set-up as a couple; they are a cute duo and fun to watch spar/spark.Sadly, Harry is still letting them down... he was chosen for his resemblance to the character and it's obvious. His acting is slightly better this time round, but he's still not terribly good. Draco was also a disappointment in this movie; he was reduced to comic relief as a total cry-baby/sap. The menace of his character was totally absent. Fred and George were just right in this movie; a lot of the characterisation of these two was lost previously and it was good to see the humour and generally mischievous nature of these two portrayed properly.The Teachers The new Dumbledore was good, I can't distinguish if I prefer the first actor or this new one but I didn't notice any real change. This is good. I don't recall McGonagall having any relevant part to play at all in the movie. But Snape provided his usual intimidation, new teacher Trelawney was suitably batty but a lot of the humour involved with her was lost. Personally, I always love Harry and Ron's mocking of her lessons, a funny highlight of the books. Hagrid was enjoyable in this film; I liked his new interactions as a teacher and his chance to do a bit of serious acting in the scenes involving the execution of Buckbeak. And finally, Lupin was a good addition to the cast. I enjoyed his lessons of Defence Against the Dark Arts more than all previous ones shown and still found him to be my favourite teacher of this subject as in the books. Only drawback was I felt he was a little mean and some crucial dialogue he should have shared with Harry was cut leaving me with a sense of disappointment.Special Effects Special effects were good, aside from the Patronus, which I wasn't a fan of. Buckbeak was good. The Lupin werewolf was cool though not really scary, compared the Sirius dog was actually much creepier and looked much better stylistically. Quidditch was the same old stuff, though it didn't get much screen time this time round so there isn't an awful lot to judge.The Whomping Willow was a nice device used in the movie to show the changing of seasons as well as being surprisingly funny. Oh, and the big thing people care about... The Dementors. At times I thought they were slightly scary but most of the time i just wound up thinking the Nazgul in LOTR were much creepier.The Knight Bus was good, but not how I imagined it to be. However they achieved a good effect in showing how fast the bus travels and the overall design was impressive.Finally, the paintings in the school were wonderful. We get to see many of them up close this time round and it's a treat seeing the sheer variety of characters contained within. Plus, Dawn French as the Fat Lady of Gryffindor is a hoot. I loved her. General Stuff * The entire Hogwarts scenery has been changed. Some will complain but I think it's much better, it seems much more like a castle in the Scottish Highlands, which is what Hogwarts is meant to be, and because the majority of the film is set outdoors it helps add a feeling of depth and scope to the locale around.* Speaking of Buckbeak, I love this creature. The special effects were beautiful, the scenes with it in glowed and I got a sense of the power and beauty of this creature. They did an excellent job creating the Hippogriff but more importantly giving it life. * Personally, I liked the darker tone of the movie. The book was dark and it was suitable that the film was too, allowing the characters more depth and as said earlier affording the whole movie a much more cinematic feeling. It felt grown up and as our heroes are getting older this was just what the film needed. Wrapping Up Despite what anyone says, Azkaban IS worth watching and in my opinion it is the best of the movies so far. Don't miss out on a movie that by its own merits is good, even if it pales slightly in comparison with the novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's meaner, it's darker...but is it better?- SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a lovely hour queuing together with three year olds on sugar high,yesterday I have seen Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. As this is the movie version of my favourite of the HP books so far, I had great expectations and couldn't wait to finally see it...So what's it like? I think it's one of the most frustrating movie I have ever seen!!! The fact that it is extraordinarily good in some things, and terribly bad in others made me feel a bit strange all the way through. I'll explain... On the production side, the movie is a gem: dark, stark and un-disneyish. Also the actors have improved and the new characters are quite impressively played by the likes of David Thewlis, Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson. Also, theunderlying moods of the movie have "grown up" since its predecessors. I haveenjoyed how the director plays with themes such as time (a strong element inthe whole HP series, related to Harry growing up, his past and his future) and Harry's perception of himself. BUT these great features are undermined by the huge cuts that the booksuffered when transposed to screenplay, mostly at the expense of characterdevelopment and tension build-up...Watching the movie you realise the climaxof the story has arrived and you have kind of missed how you got there!!! Also, the cuts mean that the audience never gets to hear why Snape hates Lupin andBlack so much, who the hell Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are, howdoes Lupin know that the Marauder map is indeed a map, why Harry is soobsessed by his fate and by dark omens, why cats, rats and dogs don't like each other, why Professor Trelawney prediction is so important, etc etc etc...I'll stop here! There's quite a lot left out, clearly, and sometimes I wondered if people who haven't read the book could actually understand what was going on. With the movie being so good in other respects, it's frustrating to see the story butchered and the characters thinned so much...The scene with Snape (AlanRickman is excellent...wish there was more of him), Lupin and Sirius in theShrieking Shack is so bloody brilliant that you wish it didn't last only 30 seconds, but that it were faithful to the book! You only get to see a spark of the hatred, recriminations and deceit that run among them...But then again, you only about this if you've read the book... So, in conclusion, go and see the movie for some good moments and for finally seeing some of your fantasies of POA represented on screen (Hogsmeade,Buckbeak, the Marauders Map)...But for story, pathos and greatcharacters...Stick to the book!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more adult Harry Potter movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban went on general release in the UK yesterday and I caught a late-night showing. This movie is a phenomenal addition to the series, very much darker both figuratively and literally, the child actors are really developing nicely (Grint, for example, is far better than he was in Chamber of Secrets) and director Cuaron put in lots of little visual touches that wouldn't have occurred to Chris Columbus in a million years. One strange thing is that the entire geography of Hogwarts has entirely changed. Both Hagrid's cottage and the Whomping Willow are in totally different places from the previous movie. However, this is not to denigrate the art direction which seems to be better than ever. One major addition to the general set is the workings of the giant Hogwarts Clock, used as a backdrop or for fly-through again and again, to great effect. Also notable is the bridge from the castle to Hagrid's cottage, a fine example of distressed woodwork.Atmospherically the movie is almost totally different from its predecessors. The colours are muted and the sky is always overcast, actually sometimes to a fault - the emotional involvement one should have felt when Harry was first riding Buckbeak was muted by the gunmetal tones of the landscape he was flying over. Beautiful indeed, but not in a "children's fantasy film" way. This is a quibble. Really the style absolutely suited the much darker ways of the plot. The Quidditch match, which takes place, as in the book, in a driving rainstorm, is an absolute tour-de-force of terror without the gimmicky camera-work prevalent in the first two films. The Dementors, in particular, are extremely well handled and are the backbone, to me, to what I found the most terrifying sequences in the whole Harry Potter saga so far. However, there are also fun parts - particularly the Knight Bus, beautifully translated from the description of Harry's nightmare journey in the book, and a brilliant piece of design in the bus itself. The book is followed almost too faithfully, resulting in little for the much-anticipated Gary Oldman to do as the mad, bad and dangerous to know Sirius Black. But David Thewlis very effectively fills in the void as Lupin. Michael Gambon has stepped so seamlessly into Richard Harris's shoes as Dumbledore that I never remotely thought of comparing their performances. Gambon is no less Dumbledore than Harris was ... in fact he might be a little better.One does hope, however, that when the DVD comes out, they make an "Extended Edition" rather than put the deleted scenes in a separate section as they have hitherto. In the released film it is all too evident, on occasion, where cuts have been made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but a tad disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say, I had high expectations for the third installment, and having enjoyed the first 2 was hoping for something of better quality than was on offer. Major points of contention include: Script: This was hacked to bits - the first two films managed to convey all the important bits, but I don't consider this one faithful to the books at all. Character development for Lupin, Black, Snape, and Pettigrew were seriously lacking, and unless you have read the book there will be quite a few unanswered questions (such as how does Lupin know about the marauders map?) Although it manages to cover most of the major bits, there were just too many loose ends for my liking. I have no idea how they're going to fit the next one into less than 4 hours to give it justice ;)Settings: Was it really necessary to change about every single backdrop? OK, it looked fine - but from a continuity point of view it just wasn't necessary. Costumes as well, they're in SCHOOL - where are the uniforms? I don't remember ever reading about a non-uniform policy being in force in the books...Dumbledore mk2: Michael Gambon was pretty good as Dumbledore, but the mk2 shows quite a different character to mk1. once again, this is more of a continuity gripe - keeping the personality the same would have been nice.The Dementors: Well, they looked pretty good on the train, but after that seemed to end up rather ethereal spectres. I don't remember them flying in the books (although i could be wrong there admittedly) but overall i jsut didn't think they were that menacing. It would have been nice to see the quiddich match where Draco and co pretend to be Dementors - Oh, and they missed out explaining the whole patronus thing - such as why its a creature when he does it for the last time...Good points though...Special Effects: As good as one would expect - special note to Buckbeak which looked great. Cast: Ron and Hermione continue to be excellent - Harry still needs work though... Notably Snape is excellent (if underused) as always, Gary Oldman was good as Black, although the shrieking shack scene lacked the dialogue to make it properly cohesive, and David Thewlis made a good Lupin - once again he could have done with more character development though.Overall: It just seemed somewhat hollow compared to the first two. Harry still needs to be sent to acting school, and there really was just too much missed out. Hopefully no.4 will be better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly thought that this was the most brilliant of the three movies. All three of the kids have grown so much as young actors and actresses. The performance given by Gary Oldman (Sirius Black), and the chemistry between him and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) were completely brilliant. The only lacking part of this movie was the quidditch scene. Brilliant and beautiful as it was, it was cut way too short (around five minutes, mostly of Harry dodging dementors), and this is a problem as this is many young children's favourite part of the Harry Potter movies. Both Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger)have transitioned gracefully into teenagers, both very good looking, while Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley)has kept with his character's lanky, less smooth looks. Congratulations, Alfonso Cuaron, 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanke ye godds for Alfonso Cuaron! This film is far, far better than the first two. The young actors have learned how to act, the set is absolutely bootyful, the costumes are modern(hallelujah! they really add 2 it), and, to top it all, the younger actors are really growing up to look a lot more like the characters as i saw them in my head (yes, people live in my head. if you have a problem with it, speak 2 my psychiatrist :]). Daniel Radcliffe (harry)... wahey! He's beginning 2 be really good looking! As is Tom Felton(malfoy), who, incidentally, looks so much better with floppy hair... what was with the gelled back crash helmet from the last two films? Richard Harris is greatly missed, not only in himself, but as dumbledore, however, Michael Gambon steps in brilliantly, and does a lovely job, all the same (albeit without the marvellous twinkle of the eye that Harris so marvelously possessed)Have so much more to write, but i really cant be bothered, am in a manic state of... something. But its good! not as good as the book, of course, but yay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most human beings, 13-year-old Harry Potter is becoming plain interesting as he gets older. The newest installment, `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,' is a testimony to testosterone and tribulation as Harry, Hermione, and Ron meet the threat of mass murderer Sirus Black, who, upon escaping Azkaban Prison, seriously wants to find Harry. Even the hundreds of Dementors sent to protect Hogwarts from Black are more trouble than they are worth.What makes Harry and buds more interesting than ever is that they care more deeply about each other and take more time to figure out their strategies, the way intelligent adults do. The use of time travel to set things right is not just a plot device but more a way of showing the importance of each decision along the way of life, a kind of existential anguish for teens, who even in normal times have enough trouble defining themselves by the choices they make. The wickedly intelligent Hermione emerges as more than a just a smart-ass girl in a male dominated school: She's pivotal in focusing Harry on the task at hand and even punches out a nasty boy. Romance has not even been hinted at; friendship, loyalty, and love of the purest kind are foremost for these adventurers. Gone is Director Chris Columbus's phallic imagery and quick cuts for `Chamber of Secrets'; in is Director Alfonso Cuarón's (`Y tu Mama Tambien') more delicate pubescent parable, like the need to know oneself and one's parents.The special effects are as smoothly integrated as ever-the first sequence of a magic triple-decker bus carrying and careening Harry through London to `The Leaky Cauldron' is funny and harrowing, like the rest of the story. The twisted, animated tree continues to hold multiple secrets while it flings leaves and people at will. But in the end, it's the people like Dumbledore and the Dark Arts teacher who provide the excitement for a young man now relying more on his wits than on magic to get him through. At the beginning of `Prisoner of Azkaban,' when Harry `blows up' his abusive aunt, he knows the action is extreme and maybe not exactly what he wanted, but his emerging adult nature sees the justice due (`She got what she deserved'), and he won't undo it. Welcome to responsibility for your actions, Harry. Adult life may be filled with terrifying enemies-you just have to deal with them as fairly and smartly as possible. Finally, the third year at Hogwarts more boldly than ever forces the young teens to confront the challenges of appearance and reality: Some enemies turn out to be friends if you give them time to disclose their true natures. Harry's life just became more complicated as he moves into the magic of real life.Like the other `Potter' installments, `There's magic in the web of it.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a massive Harry Potter fan I have to say that I was very disappointed with the third film. So much important detail has been left out in this film. It seems almost too humorous in places e.g. Harry and Hermoine have turned back time to save both the buckbeak and Sirius Blacks life and all Hermoine can say is ''does my hair really look like that from the back''? What happened in the shrieking shack? There was no explanation of Peter Pettigrew being the 'secret keeper' for the Potters and no mention of the fact that the four men were once great friends who developed the marauders map? This was supposed to be the part of the story where everything was explained e.g. how Sirius escaped from Azkaban and how Harry finally had someone who cared deeply for him after losing his parents, you know, the part in the book at which most of us struggled not to shed a tear or two.....I'm sorry but the film just didn't achieve this. Harry has gone from being a polite, almost timid boy at the Dursleys, to losing his temper at the first negative comment. The worst part for me was the ending. What happened to the Hogwarts Express, the letter Harry receives from Sirius, Ron being given his own owl and why didn't ron even mention that Harry was invited along with the Weasleys to watch the Quidditch world cup? Bring back the previous director and we might get the original scenery, uniforms and the magic back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could you change any more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just got back from the cinema and have to say that I enjoyed the movie. The effects were really good a lot better than the other 2.I have to say though that I am really disappointed with the whole thing. There is so much missing. I thought that there was a lot missing from the other 2 but this story has just been butchered. How come everything has changed so much? I know that the Dursley's house had gone through a changing rooms makeover in the last movie but it seems that Hogwarts has moved along with Hagrid's hut and he had also had the builders in and had an extension built. I thought the flyover on the lake was really good and couldn't understand where all the water went when it came to the end or was that a different lake and I just missed something. I wonder where Hogwarts will be for the next movie will it be a funhouse ride in Universal Studio's.With this book being so much longer than the other 2 I find it hard to believe that the movie was shorter. What will happen to the next one???How come Dumbledore had gone from white to grey is it a reversal from Lord Of The Rings with the whole Gandalf thing. Oh and Dementors/Ringwrathes was there much difference apart from LOTR were a bit more scary.I have to say that I am really surprised that they managed to keep some of the actors. Maggie Smith had what 5 minutes screen time and what about the kids were we in school. I really missed the lessons seeing things go wrong and learning how to do magic.Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the movie but came out feeling a bit cheated.I know that you can never have the book on screen but something like would be good. Book 4 is long enough without having to fill in all the gaps that the 3rd movie left. Here's hoping that the DVD will put back some of what is missing if they ever filmed it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good, but fans of the book say not as good as SS &amp; CofS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not read any of the books and I have never watched the first two films from start to finish, but I saw "...Azkaban" at an advance screening under the worst conditions (theater too warm, lots of cell phones ringing, babies crying!)with three FANS, all of whom had read the book-and I enjoyed it! The story was more than adequate, the effects were extremely well done and I don't think it was too intense for younger viewers. The 6 year-old girl in our group (who has seen the 1st two films repeatedly) also enjoyed it. I have always been a big fan of Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman and I really like David Thewlis, and although I also like Michael Gambon, he lacks the sweetness and serenity that Richard Harris brought to Dumbledore. Mr. Gambon plays the role as a much younger character. Comments from the book readers agreed that there were huge chunks missing, but gave it a passing grade-still not as good as the two previous releases.All in all, it will certainly do very well, although the prediction I heard on CNN recently that it should outgross the first two seems unrealistic, unless the dark tone of this one attracts a new audience.In conclusion, it may be worth the price of admission to some, others may want to wait for the inevitable DVD release (as most people that want to avoid the disrespectful patronage at the circus-like multiplexes)...I enjoyed it but I did not leave the theater with the feeling I had after my first screening of "Goldfinger" (a third in the series)...more like the original version of "Return of the Jedi"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put it this way....I HATE the harry potter books. I find them boringly written and despise the way they insult the reading ability of Children everywhere. Unlike Pullman who writes complex and descriptive books, Dahl whose imagery constantly surprises and thrills and Lewis whose Narnia books contain beautiful imagery, Rowling's books uses only very simplistic expressions.What Rowling's books do have though, it seems, is great stories. However, as always with novels, you can fit a lot more plot into a book than you can into a movie. The previous movies have kept very much to the plot of the book and as a result they have ended up leaving an awful lot of the story out. In this movie the director is not afraid to shift things about a bit in order to make the story work better as a movie.The director is a very important reason for the quality of this movie. Unlike previous directors the only place this director could be called an 'unknown' is in Hollywood. This director is critically acclaimed for his film "Y Tu Mama Tambien" ("And your mother too"). In the Harry Potter movie he has taken some of his cues from the imaginative directing style of Terry Gilliam. As such he has added wonderful personal touches such as the shrunken voodoo heads (look out for them - they're great).This is the best Harry Potter movie yet, and by that I mean it is the FIRST good Harry Potter movie so far. Let's hope the next movie can provide more of the same because this movie was awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, great, OK, bit disappointed (spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to see this with great anticipation, as a massive fan of all the books so far. Left feeling somewhat satisfied, somewhat bemused and slightly outraged - they have butchered some of the most crucial parts of the book.Although I enjoyed the first two films, I was pleased at the improved direction, and performances from the young cast. I felt Cuaron captured the dark and dangerous feel the book had once Harry had finished with the Dursley's! He also managed to make Hogwarts appear even more beautiful, despite the dull dark atmosphere.The choice of replacement for Dumbledore worked well in the film but he seemed to have lost some of his imposing manner (I'm not convinced Voldemort would have feared Dumbledore as portrayed here). The casting of the additional characters was spot-on though, as was the humour in the film (altho I do admit I was howling with laughter at some parts which the rest of the cinema didn't seem to find quite so funny!)What perplexed me the most was how rushed certain parts appeared to be and how what I believe to be crucial explanations were missed out. As others have commented, the Moony, Padfoot, Prongs and Wormtail connection (or who these alias's belong to) was not explained at all, neither was Lupin's knowledge about the map (are we to assume he is psychic??) By neglecting to explore this we do not see how important Lupin, Black or Pettigrew once were to Harry's father, or indeed that Harry's father could transform into a stag (which is an inexcusable omission - the patronus Harry conjured to save him is a stag, and it is this that is used to show him his father is always in his heart!) Also the film fails to mention Harry's heartbreaking disappointment that it was not his father he saw on the other side of the lake. Given his love for his parents, and his grief, it seems strange that he is just shown as being pleased it was himself.I think that by spending an extra 10-15 minutes explaining these things the film would seem far more "complete" to all those who know and love the books, and the character of Harry would be far closer to that of the books, and more likable. Despite this though I did enjoy the film for what is was - a seriously entertaining action fantasy film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new director, A new formula but the same old magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just got back from the cinema, where I caught the first showing of the latest in the Harry Potter saga.I'm still a bit lost for words so forgive me if some of the things i say may not make sense. Woweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. (did you understand that?)Daniel Radcliffe seems more man now than the mere boy we met in the first movie and Emma Watson is also on the bloom towards being the newest English Rose. No doubt the two of them will be setting teenage hearts fluttering worldwide this summer. Stand aside Orlando and Keira, you have competition.This was the first Harry Potter movie I watched after having read the book and unfortunately I feel the adaptation was poor. The story was told adequately enough but I feel that several events from the book that would have made for entertaining cinema were omitted and several interesting facts essential to addicts of all things Potter were also overlooked. Like the origins of The Marauders Map for instance.I also found that from out of nowhere we were onto the climax before we knew where we were and we had not yet managed to build up the suspense we should have been experiencing for Harry's first face to face meeting with Sirius Black.In the book, Rowling had used her story telling talents perfectly and by the time this meeting takes place we would all have rather died than to have put the book down. Here, I was startled when I realized what part of the story we were at and then tried to remember whether I had fallen asleep or not as it seemed a large proportion of the film appeared to be missing.Despite this it is every bit as fascinating and awe-inspiring as the other two offerings and if, like me you are a fan of Harry Potter and his magical world then you will not be disappointed.I was also impressed by the depiction of both The Dementors and Buckbeak and they were on film exactly as I had pictured them in my mind as I read, as was also the stag shaped patronus.Sir Micheal Gambon steps into the role of Prof. Albus Dumbledore and although he is an accomplished actor who adopts the role exceptionally well, one cannot help but miss the late, great Richard Harris. I'm sure that over the years and with four future Potter yarns planned, we will all grow accustomed to Gambon, but to me the role was haunted by Harris' ghost which therefore distracted me in my efforts to believe that this is supposed to be the same man from the previous two movies.Having logged on to IMDb I checked out the castlist and it is great to see a movie (an American movie mind you) filled almost entirely with home-grown talent. Gary Oldman is as dominating as ever and Alan Rickman is at his "freak me out" best. Also a return for the likes of Sir Robert Hardy and Dame Maggie Smith and the ever watchable Julie Walters are a blessing.Fans of British comedy will also be amused by the cameos made by the likes of Dawn French, Lenny Henry and Paul Whitehouse.To me however the best performances are made by David Thewlis as Prof. Remus Lupin, yet another Defence against the Dark Arts teacher, and Emma Thompson as the comical yet scatty Prof. Sybil Trelawney the Divination mistress. I have never really been a big fan of Thompson's in the past as I found her films a little to "arty farty" for my tastes, but her roles in Love Actually and Azkaban have lead me to believe that she is the possibly the most gifted and natural actress around today.Another hit for the series which leaves us awaiting Goblet of Fire (my favourite book) with an impatient lust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic still lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*The third installment of the Harry Potter series is (by my opinion, the best. It keeps close with the book but enough is improvised to keep the story at its best. Harry is at his third year at Hogwarts and Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban. Everyone knows that he is after Harry, or is he? Sirius finds Harry and tells him the truth of how Voldemort found his parents. The Prisoner of Azkaban is possibly the best Harry Potter book, in the movie the acting is great (although I don't think that Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) isn't quite as good as Richard Harris) and the special effects are amazing. The story starts off a little unrealistic (the Knight Bus is painted purple) but once the movie gets going it becomes a magical movie that captures your heart, also funnier than the other two (thanks to Ron's PG swearing) this is a movie that will surely tell you that magic lives on.I would give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darker and a lot more magical than the two previous movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban comes highly recommended. The three main actors have all aged but this works better with the heavier subject matter of the third installment of the Potter franchise. Michael Gambon is excellent as Richard Harris' replacement for Dumbeldore and after about half of the movie you fail to notice the actor has been changed. Emma Thompson and Dawn French are amusing in supporting roles. My only gripe is that the excellent Alan Rickman as Professor Snape was once again criminally unused, and overall it's astonishing how little screentime the A-list actors receive! Draco Malfoy is also totally useless in this movie - what happened to that boy? I figured by now he'd been inspiring fear, not laughs. Perhaps not suitable for very younger children - my 3 1/2 year old found the werewolf scenes a bit tense, to say the least. My eight-year old loved it, however. Overall, a strong 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went along to this film expecting it to be pretty good. Not because I liked the other films because I only found them OK, nothing special, but because I heard good reviews, the trailers were impressive and because I wanted to see how the new director handled it.This film is a huge improvement on the previous two. The director, Cuarón does a good job. The film has a more stylized look than Harry Potter one and two but it still leaves much to be desired. The CGI was patchy in some areas, and astonishing in others. The Dementors are done well and I managed to watch the whole film without them once reminding me of the black riders from Lord Of The Rings. Which is quite an achievement in itself.The kids have all grown up loads and it suits them better. I didn't think much of the acting in the first film but the trio are on top form in this installment and looking generally cooler whilst doing it! All three are convincing and if certain aspects let down the film, it's not them.I think the problem with converting the Harry Potter films to the big screen is a matter of pacing. The books are so plot orientated that fitting it all in is naturally impossible. This film, like the previous two felt in some areas like a selection of the important bits in the book put into a number of short, individual scenes. However, this is coming from someone who's read the books and is sickening biased towards them so I couldn't speak for those who haven't.Overall I'd say this film was good, but not great. Cuarón is not afraid to change the story, which may annoy some and entertain others. He obviously has a good flair for action and the early sequences with the Knight Bus are fast paced and breath taking. This film is worth seeing and if you liked the first two you'll probably love this. But for the more cynical viewers among us, especially those who have read the books, it might feel like something is missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>!! SPOILERS !! HP Turned Gothic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, what can i say? Harry Potter had definitely changed thats for sure. The movie has a much darker, more Gothic feel to it. The sunny, pleasant Hogwarts now seems to have turned into a dark, dingy, possibly evil castle, like the one you find in horror movies (not that thats a good thing) - and the clock is waaay freaky - especially that pendulum! I'm sure that violates some health and safety laws. The new Direction is clear - the scene transitions are excellent, the changing of seasons and camera movements work really well, the CGI is good, and i feel the acting has improved. This however is where i feel the good points stop.I was disappointed several important elements from the book were left out (the broomstick being found earlier, Quidditch Final (!!), Marauders map authors - which would have taken 1 minute to put in and been well worth it) - Also, i was very disappointed with the Stag scene - a Stag was hardly present! This was a major element of the story about Harrys father and was totally cut out! Due to time i feel, maybe they didn't have time to animate a amazing stag smashing through the Dementors. Also, I'm not sure about the new Dumbledore at all - Them hats seem to make him look like he's trying to fashionable, when in reality he's supposed to be a 100year old wizard - and his beard is nowhere near long enough. I feel the ending was rushed, major elements were cut there that were important, such as Sirius' guilt about Harrys parents dying, and the Secret Keeper story.A good film, but does not do the book justice and changes too many things it makes the last two films look totally different - the whole castle and layout is completely different, including the pathetic whomping willow which is now a small tree. It reminds me of what Alien Resurrection was to the Alien trilogy.</fullReview>

I definitely enjoyed this movie, but it could have been better in ways, like the very last shot of the film wasn't very good it hough, and the ending was kinda rushed. Besides that, lupin was great, and the movie goes by really fast, enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Repeat: The film is not the same as the book.But then there is a lot to cover in 2 and a bit hours, however this is actually shorter than the previous outings.Massive cheer for Hermione giving Malfoy a good whacking!Dementors are pretty cool, about as nasty as they could be in a film for under 15sHagrid's den and the whomping willow seem to be different from the previous films, but Grint, Radcliffe and Watson are great developing in the roles.Roll on next film, like the books are addictive and you just want more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keeping the kids entertained and telling a good story does not combine well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Harry Potter books are loved for their wealth of detail and twisting story lines. The Prisoner of Azkaban is in my opinion where JKR changes gear after the first two and gives us a great book. I fully accept that transferring to film is a tricky balance to achieve, however in my view there was more than enough to pull out of the book to make for a great movie - and they failed. I suspect that parts of the film had to be made less scary or cut in order to get a PG certificate, however I would dearly love for the darker tale to be told. What on earth is the graveyard scene in the Goblet of Fire going to be like if this is the precedent? It seems the series is heading towards a backlash from the older readers over dumbing down for the younger kids. I say leave the twists and have the kids use their brains - and I think and hope that JKR is with me on that one. I'm quite happy to answer any of the questions the young ones might have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So was the latest Harry Potter Installment worth the wait?I would say YES. The film itself is made very well, special effects up to standard and best of all, the scenery was excellent.Surely Alfonso Cuaron has done us proud? Well, Yes and No really. Read on....Standing at 142 minutes, you fail to realize that time has gone so quick. As the credits for the movie rolled, I thought, "my god, is that it?". I could have easily sat there for much longer, perhaps the length of a Lord of the Rings movie.The downfall with this movie is that is strays through the book too quickly. At one point, I thought I must have fallen asleep because we got from one section of the book (in the film) to another, within a blink of an eye. So much has been cut from the book and I think this is its downfall. Obviously, for those people who do not read the books, they would not see anything wrong, but for the book fans, some may be disappointed. Major plots in the book are cut into 1-2 minute scenes and some important facts have been missed out. A lot of characters from the book were not used either and those that were, so little time on the screen- ie, Mcgonagall. She was only in a few scenes, as was Dumbledore himself (Michael Gambon--Well done!!) and Snape--compared to the book was hardly present in the movieI give this movie 8 out of 10. For the normal viewers, you will Love this movie, for the fans-- very very good but it felt like a rush to get to the end and there was a lot of plot holes and parts of the book that should have been there</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film marks what I hope to be a turning point in the books adaptation to film, although I should say that I find the first two books somewhat duller than the rest of the series so far.Its darker, a lot darker than the others, Cuaron has done a fantastic job in really bringing the world of the books to life. The Dementors are especially disturbing, you get a single flicker of their mouths, and it's the stuff of nightmares. I will only mention the special effects, as special.The photography is awesome, Seresin pulls off some true jaw dropping panoramas of the Scottish countryside, with close ups on par with his best in Angel Heart. Magic, rather refreshingly features everywhere, and you really get the impression that you have entered a world filled with it.Lupin is portrayed brilliantly by Thewlis, just as I imagined him from the books. Rickman is as amazing as we have all come to expect. Ratcliffe, Watson, and Grint are all light years better than they were in the previous films, we can only hope that these up and comings don't end up as typecast child stars, that would be a waste. Oldman, unfortunately does not really get a chance to emerge as a character due to what seems like heavy time constraints. I look forward to seeing what he does with Sirius in the Goblet of Fire.Which leads me into my only complaint of the film, its been heavily edited to fit into a time slot. This is annoying because you get the feeling that a lot more was filmed and cut out. Overall it just about gets away with some of the story changes, making some composite scenes work quite effectively. I am personally hoping for a directors cut in the near future, as the tapestry that Cuaron weaves is rich and vibrant. A big thumbs up, I don't understand why they are changing the director for the next film though...Oh, did anyone else spot Ian Brown (Stone Roses) stirring a bowl of pea soup magically in the Leaky Caldron :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Different, but its Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK this may contain spoilers, you've been warned! So I've just got back from seeing this, and I liked it.Yes its different from the previous movies by Christopher Columbus, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. As the trailers of the Movie, and even the picture show, its a darker movie then the previous two, but then, the book is darker. It shows that the characters have all grown up.The actors picked to play the new roles were both good, and not so good in my humble opinion. David Thewlis, who played Professor Lupin, I'm not sure I liked him, I think I had imagined someone with more screen presence. And someone who was poor, but had those rugged good looks. Thats possibly just me. I liked Gary Oldman as Sirius, he played him very well, at times he reminded me of Johnny Depp when he was playing Jack Sparrow. Micheal Gambon did an excellent job of taking over from Richard Harris. Radcliffe, Watson &amp; Grint gave excellent performances also.If I had any major problems with it, its just the whole movie seems incredibly rushed, its like as if Cuaron didn't want the movie to pass a certain time so everything is very fast. For instance, I think we see the kids in class a sum total of 3 or 4 times. I didn't like how they portrayed the Patronus Charm also... you'll know what I mean when you see it.Hogwarts looks fantastic though, as does the grounds. The Special effects are amazing also, the Dementors are very well done, as is Buckbeat.Oh and one final question: Why did it seem that the kids had walked straight out of the Gap?! Why was there no wizard clothes, or very little.Overall the movie is very good, even if very different from the others, I gave it an 8 outta 10. Also, be warned some things are very different then in the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There may be spoilers below but nothing that HP fans wouldn't already know.This movie was amazing. Really put a new and darker feel into the whole HP franchise. The Dementors actually gave me chills everytime they were on screen. The acting is still a little wonky but Radcliffe is MUCH better than he was in HP&amp;TPS. My only criticism is that there is no "layout" continuity between the different directors. I know they each had their different view as to what Hogwarts would actually look like but unfortunately Hagrid's shack and the Whomping Willow are not in the same place they used to be in the First/Second film. I DO prefer the new "mountainside" setting but above all, I think that continuity is most important! Unless of course there's something in Book 3 about Hagrid moving his hut to the side of a mountain... in which case I take it back. But they really should have used continuity.Other than that... 9/10 - a fantastic film!</fullReview>

It was a good movie - I saw it cuz my friend won sneak passes to the movie-- it's really good and much better. the new characters were much better and i think that in the next few movies, if the books are good, then the cast/plot/lightening/scenery/tech/sound fx will be much better and we will be very pleased.

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie. It's very gripping and the special effects are beyond brilliant. It's much darker than the first two, and we are introduced to three new characters, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Professor Trelawney. Oldman, Thewlis and Thomson deliver fantastic performances as the three newcomers... The Dementors are crossovers of Wraiths and dark ghosts, and they left much of the audience in awe. Even though the director left out quite a few of the parts from the book, this movie doesn't disappoint at all. It's fun, and it really captures the imagination of even those who aren't Harry Potter fans. I just hope the Goblet of Fire is half as good as this one was - I'll be very satisfied indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absolute best Harry Potter yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little dark, almost too scary with the shrunken head guiding the bus driver on the Knight Bus in the beginning to the dementors guarding Hogwarts, not to mention the skulking werewolf in the shadows. It's quite far into the movie before we see Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), I would have liked it if his character had a larger part. Hopefully in the next movie we will see Harry living with his "Godfather" instead of that awful Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. And how many of us would love to do to someone what Harry was able to do to "Aunt Marge"??? I am very happy and lucky to have been able to see this movie as a treat. It was actually my niece (my Goddaughter) who won the tickets and took me!!! I know it should have been the other way around, but way to go Kendall! (BTW good luck with the Constitution Test today, I love you, call me if you need me) And thank you! I can only hope Goblet of Fire is as good. I believe I will need to start reading the books before seeing the movies. I really wanted to be Hermione when she socked Draco one! Want to go see this movie again but I guess I will have to wait until it comes to the theaters, I KNOW I will be buying this one when it is released for home sales and keep my collection growing. My friend Denise bought me the first one and I thank you, too Denise! The introduction of new Professors and new creatures in this movie really re-directs some interest. Shame, shame on anyone who would behead a lovely little Buckbeak. I hadn't read the book and was hoping that somehow, maybe with the use of the time tuner we would find that Harry's parents (James and Lily) aren't really dead after all, maybe just hidden in one of the paintings (maybe behind a cow with the fat lady) or trapped in a mirror. This is a very exciting and wonderful movie, EVERYONE must see it! AND ENJOY!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Us at the Odeon all saw the run-through of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban this morning- and boy does it rock. I mean, the acting is still a little dodgy and the new Dumbledore is a little sketchy but maaaaannnnnn....I mean Harry. Wow. He's angry, he's bitter, he has an attitude and best of all- he is no longer being shadowed by Ron. And speaking of Ron- him and Hermione have this great sexual tension (yes, I know they're 13. So, it's more puppy-love tension) But it's there and just lacing the plot with little 'will they wont they' feelings.Onto the plot-- they don't skimp on the important bits. Some parts I can tell people who haven't read the books would be a little bemused but apart from that Alfonso Cuarón really pulls it off. He takes his time to show just how everyone is feeling- reflecting on images of the scenery which must make the old director quiver. Also- he has just shown the world that Harry Potter is not kids stuff any longer. By the third book we can see just how they are growing up and Cuarón reflects on this successfully. So if little kids are watching this- be prepared to scare themselves when the Dementors come along. They will make you shiver. All in all the film is so much better than the first two- bringing out the best in the young actors and not missing what Rowling was going for when she wrote it. Fan-bloody-tastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't let us down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If these movies keep getting better, the academy of motion pictures will eventually have to recognize them . . . Nah,will never happen. But just remember, the same critics that panned, downplayed, or just plain ignored Star Wars back in 1976, are today using it as a benchmark movie. I like Epert and Ropers comparison to these movies (specifically Chamber) to the Wizard of Oz. They definitely are succeeding in creating Rowlings world for us to visually enjoy. If you are a true faithful hoping to see the book word for word, you'll be let down. (Hope for a 7 year Masterpiece theater television type of project some years down the road where they have 24, 1 hour episodes to do each book.) However, if you can appreciate the impossibility of transferring a thick, well written, action packed book to the wide screen in a reasonable amount of time, you will be taking your hat off to Steven Kloves. I believe that he has hit his stride in his comfort level with the books and with Ms. Rowlings world. I say this because he successfully rewrote most of the details of the end action to compress and even heighten the suspense, while preserving the feel of the book. The dementors were even more menacing than Rowlings descriptions, and the Werewolf, while it just ran off in the book, became an important element in the action of the final scenes.The ensemble of Daniel Radcliff (Harry), Rupert Gint (Ron), and Emma Watson (Hermione) have matured very nicely, both physically and as actors. Rupert especially raised the bar on his performance compared to Chamber. The interplay was top notch, especially between Hermione and Ron, starting to hint at the Romantic interest that appears to be developing there. I'm glad to see that the HP casting directors did such a fine job in spotting and developing such talented young actors for these roles, (unlike the Star Wars casting fiascos - i.e. both Anakins) I hope they can be enticed to stay to finish out the series. Come on Warner Brothers, promise these kids breakout acting roles once this gig is up. The new Dumbledore was a bit disappointing only when compared to the late Rex Harrison. He didn't seem to capture the same charismatic presence that he gave as Gandalf in the LoR series, but he is a fine actor will serve the role well.The special effects were every bit as good as chamber, with Buckbeak and the blowing up of Aunt Marge being the best efforts yet. Some seemingly important details to the plot of the books were not divulged here, such as who Prongs, Padfoot, Mooney, and Wormtail were, but it will be easy enough to do this when the information becomes directly relevant to the plot. Another missed event from the book was Harry sending his patronus at Malfoy and Slytherin cronies dressed as dementors, but the way the movie plot was developed, and the way the action climaxed, it wouldn't have worked. We do get to witness Hermione punch out Malfoy (twice actually).Some details were bothersome. Hagrid's Hut and the Whomping Willow seem to have been moved, and the general landscape of the school grounds seemed very different. But the wonder and magic of Hogwarts was not only maintained but heightened. All in all, this was a thoroughly entertaining and magical movie from start to finish. I look forward to Goblet. I don't see how it could have been done better in the limited format of an under 3 hour movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having seen a screening of the movie in Hollywood last night I regret to say that I do not understand the enthusiasm I've seen written in other reviews. I am a great fan of the Harry Potter series, I have read all of the books,and the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is one of my favorites. Nevertheless, I regret to say that it would appear from this film that Mr Cuaron is a muggle. The change of direction was evident throughout. The entire 'feel' of the Harry Potter universe was changed, the 'magic' so skillfully created by Ms Rowling and captured by Mr Columbus was all but gone. The actors themselves seemed ill at ease at times and there was 'staged' feel in many of the scenes. I also cannot see how anyone unfamiliar with the book would have a chance of following the disjointed and highly diluted plot. Nevertheless, there were some high points. There were many humorous and well acted scenes, and the cast is a collection of some of the finest actors around today. Despite its failings, I would recommend anyone even a little bit interested in Harry Potter to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter grows up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film yesterday. I think it is the best one yet. The new director has done an excellent job. This is an interesting movie because Harry, Hermione, and Ron all begin to grow up in this film and the actors are growing with them. This movie stays very true to the book even though some of the more detailed parts had to be left out due to obvious time constraints. I really liked the Marauder's map and the special effects they were absolutely incredible. Buckbeak, the hippogriff, looked pretty computer animated to me but he even seemed pretty real. I think more than anything it was just amazing to see this book come to life. When Harry casts the Expecto Patromum it is really sweet how you get to see him save himself. Lupin is an important character to this film as well. It is pretty interesting how they show him transform from a man to a werewolf. Anyways, long story short this is a great movie, I think it gives the first two a run for their money. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday at a screening in Chicago. I thought there was more humor in this film than the other two. The characters are older and this makes them better actors. There are some new additions to the cast and they add a lot to the film. Harry's uncle is meaner then ever.The new director did a good job of being true to the book. The action focuses less on life at Hogwarts this time. I wish there was more Quidditch. The special effects were good. The end gets a little confusing because there is a lot of time travel. The movie is not too scary and it is probably appropriate for all school age children. I think people of all ages will enjoy this movie. I will probably see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW THIS MOVIE TOTALLY Surprised ME!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to a NYC Screening of this movie and all I have to say is Wow. I didn't know if the movie would be better than the first two or not but Alfonso Cuaron did the movie just as good if better. I recommend going to see this move. As always Dan, Rupert, Emma, and Robbie play there parts well but I was surprised about how good David Thewlis played Lupin he was awesome and was meant for the role. Gary Oldman played Sirius well but he looked a little too old for the part but who cares anyway. Micheal Gambon was just as good as Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Emma Thompson was great as Prof. Trelwany. I recommend again to go see this movie.10 OUT OF 10-Hands Down</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful, Exciting New Addition to the Series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron has done it!! He has actually been able to improve the Harry Potter films. I will not give exact details, see the film please. The cinematography is brilliant. It is one of the most beautifully filmed movie i have ever seen. I teach these novels in my classes and Cuaron has nailed the third book perfectly. He has kept all of the best parts. The actors were all wonderful. Kudos to the three main actors for maintaining a new sense of maturity that grows within the books. I cannot wait for the fourth film, unfortunately, Cuaron is not directing it!! What a total shame. Radcliffe is great in the film as is Gary Oldman, his Sirius Black is worth waiting for in the second half of the film. David Thewlis was very good. Michael Gambon an inspired choice for Dumbledore. He is very good too. You will not believe how much everyone has grown as far as the children go either. Harry is a summer must see for all ages!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The series is getting better which each movie ... this one was superior to the previous 2 and the new cast members were great. The principal cast are now so comfortable with their roles, that they may never be able to work again and it is fun watching them age on screen. Definitely darker and really may not be suitable for young children. This will make more money at the box office than the previous two and I have not seen a line (mob) for a preview that even came close to this. Michael Gambon slides into the Dumbledore role with ease and Oldman is his usual awesome self. Coltrane and Smith are as dependable as usual and Thelwis and Rickman are solid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Won't disappoint true believers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it in a preview yesterday. I'm no HP fan, but I've accompanied my daughter (now 10) to all three movies. Hoped this one would have some (chaste) "Y Tu Mama Tambien" teenage exuberance, but it's not much different than the other movies. This one is better--and probably scarier--but not much better. It's slow-paced until near the end, and, if you haven't the read the book, somewhat incomprehensible. Most fun is spotting familiar English actors--Emma Thompson, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Julie Christie, Dawn French, Timothy Spall. Daughter complained that important elements of the book were omitted. Tried to explain that as Rowling's books keep getting longer and movies needed to stay more or less the same length, something had to go. She remains unpersuaded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is without a doubt the best of the three ... It is so visually rich with detail ... Interesting angles, lots of exterior shots, special effects were seamless ... The acting of the three majors is improved, raw and natural ... While staying true to the essence of the book, what is delivered here is a pleasing, fast-paced, extremely witty, visual feast ...Warning: Some plotlines don't make it into the movie or in some cases the sequence of things are not the same or are streamlined for the sake of time ? While this is always a bit painful for the faithful Potter-fan to swallow, even the sections I knew ahead of time were missing I didn't find it to be blatant ? you get swept away in the movie and it's hardly noticeable ? Important though to separate yourself from the details of the book so as not to be disappointed ? There ARE things missing but the main stuff from the book is all there ? All considering, they were pretty faithful ? There are some added scenes or things in scenes that only served to enhance ?Bottom Line: Can't imagine anyone coming away disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Weakest of the First Three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) ** (out of 4)Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts for his third year where he's befriended by a new professor but also must prepare for Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from prison.I knew going into HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN that this was the shortest film of the first three in the series. I must say that this is also the weakest of the first three films and even though it had the shortest running time it seemed to drag on longer than the first two films combined. Technically everything here is on par with the previous films and that includes the cinematography, set and costume design, the score and the performances.So, what's wrong with this film? I'm going to place the majority of the blame on director Alfonso Cuaron. Chris Columbus managed to bring the magical aspect of the books off the pages and onto the screen but that didn't happen here. In fact I thought the majority of the film was missing this magic and even worse is that it seems more comic relief was thrown in. The comedy was pretty bland throughout and especially during the opening thirty minutes or so where it was just trying too hard to be funny.I also thought the story itself was pretty boring and at times it seemed to be all over the place. Perhaps had I been familiar with the books it would have played better? I'm not sure. I will say that the performances were once again quite good with Radcliffe, Richard Griffiths and the rest of the gang in fine form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more "grown-up looking" Harry Potter adventure, held back by lacklustre plot and over-active camera work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third Harry Potter film has a better 'look' than the previous two. The colours and photography are much darker, presumably to reflect the darker turn taken by the story. It's clear that new director Alfonso Cuaron is intent on moving the series into a more grown-up, emotionally engaging, self-consciously moody realm of film-making. What lets Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban down is the absence of a truly compelling storyline (it hovers constantly on the verge of something really good, but never quite gets there). There's also an irritating over-emphasis on the camera work, more of which will be said later.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts, but things at the school are not at all well. A notorious prisoner, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), has escaped from Azkaban Prison and many fear that he will head for Hogwarts. Black has spent years imprisoned for being an ally of Voldemort (the bad wizard who murdered Harry's parents) and it is feared that he wants to track down Harry and kill him. Dementors, demon-like guardians from Azkaban, are placed around the school perimeters to intercept the escaped villain ? yet they seem just as dangerous to the safety of the pupils, Harry most of all. Rather than sit around and wait for trouble to come to him, Harry tries to piece together more of the events that led to his parent's demise all those years ago, in the hope that something from his past will help him in his quest to stay alive.Like the previous two films, Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban is geared towards fans of the book more than casual viewers. There are occasional incidents and bits of dialogue that seem incoherent or flawed, yet those more familiar with the book seem able to fill in such gaps in narrative logic quite readily. On the positive side, though, there are favourable things to say about the film. Its dark mood is nicely maintained; the child actors finally seem to be getting better; there is a more fulfilling sense of character development; some of the plot developments are quite unpredictable. The film is certainly equal to ? possibly a fraction better than ? the first one, and considerably improves on the underwhelming number Two. One thing which really mars this film, though, is the restless camera work. In every shot ? even a scene as mundane as a conversation or a lesson ? the camera pans and zooms and prowls needlessly, to the point where it induces headaches. Photographer Michael Seresin has tried to be a little too showy for his own good, and the effect merely lessens one's enjoyment of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>~*-Harry Potter and Alfonso Cuarón-*~</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie so many times, until I turned 15 (2006) and I loved it every time! Of course, back then I was watching it for the story. I'm seventeen right now and almost forgot I am still a teenager. This movie reminds me of so much in my life, because every time I watched it, I was sad or angry and it always helped me distract and then concentrate on a solution.Today I watched this movie again and I noticed new things, I can say this is the kind of movie, which you can watch so many times and discover something new about it every time.I've seen "Y tu mamá también" and "Paris, je t'aime" mostly because of curiosity about Alfonso Cuarón's directing style. I can recognize that style now, in "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban". He managed to bring the movie two Oscar nominations (although he wasn't personally nominated, we know the director comes with the "vision").Of course the change is huge, it's almost an entirely different "Harry Potter" universe, the young wizards are obviously teenagers now, everything is so much darker, the characters were more rebellious and the actors were allowed more liberty with their characters and I think they did a good job. I can clearly recognize Alfonso's style with all the hugs between Harry, Ron and Hermione, you have to admit, those are a tiny bit sexual. And the "Y tu mamá también" reference when Hermione hugged Ron and Harry hugged Hermione at Buckbeak's "execution", I found a little bit too much. They were supposed to be thirteen and they referenced to a movie that's basically about a ménage ? trois.The cast was great, you can feel that Daniel Radcliffe was having a lot of fun with his character and probably Emma Watson and Rupert Grint had fun also, but Radcliffe's performance is the most noticeable.Also, the first thing you forget is how nice and magical the first movie was, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone". This third one rather felt like real, like this magic world is real and there is a huge story coming about this dark wizard coming back to torment and kill the people. And I believe that was the entire purpose of the third book, getting over this amazing world and focusing on the plot Voldemort-will-be-back-soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a glimpse of what could have been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so fresh... it flows easily are sprinkled with nice humor and is full of creative touches, the music is good, hell even the kids (especially Emma Watson) are good (well... Radclife is passable) and the direction is nothing short of mind blowing.Seriously, this is a glimpse of what could have been a great series if someone like Cuaron would have directed it. He seems to have a firm grasp of the humor and atmosphere of JKs universe and have distilled the book into a organic film instead of a bunch of stringed together scenes.Everything looks so much better then in previous entries. And there is a sensed of darkness here that could only been sensed before, now, if you read JKs novels you know that this darkness is in the books too, its that surrounding darkness that makes Hogwarts such a cosy place, Cuaron understands, look how he contrasts the dread of the dementers with the guys joking around in the tower. Its a knee-jerk reaction equating darkness with improvement, but Cuaron is much more then darkness, he instills real warmth and charm into his characters, contrasting that darkness, making it a cosy picture, Hagrid is especially endearing in this installment. His warmth is real, his sadness is real.David Thewlis as Lupin shines brightest though. The acting, the mustasche, its just comes together brilliantly.Cuaron also understands that Dumbledore isn't some Gandalf rip-off, he is this wise, but still genuinely eccentric wizard. And Finally we can sense that weird side of him to. (not that Richard Harris wasn't brilliant though... i just think he was a little to... tired) And in a stroke of genius Cuaron throws in this shrunken-talking- Jamaican head WOW... just WOW</fullReview>

Now this movie would not be entirely bad if they just left stuff out but they actually changed the book! And it wasn't just a little thing here and there they changed major things. I'm not going to say what they where all I can say is that you should get the book, read it, and then watch the movie again to see how much worse the are then the books. The S.E. were pretty good even though every time any one cast a spell it looked like wind shot out and that was that.

		<shortDescription>Harry's Even More Magical World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuarón is probably one of the most eclectic directors in all of Hollywood. I first became interested in him after viewing the film Y Tu Mamá También, and began to devour his other works including Great Expectations and A Little Princess. Every film of his is a gem, and completely different from the previous, but the one film that really stood out in my mind as a showcase of his work was, incredibly enough, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Now, I am by no means a very big Harry Potter fan. Yes, I've read the books, and yes I've seen the movies, but they were never really a very big deal for me, like they were for some of my peers. What drew my attention to the film was the attachment of Alfonso Cuarón to the job of directing.After two financially successful Harry Potter films, Chris Columbus called it quits, and in 2003, the job was up for grabs. Columbus, after a string a very successful family films including Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Stepmom, had developed a very predictable way of directing, which, for me, made the first two Harry Potter films incredibly dull. When I became aware that Cuarón was taking the job, I grew very excited for the release of the film. In his other works, Cuarón had found a way of completely opening up the film to let the audience be entirely immersed in a world they are not part of. He gives the audience room to imagine what is beyond the scope of the camera and the walls of Hogwarts. I love everything about this technique because it gives such a sense of possibility and limitlessness.While many cynics, especially kids who have read the book, as it's likely the only book they've read which has been made into a movie, object to the removal of subplots in the film, they are missing the overall aesthetic and feel of the film. The third movie feels more like a Harry Potter book. While only focusing on the linear events of Harry Potter, Columbus missed out on the broad world of Harry Potter, which is exactly what Cuarón provided. Cuarón spent a great deal of time showcasing the lusciousness of the castle, the beauty of the grounds, and the overall quirkiness of everyday objects in this world. He paid extra special attention to the colors that were placed in the film, green for jealousy, and red for warning. Cuarón managed to set up incredibly complicated camera shots that weave in and out of rooms, over turrets, and across lakes. These small touches are what emphasize the magic of Harry's world, and not the actual events that happen in the narrative. Everybody knows they can do magic and everybody knows the invisibility cloak works. It's how the director engages the audience by the use of camera movement that the audience feels that they too, can be a part of this.Cuarón also binds magical elements to the elements of the real world. Like in A Little Princess, the audience is not quite sure how all of those food and luxury items appeared in Sara's room, but they like it just the same. In Great Expectations it's quite unrealistic to believe that Fin gets this remarkable chance to display his art and become famous, but it is bound with very realistic elements such as poverty, and heart brokenness, that makes the audience come to believe that this could really happen. Cuarón uses the same techniques in The Prisoner of Azkaban. Throughout most of the film, the main characters are never seen with their robes on, yet appear performing magic all the time. Having these two elements juxtaposed together engages the audience even more, because these are kids who wear the same clothes, talk about the same things, and have the same problems that everyone does. The audience can relate to the characters, and feel like they area part of the story, rather than idly watching. Cuarón emulates what J.K. Rowling's books were trying to invoke in readers?a sense of belonging.A well directed film will not necessarily leave the viewer continuing to think about the plot of the film, or even its social implications, but a well directed film will make you think in terms of the world it was set in. After The Prisoner of Azkaban, the audience wants to know what else is going in this world. They want to know what lies deep in the forbidden forest; they want to know the ins and outs of the castle; and because of the omnipotence of the camera, the audience believes that they are entitled and have the ability to know more. This was not a film told in a linear way, but in an incredibly 3-dimensional world, where anything is possible, and it is they way that Cuarón illustrates this with his techniques that makes this film amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Lousy Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay first off I am a Harry Potter fan but first and foremost I am a movie fan. This said I gave what I believe was a fair grade. Let's start off as why this movie got a 2.Now I could sit here and go on and on about how the movie isn't like the book but to be fair I will only go into this briefly. Like it's previous installments the movie has omitted some well known characters in the series Peeves still hasn't appeared in this movie nor has Cho, Harry's dream girl, so I was quite since Peeves adds the comedic effect and Harry's love for Cho adds a little more depth to his character. Then there's the typical character and plot change often seen in this particular series of films and the plot holes are numerous. Plus the character portrayal left much to be desired.Now on to the aspects of the film. Like all the previous installments this film once again features a cast of well known British actors which, while they are some of my favorites, are way too many. A few unknowns would be welcome on the scene. The scenery has changed to give it a darker setting despite this fact it didn't help the film too much. Daniel Radcliff, as our heroic boy wizard, didn't really do too much for me in terms of his portrayal. Yes the boy does look like Harry as I and quite a few others imagined him, at least that's as close as the physical interpretation is going get. The acting on his part is lacking as always. I don't know it could just be me but he only seems to have a few expressions and he never seems to display the right emotion. Ron was good though I don't agree that he should be reduced to a sniveling coward so much. The kid needs to have some guts. Hermione yeah I think she did well enough. The others did what was and has become expected of their portrayals not much to say there. I however did not like Gary Oldman's portrayal of Sirius Black.Look I know the guy has been in Azkaban for years but Sirius was a cool kind of guy who had not done what others thought he did. That's what was so special about Sirius even though the man spent years in a place where even the darkest wizards go insane not even the Dementors could get him because Sirius was without guilt. Instead in this movie what few times he's seen he's portrayed as borderline insane like he's just about to go over the edge. Not Mr. Oldman's best performance by a long shot. There was Thewlis' portrayal of Lupin. For the most part the man did a moderate portrayal of the werewolf/teacher. Then again his performance was one of the better ones of the film.There's that repetitive score that was good in the first film but by now is heard in every single scene. Then there's the monotonous CGI effects that appear so frequently in this film series. Sure Buckbeak was well done and was one of the higher points of the film. This said the CG werewolf was not ferocious or threatening but instead seemed sickly and underfed. The Dementors would have struck fear in me if I was four years old and every other computer generated character looked oddly deformed in someway.My list of dislikes could go further so time to rap it up. All around if this movie weren't based on a book series I might have liked it more. But since it is there isn't really much boosting it up. If you've read the books avoid this and all previous and future HP films. If you've seen the previous movies and liked them then I guess you'll be easier to please with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't stand this movie at all! Me and my best friend were complaining so loudly in the cinema that our other friends went and sat in the aisle. The PoA is my all-time favorite book and prolly always will be, I had been looking forward to this movie ever since 2001 when they started making them, and was so disappointed at the lack of faithfulness (or ANY faithfulness) to the books. Our friends were asking us countless questions not the way home because the movie didn't cover enough points and left allot of loose ends untied.Lupin not explaining the Marauders storyline was the ultimate downfall, which was what made the book the best of them all, I was so upset. Lupin looking like an overgrown Hairy Gollum when he was supposed to look like a normal wolf with only a few distinguishing features (tail, eyes etc) also, when they were explaining how Pettigrew was the traitor not Sirius, they didn't really explain the secret keeper charm properly and explained Pettigrew cutting off his finger and transforming into a rat in about a 30 second speech by Sirius. It is so obvious they crammed everything in. The stag at the end was never explained. They say they must cut the movies short or else they'd go on for to long, they had no trouble with Lord of the Rings! 3 hours long and they are considered classics! Oh yeah, the whole set was changed, the fat lady wasn't in a corridor but directly in front of the stairs, they put so much emphasis on that stupid clock and the music was really corny. Professor Trelawney was soooo stupid, she had frizzy hair! Trelawney was always described as sleek, mysterious with shawls and bangles but not, they had to simplify that. They changed the prophesy saying that "Innocent blood will be spilt" and no innocent blood was spilt! NONE!!!! About the only thing they did right were the dementors, the scary scenes were brilliant! I blame the director (Alfonso Cuarón) who did just this one film, all the others are fine but the best book is the worst movie and that makes me really mad! All in all, a movie that doesn't explain anything and is totally unfaithful to any form of the book.</fullReview>

Looking at the credentials of the guy who directed this movie, its no surprise. The acting by the newly introduced characters is absolutely horrible and even the old ones seem to have lost their touch. The plot takes many inexplicable and highly illogical twists and turns. With utterly crappy CGI and special effects, especially during the werewolf scene, this movie is actually a downgrade. The deatheaters were however, very nicely done. As a movie by itself, this is really not that bad and can be entertaining but has seriously gone downhill after the first two parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was a terrible waste of my time. There really wasn't a beginning and an ending, and I felt as if everything was rushed. The movie starts out with Harry sitting up in bed... DOING MAGIC! Underage wizards aren't allowed to do magic outside of school! Anyway, he does this about 5 times, then he lays back down and goes to sleep. With a blank screen, you hear his aunt shouting at him, but she doesn't sound anything like in the first and second movies. The next few shots are live-action, and very inaccurate to the book. Skipping to the ending... I honestly have to say that I am furious about the ending. Harry receives a broomstick in the mail, and flies with it. The movie ends when... he is flying on his broom in a pause-shot!? Honestly! The entire movie is BAD, and I really don't recommend it to anyone who has read the books. People who have just seen the movies... well that's just great because it doesn't make any sense. Okay, and just a warning, the dementors don't even have feelings in this movie (like they did in the book!!!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the trailers portray this movie as a great installment to the HP series. Do not be fooled. Personally, I had high expectations of this film as Harry Potter and the POA is one of the best books out of the six. I was disappointed and felt like the movie was rushed. Main events were missed out such as Sirius Black coming into Hogwarts, Quidditch matches and Hermione's worries over the firebolt, which was meant to be introduced in the middle of the plot. Events were not explain thoroughly enough and I think many viewers who have not read the book may have started to get confused. Also an important factor in the movie was the bond between Harry, Ron and Hermione. Sometimes while watching the film, I felt like they were not best friends but merely classmates. Arguments appear between Ron and Hermione, which is perfectly normal, but there is just no love between the trio. Praises go to Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis for playing their roles excellently! The movie is not terrible, as the special effects are good and the acting is OK, but I just didn't feel the special magic of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darker and better: the Potter franchise keeps maturing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Tim Burton did with Batman, Chris Columbus "dumped" the Harry Potter franchise after the first two movies. Luckily, his replacement, Alfonso Cuar?n, is no Joel Schumacher and the third Potter episode is no Batman Forever.While still children-friendly enough to get a PG, The Prisoner of Azkaban is quite darker than Columbus' opening twosome: this time, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is in serious danger. No, the fact that he put a spell on his aunt has nothing to do with it. The real problem Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a feared murderer who has broken out of magical prison Azkaban to track down and kill our favorite teenage wizard. Why? Well, probably because he used to work for Voldemort and wants to complete what he started several years ago: apparently, he is the one who betrayed Harry's parents, leading to their death. With all the other weird things going on at Hogwarts (new teachers, werewolves, "I have a bad feeling about this" speeches), it looks like the third year will be like the previous two: filled with dangers, excitement and, most of all, magic.Cuar?n does an excellent job when it comes to showing the young protagonists' growing pains and frustrations, emphasizing the fact that they are getting older and more aware of what is required of them, as well as laying the grounds for further exploration of teenage problems in the upcoming fourth film. Also, unlike Columbus, he's not afraid of removing certain parts of the book to make the film less stiff. As a result, Prisoner of Azkaban is more fluid and enjoyable than the first two Potter flicks, but the director could and should have kept a couple of crucial explanations in the third act, their absence implying viewers who haven't read the book might be left with more questions than answers. Another crucial innovation, as previously mentioned, is the darker tone, never more evident than in the scenes featuring the Dementors, the demonic creatures that have been sent to capture Black. An impressive example of good (as in serving the story, not being above it) CGI, they might remind of the Nazguls from The Lord of the Rings at first, but in the end they come off as much more frightening).As for the additions the cast (the other element to constantly evaluate in each new film), Emma Thompson is very amusing (though in a spooky way), while Michael Gambon proves a worthy replacement for the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, having the authority and at the same time kindness the role demands. But ultimately, this movie belongs to two actors: David Thewlis and Gary Oldman. The former provides warmth and humanity as Remus Lupin, the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, even if it is weird no one ever becomes suspicious because of his last name (as seen in the brilliant climax); the latter comes close to stealing the entire movie, making Sirius Black this installment's Big Thing. All the character's pain, resentment and anger come out of Oldman's face and mouth with an almost scary intensity, adding plenty to the film's emotional resonance.Overall, this darker, less by-the-book (in terms of fidelity to the source material) Potter is much better than the first two entries in the series. If the fourth movie is at least equally good, the franchise might turn into something spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highlight of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another rating point above part two, so a solid 9 for me. This is my favorite movie of all four of the series. There are basically two main reasons for that. The time-travel sequence had me on the edge of my seat, I was stunned by the complexity and the brilliancy of how this aspect was presented, how it fitted to the scene before and how it was generally linked. That made it for me. The second reason was the complex storyline, in particular the new character of Mr. Lupin, Harry's teacher, and the way he and Sirius Black turned into animals as one of the movies highlights. Also the map of the castle with the mysterious footprints was just utter genius! Harry's fight against the "Dementor"-guys was a very powerful sequence, when you consider him being emotionally so much involved here, when he created that shield with the memories of his parents. When I look into Harry's eyes there, I can almost feel how much he struggles with his fear and how powerful his magical skills are. Again, my favorite of the series. Just think of the wonderful animal Harry and Hermione save, what an eye-catcher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new style for a great series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third installment in the Harry Potter series sports a new style, much different from the previous two films' style. It turns the family-friendly franchise into a new, teenager-friendly offering, complete with teen angst, anger, and puppy love. The films are growing with their audience.The plot line of the film is fairly simple, but gets VERY complicated toward the end: Harry is entering his third year at Hogwarts, and he's going with the knowledge that there is a killer on the loose looking for him: Sirius Black. Mr. Weasley makes Harry swear that, no matter what, he won't go looking for Black. But, to quote Harry, why would he go looking for someone who wants to kill him? The mystery is solved in this excellently crafted fantasy film that combines good plot, artistic cinematography, and an excellent score from John Williams.The film hardly has any shortcomings. The actor who replaces Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, is in my opinion better as Dumbledore, but some people may not share my views. Also, the plot can get quite confusing towards the end, but it all makes sense by the end of the film if you've been paying attention. None of these faults are bad enough to affect the film much, though. It's an absolutely outstanding cinematic achievement, and it's worth a buy for sure. Go get it now! 10/10 from zero-hour-ii</fullReview>

Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint were the best people for the roles. I think that Emma Watson is a great role model for all teenagers...especially me! Overall, it's one of the best movies, and I cannot wait for the rest of the movies! The movie was very well done and the cast worked the roles great. One of my favorite parts was when Hermione smacked Draco. Wow! What power! I think that they could have included more detail from the book. I am a huge Harry Potter fanatic!! I have read all the books more than once, and they I can never put them down! J.K. Rowling is an amazing author, and she captures everyone's imagination. All of my friends say that Harry Potter is the best movie ever! I agree with that...to sum up everything, I LOVED Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban, and Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe are amazing! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone is Chris Columbus and so enters Alfonso Cuaron. Strike up the band, paint a banner, and the parade will be here in a few minutes.I have nothing against Columbus (haha thats where i live), but from the way chamber of secrets was going, it looked like the franchise was going to get a little stale. So gone are the bright colors and blockbuster soundtrack and cheap special effects of the first two movies and in comes the new artsy, darker look of Prizoner of Azkaban.Cuaron wasted no time in changing things to suit his needs however. Gone are the gentle rolling hills surrounding Hogwarts and in place of them are more extreme mountains. Hagrid's hut is down a hill that was nonexistent in the other movies, and the castle now includes a courtyard, a giant clock, and a large elevated walkway that leads to seemingly no where. These changes aren't necessarily bad, but they hurt the continuity of the series. Also, the entire tone of the movie is different, as the kids grow older and more mature.At first viewing, I didn't really like this movie as much as the other ones, mostly Sorceror's Stone. But when I thought about it, and as I read the 6th book, I realized that Harry's world isn't always a bright and colorful world with a blockbuster soundtrack and cheap special effects. So in a way, this movie provides a nice transition between the first books of the series and the later more darker ones, at least for the movies.Personally, I loved the new sound of the soundtrack. John Williams remains as fresh as ever and the medieval styled music is very good and appropriate, combined with the old themes.Some things are sorely missed though. One thing in particular, is Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is by no means a bad actor, but him as Dumbledore wearing a beanie just doesn't work. Richard Harris' dumbledore had that warmth and authority that perfectly caught the essence of the character portrayed in the books. There's nothing they can do about it, but I think Ian McKellen would have been a better choice, or maybe even Patrick Stewart.The only thing that makes this movie a little subordinate to the Sorceror's Stone is the end, which i thought lacked a little substance and could have been better given how the book ended. There were just a few little things that it could have added to make it that much more powerful, but they decided to make the movie that much shorter. Still, this is a very good movie and I eagerly anticipate the next movie. Mischief managed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Potter Movie yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an entirely different director, followed by a different style, the third installment of the Harry Potter series had people questioning whether or not this film would be as entertaining and refreshing as its predecessors. As for me, it not only was entertaining, but seemed better and more adult than its predecessors.When comparing such a movie to its original novel, it's hard to say how along the lines this particular movie followed. With several crucial missing parts, it left faithful Potter fans to throw their popcorn cartons to the screen, and babbling about Cuaron's terrible job on the movie. I, having read the series, do agree that the film could have done well and made more sense with what had been cut. However, most forget to think of this movie as a movie alone--with no thought of the novel from which it was derived. Instead of comparing it to its novel twin, comparing it with its predecessors would be more accurate.As the series progresses, the stories, therefore the movies, get better, as well as the acting abilities. As the stories continue to get darker, the characters continue to mature. Radcliffe's performance, unfortunately, was a bit of a disappointment. Having improved since "Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone", his performance was still less than expected for the third installment and for the character he plays. He is Harry Potter, after all.Watson continues to improve, and she does not disappoint in her performance as Hermione Granger. She has grown to be one of the finest and most respectable teenage actresses for this generation. Grint has a natural talent for being Ron Weasley. It was almost as if he were born to play the part. He IS Ron. His performance was one of the most entertaining in the entire film. Comic relief is an important part in films which consist mainly of darker matters, which is what Ron brings to the film.The style in which this movie was set--more casual and laid back--was really appealing. It was refreshing to see that Hogwarts students aren't always in uniform, and everything is really comforting. This was by far the best way I have seen a Harry Potter film. Cuaron should have directed all three films. His style of directing was really riveting.Thus, I give Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban a 9/10 rating. Fantabulous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. As a devoted Harry Potter fan, I was disappointed with a few things, but you can't always match your vision with the vision of the director. All of the Harry Potter main characters, played by Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint, were much better this time around (I still like to laugh at their acting jobs in the first two movies, but they were kids). The replacement Dumbledore I actually liked BETTER than the first one because he seemed more quirky, more like the Dumbledore that I picture and that is represented in the books. David Thewlis and Gary Oldman were fine, though I see them differently as well. Not that he is ugly, but Sirius Black is supposed to be very, VERY good-looking, and you could not see a trace of a good-looking man (that I pictured) in the withered Oldman.Also, the ending was rather stupid for me. I did not like the whole Harry-got-a-broom-and-is-whisked-away ending with Daniel Radcliffe's blurry face.Great movie. I cannot wait for the next one! (November 18, 2005!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A welcome rejuvenation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Harry Potter movie series, so far, stands among only a few movie series that have improved with each successive film--the Evil Dead series and The Man With No Name trilogy to name two others. Chris Columbus, director of the first two films, gained a steadier grasp on his material with the second film, but it was Cuaron, director of this third, that moved the series into a much needed different direction.Columbus, a children movie director, paradoxically does not understand children. In his films, he forms representations of children that cater to an adult imagination; however, these representations are far too stiff and too clever to be true or believable. His films are entertaining because they appeal to this adult imagination, but that can only take the Harry Potter series so far. Cuaron stepped into it and yielded to the young actors a measure more freedom of character movement. The young actors, because of this freedom, act more like real kids, rather than cute representations.Rupert Grint, playing Ron Weasley, in this film does not rely on the quizzical expression that frequented his face in the first two films, and his punchline voice, though it remains, is clearing up nicely. Emma Watson, as Hermione Granger, has gained strength and confidence as an actress; she possessed both in the first two films, but has more-so now.Daniel Radcliffe, as the title hero, still needs some tuning up: his dialogue is more halting in this film and he can't quite manage the clunkers screenwriter Steven Kloves throws at him--when, for instance, he swears vengeance on convict wizard Sirius Black. Despite this, Radcliffe plays a better Harry Potter in this film, one who is more a troubled loner and tumultuous teenager, one who is a truer manifestation of the hothead Rowling created.In an otherwise cartoonish--though not unpleasantly cartoonish--first third, Radcliffe brings this troubled teendom out when he runs away after an upsetting episode with the Dursleys, his foster family. He seethes with anger, confusion, and melancholy.The filmmaker, whether it is Cuaron or Kloves or others, risks more in this film. Some of these risks are silly, whether it is an allusion to drug use when the boys are sitting around trying candies that have different joke effects on them, or whether it is an allusion to another boyhood activity when Harry makes his wand incandesce underneath his bedsheets.The biggest risk was changing Hogwart's locale. The terrain in this film feels natural and vibrant, and though they acquaint the audience well enough with the new hilly school-grounds, the audience may be put off, or, worse yet, confused after having familiarized themselves with the setting during the first two.The filmmakers also risk confusing the audience by glossing over some of the plot details in the assumption that most the audience has read the book. Columbus, at least, enunciated every significant detail.Cuaron, however, should be congratulated on the risk that paid off the best: putting more emphasis on characters than effects and putting more control into the young actors' hands. This most of all makes Prisoner of Azkaban the engrossing, entertaining, vibrant film it is.The visual effects--and they're considerably vital in a franchise such as this and worth consideration--are absolutely astounding, Buckbeak the hippogryff especially--another leap forward from the first two.Also, listen to the score by John Williams as you watch. It's a treat too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of all of the harry potter films, but I have found this one to be the best of all. First off I would like to mention how much I admire Michael Gambons performance as Dumbledore. I think I admired it because he didn't try to duplicate the late Richard Harris's dead on creation of Dumbledore. He instead showed how he perceived Dumbledore to be and while it is not quite as perfect as Harris's it is his own.The film was also much darker but I liked that. I feel like the films are getting darker because Harry is maturing while facing dangers that get darker as each book and films goes by. I also liked how the film wasn't a perfect carbon copy of the book, and that some liberties were taken.I feel like the actors really know their characters now, and have grown in talent as well. You have to remember that for the three main leads these movies pretty much are their whole list of movies they have acted in. They are getting better with each film. In particular Emma Watson has made her character into the strongest of the three.I see great things to come in future films and I eagerly anticipate Goblet of Fire coming towards the end of the year. As for this one I say darker is better(and yes there were light-hearted moments to lighten the mood)so keep it going.</fullReview>

They changed the music. This one just sucked in general. I mean some of the graphics were okay, but it didn't just meet up to the first two. Maybe it was because of the new director of the movie. The creatures were real cool. They changed some of the characters and there wasn't much of the old excitement as there was in the older movies. Another example of changing location was the hotel where Harry stayed at in the first 2 was run by a different tom and it was as befuddled. Another thing was that it was next to a train track. In the first movie. It wasn't anywhere near a train track. So ill say it again, this one stinks!!! I'm a big fan of Harry Potter.

		<fullReview>I am a huge Harry Potter fan, however, I read the books only after having watched the first two films on TV and Azkaban in a movie theater. Actually, it was Azkaban that did it for me. I like the third film better than the first two, and don't mind any of the changes made to the plot. It now reflects Harry's inner feelings and development, and this is OK. Cuarón's work is much more artistic, and creates an atmosphere that Columbus failed to achieve. I have watched this film so many times now that I fully appreciate it on its own, separately from the book. The time-turner sequence is an accurate portrayal of events, and actually clarifies the rules of time-traveling.However, I think that before watching the upcoming film, Goblet of Fire, you should read the book first, or you won't understand much of the story. A book which is that long can not possibly be adapted to screen without making considerable changes. I am very much looking forward to Goblet, nevertheless, and can't wait to see how the new director manages to tell the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first found out that a Mexican was directing the third installment in the phenomenal "potter" series was kind of a shock,a good one that is.Alfonso Cuaron directing the beautiful "a little princess" and the sexy "y tu mama tambien" has crafted a fantasy story worth remembering.The film,which is way much darker and it isn't directed to the kiddy audience,is mostly about betrayal of an old generation and revenge.Sirius Black,the escaped prisoner of Azkaban is heading to Harry to finally achieve what his master couldn't do:to finally get rid of the boy who lived.Also in this film many secrets are discovered (wont give them away!) and surprises that will be used in the upcoming films. The first two installments,directed by Chris Columbus didn't bring the spirit of wizards and witchcraft.For example since the movie is a about witches and dark lords ,it should be with more of a dark feeling in cinematography,music,and set decoration and thats something Columbus failed and Cuaron achieved.The performances here are way much better from regular child actors.Emma Watson delivers the role of the nerdy yet rebellion Hermione,Rupert Grint as the clumsy but loyal Ron,and Harry as the wizard who his mysterious past keeps unfolding at each movie.Even though the films are'nt as faithful in pages as the last two,it still manages to get the storyline right.And for the crazy fans who sended death threats to Cuaron,at the end credits you can see in bold letters:"BASED on the book by JK Rowling".So they aren't saying it IS the movie,they are saying it is BASED.In conclusion,as crazy you might think I am,this was the best film of 2004.It has great performances,directed with inmense flair,art directed with a Gothic feel,beautiful music,spectacular special effects and most importantly of all it has the spirit of JK Rowling spectacular series in to a big budget movie.Amazing and truly captivating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an adult HP fan, I was disappointed in POA. I believe the director did not read the books or watch the films or if he did, didn't understand them.Snape in SS and COS was scary. In POA, he just looks like a very ugly, silly cross dresser. In the other films, you see him be unnerved by Harry. (Watch SS and COS's scenes with these two.) McGongagall who had come across as strict, but with an understanding of kids now is depicted as cross, uncaring and almost mean.Another thing I did not like is how the kids wore their street clothes at Hogwarts. It made Hogwarts less magical. Before, the distinction between Muggle and Wizard worlds was made with their clothing. It just felt wrong, like seeing your teacher show up to class in their nightclothes.Hermione, once intelligent, is now portrayed as cross, moody, and unable to be understood. Ron is now the dumb sidekick. What a waste of talent.Some of the few good things seen are Harry's self doubts, pain, and humanity. At one point in the film, his emotions are so raw, his actions and words just hit you, as if you are feeling the emotions with him.Harry's pain, his rage, and so many emotions all at once coming to the surface to be voiced as they had not been before. Seeing Harry discover the past that is his, known to all but him, finding who he is now and searching for his place in the world, especially the Wizarding world, you feel for him and want to help him. That is Daniel Radcliffe's brilliance, not anyone else's. His interpretation of this side of Harry was done to perfection.Harry's conferences with Lupin, expressing his fears, and confiding in him. I was also impressed with Lupin not treating him as a silly child, but someone closer to being a man and giving Harry honest answers, even if Lupin had no answers or the answers were not what Harry wanted to hear.The bones in the story are strong, but this director goofed more than he didn't. Had this movie been done by someone who understood the movies, it'd have turned out so much better.I think Steve Kloves, JK Rowling and other PTB (powers that be) need to BEG Chris Columbus to take the director's chair again. He GOT the movies. He understood how to do the difficult task of putting Harry Potter on film, capturing the magic, wowing audiences, and still being very true to the books.I in no way blame the actors. They all did their best to give the stellar performances but with lousy direction, even the best actor cannot shine.These actors have only one chance per movie to get it right. I can only hope that Goblet of Fire and if the sixth film is made, that more care, time, and talent comes from the director of those films. However, if the PTB get it right and get Columbus back in the director's chair and give him free reign, I know the true magic of Harry Potter will return.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gets a 7 out of 10 solely because despite all its shortcomings, it is STILL Harry Potter. This movie is a drastic step down from the first two movies--mostly because of a new, inferior, director. The set has been greatly changed (did he think we wouldn't notice Hagrid's hut is in a completely different location?), the student's no longer have to wear their school uniforms--a sudden change in centuries of school policy--and the change in camera techniques are annoying. There are very few still shots in this movie. The camera is panning from up right or left and "swooping" down to the opposite corner while coming toward the subject on nearly every shot. It would be okay, I suppose, but it gets quite annoying after awhile.The magic and grandeur of the first two movies is sadly lacking from this incarnation. When shooting the magic stairwell, for example, where Columbus shot it from the ground-up, giving it a majestic, magical quality; this new director (whose name we do not speak) chooses, rather, to shoot downward at it--giving it a carnival-ride, ho-hum, feel.Finally, this book departs from the book far more widely than its two predecessors. The books have been thoroughly enjoyed and were well-written. Why would someone choose to depart from them? There were not just scenes from the book that were altered, but themes that were not at all addressed by the movie.The movie is certainly worth seeing, but if I did not love the Potter series so much, and if I were not hoping beyond hope that this current director does not continue with the fourth, my rating would be much less than 7.Please bring back Columbus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of all I appreciate your young cast. It certainly left curiosity in our hearts for the forth-coming flick. I have like warner brothers previous works too. Mostly magical, special effects, never seen before(NSB) computer graphics and anime. Especially the hippogriff. We wished it could stay for long and could do more things. Nasty! Sets are quite attracting and absorbing. One thing lacking is spontaneity in Harry's character. He hears too much. Takes a lot of time. He must become emotional with age. Which is bad of'course but that's how this character sounds. Otherwise, it is rising. Rupert Grint is your finding. We like tidier movies and thin guys. Movie has a scary name but was action packed and scary too. Keep it up!</fullReview>

I hate that; there were too many shadows and the black-out was way over-used. I mean, there ARE other screen transitions.Kudos to Michael Gambin for trying to fill Richard Harris' shoes though; even in sickness, that's a hard act to follow.Plus Alan Rickman wasn't in it nearly enough. His thirty seconds at the head table, then the cross-dressing incident, and then in the cabin...not enough sexiness for me. I'd really rather watch the first two, where you can see his brilliant acting and his...snarky sexiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best harry potter movie so far: which isn't saying much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to say that I'm giving this movie a one because I think it deserves less than whatever the average currently is at IMDb. However, if this review had nothing to do with averaging out the score, I would give it a five. Firstly, "Something wicked this way comes", grammatically it makes no sense, it would make sense if you said, "something wicked comes this way". Special effects are still bad, but they take a small step up, Cuaron seems to know what he's doing. At least better than Chris Columbus, who only got the job because he was prepared to be Rowling's tool. Then we come to the acting, though there seems to be a love interest brewing between Ron and Hermione, the ugliest two individuals to ever appear on screen at the same time, I can't help but feel that Ron is in the closet but trying desperately to leap out. None of these actors are charming, and furthermore Richard Harris passed away, probably the most talented of the cast from before. They were smart in cutting out a few scenes and it works well as a two hour movie. A step up from the past two films and hopefully a saving grace in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went with my nephews (who have read all the books) to see this movie. We were all so disappointed with the new direction Cuaron gave the movie. You see for my nephews reading this book was really difficult. They are just ages 7 and 8 and not avid readers. They expected the movie to be as the previous ones, somewhat fateful to the books. These kids loved the fact that they were able to see on screen what they imagined while reading the book. Although they did like the movie, they were still disappointed by the fact that this time their imagination did not come to life. The castle layout felt so wrong compared to the previous movie. Not to mention the portrayal of the characters. I just hope the next one is as great as the first two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Purists will be muttering about the departures from the book (check out some of the other reviews); while no purist myself I am puzzled about one or two of the changes in the setting and direction. What has not been mentioned is the location of Hagrids cottage. It has suddenly jumped from being just outside the main gate of Hogwarts (and adjacent to the Haunted Forest) to a wooded valley and reached by a path down a stony hillside. I believe that the castle was also visible in the background on a hill top. What was the point of that, I wonder? I also found the whole film entirely lacking the feel of the first two. OK, new Director wanting to put his own stamp on the series, I can understand that, but the film has suffered. It compares badly (in my opinion) with the others - sadly, it was mostly dull with definitely a touch of the "ho hum" factor. Michael Gambon is a damn good actor - why was his character so low key? As it was, you are reminded that Richard Harris is dead and this is the replacement, instead of just presenting Dumbledore as a lead part. Sorry, but I can only give this a 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was very good, considering they went and got themselves a new director. The way the movie transitioned and went from scene to scene was pretty well, nothing was dragged out or moved too fast. The only thing that I thought was silly was the end when they froze on Harry's face when he was riding the broom XD Hahahaha, but hey it is a movie meant for kids, so who cares if its childish :) It overall was great though in my opinion. Sure everything that was in the book wasn't included, but thats understandable because if they stayed faithful to the book, then well you know, it would end up 16 hours long or something, so they did fine with what they had. They kept you wondering and interested about what was going to happen next (for those who didn't read the book) and wondering just what it is that certain monsters or spells do. Of course, all of it eventually gets answered anyway, so its all good n gravey, and pretty much all of your questions (or mine were) answered by the end. I dunno why you'd go and strain yourself over something like that anyway, and go out of your way to find some unanswered question or something wrong. You can't ever really bottle perfection, and sometimes just have to be happy with what you have.I honestly didn't read the books at all, because I'm not one with the attention span to be able to do so, but this movie certainly drew me in, and explained things to a non-book person just fine :D The only reason that I might've not been able to know what was going on at times in the movie was because I couldn't make out what they were saying with their accents, or they were speaking to softly at times, but after watching it a 2nd time with the volume up and some subtitles, i got it all fine.But hey thats just me. I'm a Potter fan, and happy with the movies they've come out with so far. This one would have to be my favorite though, seeing as they've come a long way since the beginning and have got more budgeting to do the better CGI and animations and whatnot. But um... yeah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many essentials to the story left out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first and second movies were golden. This one however left out many important details that I felt really should have been included. Yes, it is a long book so they have to leave out a lot to fit it into a reasonable length movie, but not at the expense of cutting out essentials of the main storyline. One example of the many important features left out: The climax of the film was when Harry was finding out the truth about Sirius. It happened so quickly and so much was not explained. Did they explain how Sirius was able to escape from jail? How did they all know about this secret location below the whomping willow? And they hardly touched on everything about how Black, Lupin, Pettigrew and Potter were all a group of friends and the entire betrayal that occurred. Why was Snape so against Black?...(they never mention snape's history with that group. I mean, it explains why he never liked Harry) And finally, why didn't they explain the patronus looking like a stag? I'm a big fan of Harry Potter books and movies but this one just didn't meet my expectations. I give Harry Potter #1 a 9/10, #2 a 8/10 and #3 a 5/10.</fullReview>

I was disappointed that it lacked the charm the first two films produced and fell short mainly due to the plot which just was not well executed. More magical moments, more action and more humor would have made this movie as spellbinding as the first two.Although Prisoner of Azkaban is definitely worth renting, it does not deserve the praise given to the first two films as it just doesn't quite pull all of them together. In short, you will not leave your seat with that "magical glow" when the credits roll on this one and you will perhaps leave a little empty.</fullReview>

Believe me, I have read the book over 6 times, I should know. The quidditch game is in the wrong time period; and since when do the students wear zip-up hoodies and rainbow belts? That is wrong.

		<shortDescription>One movie, hold the sensibility, please.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that the novel 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' by J.K. Rowling is great, one of the best of the series, and I say this because of the way everything spins together and then there's the whole Scabbers/Pittegrew twist. But for the movie series, I'd have to say that the third installment is the worst of the bunch.It started out OK, the blowing-up-of-the-aunt part was pretty funny, and the Jamacian shrunken head was pretty cool. The first thing that made me think poorly of this movie was the fact that they BUTCHERED it. Just so that they can fit it in under two and a half hours, they decided to just go along like Lance Armstrong on speed. There are so many parts that were in the novel and left out in the movie.I think that I first started to get irritated was during the Shrieking Shack scene (with Black and Lupin and Pettigrew). That scene in the novel is crucial to the plot because they explain everything in detail. But in this movie, they cut the scene to seven minutes, which left the following sequence of events: Harry tackles Black, Lupin arrives, Snape arrives, Snape gets knocked cold, Lupin reveals Pittegrew. The next thing I know, they're outside the tree again! The only thing they explained was, "Scabbers is Peter Pittegrew, and HE'S the one that killed Harry's parents." They don't explain the Wormtail/Moody/Padfoot/Prongs deal. In fact, the only reference that you get that Harry's dad palled around with Lupin and Black was when Harry said, "My dad wouldn't want his two best friends to become killers." And it's so subtle that I almost missed it.There's more, but I'm pressed for space so I'll skip to the end: all of a sudden, the forgotten Firebolt now weaves its way into the movie. I think it ended up in the end because during the final days of shooting, the director peeked into the novels and said, "Oh, crud, Harry flies again and his broom is smashed to bits." The Firebolt was a last-minute shot and lasted under a minute. Not gonna win any awards there. And the last shot of the movie was Harry on the broom screaming' his brains out in a cheesy let's-all-jump-and-freeze-the-frame-to-end-the-movie-shot. No.The only reason that this movie got the three points is because it had some good special effects and CGI (I loved the tree whacking the dove though). In short, if you want to see what Harry's doing, read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleased,touched with slight disappointments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An eagerly awaited treat to be treasured in the collection. Partly because of what it is;- the third film of the most exciting "children's" story in modern times and therefore a must have if you are following the adventure. (I am 46 but that is not old for a child........) A fabulous book needs a fabulous film to re-create it perfectly, a very difficult job. But then, if you are eagerly following as I am, there were slight disappointments. Unavoidable as it is, I feel Michael Gambon is only a substitute Dumbledore, not the real thing. Not his fault, it would have worked fine if he had been in from the start, it is the sad fact that he had to pick up where others left off. If only he had stuck with his own wonderful speaking voice and not used an Irish accent the exchange might not have been so noticeable. Other differences stood out rather glaringly, the alteration in position for Hagrid's shack gave us all a jolt. My friends and I felt there was rather too much attention to scene setting at the expense of the plot - why could we not have been told who Messrs Mooney, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs were, for instance? Why did not the children meet up with Dumbledore inside the infirmary to be locked in so no suspicion could fall on them? We felt it was obvious that there was a new director, understandable that he wanted to do it in his own way but this is one episode in a complete story, isn't it? A friend who had not read the book found the plot quite confusing and the sequences rather staccato, the story did not flow for them. However, to put things back into perspective, it was a triumph of organisation and thrilling special effects. Buckbeak was simply perfect. Lupin and his transformation were excellent. All the great names were as wonderful as ever and I shall be watching this film over and over again - along with the others of course, and I confess that so far, I think I prefer them in their own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what about the plot holes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was the best of the series so far, until it got to the "back in time" sequence, when Harry and Hermione try to save the day. Now, let's see: I hate it when a film leaves interesting questions unanswered, or worse, forgets about them on the way. 1. How did Sirius escape from Azkaban and tricked the dormentors? (I hope that's what they're called :) 2. Indeed, Harry has a point towards the end of the movie: nothing is changed with Sirius's escape. Everybody would think he's a murderer who managed to flee. The truth that the 3 little wizards and us know about Sirius is still unknown to the rest of the world (fictional one, that is). 3. And now, here comes the best one, which i think has to do with the way the screenwriters and the director understand the notion of TIME. Or it's sheer stupidity... Let's say that the action of the movie, the way we see it, is a perpetuous present. When Harry and Hermione mess with the time artifact, they go back in the past to modify the future. The problem is some actions we see in the present (the stones thrown in Hagrid's hut, Hermione calling the werewolf, Harry performing the superspell) are coming from the future (the moment when Harry goes back in time comes after those three moments mentioned above, therefore it is the future on the axis of time). What I mean is this: how could the characters hear the stones, the werewolf shout, or see the spell, if these actions never took place? They will take place in the future (of course, by going back in time) It's a little bit tricky and maybe i don't make it clear, but this is a huge plot hole. Maybe someone else tries to explain this better than I? Or at least is there somebody out here who agrees with me?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rowling's books, given their references to: English boarding schools; the problems of life in (apparently mundane and, at times, abusive) suburban and middle-class English life; the acquisition of knowledge regardless of cost; the shifting and unreliable input of adults per se; and, surely, the need for a child to believe in the sanctity of missing parent(s), were always going to be problematic when transferred to the "big/silver screen".Well, three films later, Alfonso Cuaron (sorry about the lack of diacritical mark) has fulfilled the promise! There has ever been a darker side to the texts and, finally, it has come to the fore. Cuaron has not lost the thread of the first two episodes - rather he has added to what at the moment, promises to become a remarkable teratology. And, of course, there is more to come from Rowling's pen.Steven Kloves has written a superb screenplay. The CGI and cinematography are, as usual, excellent: as is the casting.On a different note, there is, perhaps, too little attention given to the subtexts contained within Rowling's work. And, as mentioned in the opening paragraph, they seem specifically English. Obviously, with regard to publication of the books, this is not the case: translations and the move "across the pond" are reaping enormous awards. Regardless of this success, how do the films cross cultural barriers and appeal to children across the globe? Within reason, they don't.If there is a third-world audience of children (the US "M" classification and individual governance's may, in effect, ban them from seeing the film) they will, perhaps, understand only the references to magic.(In New Guinea, in 1974, "Easy Rider" was screened, for us, as Australian soldiers, on a bedsheet outside a tent. The interested indigenous people [viewing it from the obverse] were mesmerised - but only by the music and cinematography. None of them understood English and therefore the text. Oh, dear. They probably think, to this day, that slurred and misunderstood dialogue is "the way to go".) The appeal of the books AND the films can only be understood within the contexts of either an elite (yes, I know, diacritics) class who can attend boarding-schools, or those granted scholarships to attend same. Surely, this is the reason for the delineated antagonism between Draco, Potter et al. The notion that old money will buy a place in the "academy" (Draco), is offset by Potter (granted a scholarship), Hermione (innate esoteric intelligence), and Ron (perhaps second-banana to Harry) who also is there because his impoverished family has a "free ticket-to-ride". The only way that the reader/audience GAINS insights into these protagonists' characters is how they react to, and combine with, Harry.In some ways, the books/films are a "rite-de-passage". As the central characters gain knowledge, they also (perhaps) become world-weary. At the same time, however, their inter reaction with an unusual and magical world never ceases to delight. Like us, really.When is the bus due? There's something stirring in the bushes... Something wicked this way comes and it ain't a bad dream...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A HUGE Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the Harry Potter books, and I was thrilled with the first two movies. Except for Fawkes, who looks like a musclebound chicken, I thought that the producers had done an amazing job of bringing JK Rowling's vision to the screen. Ieagerly awaited the Prisoner of Azkaban, missed seeing it in the theaters, and finally saw it at home. The best thing I can say about it is that I didn't waste my time and money at the theater. The look of the movie was dark and dreary,which was bad enough, but the children were not in their robes, which wasmuch worse. They looked out of place in their street clothes, especially inside the castle. They didn't wear Muggle clothes to Hogwarts in the first two movies. Why the change? What really ruined the movie for me was the hectic pace andthe holes in the script. The third book had a lot of slow spots where thecharacters just talked-about the past, about Sirius and his relationship with the Potters, about Peter Pettigrew. There was very little explanation in this film. If you read the book you knew what was going on, but if you didn't you were left guessing about a lot of things. I particularly missed Sirius lengthy explanation of his actions after the Potters were killed, and I was surprised that with so many special effects they couldn't squeeze in the picture of Sirius as best man at James' and Lily's wedding. Without Sirius talking to Harry about what reallyhappened, Harry's sudden warming to him seemed forced and unnatural, andwithout explaining what Sirius had done to Snape, Snape still seems like an evil person who doesn't belong at Hogwarts. The bottom line? The characterslooked out of place in their street clothes and with all the holes in the script, they were either operating in the dark or using telepathy. I am looking forward to Rowling's next book, but I doubt I'll be very excited when the next movie comes out.</fullReview>

This movie was written where it left out so much from the book that people who have not read the book could not possible have a clue about all that is going in the story. I was expecting some of the things to be missing but they completely rearranged some events! The actors where not dressed to represent the way they are written in the book. I believe the first two movies did a whole lot better at staying with the book and getting to the point than this one. If the fourth one does not improve I might stop buying the series. I understand that you have to leave out somethings but not adding some of the facts left viewers who had not seen the book totally lost and confused. I will say they did a good job on the creatures on this one. If you had to cut things why not the visit to the town. Not the information about James Potter and how Black and the others fit into the puzzle. You started the movie fine but after getting to school things started going down hill. Why not have Mr. Weasly tell Harry about the secret keeper; Black, Petter, and the others being friends; at the end you could of have the teacher tell Harry what his father and his other friends did for him while they where at school and what their nicknames where. At least this would of filled in some of the missing information that is vitial to understand how the Potter family was betrade and why he seen the vision he did at the lake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>hp 3 is the best book in the series, and the movie does not fail to please. it is the best movie thus far, although i believe that the fourth movie will be much better. first: the good. the good things about HP: POA is that the acting is excellent. dan radcliffe is one of the best young actors around, as is emma watson, who is turning into a very pretty young girl, and tom felton is a great actor as a baddie here. the chemistry between the big three (radcliffe, grint, watson) is fantastic. they look like they're the best of friends in real life, and they probably are. Now the bad: this movie is too short. alfonso cuaron destroyed the purpose of the book, altered happenings in the movie or moved the events to different points than they were in the movie. this is the only fault i have of this movie. it's a great one. 9/10 a sure cliffhanger till the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited about this movies. I love the 3rd book of the series and the saga in general, I love the first two movies and so I was very eager to watch this movie. I expected from it to be great. But it was even better than expected. The new director, Alfonso Quaron created a new cool vision of the movie and the result was fascinating - the 3rd movie about Harry Potter looks even better than it's predecessors! Also the kids are playing their characters better and better, Daniel Radcliffe won my sincerest admiration as Harry Potter. The special effects are spectacular, especially the Dementors, which are, in my opinion, one of the coolest monsters in cinema. The film was also very touching, I almost cried in some parts and I'm quite old for this sort of things - 20 years. The movie was much quicker than the previous installments as action, but still, it tells the story from the book very well. I think that the part withSPOILER the time travel was better explained in the film, than in the book.END OF SPOILER In general, it is the best Harry Potter movie so far and my all-time favourite film. I can't wait for the next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly magical movie experience! *may contain spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third installment of both the Harry Potter movies, as well as the books written by acclaimed author J.K. Rowling. This movie was directed by Alfonso Cuaron, whereas the first two films were directed by Chris Columbus, and I find there is quite a bit of a difference--a very good one.Upon entering their third year at Hogwarts, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, who is amazing in this film), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson), the trio finds out that there is a wizard by the name of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from the wizard prison of Azkaban. He is legendary as he once killed thirteen muggles in a city street with a single curse.This movie proves to be the darkest of the three in both the atmosphere, but also the content. The group of kids behind me in the theatre were crying when the dementors came on screen! The dementors are, of course, the guards of Azkaban prison, and as such need to be terrifying and powerful. The cinematographers did a wonderful job at creating the dementors; they're just as I pictured them to be. They're quite similar to the ring wraiths in Lord of the Rings, only you get to see a bit more detail when the souls get sucked from the victims.Some of the new characters in the film are Professor Trelawney (brilliantly cast by a batty Emma Thompson), Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), and of course, replacing the late and beloved Richard Harris is Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore. Gambon does a good job, giving Dumbledore a slightly more mysterious air about him, but he is still no Harris.Among the greatest achievements in this film have got to be the scenes where Harry flies Buckbeak the hippogriff, the scenes where the dementors swoop in on Harry in big groups, and the Knight Bus was truly entertaining, as well as its driver, Ernie Prang (Jimmy Gardner), a pimply-faced wizard by the name Stan Shunpike (Lee Ingleby), and the very amusing Shrunken Head, voiced by Lenny Henry.Over all, if you want to see action, good acting, amazing special effects, and a good, imaginative story all rolled up into one, go see this one-hundred-forty-one minute movie. It's sure to please!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this is the best 'Harry Potter'-film yet. The story is better, especially the ending, and the characters are really growing up in this one. 'Azkaban' is darker, scarier than the first two, making it more a grown up film. What also helps for that is director Alfonso Cuarón, known from the terrific 'Y Tu Mamá También', who gives the film a better look. The cinematography is more "European", if you can say that, and for me that makes the film better.The only point of critique I have has to do with my comments above. The movie feels more mature, a good thing since the book was pretty dark as well, but I feel younger children should enjoy films like this. I guess there are some scenes here that are not very suitable for the kids. Still, the best entry in the series, a highly enjoyable movie!</fullReview>

I thought it lacked originality in to many places to be considered a 'masterpiece' but I know very little about literature so my argument is limited!This film was too long and pretentious with a cast full of second rate kid actors and money grabbing actors on auto-pilot or desperate for big screen television actors. YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT!The scene where they literally replay a previous scene when they go back in time couldn't have been made faster as we all caught on of the story by the time it concluded!

		<shortDescription>Darker but still magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this third installment of the Harry Potter series doesn't quite match the magic of the first, it's because - well, this is a sequel, and the 'magic" no longer surprises quite as much. While it has to be selective due to the fact the novels progressively get longer, this production remains faithful to the book. Alfonso Cuaron as the new series director has been given credit for adding a more substantive darker side and concentrating a bit less on special effects. Regarding the former, the material itself calls for a more grown-up story: the kid characters along with the actors are maturing, and their coming into full-fledged adolescence demands sterner character. There are humorous scenes, but the general tone is more serious, as in fact it must needs be, and Daniel Radcliffe, for one, shows himself quite capable of serious acting as Harry continues to discover his identity. And isn't that Eriksonian quest of youth in fact the real theme of Rowling's series? It looks like most of the cast will be back for the fourth installment: we'll get to see them grow up at least once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like almost half this planet I am a Harry Potter fan and yes I did queue up outside a cinema on the day of release to see this film (despite the fact I was on holiday in France and had to behave like a true fan and sit through the French dubbed version before I could see it in English, just so I could see it on the day it came out)(Spoilers for non book readers)I found it much more enjoyable than the first two as although it did not stick as closely to the book as previously, it did flow much better and did not give the impression of random scenes from the book being placed in chronological order. Unlike, what it seems, most fans I did not object to the casting or to the fact that they gave away some of Ron's lines as I tried to see it from a film makers point of view. Although I did not agree with the changes they had made to Hermione's character as I found they had made her to socially adapt which was unnecessary. I found the moments that hinted a blossoming romance between two certain characters were well used as it seems that not all fans are picking up the book hints (don't ask me how).The film was reasonably well acted and it seems that Daniel Radcliff's acting talents are improving (gradually). Michael Gambon was well recast as Dumbledore. Gary Oldman was also great, despite the fact that his looks do not correspond to how I pictured Sirius as you really felt him change the character from raving azkaban escapee to loving godfather.Yes this film is darker than the other two, but then again the third book is darker than the first two so don't be surprised by that. I enjoyed it.8/10</fullReview>

It's clear that it's difficult to say at the tender age of 10-11 years if some kid will be able to act at all ?. Nevertheless, there are no excuses for letting a generally good actress entirely out of control. It was as if Mrs. Thompson played in a different movie. Thanks God there were also Allan Rickman, Gary Oldman and David Thwelis, so the movie wasn't completely ruined.I join those who are missing Chris Columbus and wondering what the fourth part will look like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's really necessary that you've seen the previous Harry Potter - Movies to like this one. I did not - and during the whole film I had the feeling that this Movie was full of allusions and references to Harry Potter Part 1 and 2. Frequently there were scenes in the cinema, when the complete audience (the average age was something between 13 and 16 years, many of them "Potter-fans") was laughing and screaming. The complete audience - except of me. Am I to old (22) for such kind of movie? Am I to serious? If yes, why do I like "Lord of the rings" and other fantasy stuff that much? So better read the book(s) or watch the previous movies to enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Past Pitiful Performance Repeated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one word, the first two installments of the HP series sucked. In two words, they EXTREMELY sucked. And that's not an understatement. I lost faith in the movies being as great as the books.Now that they got a new director, Cuaron, I thought, hey, he might make it better. So I watched it.10 minutes into the movie I thought "Past performance repeated". 20 minutes into the movie I popped up my CD Player and listened to music instead.The acting is VERY bad. And, excuse me fangirls, but Daniel Radcliffe does not know how to act. The best thing that happened to Harry Potter is Rupert Grint.Its not as even as funny as the book. They made all the funny parts extremely lame. The funniest part was at the beginning with the Dursleys. The rest was tedious.However, I congratulate Cuaron on 2 things: 1- He stuck to the story brilliantly. 2- He managed to make the movie darker and more mature.Overall VERY bad movie even if you're a fan. Don't know why it stays as #1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing I'd like to say is I'm a huge fan of the books and after viewing the movie more than once, I am so happy with the final product. Prisoner is my favorite book our of the whole series. To be honest, I read everyone's review of the movie before actually seeing it and the basic message I got was to enjoy the movie as a movie and leave out all comparisons from the book. This worked and made me enjoy the movie.*On Acting* There were so many things to be happy about. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson did an excellent job portraying Harry, Ron and Hermione. They were better this time around than in Sorcerer's Stone or Chamber of Secrets. I could feel the angst coming from Harry. I was surprised and glad with Radcliffe's screaming "He was their friend!" scene. Superb acting from David Thewliss and Gary Oldman - they nailed their parts down. Sirius's speech in the Shrieking shack was intense. I was glad the new Dumbledore was a little more "mad" this time round. Alan Rickman's Snape of course was true to form. If given a chance to show how unfair Snape really is in the books on screen, the audience will probably hate the character even more. Emma Thompson as Professor Trewlawney was perfect. Loved it.*On Directing* Enjoyed the directing. I was left with distinct images - the frozen and dying flowers as dementors passed, the transitions between scenes and the like. I liked the new look of Hogwarts even though it wasn't what I initially imagined when I read the books.On whole, the movie was a lot better than the first two with the directing and improved acting of the main characters. The special effects were average. I was glad everyone was using their wands for light. I was not exactly impressed with the Patronus and I thought the werewolf could have been done better. Perhaps I'm just spoiled with fantastic special effects from Lord of The Rings.I give the movie thumbs up. Looking forward to owning this on DVD as well as the 6th book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our favorite book turned into a freakin soap opera...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third movie, whether being ravaged by a new director or simply dressed up by Hollywood, was a total let-down. How many of us Harry Potter fans walked out of the movie theater with either a frown or a nasty glare?! The movie seemed to lack a great deal of what the book is based on--magic. The kids were mostly pictured in normal street clothing instead of robes, and the usual air of mystery and fantasy was completely absent. I felt that the story itself didn't change all that much (it was pretty accurate), but the key minute details just weren't there. It was too modern and there was too much of an effort to make Harry and his peers mainstream and modern. The book is based on a world far removed from our own; why did the producers/director try to capture an average high school with wands and freaky creatures? We don't read the books in hopes of seeing another representation of our reality. We read them because the magic, mystery, and adventure captivates us. The dementors, hypogriffs, and animagi were great, but they just weren't enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie that Potter fans will enjoy but it is not up to the level of the previous two. Less time is spent with the adults and there is considerably less magic by everyone except Harry. Richard Harris' replacement seems lost in his role; is he wise or lost in the school? The answer isn't clear and I wasn't sure if I even wanted to spend the time seeking the answer. The plot line is razor thin and the climax is a mere bump in the storyline. Lots of surprises as to why the second week ticket sales drops so sharply. Funny thing was is that I wasn't surprised as all. One can only hope this movie is a segway to something greater else this series has run its course. One last note, you can tell how much everyone has grown up since the last movie. Unfortunately, many of the classmates are not present in the background. Mr. Longshaft was good in the first two movies but is both absent and not even mentioned in the third.</fullReview>

Having read the comments from "movie specialist" and critics in papers and on various TV-channels I had really high expectations - but I was let down. Why? Because although the movie had much better acting skills (at least from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint I was grieved to see Emma Thompsons characterization of professor Trelawney. Not good enough by a long shot. The editing was so so. The direction was probably very good from a movie technical point of view - but ...and it is a very big BUT:The film was not by a mile dark enough. The film was not by a hundred miles long enough. And the details were to scarce to get a real idea of the story.A personal message to Alfonso Cuaron? Make an extended version. At least 45 minutes longer. And the next time, if possible - make the werewolf believable. It was also a shock to see that the grounds of Hogwarts had changed as much as it had. Too much. This is lack of respect for those who've watched the first two movies. Continuity is vital. Even in such small matters. And it is vital to put further details in the plot... there is so much more to get from it than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the first two potter movies. They had poor acting from the kids, and mediocre plots, but they were visually entertaining and there was a silly adventure that you could follow and be entertained by. This movie was terrible. The child actors are better now, however, considering the depths of badness they started from their new levels are nowhere near "good". The movie was visually interesting with the fades, but otherwise had lost it's "magical" appearance that was so appealing in the other movies. I can honestly say that there wasn't a single moment in this film that I wasn't bored or wondering when it will all end. Finally, the plot can be summarized in one word: pointless. What is really bad is that movie franchizes like this will make money no matter what. We're all going to go see it regardless and it will send all the wrong messages to the producers and studio. If you are a purist and have more self-control than I did, don't go see this movie, make a statement! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This will be the definitive review for the movie.When doing a movie based on a book, you should make the movie follow the book as close as possible. granted you can not put everything in the book in a movie, but you do have to remember that a movie should and DOES tell a story. 4 crucial points which are VERY important to this movie being part of a 7 part series. A movie is plot, dialog, shooting, editing, wardrobe, scenery and most importantly supposed to stand alone. The first 2 movies by Chris do that. People say they were long, boring, and had no imagination. BUT they were the best movies made from a book. ( except LOTR and silence of the lambs )1. Who are the marauders? What is their importance in the next 4 movies? 2. Who is Prongs? what role does he play? 3. Why is hermonie's 'cat' important ? 4. who are cedric diggory and cho chang?Watching the movie, those will be things you can NOT answer. Being a reader of the books, you can. Why is this important? because they ALL play BIG ROLES in the next 2 movies!!The movie was sliced, diced, and minced. It looked like a stage play. or a rehearsal for a movie that wasn't finished. The edits were bad, the camera shook.It was a great creative art film, with great actors, and a nice LOOSE interpretation of the book. But as far as i am concerned, not a movie that should be considered part of the series. ( kind of like the second parts to the Wizard of Oz, or Gone with the Wind...LOL)P.S. - noticed the quotes around the word 'cat'... HINT! HINT! Do yourself a favor and read the books if you want to know how much you REALLY MISSED, and well as the director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The darkest of the bunch...and the best, so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS)Amazing what happens to a franchise when a talented director takes over. Instead of a Hollywood hack taking the directorial reins yet again, this time the film was given to Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón, whose films include the brilliant "Y tu mamá también" (2001) and the under-rated "A Little Princess" (1995).What refreshing about "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is that Cuarón does not dumb down the story. As Harry and his friends mature, so does the story.The film begins with the customary scene at the Dursleys, where the story stretches to get laughs. But then the film takes a good turn when Harry leaves his relatives' home and Cuarón laces the rest of the story with a sense of dread throughout. Even the game of quiddich, which thankfully is brief, no longer has that playful, colorful aura about it. This time it occurs during a rainstorm and remains dark and dangerous.Hogwarts, too, has changed. For the better. Now, you get the feeling that danger lurks everywhere, that something terrible might indeed happen when we least expect it. And that's the fun of this film.The three main actors - Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint - have matured well, though I doubt they'll be around for Harry Potter's seventh installment. They might look too old for the parts then. But, for now, they're fine. The surprise is young Miss Watson, who is blossoming into a terrific actress. Her Hermione has spunk and proves a fine role model. It's fun watching Miss Watson take control of her scenes. Once she's done with the Harry Potter series, there's little doubt a rewarding acting career as an adult awaits her.The supporting cast does a fine job, too. Michael Gambon slips nicely into the role of Albus Dumbledore and David Thewlis (as Lupin) always is fun to watch. Gary Oldman relishes every moment on screen as Sirius Black, but it's a pity we don't see enough of him. In fact, the same could be said of the great Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman (surely screenwriter Steve Kloves, who is one of the best in the business - if you doubt it, see "Flesh and Bone" and "The Fabulous Baker Boys" - could give Prof. Severus Snape more scenes.), Emma Thompson and Julie Christie, whose appearance is too brief for such a radiant actress.Some scenes seem superfluous, especially a CGI werewolf-wolf battle that seems to be from another movie. This must be the year for computer-generated wolves - we've seen them in "Van Helsing," "The Day After Tomorrow" and now this film. The scene isn't needed because it comes at a time when the plot should focus more on Sirius. Though I liked the CGI tree, especially when it shakes off some snow and the snow hits the camera lens."Harry Potter" is an international phenomenon and it matters little what critics say. J.K. Rowling should be commended for creating characters that children (and adults) the world over adore. And anyone who can get kids nowadays to read a 1,000-page book deserves to be championed.Cuarón was ideal for this film. He's taken a mature approach to the story and gives us a beautiful, entertaining and enjoyable film. It might be a bit too dark for very young children, but anyone older than 12 should thoroughly enjoy this film. Under Cuarón's direction, the film is creepier, more sinister, sophisticated and fresh. And that's always a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a mishmash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third film in the Harry Potter film series, based on the book series, this time with a new director on board... with mixed results. While the first two films were visualy stunning I had found them to be a tad on the dull side with too much of the books adapted and too many somewhat dull scenes.. however this one seems to have gone the opposite route.. this film seems somewhat rushed, as though we are missing storylines.. things seemed to move too fast to have much of an impact and many of the characters, particularly the adult ones, seemed to filter in and out with little development.. Someone who missed the first two chapters and then checked in for this one would be completly lost. Not that this one is without its merits, the kid actors are developing into decent thespians and growing with their roles, and I did apreciate the slightly darker tone that this version took.. but the storyline just seemed to lurch along too much without satisfying resolutions.. they really need to kinda split the difference on the next installment. GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting visuals that fail to make up for poor Storytelling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off the VISUAL STYLE of this film was very artistic and dark. It went in a new direction that tossed aside the established world of wonder that Chris Columbus set us up with in the first two films. In some ways this is good, in others distracting and uncomfortable. Visual effects aside THE STORY exposition presents many problems for this film. What we have come to see is the story of these teenagers and their conflicts, climaxes and resolutions. In this film their is little of that.While Cuaran says that he wants to emphasize the feels of conflict inside these teenagers, he manages to gloss over it. From the onset of the film we begin with quick forced plot points given as fast as possible with no time to breathe. Sometimes its a good idea to stop and let the audience feel what is happening inside these people. That said, there was not enough exposition to cover the story. Cuaran touches on things and lets them die without embellishing on them at all. Columbus never let that happen. In this film we simply find no follow through. The film needed to be longer.SPOILERS We start at the Dursleys and without any preamble we are introduced to Aunt Marge. We know nothing of the relationship between her and Harry and we know nothing about why he despises her. After he gets angry and blows her up, he flees into the night. Here we have no sense of why he is worried about what he has done. He wanders out and is taken by Knightbus to The Leaky Cauldron during this time he learns of Sirius Black. Good moments of time spent on Diagon Ally are tossed out, and after this it is off to Hogwarts. On the train we are introduced to the dementors and Professor Lupin, played by Thewlis who has a certain warmth to him that you attach to.At Hogwarts we see Dumbledore again, this time of course played by Michael Gambon. Gambon has a certain batty and stern but humorous sense about him, but very much lacks any of the wistfulness that Harris brought to the part. Throughout the next forty or so minutes. The Hogwarts year passes by completely. This is far to short too cover all that needs to be covered before Harry meets Sirius at the end. We are briefly introduced to Lupin's teaching methods and Harry's fear of the Dementors. The subject of Harry's parents and their connection to Lupin, Sirius and Pettigrew is barely touched. Harry's desire to go to Hogsmead is not well supported, as his permission slip requirements are not truly discussed in the beginning of the film. Harry plays Quidditch only once and falls off his broom which is destroyed. He gets the Marauder's Map from Fred and George. The map is well done but is hardly seen. He goes into town and McGonagall conveniently divulges the facts on Sirius and his relation to the Potters. This whole scene is forced and way too quick to really let it sink in. There are several scenes where Lupin and Harry are for some reason walking though the grounds and Harry expresses his need to learn the Patronus Charm. After one session however he has it down. He also sees Pettigrew on the map well ahead of the scene in the Shak and it makes the ending less interesting. Hagrid only has one class that we see, the Buckbeak scene. After this Buckbeak is sentenced. At no time do we really see Hagrid distraught like we have in the past. So you never truly care for the Hippogriff. Twelawny's class is only seen twice and each time not much is revealed. She never makes the predictions she should that set her up as a mystic and later a fraud. As we leave Buckbeak's supposed execution Sirius in dog form drags Ron and his rat off under the Williow. Here comes a quick anti-climactic scene where Sirius reveals himself and Lupin comes in to stop him, realizes who he is and embraces him. Of course at no point did they establish the friendship of Lupin and Black. Then Snape pops in for no apparent reason and tries to stop the lot of them. They stop snape reveal the rat and Harry decides spare him. Lupin is then transformed into a werewolf. Sirius shouts to ask if he has taken his potion. Of course we know nothing about any potion because this part between Snape and Lupin, which would also serve to explain why Snape was there, is completely left out. Pettigrew then gets away, Sirius chase Lupin off and Harry follows. There is a scene which is the dementors flocking down on Harry and Sirius, and then Harry thinks his father sends a Patronus charm to aid them. He awakes in the castle and Dumbledore indicates that Hermione must use a Timeturner to help them aid Buckbeak and Sirius, which they then do. At the end of the film Harry speaks briefly to Lupin, where instead of providing any explanation as to the map, or Pettigrew, he says he is proud of Harry and must leave the school. Then Harry goes down and receives his Firebolt. This is the same one that plays an important point in the book. However, Cuaran left out all of Christmas at Hogwarts and the Firebolt and its importance. Instead it is used to end the film with Harry flying into the air and a freeze frame of his smiling face fading to black. I hate to rant on a film, but this lacked any sense of a climax. In parts there was little to indicate true conflict or resolution and no explanation of key elements of the story. The directing loses its vision early on. It is funny yes, but a series of Ron's jokes and Hermione's right hooks don't make up for a serious breach of storytelling. My overall score is 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film style was a turn for the worse in Harry Potter. The filmquality was grainy. It looked like it was shot in the 80's.Taken as a whole it seems to miss the key concepts of the Harry Potterbooks. The books are a coming of age story. They are aboutfriendships. Somehow the movie completely forgot to develop thefriendships at all. The plot felt disjointed. There was no flow to the movie. It was likejumping around the book and reading a paragraph here and a paragraphthere but the dot's didn't connect. By comparison to the previous two HP films, this one strayed from beinga mystery suspense novel and instead was a 2 hour and 15 minute versionof the last 2 minutes of a Scooby Doo episode. Thoroughly disappointed. Bring back Columbus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Columbus left much to be desired, I despise what Cuaron has done to Azkaban. He cut WAY too much out of this movie. If one hasn't read the book, one could be lost. I won't object to a three hour movie. Let the story take up the time it needs. I hate the lighting. It is totally unnatural. The sets , while beautiful, are entirely different from the 1st two movies, and I disliked that. Hogwarts is supposed to be a home and refuge to Harry even when danger threatens. Here the Dursley's house looks more inviting. What is with all the muggle clothing. Different clothing is worn by the entire wizarding world. So why is everyone walking around in jeans?? I was just entirely put off by the set changes and the butchering done to the storyline. I hope that some others finally speak up and bring some sense to the reviews of this movie. The 1st two were by far superior movies, while Rowlings book was better than the 1st two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter is a sequence of stories beginning with Harry as a child, and then growing up. Nevertheless, it is a kids story, and this film lacks that kid element - unless we have demented kids running around.This particular story, The Prisoner of Azkaban, sets up Potter's mid-kid crisis so to say. He finds a friend of the family, but realises his own magical strength as a wizard. It's one of the most important stories in the series, but this film depicts a real dark side which I would never allow my kids to see. Columbus did a great job in the first two movies, endearing us to characters such as Weasley, Malfoy, Granger, Dumbledore, Snape, et al. This director's version made it all about Potter. One character can be a movie, but with the talented experienced theatrical actors such as Smith, Gambon, Rickman, and Thompson - they went to waste! Potter's father, if you read the books, was a slime bag - an arrogant man with an ego bigger than Aunt Marge. Sirius Black was his partner in crime, so birds of a feather flock together.Albeit it's a good series of reading, the movies need to bring some compassion of the characters, which the first two did. It'll be interesting to see how the next director does with Goblet of Fire.</fullReview>

I did not enjoy myself once sitting through it as it just drags on and on without an end. I felt like I was sitting through the first two all over again, it's the much alike in the story. The only part unique about this one than the other two was the cinematography/directing, which were both horrible. This movie was absolutely boring, although I didn't expect better coming from the books. Don't let your children see this mindless crap, it's awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my view "The Prisoner of Azkaban" is J K Rowling's best work. From what I had read, I expected that Alfonso Cuaron would scrap the "Hollywood" style and his film would reflect the darker nature of this story.He certainly did achieve that. The film was beautifully filmed and was genuinely eerie in places. His animation of the Hippogriff was fantastic - most believable.Of his actors - David Thewlis as Lupin was not as I pictured the character but did an admirable job. Gary Oldman as Sirius however was woefully under-used. Michael Gambon was an excellent replacement Dumbledore and all three central characters turned in fine performances.Nevertheless I left the cinema feeling disappointed. I had a feeling that the POA should have been a great film - but wasn't!! If I hadn't read the book, I think a number of scenes would have completely baffled me.My prime objection was that I felt I had just been watching a 4 hour film in Fast-forward mode. Every scene was pared to the bone and over in 90 seconds or less. With the exception of Harry, Hermione, Ron and Lupin all other characters were reduced to mere 3 line cameos.Also what happened to the continuity? - "The Leaky Cauldron", is now presided over by "Igor the Truly Terrible" and has been transported next to a railway terminus. A landslide has caused Hagrid's cottage to end up at the bottom of a hill. Lakes appeared to expand and contract from scene to scene.Because of Cuaron's mad rush to produce a shorter film from a much longer book, many essential plot items disappeared. Did I miss an explanation of the Marauders Mapmaker's names? That surely was essential to the story. Harry needs to know this to believe his father saved him by using a Stag Patronus. Another key element of the book was Hermione's need to obtain the Time Turner so she should get to all her lessons. The film barely touched on Hermione's impossible school timetable.Obviously a scriptwriter's job must be to condense - but I felt the essential feel of the book was lost somewhere in the translation. With this in mind, I am certainly not looking forward to seeing any slimmed-down version of the next couple of books. I might just give their films a miss.I hope that the distributors will follow the LOTR example and the fully-extended 4 hour version of this film will shortly be available on DVD.Score 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cuaron and company rise this to the level of near pop-art; Harry Potter moving on up in style and substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first two Harry Potter movies, Chris Columbus waived his director's seat and after some searing Alfonso Cuaron stepped in. It's an interesting choice, as he had only done one 'family-friendly' film before (A Little Princess), and had just finished an NC-17 film the excellent Y Tu Mama Tambien. Although I've yet to read 'Azkaban' or any of the books, from what I've heard from those that have it's a book that doesn't seem to be really progressing too much in terms of a 100% engaging 'plot'. We're only learning so much about Potter's lineage, and mostly through the element of Sirius Black, who has escaped from Azkaban prison and has his sights set after Potter to avenge the "dark lord." But through this set-up, Cuaron does the most extraordinary things, surpassing Columbus's big-epic aspirations and making it...still epic, yes, but with a more ambitious scop in directorial style. Even when things get at their most conventional, there's a full sense of balancing whimsy and true dark intonations. I loved how he and the visual effects crew dealt with the Dementors, the shape shifters who act as a double-edged sword with Hogwarts and Potter. I haven't seen the film in a while, but I still remember so clearly many scenes and shots, and how the filmmaker this time really brings on a strong presence that actually, if anything, enriches the material of the book.There's other small pleasures as well: Emma Thompson wonderfully plays a scatter-shot professor who looks like she could get lost in a grocery store; the beginning scenes, where the pig-headed family that's taken in Harry all this time getting their just desserts; the Quiddich battle, which ends up being a little unexpected in some ways, and is actually much ahead in suspense than in even the first film, which introduced the whole bloody concept; the acting by David Thewlis, usually known for more idiosyncratic character roles in movies indie and mainstream, who despite all appearances is also ambiguous. Best of all is Oldman as Sirius Black, and for the brief moments he's on screen (and, to be sure, how sentimental the dialog veers towards when he and Potter sit down for a talk on the roof), the screen does the clichéd move of "lighting up". Just the poster image alone, with "have you seen this man" is ominous, even as there is almost the feeling that he isn't quite as evil as might be let on. The levels of darkness in the film are upped a bit- this is the first time that the Harry Potter series has to get a little more mature, even still on "family-friendly" terms- and cast and crew are up completely to the challenge.In fact, this might still be my favorite of the Potter films (Order of Phoenix close second), as it does capture the levels of wonder at such a concept that a wizard school offers, and expands further into the crevices of the psychologies of the characters and the possibilities of the identity of evil or good or what might be mixed around. 8.5/10</fullReview>

Who the heck are you kidding?? The similarities with the book I could count on one hand.Okay let's see what I would change...1. Who the heck needs that much angst in a movie based on the third book?? Try the fifth book and you'll still be way over it. THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT MUCH ANGST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! 2. Why the heck did we need that lame shrunken head. That was just stupid. Is there anyone who can say that they really liked the shrunken head?? It's like JarJar Binks from Episode 1: supposed to be funny, but just annoying.3. We need to know about Harry's past. That's one of the main plots throughout the books, and that much is kinda important in the fifth book to learn this stuff 4. When Disney's Jungle Book was made, the writer was expressly told not to read the book, just make the movie based off of "a boy raised by wolves who must return to a village." Did they do this with this movie too?? 5. The reason Crabbe isn't there is that he had to take exams. Couldn't they tape it another day?? How hard is that?? That being said, there is one thing I must commend Alfonso Cuaron for: duping a bunch of people into watching and/or buying this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a big fan of the third book, I had high expectations when I went to see this movie. Boy, was I ever disappointed! This movie has many flaws, but I'll name just a few.1. The werewolf was supposed to have hair and a tail, as it says clearly in the book.2. The dementors were not supposed to fly. Only float.3. The Firebolt that Harry received was given to him by Sirius. In the book, it was on Christmas. In the movie, it was the end of the year.4. The director failed to explain the Maruader's Map, like who wrote it, and the fact that Harry's father was one of them.5. Trelawney's prediction was not explained enough. Like that fact that it was her second prediction overall. This turns out to be important in the fifth book.6. The Knight Bus was not done the right way at all. (It wasn't supposed to squeeze through two vehicles.)7. In the book, Harry does not yell, "Expecto Patronum." 8. They didn't show the Quidditch Final, which Gryffindor won.9. The actor who played Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, was not right for the part.(See * below.) 10. Dumbledore should have talked to Harry more.Those are, like I said, only a few (*) I know that Richard Harris passed away in 2002, but someone else should have played Dumbledore. Michael Gambon just wasn't right.Like I said above, I loved the third book, but this film was my least favorite. I haven't seen the fourth movie, but I doubt it'll beat the second movie, which is my favorite one so far.Unless you're a die-hard fan, avoid this movie. If you must watch it, read the book first. Otherwwise, you'll be completely lost.My Score: 6/10.</fullReview>

I can not understand why Chris Columbus stopped directing. He was true to the story and the elements which are necessary to the plot. I disagree with putting the Hogwarts students int to "muggle" clothing. It takes away from the feel of the movie. Dressing differently is part of the whole package. They are not meant to be like "us".I found the acting improved. I think Emma Watson's acting has improved greatly, although a little over acted. Over all the actors were wonderful and did the best they could,considering what they had to work with.

		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuarón claims that the film didn't need to be 3-4hrs long; well I have to admit he may be correct; the only problem is he forgot to explain what the hell was going on?He said that a novel-to-screen adaptation is the Directors viewpoint on how to best tell the story. Well that's fine, but you still need to actually tell the story. Don't you? Not one person, who saw the film, without reading the books, understood what was going on half the time, and the few sub-plots he left in weren't explained in any way, shape or form that could be understood but an outside observer! So doesn't that contradict his whole Directors Viewpoint theory?Cuarón was just showing off his excellent film making skills (No I'm not being sarcastic!) and decided to say F*#K YOU to all the Big Name Hollywood Directors by making a Art-House style Blockbuster, which would have been great, if he had bothered to pay attention to the actual story, instead of just concentrating on all the stupid things he chose to shoot instead! Don't get me wrong they were amazing, but so much time consuming crap was put into the film, that could have been spent on, you know, Harry Potter instead of showing off to the world that he's an excellent director... WE KNOW YOU ARE MATE!

Things we were all looking forward to being brought to life on the big screen...And as if that wasn't bad enough, he convinced Mike Newell to make GOF (Which is the same size as books 1, 2 &amp; 3, combined) into a 2 1/2 hour movie!?!

		<fullReview>- Although I'm not in the target audience, I've read all of the Harry Potter books. I watched and enjoyed both of the first two Harry Potter movies. I have been waiting quit a while to finally get the chance to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I don't know when I've been more disappointed with a movie.- From the very start, the movie feels rushed. It's amazing that the longest of the Harry Potter books was turned into the shortest of the Harry Potter movies. There's just so much that's left out. Take Harry's crush on an older student, Cho Chang. This relationship is so important to the next book and she is not even mentioned in this installment. I realize that to include everything in the book would have meant a 6 hour movie, but to leave out plot points like this is unforgivable.- Unless your a fan of the books or have seen the first two movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban must be a very difficult movie to follow. I mean I've read the book twice and still had trouble keeping up with what was going on. Take the line spoken by one of Harry's teachers with no explanation, "Five points from Gryffindor!" I can just imagine someone asking themselves "Five Points? What Five Points?" or "Gryffindor? What the hell is a Gryffindor?" - I realize that my biggest complaint about the movie is something that is difficult to put into words, but (and excuse the pun) the magic is gone. I sat in wonderment of the magic power the first two movies had. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban didn't come close to giving me that same feeling. For the most part, it just left me cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Returns to Hogwarts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, brings the usual assorted hazards, challenges and life-threatening scrapes we've come to expect from this series. This time Potter is under threat from Sirius Black, an escapee from Azkaban Prison., who is apparently intent on murdering our hero and prematurely ending one of the most successful film series of all time. Along the way Harry must also face the frightening Dementor (the spectral guards of Azkaban Prison), get the better of Draco Malfoy, and save Hagrid's new pet from a sticky end.Harry Potter &amp; The Prisoner of Azkaban is as well-produced as its predecessors, and atmospherically (if gloomily) photographed by Michael Seresin, with the usual excellent set designs (by Stuart Craig), impressively-realised visual effects and another good score from John Williams. There's also the usual excellent supporting cast, and the roll-call of Potter cast members is approaching a who's-who of British acting talent. This time Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall, David Thewlis and Julie Christie join series regulars Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman and Julie Walters and others. If nothing else, these films are at least keeping half of Equity in employment.I have to admit to being a little disappointed with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which stuck too closely to the formula of the first film, but The Prisoner of Azkaban at least introduces some new elements in the plot department. As in the previous two films, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts master plays an important role in the story. This time, however, the plot is a bit less predictable, and the audience is kept guessing which side Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and some of the other characters are on. But there is also some evidence of sloppy writing, particularly with the "time turner" device, which is conveniently produced to save the day at one point.Of the new cast members, only David Thewlis really gets that much of a part. Gary Oldman is very under-used as the prisoner Sirius Black, and Julie Christie barely appears. Michael Gambon meanwhile, does a decent enough job as the late Richard Harris's replacement as Professor Dumbledore. Tom Felton (as Potter's schoolboy nemesis Draco Malfoy) is also improved. In the first couple of films he seemed hopelessly miscast, but this time the makers seem to have realised his portrayal of Malfoy is more snivelling than threatening, and he seems more convincing.A lot has been made of the frightening nature of some of the scenes in the film, particularly the Dementors. However, if you could take the hordes of giant spiders in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets you'll probably be fine here too. More to the point is whether children will really have the patience to sit through another two hour plus Harry Potter epic. Like its predecessors, The Prisoner of Azkaban could go with cutting by about 10-15 minutes and will seem long even for adult audiences. Sometimes these films have seemed a little too faithful and reverential to their source material, hence the impressive running times. As the books The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix are twice the length of their predecessors, the film-makers will have to lose their excessive caution and do some serious cutting and refashioning of the story if the next two films are to be a manageable length.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is said that all knowledge comes from introspection. If viewed from the original novel, the movie's screenplay is very incomplete. Given, it is a story about magic! But its explanations as to how many of its important events occurred are impoverished. First and foremost, Mr. Black's escape from the prison of Azkaban isn't explained. Nor is how Miss. Granger came to be in possession of a time-travel device called a time-turner. In retrospect, the primary theme of the entire movie amounted to the belief that Mr. Black wanted Potter dead. Moving on, the production of the film was very good. The special effects captured the events as I expect the writer Rowlings intended. The performance of the actors was sufficient, but not great. Well, whoever plays Granger is nearly as annoying as the fictional one in the original text. The guy who plays Snape is also nearly as creepy as the fictional one. The beginning of the film is excellent, and quite hilarious. It also seemed as if the entire story could have been told in a film three quarters as long, including the omissions as mentioned above. Overall, I give it a 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who needs to read the books now?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been unable to see or rent this DVD since its release, I was fortunate enough to obtain a copy for the first time last night. Wow! I've never read the books and now feel I never need to after watching the third and most challenging of the three films (I'd seen the other two and was so bowled over by the plots, CGI and acting of the hundred or more central characters that I didn't feel I was worthy enough of being able to endure a third, classic, masterpiece).It would be too easy to comment on the obvious effort the two lads and ladette put into their performances; I'm sure their special acting talents and line delivery have been mentioned in many woodworking manuals since the film was made. And what about the amazing score? I was humming it when I went to bed and found I was asleep in no-time! The Hippo Griff character rocked. One almost couldn't tell that they'd been able to recycle a pantomime horse and make it look like a different pantomime horse to the one they originally hired. Why weren't the actors inside it credited? That's scandalous! Following the plot was exciting too. It reminded me of being lost in a department store when I was a small child (though you'll be relieved to know I didn't blub this time). Such nostalgia.I just have one small criticism though. Maybe it would be wise to get someone like Tarantino to direct the next one. That scene where the pantomime horse was beheaded; I rest my case.All in all, a roller-coaster of a ride, a maze of intrigue and wonder, a plot that really made me want to rush out and buy-the-book(s); sorry, it had or did none of these things for me. What it highlighted, however, was the realisation that one never really stops the need for anger management and that my constant desire to slap the irritating Herm-My-On-Knee, poke the eyes of that strange and ugly Weezlie thing (what was that anyway; it certainly wasn't human?) and shouting optical, fashion advice to the Harri Porter character (doesen't he know about contact lenses?) kept me on the edge of my seat when I woke up just before the credits.Oh yes, wonderful performance by Emma Thompson by the way; reminded me of, now what was it, oh yes, Emma Thompson in thick spectacles.Can't wait for the next one. Really I can't.</fullReview>

Besides, they are jumping around in the movie, without a good explanation of the story. (it was not told who did make the map with the secret rooms ). Last but not least, in almost all the movie, the characters are wearing normal clothing If the next movie will continue like that, it will destroy the secret of harry potter itself.

		<shortDescription>A second rate film to a first rate book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is unfortunately disappointing in more then one way. Firstly everything in this film seems to be slightly rushed. it doesn't give you enough time for anything to sink in, although some people may like it to be fast paced this is still about a schoolboy; a schoolboy that goes to a school of witchcraft and wizards but still a schoolboy. many of the details which make the story so unique and interesting suffer because of this. For example the hatch in the ceiling to professor trelawney's class (i think the name is right) is no longer there with the ladder, just a boring door.. The fat lady's portrait being replaced with the annoying short knight is no longer there either. it doesn't even explain WHY the gryffindor students are sleeping in the great hall fully making it just seem plain random. The failed patronus spells don't come out as whisps of silvery smoke, they come out as what looks like a silvery disc. Sirius black just didn't seem right, the movement from fighting to deep emotional conversation cut from each other too quickly to be believable. You don't get to see harry's fascination in the firebolt or the fact that he stayed in diagon ally for 2 weeks. Regarding film fluidity carrying on from the first two films: Hagrid's house seems to have changed its position (perhaps magically, but it says nothing about this in the book) Michael gambon does not have the same wise misty voice as Richard Harris had in playing the part of albus dumbledore which detracts from his character greatly. And the order of a lot of things are messed upI suggest to anyone wanting a good adventure to read the book, not watch this film. It makes me very sad to say this is not a good movie, especially since i payed near enough ?17 for the DVD to watch it - It doesn't tell enough of the story for new people, and it doesn't include enough of the important details for people that have already read the book. The film is jumpy with its scenes and does not allow you to take everything in.Perhaps what i imagined the images of the book to be formed better in my head then the film showed them. And for someone who would usually pay more to watch the film then read the book, that has to be saying something.I hope other people enjoy it better then i haven't.A sad disappointment with unnecessary changes from the book.It just doesn't do J.K. Rowling justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different but not necessarily better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third Harry Potter movie is different from the previous two movies. "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is darker and much more mature but not better than its predecessors.Yet again there are several things wrong with this Harry Potter movie. The movie starts of too slow with a completely wrong pace due to some poor editing. Once the movie really gets started you'll notice that there are several things different about this movie compared to the first two. No, I'm not just talking about the visual style or the fact that Harry and his friends are wearing 'normal' clothes, I'm mainly talking about the two things that I missed most in the movie; The humor and the adult cast. What made the first two Harry Potter movies excellent to watch was the perfect English adult cast with many big names. In "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" the adult cast is heavily underused. Gary Oldman who I normally love was way too plain and boring in this movie, I actually really wish now that he hadn't been in it. Odd thing is that they let the main adult character play by the fairly unknown actor David Thewlis. Micheal Gambon does his best but he really wasn't Dumbledore to me. Richard Harris scene's as Dumbledore always brought a smile on my face and I really enjoyed every scene with him, Gambon just plays the role very plain and I just couldn't like it...Problem is that the story takes itself too serious. The first two Harry Potter movies had a fun feeling especially between the three main characters and some good humor. In "Harry Potter the Prisoner of Azkaban" everything is far more serious and less fun. The story also gave me the feeling that it wasn't very original all. It seems like J.K. Rowling uses a bit too many parts and elements from different fantasy genres.Good news is that the special effects are looking great. Another great thing was that there were some nicely done acting sequence's such as the werewolf scene which I found quite good.It is still good entertainment, especially for children and the Potter fans, although the movie probably is too scary for the very young ones.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit rough around the edges, but it's still better than the other two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' opens with the young Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), under the covers of his bed, doing what most mischievous 13-year-old boys have done at some point or another in the dead of night (Reading! Sheesh!). We're amused to see that Harry's Uncle Vernon is too stupid to catch him (as the villain always is), and so the film begins!Harry, who always seems to get himself into trouble, doesn't disappoint us in this movie. He 'accidentally' blows up his Aunt Marge, and is now on the run from the Ministry of Magic, whom he is certain will expel him from Hogwarts. Harry decides to take the Knight Bus, a violently purple triple decker bus, to London to retrieve some coinage from his vault. Now, the Knight Bus was pretty cool... at first. However, it got old quickly, and the shrunken Jamaican head began to grind on my nerves within 30 seconds. The entire scene was dragged out much too long.While on the Bus, Harry is told all about Sirius Black, the dangerous murderer who escaped from Azkaban; a feat never before achieved. Harry quickly finds out from Daddy Weasley that Sirius is after him, but Harry isn't overly concerned. Why should he be? He's a teenager! It's an age- old tradition that we ignore the sensible advice of elders.Harry boards the train, but his pleasure soon turns into misery when the Dementors get on the train to check for Sirius Black. What are Dementors? Good question, and a difficult one to answer. They're faceless, they can fly, and they look scary. Enough said!This film in jammed- pack with action, excitement, and... love. Make way for the hormones, because Ron and Hermione have already begun to not- so- subtlety crush on one another. The full extent of their relationship in the books were arguments, which OF COURSE means they love each other (*rolls eyes*). In this film, however, they begin holding hands and hugging, and even their bickering is borderline- cute.The art direction in this film is fantastic. The exterior is completely different, yet more natural. You actually believe that the kids are at a bordering school in Scotland as you watch. It's rustic, yet colourful and alive. Cuaron pulled it off in a way that no other director could, ESPECIALLY Columbus. A particularly impression CGI was Buckbeak, a hippogriff. Buckbeak looked so real, I was tempted to believe that hippogriffs really DO exist, and somehow the crew managed to cage a wild one. The acting of all the children has greatly improved. Radcliffe, in particular, has taken strides. He had a few poorly done scenes, such as when he blew up Aunt Marge in the kitchen. Another one that comes to mind was the infamous 'crying scene,' which was the source of so much grief at many a message board. Word of Advice, Dan: If you can't cry, kindly as your make-up artist for some tear inducer! Honestly, kids were LAUGHING at him at the showing I went to! However, I can't just criticize. His body language and his entire approach to the character seemed much more natural in this movie, and so I applaud him!Two new actors joined the cast this year: Gary Oldman, as Sirius Black, and David Thewlis, as Harry's intelligent Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher. Both were extremely well- casted, ESPECIALLY Thewlis. In conclusion, this film was great. It is much better than the previous two, yet it still has its flaws. However, watch it for it's beautiful art direction and well- done CGI characters!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a good movie, it is a result of excellent marketing. The tricks and effects are good but then the best films would be about theater magicians and illusionists. Does not even worth renting. Most of the effects are a repetition of the previous ones. Hopefully, the probability of a Harry IV are very thin, thanks to the fact that everyone grows up, as in this movie the aging of faces and ideas clearly shows up. A hint to film lovers: A big part of the overall success of the Harry Potter phenomenon seems to be the absence of anything deep enough to think or debate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has no sparkle to it. The book which contains Oliver Wood's finest hour has hardly a mention of Quiddich when transferred to screen.The horrifying scene when Ron is attacked in his bed by a maddened Sirius seeking Scabbers/Pettigrew has been dispatched without a backward glance. The knife-slashed curtains have been abandoned as unimportant. Pettigrew never appeared on the Marauder's Map.Hagrid's hut across the lawns at the edge of the Dark Forest somehow manages to cling precariously to the side of a cliff. This will cause MAJOR problems when filming books four and five where important events happen at speed between the castle doors and Hagrid's hut.It must really have taken some doing to make Julie Christie look like a secretary - they couldn't have made Madame Rosemerta look less like a pub landlady if they'd tried. What happened to the 'sparkly high-heels'?! And - for heaven's sake - couldn't some middle ground have been found so that the children could have had a butterbeer in the pub instead of lurking in the doorway?! How are they going to set up the DA (Dumbledore's Army) in 'The Order of the Phoenix' in the 'Hog's Head'? That can't be tampered with - it's a vital part of the plot.And a word about casting - and for this I'm on a planet of my own! Gary Oldman is a wonderful, accomplished actor who puts his heart and soul into everything he does. But Sirius he isn't. Sirius was the last of a long line of aristocrats. He was outrageously goodlooking with easy, graceful manners and abundant self-confidence. Azkaban made him a nervous wreck but it didn't turn the Scarlet Pimpernel into Gary Oldman. It also worries me a bit how they're going to change the nerd in the Mirror of Erised into the Snitch-twirling, show-off James Potter who 'roolz the skool'!I agree that there was a need for a different approach from that Chris Columbus employed - Harry does need to grow up. But he needs to grow up 'magically'. There doesn't seem to be a lot of difference in approach between Uncle Vernon and some of the wizards in PoA the Movie. Lastly, special effects. Why ARE they so patchy in the HP movies? Buckbeak was stupendous - absolutely fantastic. Lupin's werewolf was abominable - it looked like something out of a cheap cartoon. The Dementors are, I think, a matter of opinion. They depend largely on what you saw in your head when you read the book. Personally, I would have found them far more threatening if they had been more like the 'Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come' in the old black and white version of 'Scrooge' (Alister Simm). Check it out if you're under 105 - it's gruesome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really cannot understand what's make so good to the critics this Harry Potter, it's the one of the worst movies I have seen this year (not so bad as Val Helsing). I know the cast and the acting is good, also is the soundtrack, but the story have nothing original and it's very predictable. Again we see Harry fighting VS the legacy of Voldemort who, as always, is trying to find a way to return. Only this time some new things of his past are revealed and a more sad Potter (but always the good guy, the same saint Potter of every book). Yeah, the story it's just a little more dark, with many monsters, but still too shallow, there's no real drama or realistic characters, as I said Potter is the same "perfect" good guy and the villains are always the baddest guys, for this reason he always receive special treatment (from the dumbledore and Hargrid, those who don't do it are the bad guys)to guarantee a forced happy ending, even when you know the next movie some little piece of the puzzle of Voldemort will appear. Some new elements have nothing new if you remember movies like Army of Darkness(the book of monsters) and the Frighteners(the dementors). I thought the end of the first movie was the worst I have seen in a film, but this one is the edge of stupidity. To those who want something more realistic and less shallow I recommend to read the masterpiece of Vertigo from DC comics "The Books of magic", and the Trilogy of books "The Passing of the Technomages", both have characters like Harry Potter, but the stories are very much better (in the trilogy of Technomage the first character have tragic past like Potter and even when is the hero of the story he never is well treated)</fullReview>

The changing of director was obvious! I say that Chris Colombus should have direct the 3rd movie too. Well at least, Alfonso Cuaron won't be there for the 4th so i hope it will be better. the positive side now.. (lol) when Lupin changed into a werewolf, i thought that was cool and scary! and..the dementors..when i read the books, i didn't imagine them like that but..they're still scary so, that's what matters. the main characters were still pretty good, and funny :) i still love HP despite of all those things and i'm looking forward to see the 4th movie !</fullReview>

We were both really disappointed.I understand that for length reasons they would have to condense some things and leave out others, but...There were a number of things that were not done right.The special effects were really good. Most were very believable, especially Buckbeak.They completely left out the parts about Harry, Hermione, and Ron helping Hagrid with the case of Buckbeak.They completely left out Christmas. Instead Harry doesn't get the Firebolt until the very end of the film. They also left out the part at the beginning where Harry goes and sees the Firebolt in Diagon Alley. They left out the Quidditch final. Shall I continue?They also added some things that were not even in the book. They added Harry seeing Peter Pettigrew on the map and going to find him in the school.Overall this was so far off from the book it is crazy. If we did not read the book right before going to see the movie we probably would have enjoyed the movie more. Since we did it was a total distraction.In summary things were left out, things were added, and things were re-arranged.A very disappointing movie for any Harry Potter fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My best friend got me started on the Harry Potter books, and I've read every one. The first two movies seemed pretty true to the book, but I felt this one left out some pretty important things. I understand that for a book as long as this they have to slim things down a bit to put it on film, I felt they slimed down too much. In the book you really felt the closeness Harry felt toward Sirrus, and the relationship that Sirrus, Lupin &amp; Peter had with his father, James. I didn't really feel a sense of either in the movie. As a matter of fact, all that was said in the movie was that they were friends of his parents. This book gave the reader an idea of how much Harry is like his father, the movie never does. My biggest pet peeve about this film though, is that at the end, when Harry does the spell to hold back the Dementors, they show the white stag, but never mention it. If the person watching didn't read the book they'll have no idea what that was or why it appeared. It was also never told why Sirrus, Peter, and James turned into animal forms or that James form was a white stag. Which is why Harry sees the stag during the spell. Over all, the movie was wonderful visually, but I was very disappointed in the story. I'm not too sure I'll go to see the next movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie me had me leaving the theater feeling disappointed and dissatisfied. The deviation from the book was such that there were gaping plot holes and the chronology was utterly destroyed. Many scenes that were added were unnecessary and took up time that could have been dedicated to more plot specific events. The scenes between Harry and Lupin which are critical to the story were very awkward and often were rambling without providing significant dialogue. While it is true that it is difficult for a movie to die hard fans of its original book, this was a complete distortion. Characters and events that are crucial to the outcome of both the third book as well as the story of the fourth were omitted or changed beyond recognition. Essentially the story became secondary to the imagery, which was lacking in itself. The scenery was a fierce deviation from the first two films, giving the impression that they were not even at Hogwarts. The attempts to make the film poignant came across as trite giving the movie a hackneyed quality. The characters were flat making it hard for the audience to empathize with them. I was glad I read the book because there was so much lost I would not have been able to follow the story, yet upset that I read the book because this movie fell so far from my expectations. All in all I would recommend waiting for video or even not seeing the film at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Garbled Tale ? A Lot of Fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So here we are with number three in the series of a now older 13 year-old Harry Potter that badly limps in story content. Sure, the movie is full of neat special effects, cute scenarios, and spectacular sets; however, as far as a good tale is concerned, this screenwriter must have been absent during writing 101. This fable keeps bouncing around from one implausible and twisted situation to another without rhyme nor reason to fortify its transitions. If I wasn't enthralled by the effects presented on the giant IMAX screen at the Loew's IMAX, I probably would have spent considerably more time at the snack bar and the restroom.Many of the special effects seem to be a rip-off of the Lord of the Ring's last adventure. Especially the Werewolf whose face, color and body is virtually identical to the incoherent, naked dwarf in LOTR who if you remember treks along with the heroes throughout the other movie. The `Hippogriff', half bird and half horse, also seems similar to some creatures featured in LOTR. Frankly, I was not too impressed with the rest of the CGI monsters made for the film. The dreaded `Dementors', who ostensibly suck the soul out their victims, never seemed to be able to accomplish that task. They seem far better suited for an animated film than a feature.There were some funny moments, especially at the beginning when Harry casts a spell on his shrew of an Aunt by causing her to inflated grotesquely and float off into the sky over London. His antagonists were lamely presented without nearly the intensity of the prior Potters. In this muddled presentation it was difficult to establish who in fact the actual heavies were. The movie jerks you back and forth until you don't know whom to hiss at any more, nor do you care.Had this film been better crafted, it would have been quite memorable in the IMAX format. Now the format and the scenery are the star, leaving the film a mediocre children's tale. I query whether even a child would be entertained by the confusion and ambiguity. The stunning scenery and special sets are a delight to see; nevertheless, I would still pass on this puppy, unless of course you get to see it on the IMAX screen.Opens June 4th, 2004.</fullReview>

No longer always in Hermione's shadow Harrys magical powers are needed now more than ever, stalked as he is by the Dementors (these are cool) This movie uses some cool tricks, some great visuals and has plenty of story developments. The only disappointment for me was how pathetic Draco Malfoy has become (he is a wimp, of the highest order), and i was looking forward to him and Harry having some good battles later in the series.Again Harry Potter delivers in this his best outing to date.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie would be too dark for a child less than 8 years old but too childish for anyone over 12. The effects were horrible, the plot line disjointed, and the screenplay a far cry from the book. I a 24 year old, avid reader and huge fan of the Harry Potter books and the first two movies. Now I understand that it is a large book and it is impossible to literally translate a book to the screen but Chris Columbus did a great job with the first two films.I have never been so let down by a film in my life. If you haven't read to book recently I feel that you would be lost for the most part, so much is left out. However if you have read the book, you spend so much of the movie lamenting the wonderful material that was butchered for this production.Now the acting, rarely have I seen such "over-acting" in such a heralded movie. The reactions of the actors, young and old alike, brought to mind old cartoons with bulging eyes, melodramatic crying, and buffoonish grins. I spent most of the movie thinking how the acting and character portrayal was so much better in the two previous films. Please bring back Chris Columbus, and please consider that most of the fans of Harry Potter, immaterial of age, like the series because of it's well written, well thought out story lines, and please try to stay true to that. I would thoroughly enjoy an epic long film or even a two part film released separately or together, for the remaining four films if only they stay true to the wonderful spirit that J. K. Rowling so artfully and lovingly created in our hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK the first thing i want to say is that if you have not read the book or seen this movie than do not read this review because it gives away many parts of the story that i don't think should be ruined for you, the second thing i want to say is that the prisoner of Azkaban was my second favorite book out of the series so far, right behind the order of the phenixnow that i said that i would like to say that this movie was horriblethe order of events that went on in the book were completely butchered out out of order in this movie, important events, like when mowfoy and his friends dressed up like dementers and hary performed the patronus on them were completely left out, and many important people have just been completely left out, like Percy, who this year was when he became head boy, and oliver wood who this was his last year at hogwarts, i could name people who were left out all night long but those are some examplesthey left out many important details that if you did not read the book befor you saw the movie than you would have no idea what is going on, for example they didn't explain the time turner at all...the only thing that i thought was almost good was how they saved sirus, but that was still a little offthey definitely need to get the old director back for the rest of the movies because this one obviously has know idea what he is doing, the old director i thought did very good in capturing the story but it seems that the new director is just sucking all of the fantasy and majic that harry potter is good and known forthere are many other things wrong with this book but i do not want to go on all night, so ill leave off here and let you decide what you think of the movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>JK Rowling says "Best one yet" and I agree!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You want to slam the director for cutting, cutting, cutting, go for it. I agree, it's painful sometimes to watch a film based on a book and notice the missing pieces everywhere.Now, get over it. Put the freakin' book down, clear your head and watch the film.That's right, the film, not the book, the film.First, let's get Chris Columbus out of the way. He's one of the blandest, clumsiest directors out there. Don't forget, this man forever left us with that damned us with that Home Alone film and I will never for give him. The first two Potter films were slow, episodic dribble that while holding the story of the book together where tedious and uninvolving to those who had not read it, and those who had. I dreaded the films from the minute I heard he was helming them and hoped beyond hope they would. Well they did.Second, let's talk about what was done right. The dialogue is honest, the acting is ten-fold better, the special effects near perfect, the lighting brilliant, the tone flawless and the camera never stagnant and always involving. Third, the story; the point is there. Don't argue that he cut stuff out because the Author okayed it and I think she would know what has to be there! Finally; JK Rowling approves the film and proclaimed it the Best of the Three! Okay, the author herself, the person who penned those books you lonely fanatics hold so dear signed off on it and showered it with praise.So there, detractors, take that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the adaptation of the third book in the Harry Potter's saga written by J.K. Rowling, and is the first in the franchise that isn't directed by Chris Columbus, who makes way for Alfonso Cuarón. The cast, however, remains the same, which allows to this film doesn't seems a totally different thing from the first two, although there are changes in the way the story is told and seen. One of the most obvious changes is the gradual abandonment of the use of black school robes, almost ubiquitous in the first two movies. For some fans, its a transition to another stage of the film franchise. Also notable is the arrival of Michael Gambon to the role of Albus Dumbledore, left vacant by the death of Richard Harris. Although loyalty and attachment to the original book and it's details is a feature that will come to gradually disappearing, this movie still follows closely the history of the book. For all these reasons, this movie entertains, delights but haven't nothing surprising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tag line speaks the truth. New actors replace some old actors, new charters, new spells, and new fun! I think this one is not the best story wise, but it is the most fun to watch! It has good humor, good CGI, good acting, it is a fun movie to watch that young lings will enjoy. Just like every single Harry Potter movie, the last fight might have little kids cover there eyes, but other then The Dog Scene and The Dementor Scene, you and your kids will enjoy this movie. It is a great movie. Although one thing I don't like about this movie is no Voldemort! There are only two Harry Potter films without him. This movie and the sixth movie have no Voldemort. All the other movies, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, and 8th have Voldemort. But the 3rd and 6th don't. So, you have watched 3 out of 8 Harry Potter films, now go and watch the 4th one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as "Avatar" and "Watchmen", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer "Avatar", because "Avatar" has aliens, and I love aliens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Harry Potter series gets darker than ever with some Black added into the mix.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third instalment of the juggernaut that is the Harry Potter franchise is, despite stiff competition (and without foreknowledge of how "The Deathly Hallows" will be), the best of the bunch.It's a much darker affair, just as the book was, and is capably directed by Alfonso Cuarón, who keeps things just the right side of entertaining while Hogwarts faces it's most difficult year yet.Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban and is on the loose so Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) must be even more careful than usual. Especially with the Dementors (Azkaban prison guards, essentially) around. Thankfully, the new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher (played by David Thewlis) seems to be a good egg. It's a shame that the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney (played by Emma Thompson), is not quite as cool, calm and collected.It would be easy to rate this movie just that little bit higher than the previous instalment but one or two aspects keep it on a level pegging. The cast are all decent, although Michael Gambon has some big shoes to fill as he replaces the deceased Richard Harris in the role of Dumbledore, but still nowhere near as good as many other people in the business called show. The effects are fantastic (the Quidditch sequence is a vast improvement over the very first match we saw in the first movie) and all of the little touches in almost every frame prove to be absolutely delightful.But there's a big disappointment here when we get to finally see one of the main creatures (that I won't spoil for you by naming). It just doesn't come close to looking like a living, breathing creature and that's a major blow in a movie that parades before us a menagerie of fantastical, magical creatures.Despite it's long running time, there's a lot packed in here. This is no place for newcomers to dip their toes. The Dementors are introduced quickly enough and then it's a case of holding on tight while we're sent on a journey involving magical maps, an animagus or two, time trickery, a hippogriff and a knight bus. Great stuff.See this if you like: Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire, Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter (Daniel Redcliffe) is about to start his third year at Hogwart's school of Witchcraft and Wizardy but trouble has started in the world of non-magic folks aka Muggles. It seems Harry has accident inflated his Aunt Marge (Pam Farris) and runs away to be united with his best friends in the whole wide galaxy known as Hermonine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grinn) as he goes back into the world of magic for his new school year. He gets a new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher named Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) whom befriends the boy and of course there's talk about an escaped prisoner from Azkaban named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) that is rumored to be heir to Voldermort as he troubles poor Harry. Not only that but also some Death-esquire Dementors are searching around for him to have his soul but can Harry find out who the true heir of Voldermort is and is Sirius really the one behind it? One of the best installments of the series by far! Alfonso Cauron takes Chris Columbus place as director with Columbus as executive producer as it's the most artsy and complex of the series. The film does replace Richard Harris with Michael Gambon for Dumbledore and reunites Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Julie Waters as Mrs. Weasley, Maggie Smith as Professor McGarnagle, John Cleese as Nearly-Headless Nick and introduces new characters like Emma Thompson as Professor Trelaway. Here the film is more darker and more complex then it's processors but has more improved acting on the kid cast being no longer kids but teens.There's plenty of surprises and dark stuff galore with a good storyline including faithfulness to the book in this installment that makes this the most beloved movie of the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Prisoner of Azkaban is pretty impressive for a Harry Potter film. With Alfonso Cuaron at the helm, the film is much more adult and darker in tone. Breathtakingly shot and superbly visualized, there is genuine emotion in the story, unlike the 'americanized' tone of the first two films. Harry is older this time and ready to get angry. Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson provide stand out performances (though only supporting in nature). The young actors are generally competent though Radcliffe struggles a bit compared to Watson and Grint. The special effects are truly magical, specially some scary 'dementors' and an amazing 'hippogriff'. The film is still a bit too long and some parts of the plot aren't fully explained.Overall 8/10</fullReview>

Alfonso got it right. The sets were great, the screenplay was awesome, the directing fantastic, the acting, very good. While this movie is not perfect, it still amounts to a recommended film on my list. The film has a much darker tone than the last two, this tone helps the film a lot, it's much more easy to take seriously. John Williams cooks up his best score of the series, making it moodie, creepie, happy, and at points terrifying, the best of this score is probably the children's choir singing "Double Trouble". I highly recommend this film, for me, it is currently (December '07) the second best film of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyway, I felt that from this movie onwards there was a lot missing. Richard Harris played Dumbledore as a very wise, fair and most importantly kind old man. Gambon plays him with an Ulster accent like that of Ian Paisley. It sounds abrupt, preaching and everything but friendly. The Dawn French lines made me cringe, and the Granger girl seemed to become the main protagonist. There seems a lot of cost cutting like, "Don't bother going to the Alley to get your books because I've conveniently got them all for you" and let's just cut out Platform 9 and 3/4 and jump straight to the train chugging along with everyone aboard. Many scenes are drawn out to a yawn inducing length which sacrifices quality for quantity.Overall it felt like this movie and the next has a different Director and Screenplay Writer. I checked this out and it says they're the same, but it doesn't look it. Perhaps the cutting room editor is different, I just don't know. If it isn't broke then don't fix it, but someone has tried. It definitely looks cheaper.The time travel scenes were blatant 'Back To The Future II' rip offs and they reminded me of accusations of old, primarily that J.K.Rowling had collected many ideas of other's and passed them off as her own. Many people do this to some extent, but not quite like Rowling does. She's like those Hip Hop musicians who rip off sections of popular songs by changing a few lyrics or beats and incorporating them into their next hit.The first two movies were great and when watched back to back they followed on seamlessly. Prisoner Of Azkaban and Goblet Of Fire look only vaguely related and this is glaringly so when watched straight after Chamber Of Secrets. I found it immensely disappointing.I found myself persevering with Prisoner just to understand the next movie. Towards the end it picked up a bit but that's scant consolation. I found myself doing the same with Goblet Of Fire, but only this time it didn't pick up. Yawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good movie, with lots of energy - but still has some negative points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7.99/8 I was excepting high hopes for this movie, and was throughly impressed by this epic, but the thing that disappointed me, which made the movie lose three stars, was the plot, a bit too many plots which makes the movie boring and confusing, but thankfully it still had some energy left to bring back to entertained the audience, which is great, but it's still beside the point. And the other thing was the colour of it, too dark, perhaps they wanted to make this one the darkest one yet and they ended up going over the budget, so I was disappointed by that as well. But the movie was still good, really entertaining, with a few twists and turns, which keeps the audience captivated to watch more and I thought it was the best one yet.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but it didn't start well, as Harry blew up his aunt, who was being very mean to his parents and fainted on the train to Hogwarts. But that's not all, the school and including Harry is in danger as mass-murder (Sirius Black) broke out of Azkaban prison to come and find (possibly kill) Harry. And that's not all soul-sucking Demonters are guarding the school grounds, which Harry is scared to face against, next to Sirius. Harry doesn't know what's ahead of him, as he faces new challenges in his life.Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) stole the movie, as he shone throughout the movie and his performances were all out-of-this-world, so well done Gary. And also congratulations to the rest of the cast, as they all performed their role realistically and is one of the best things about this movie. 9.89/10 for the performances.Overall, a great movie, lots of energy to keep everyone entertained, but too many plots, which lets down the movie and perhaps it's too dark - brighten it a little! Hopefully, the fourth movie will take the place as the best Harry Potter move yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and imaginative but not harry potter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I totally agree with every positive review of this film. It is both funny and imaginative as well as entertaining however it does not capture the magic of the first two films.As with every director Alfonso Cuaron wanted to put his own mark on his work and thus this film is incredibly different from the first two films directed by Christopher Columbus. It seems that while Columbus preferred to focus on the actual book and narrative, sticking jealously to the plot, Cuaron preferred to branch out from the norm which had a positive and negative effect on the film.The film is as I said very enjoyable, entertaining, thrilling and in most cases downright funny. However the negative part is that there was a loss of continuity. This means that basically for me the film no longer felt like the books. Things like the animal sweets, the big swinging pendulum and the toads singing seemed completely out of place.Another example of lack of continuity was Michael Gambon as Dumbeldore, who's almost energetic performance is in stark contrast to the wise, plodding Richard Harris who captured Dumbeldore perfectly. Gambon is less convincing. By contrast David Thewlis and Gary Oldman are great in their respective roles.All in all this is not a bad film, however it fails quite badly to capture the magic of the first two films of the books</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had it's moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had a lot of potential. The third book was easily one of the best in the series, so naturally you shouldn't have to alter the storyline of the movie to much to make it dark and fun.Right? Wrong.From the beginning, it's obvious that this film is going to be much different from the book. Not completely so, but enough to take the enjoyment away from any hard-core fan of the book.The scene with the Dursleys, for starters, was horribly done. That scene should have been longer, it should have been so much more emotional. Instead, it feels completely rushed, like it was just thrown in there for humor. Because thats what it came off as. It was not as dark and horrible as it was in the book, which took away from it.The next few scenes were well done (with the exception of the shrunken head on the Knight bus) The scene with the Dementor was well done and appropriately dark. This however, seemed more due to lighting than the actual Dementor itself, which didn't look scary at all.Threy then arrive at the school and from there on it's a series of ups and downs. The boggart scene was done well. Buckbeak looked fantastic. The Harry/Ron/Hermione interaction is good, all three of the kids have definitely grown into their roles nicely. (not that I had any doubt that they would) The downfalls however, are plentiful and certainly enough to ruin what could be a great film. For starters, the whole set is different from the first two. I can read the books and then watch the first two films and see Hogwarts as it was described in the books in those two films. I however, can't with this one. It also seems that in order to show this films darker tone, the film was simply stripped of it's color. It looks bland, almost like it's about to resort to black and white soon.The classes are almost never seen and the students are almost always seen wearing regular clothing instead of robes.They also failed to mention the firebolt, until the end. Only one Quidditch match was actually shown, and Hermione's overwhelming amount of classes was hardly addressed at all.This however, could all be overlooked if it weren't for the gaping plot holes that pop up at the end. What should have been a lengthy, somewhat dramatic confrontation between the three remaining Marauders, Snape and the trio was altered so drastically that had I not read the book beforehand, I never would have been able to figure out what was going on.The Marauders were never explained, it was never told that Harry's father was an Animagus or exactly why Petttigrew and Sirius were ones. The Marauder's history with Snape was never explained either. We didn't really find out exactly what had transpired between Sirius and Pettigrew or about Lupin being a werewolf. (we were just told he was one by Hermione, no further elaboration except for Lupin briefly confirming it) The scene was rushed and over-dramatized at times. I remember first reading this book a few years ago when I was about fifteen and being shocked out of my mind at this part. I never would have guessed on my own that Pettigrew was an Animagus or that he was even still alive. Yet, when I watched the movies version of it, I felt nothing but confusion by the whole thing, not to mention upset considering just how much was cut.The next few scenes, were thankfully done well. There were inconsistencies, like Hermione's rather rushed explanation of the time-turner. But overall it was action packed and trilling. (Although, I did feel that Lupin as a werewolf looked pretty lame, almost comical) As for the actor and actresses, I believe they all performed admirably, with the exception of Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon. Oldman just didn't seem right as Sirius to me and don't even get me started on Gambon. The man can't hold a candle to Richard Harris. (R.I.P. Harris) Overall, not a bad film, but there is definitely room for improvement. Perhaps if this movie had been longer and included more of the original storyline, it would have been a more worthy entry to the series.Four stars out of ten.</fullReview>

Soft spoken, yet very firm. Gentle, but also powerful. And he just looked like the most brilliant man on Earth. The second reason was that we had a new director with a new vision of how the movie would look. Now on to what worked. The dementors, looked good. The sets, incredible. The scenery, amazing. And the acting, better. But the most amazing thing is the producers, and others, who find the actors to play these characters. Gary Oldman, perfect. Timothy Spall, well chosen.

		<fullReview>I know that many of the readers of the books, those that post on IMDb anyway, and the critical mass hailed this as the first authentic recreation of the universe that Rowling created. Again, I come to these films totally ignorant of the books, however, for me, the criticism of Columbus' first 2 films in the franchise is nitpicking. Further, the praise given to this film I think is overdone.The kids are once again great, but the film to me is disjointed and a mess. Not sure if the book treats the Black character the same as the film, but when we FINALLY get to see him in the flesh, he is gone again. I thought the whole lead up to his reveal was overdone. Oldman plays the character fantastically, but the character is hyped so much in the film and then given very little in the end that I felt almost cheated.As for the darkness of the film, it works in furthering the story, but just because it is darker doesn't make it better. I still think Columbus did an excellent job with the first two films and I don't understand the criticism of his films and the lauding of this one.I was very disappointed that once again Snape, the Malfoy's and Dumbledore are all but absent here. Again, not sure if in the books these characters are thrown to the side, but they are characters I personally would like to see more time given to. Draco is turned into an absolute wimp this go around and I thought that totally discredited his character. Yes, he has the cowards personality shown in the first two films, but he is also seen as a serious threat to Harry. Now he is reduced to the clichéd wimpy bully here. Another major rub this time around is Dumbledore. He is reduced to a dismissive kindly old man. Is he not the headmaster? Yet he seems to have little to do from a leadership stand point. All in all, this was a good movie, but for me, the weakest in the franchise to date. There is a lot of good in it, but there is also a lot of negative, mainly with the characters I mentioned, and in the end made the film a disappointment for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever was Warner Bros. Pictures thinking when they decided that Alfonso Cuarón should direct this film? First of all his well known film is Y tu mamá también, which was good with critics, but not really Harry Potter worthy if you ask me.First of all, the writer of the script, Steven Kloves, did not do a good job as he had with the previous films. He completely took the book and turned it into more of a Cliff Notes version of the book with leaving some important things out of the film.Now, don't get me wrong but the film is great as a movie, but as an adaption based upon the book it's horrible. It has many flaws, plot holes and worse of all the magic seems to be missing from this film. Not magic as in magic, but the presence of magic that the first two films brought into us fans of the books. Hogwarts even looked different to me.For people who have never read the books you'll love it, but for readers of the books you may have mixed emotions as I did. I liked the film, don't get me wrong, I was just disappointed as a fan of the book. However, I have to give some credit to this film. Since I didn't completely hate it but didn't completely love it. Which is why I gave it a 5 out of 5.It has it's issues, but only for readers of the books.Love Always &amp; Blessed Be, Xander Trotter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***may contain spoilers*** I must say that I was rather disappointed with this film. This is my favorite book out of the series, and I was expecting the movie to be as well. I might have been expecting too much, but I just didn't like the movie very much.I'll start off with what I liked. I thought the time turner was done very well. It was a hard thing to do to show people going back in time, and I thought Alfonso did I good job with that. I also thought he did a wonderful job with Buckbeak. He was done very well, and he looked very realistic as well.Now to what I didn't like. I will start by saying that I thought the movie was rushed. I think they didn't want the movie to be very long so they could add more to the time turner and revealing who Sirius and Wormtail really are. But it ruined the movie. I thought the acting wasn't done very well in this movie, and I don't blame the actors. The actors can only do as well as they can with the directions they are given by their director. Harry crying after he found out Sirius was his Godfather was laughable. It didn't sound realistic, and he didn't look at all sad. I didn't feel any amount of pathos for Harry. I actually laughed because of how fake his crying sounded.I found that the numerous scenes with Lupin were unnecessary. They could have showed the relationship between Lupin and Harry a better way than only walks. I also didn't really like the way Harry learned the patronus, but it didn't bother me too much. I didn't like how Harry fell off of his broom during the Quidditch match.Throughout the movie, I didn't get the magical feeling Hogwarts possessed during the 1st and 2nd and even the 4th film. It also didn't feel like the year was progressing. Showing the tree changing seasons was clever, but it didn't make the year feel like it was passing. Harry getting the broom at the end didn't seem very logical because they made it seem like it was the end of the year, and then they're still talking about the Quidditch cup being theirs. Another thing I didn't like was Oliver Wood and Gryffindor not winning the Cup being cut out. I know they can't add everything into a movie, but this was Oliver's big year.One thing that I honestly can't stand is that they didn't mention who the Marauders were. That is a crucial part for Harry since he finds out more about his father, and who his father is. We hear some much about Lily that we wonder about James. This was one of those key character pieces. They could have easily added onto the end a few more minutes about Harry finding out from Lupin that him, James, Sirius, and Wormtail had created the map.Overall, I didn't find this movie very satisfying. Alfonso seemed to focus more on humor than on the darkness and seriousness of the film. Alfonso did an OK job at staying on the main plot and theme, but he could have stayed more on track. I don't think they ever explain thoroughly the relationship Sirius, James, Lupin, and Wormtail had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie may be the "best" movie of the Harry Potter movies, but it is the most untrue to the book. Sure in the 4th one the maze was all wrong, and in the 1st they left out trials before Harry gets to the stone. But in the 3rd, not only are some characters just portrayed incorrectly, the plot is twisted, and many things are not explained. For example, if you have not read the book, you don't understand anything about Sirius and why he really isn't guilty (my brother was super confused for example). Also there was barely any quidditch, quidditch is one of the most important aspects in the book. On that note, Sirius was supposed to send Harry his fire bolt in the middle of the book, and there was a big conflict about if the broom is bewitched. Also, it says specifically in the book that the students at Hogwarts don't know how to dress in the "current styles" because they only wear their robes, that doesn't seem to be the case in the movie. Also the dementors are wrong, they don't fly, they float, the kiss was not them attacking you and pulling your face off, they was supposed to be huge lips somewhere, i didn't see any. Also i cant seem to decide whether Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are good actors or not, in the 4th they are fine, no overacting or anything, but in the 3rd, i don't know what to think, for example, when Harry finds out about SIrius and his parents, he does some sort of cry thing, that looks like he is having an asthma attack. Also, this isn't really any ones fault, but Emma Watson is way too gorgeous for her character, i mean, Hermione is supposed to have bushy hair and buck teeth, Emma Watson has perfect teeth and amazing hair. The movie was disappointing, when you have a Harry Potter marathon, watch 1, 2, and 4. because the only reason you should watch 3 is when you are in a "omg this movie is wrong" mood, and want to point out everything incorrect in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron has made a common mistake among directors these days: just because a movie pretty doesn't mean it's good.Yes, I admit, Azkaban's visuals - and how Cuaron uses them - are jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The Dementors are unfaithful to the book, but still genuinely scary, and Buckbeak looks incredible. In fact, I would have rated this movie lower had it not been for these spectacular effects.Cuaron seems to have a very claustrophobic sense of directing, keeping everybody intense and focused on one shot and not allowing anyone to breathe while a line is being spoken. This results in some extremely tight and stiff acting from some incredible acting. In fact, only the three new adults - Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis - seem free from Cuaron's grip.The script is okay; at least it doesn't try to cram everything in like in Chamber of Secrets. However, this time it does the opposite: it focuses too much screen time on visuals and not enough on important elements like plot, acting and storyline.In conclusion, this movie could have been so much better. I don't recommend seeing this movie if you have already read the book, because you will be gravely disappointed. For the rest of you, it's an okay way to kill two-and-a-half hours. Have "fun".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best of the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It skipped some major scenes, and I didn't particularly like some of the actors. The special effects, though, were AMAZING. All of the scenes in town were pretty good. My personal favorite was Honeydukes. There was some added stuff, but it didn't matter much to me. The amount of shrunken heads, however, confused me, especially the ones that stopped Hermione and Ron from entering the Three Broomsticks. Maybe my memory isn't too good, but I don't remember that many heads in the book. Or any, for that matter. I can't say much more without spoiling a lot, so I'll stop here. But it was worth seeing, being my favorite of the books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say that these 3 kids are horrible actors and I absolutely HATE British accents! Anyways...Harry, Ron, and Hermoine should not have any problems ever. Here's why: 1.They all have magic powers. They can just cast a spell on whoever they hate. 2.They have an invisibility cloak. If I had one of those, I wouldn't waste my time with whatever they waste their time with. I'd steal, spy, and sneak however I need to in order to get rid of my problems. 3.They have a 'time machine'. How the hell do you complain about anything when you can just go back in time and fix it? 4.They have magic brooms, and... 5.They have access to a flying horse/bird creature. Either one of those two can be used for easy transportation to anywhere they want to go. 6.They have a map that shows they all the things going on on the ENTIRE campus! These all give these 3 an incredibly unfair advantage against any enemies or problems they have. I would also like to mention that an enormous portion of the movie was spent on displaying that criminal as such a bad guy and a ridiculously small portion of the movie in the climax. Then, when they finally got around to the climax, the movie just ended. Because of all this, I give this movie two big fat thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers? This film is different from the other HP movies, and actually contains humor. Sirius Black (Oldman) is added to the long list of characters, and this one doesn't talk about Voldemort as much as the others, but really focuses on the mystery of Black. When Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for a third year, he faces many problems. His form to go to Hogsmead isn't signed, he worries that Sirius is after him, and Hagrid's hippogriff (half horse, half human) is going to be executed for injuring a student. He also faces dementors, animals that suck out people's souls, but learns the spell to defend him from his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film, but see the first 2 first if you're a newbie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is one of my favorite movies. I love reading about Harry Potter as much as watching his films. The only real criticism I have is that you may be a little confused about some of the elements if you haven't a) seen the first two films, or b) read the first three books. Harry's history is glossed over, and leaving Potter-heads to explain to their friends outside of the fandom the basics about Harry and his non-magical relatives. "why does he live with them? Where is he going with that trunk?" etc. The big picture becomes clearer, however when he threatens his "muggle" uncle with his wand, and heads for Hogwarts school of Witch Craft and Wizardry once again. The Knight Bus scene is hysterical.However, Harry heads to his home-away-from-home and into unseen danger as murderous, wild-eyed wizard escapes from Azkaban Prison and (rhumor has it) is searching for Harry Potter. Harry teams up with his two best friends, lovable Ron Weasley and intelligent Hermione Granger once again. And this time their new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher knows more about Harry and the mysterious escaped prisoner than he lets on. Some moving scenes, excellent cinematography and Gary Oldman's portrayal as the infamous Sirius Black are just some of the things that make this one a must-see. However, if you're not familiar with the basic premise watch Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film maker's aspect of the wondorous world of Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mise-én-scene of Harry Potter Happiness can be found, in the darkest of times, if one simply remembers to turn on the light. Welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter! Our feature presentation is Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is a thirteen year old boy, shaping his future while learning more and more about his dark and heroic past. "A true kid's classic is just as magical for adults. " Says Peter Rainer of the New York Magazine. But just how was it created so that adults sit spell bounded in their seats. Enchanted?.... Charmed?.... Bewitched?.... If it weren't for the excellent use of mise-én-scene, it probably wouldn't be the same. No, my fellow Harry Potter fan, mise-én-scene is not a spell, nor is it the name of a character or actor. It is the thaumaturgy of the director and the Director of Photography; it is the sum and substance of the directors' wits that draws you attention to the screen. Mise-én-scene was originally a French theatrical term that meant "placing on stage". It is the use of many different elements in movies, kind of like painting a picture on the closed space of the canvas and placing objects appropriately where they belong. Some elements of mise-én-scene amongst the hundred of others used on the set of Harry Potter are composition and design, territorial space, and the superb use of proxemic use of proxemic patterns.Composition and design refer to the systematic placement of people, places, lights, camera, and objects. The human eye attempts to harmonize the elements of a composition into a unified whole. The director takes advantage of this fact by strategically lighting different parts of an image, guiding our eyes to the dominant, which attracts our eyes with its compelling contrast. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson), embark upon a journey neither one wished to take, leading to their finding out more and more about Harry's "criminal, murderous" Godfather, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman). In one of the final scenes, the audience's eyes are carefully guided from Harry's face of shock, to Hermione's face of absolute fear, to Ron's face of mingled pain and surprise and finally to the cause of their reactions --- Sirius Black, who wears a maniacal glow and a wicked smile on his unsightly face. He really does look like a murderer! How close should the camera get to the subject? Or how close should we get to the subject, since our eyes identify with the camera lens. Space is one of the principle methods of communication in all films. The way people are arranged in space tell a lot about their emotional, social, and physical relationships. Harry has yet to find out who his Godfather really is; he thinks or rather the whole world knows his Godfather to be a murderer. The first time Harry meets, or more exactly encounters his Godfather, they keep quite a distance. Harry stands at on end of the room while Sirius stands at the other end of the room. The spacing suggests a distant or scared relationship between the two main characters. Harry is positioned, standing in a quarter turn, with a high degree of intimacy but less emotional involvement. Sirius is shown with his back towards the camera, conveying a sense of mystery and concealment.Harry stands ten feet away from Sirius at their first meeting; both look hateful and full of vengeance. Neither knows why the other hates him, but the rest of the movie makes us understand Harry's anger. Sirius remains a complete mystery until the end, where he and Harry find out and clarify the truth about their odiums. As the movie ends, Sirius and Harry stand beside each other, exchanging words of comfort and relief. Harry has just rescued "an innocent man from a terrible fate", and their two-minute talk ends the tension between them. Harry now regards Sirius as a mix between a father and a brother and comes to love him like no one else. The proxemic patterns or relations of organisms within a given space, give us a commentary on what each character feels, without them having to tell us anything. Harry and Sirius start from being bitter enemies in a public space, to uncovering their true relationship as Godfather and Godson in a personal space.Mise-én-scene ??. Harry Potter??. Director Alfonso Cuarón enchants us, bewitches us, charms us by the use of mise-én-scene . We see Harry's point of view and then Sirius's. When they become Godfather and Godson again, we feel happy and elated for both of them. We witness and feel the human trials and triumphs that they go through. We watch Harry turn into a true hero despite the "Double, double, toil and trouble." Get ready for a bumpy ride!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the first two movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a brilliant movie that never ceases to bring something new and entertaining to the screen. There is always an excellent new idea brought into the plot creating more visual entertainment for the audience. There are so many different twists that it seems impossible to not continuously be kept on the edge of your seat. Harry Potty has been said to be strictly a love or hate movie, but in my opinion, it's absolutely phenomenal. The thought of someone being able to have such a wide imagination to think up these peculiar yet unique ideas is beyond me. The graphics, the casting, the acting, everything is simply extraordinary. From start to finish it proves to be nothing less than exceptional. It leaves you with a great feeling after watching it. This is definitely a movie you want to go out and see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' sees Harry becoming an older and more rebellious character, this time wanting to escape the escape prisoner Sirius Black. In this story, Potter learns even more about his parents and about himself. This story and film is much more darker than the previous two, and although there is too much to fit into the film, the editing was done well to allow the most important parts crucial to the films success. I would recommend reading the book to get more of the depth of the story because some parts had to be cut out completely, and these are no-doubt relevant to what happens later on. Mainly, these were more character-focused scenes to build up the characters rather than action scenes.The film is also less innocent than the original, and there is more detail in the scenes and more character to these scenes. It's very good, and this is a sure winner for Potter fans. Even if you're not a Potter fan, you will enjoy it. Just don't forget to read the books!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't feel the need of writing about Harry Potter movies. I have read the books, I have been (in my mind) inside the magical world, I have witnessed the experiences?Now I'll try to write about the third part of J.K Rowling's fantasy. Why this and not any of the others? Probably because it is the best movie (not novel) of the first three and because I plan to write about the others eventually.People have asked me why I think this one's the best, as in asking for reasons. I don't know if I can give a list of things that define this one as the better one. I can explain it saying that it's something you sense; on the whole. This is a well rounded project in all of its parts; and it's not even perfect.Anyway, here I go with everything I think; like it or not. Alfonso Cuarón is a truly gifted filmmaker. "A little princess" is one of the most wonderful things I've seen in my life, it still amazes me today; "Y tu mamá también" has no shame?Maybe that gift made him take Harry Potter from where it needed to be taken.So he grabbed his work strictly from the view of film-making. I explain: in the first two deliveries, Chris Columbus took a commitment with Rowling's story; Cuarón took a commitment with the plain fact of making a movie. What he chose is much darker, obscure, and mysterious; apart from Columbus' shining universe.There are deep moving issues in the novels, and Columbus knew it, but didn't show it; now there are long talks about the characters' past. The screenplay is shorter and not so "by the book" as the last two; which explains clearly the freedom Cuarón took for the film. There's an intense development of personalities, which is a positive aspect for every element of the movie.Take the young actors that this is just as the only thing they've done in their lives and I still can't say if they've got the skill. Daniel Radcliffe's character actually faces his past for the first time in this film, and that requires a different approach. Rupert Grint's character has to deal with problems of the heart; with feelings. Emma Watson's character takes the helm of everything, has to handle a different kind of responsibility; and they all have to reach other levels.A blessing is to see the ensemble coming to life. A blessing is to imagine and think about the actors that will play the characters you've met in the book. A blessing was to see Emma Thompson in a wonderful portrayal as Professor Trelawney, to meet Sirius Black in the skin of a curly-haired Gary Oldman and meet the revelation of the journey David Thewlis portraying R.J Lupin. Plus, Alan Rickman's Snape is better every minute; Michael Gambon and Maggie Smith maintain the class and Robbie Coltrane keeps his fun going.Not to mention the visuals?To achieve his perfect world, Cuarón recurred to his old editing collaborator Steven Weisberg, who got his vision perfectly, taking everything to the sky. The cinematography by Michael Seresin is also a remarkable; in the best representation of this tale that has been able to keep one thing going during its three deliveries?Frame by frame, shot by shot, moment by moment, nothing stays still; there's always some element that connects the image with another thing to keep a continuous movement.Look closely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the third installment in the box office phenomena, Harry Potter, Harry is confronted with some new dangers. Hogwarts might not be enough to protect Harry from his new nemesis (or so everyone thinks), Sirius Black. The ending of this film has the most spectacular plot-twists of all the films (er... books) in my opinion. It introduces us to Harry's father's two best friends and the man who betrayed them.In "Prisoner of Azkaban," Emma has improved quite a bit. Ron's character is (thankfully) no longer the stupid sidekick (GRRR to you, Chris Columbus! GRRR!) but still provides a lot of comic relief. Dan is pretty good as Harry, but can't cry! (Well, I must admit, I am writing this after seeing GoF, in which his crying wasn't so-bad-it's-funny. It actually was believable and made other people cry too, but for more info, see my GoF review.) When Harry cried, which wasn't in the book and I wish it wasn't in the film, I laughed. Sort of a titter, rather... But all in all, it is way more mature than PS/SS and CoS, but still a little, teeny-weeny bit childish. The score rocks, though. So go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the 4 films that are out (as of December 2005). The main kudos goes to the director, Alfonso Cuarón (the director of the acclaimed film Y Tu Mamá También). He brought out the adolescent natures of Harry Potter and his friends, starting with their loose clothing (as kids their age would do, whereas in the first 2, the clothes were kempt and proper) and flowing hairstyles (again the kids starting to show their independent natures as opposed to the first two films). The music is also the best of the 4 films, John Williams having outdone himself - this score is the best he has done in quite a long time, putting such varied styles into the film to make it a musical feast. But not only this, unlike the other 3 films which for me are merely adaptations of the beloved books, this one is an actual film which has a proper beginning, middle, and end and not just cut-and-pasted scenes as per book. Therefore, I give this film a well-done 9 out of 10! Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God Potter exists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood film-making has become a very well orchestrated business with movies being done to satisfy "market-groups" and not to satisfy artistic values. Well, the market-group that has emerged as the most powerful is the under 14 years old, as opposed to some years back where teenagers where the group to target.This said, its obvious why kid's books and comic books are made in movies and that all movies have become more light hearted - more kid-friendly. Harry Potter may be a direct commercial effort to drain the pocket-money of the under-14s that already have spent most of it on the books, but it (the whole movie series) stands as a nice example of film-making with a heart, resulting in very watchable and enjoyable adventures - even if you haven't read the books.Thank God we have the Potter movies - at least they are imaginative, original and not dull and predictive like any other film nowadays.As for "Prisoner of Azkaban" its obviously the movie (and book) where Rowling is the most inventive (with the cool time travel). May be for some it was a disappointing adaption of the book but it nevertheless is a wonderful cinematic experience.Recommendable for the moviegoer that likes to be lost in a different world in the 2 hours he/she is watching a movie.</fullReview>

Due to the directing and the continuation of the storyline, the characters grow, and the actors grow along with the story.

		<shortDescription>Harry at age 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'm a fan of the books. I have read this particular chapter, or should I say year, several times. My feelings on the film are as follows:There are many new things to talk about this time out. First, Dumbledore's replacement. For those not in the know, Richard Harris passed shortly after the second film was finished. To me, he was the perfect Dumbledore right from the beginning and I had a hard time seeing a new face in the role. Michael Gambon was satisfactory but too many key elements from the character are missing. Instead of playing Dumbledore as a wise, kind and somewhat tired old wizard as Harris did, Gambon seems more energetic and detached from the main characters. I felt as though he and Harry's relationship took a step backwards from the previous movies. I felt as though Harris' performance was closer to Dumbledore as written in the books. Second, we have a new director. Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron steps in and to my delight has given the series a fresh and interesting approach. He approaches the darker tones found in the book with vigor and panache. I was very happy with his visual style. It was very bold and edgy, yet full of emotion. Yeah "Y Tu Mama Tambien" dude. Way to step up. Great job with the dementors and Sirius Black.This is what I consider the turning point towards maturity for the characters in the books. I was very happy to see that this transition was also made in the film version. 8/10Also, I would like it to be known that this is one of John Williams' very best film scores, and that's saying a lot. He was robbed at the Oscars. Oh well. He has 5 already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great, dark like the book and the cinematography was spectacular. Harry's ride on Buckbeak was amazing except for the Titanic-esquire part. (Cheesiest part since the freeze-frame ending to Philosopher's stone!) I really liked how they animated the map. Only thing I find missing is an explanation of the Marauders and why they had the nicknames they had. Everyone I know who hasn't read the book was confused by that and the stag at the end makes no sense unless you know who "Prongs" is! They should have Alfonzo Cuoron back to do more! He did a much better job than Chris Columbus and I think he got the tone of the book down pat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Praised by many, hated by many, the third part of this well known fantasy saga is probably the most controversial of all. Nevertheless, and trying to be the most objective about it, this is probably the best movie in the series, and one of the best movies of 2004.Most of the complains have been directed towards the director, Mexican Alfonso Cuarón, who has received many awards for his work in "A Little Princess", "Great Expectations" and "Y Tu Mamá También". I find most of those complains a little bit too childish, considering that their main topic is how much it was taken from the book. Not only this complain should is directed to the wrong person(whether true or false, it's the writer of the screenplay's fault), but it's very simplistic to say that the book should be completely transcript to the movie.Regarding this aspect(and counting myself as a fan of the book), I found the adaptation(key word: Adaption) very good, and while it was not the most faithful to the book(unlike parts 1 &amp; 2), probably this liberties helped the movie to be more entertaining, and gave it a more dynamic pace. In my opinion, all the changes to the book served to a bigger purpose: to make the movie enjoyable. Of Course, as a fan of the books I was shocked at first, but considering the length of the book and how good the final product is, I think they did a pretty good job with the adaptation.Cuarón's direction is fresh, and shows a development over previous parts, considering that our characters have grown up. The world looks now darker as the plot moves to somber situations. The plot is as follows: As the mysterious Prisoner Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban in what seems to be a hunt for Harry Potter, the young wizard, now 13 years old, returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year of study. Meanwhile, the Dementors, the horrifying guards of Azkaban, patrol the surroundings of Hogwarts looking for Black and make the year uncomfortable not only for Harry, but for the entire school. Sirius Black carries part of Harry's past and a shocking discovery will take place when they face each other.The acting for the most part is superb with the young actors gaining more experience every year. Emma Watson displays an enormous improvement and shows promise of a bright future. Rupert Grint, as Ron Weasley, has less chances of displaying his abilities but nevertheless he manages to perform a good acting. Daniel Radcliffe is not so lucky, but considering that the weight of the entire series rest on his shoulders, it's good to see him improve in this movie. Maybe he is not the best actor in the movie, but he has known the part and has made it his own.The adult cast is awesome, and even when the kids are the stars, there are fine performances by veterans of the Harry Potter series Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane as well as newcomers Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Michael Gambon. David Thewlis steals the movie as the gentle but cursed prof. Lupin. He manages to capture the sadness of the character and the kindness he displays to his students.Overall, this is probably the best Harry Potter movie to date. Sure, it's not as faithful to the source as the others, but the changes help it to be enjoyable for both Harry Pottewr fans and the casual movie-goer.9/10. Outstanding</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter now has more storyline, mystery and entertainment- enough to fill your satisfaction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the one Harry Potter I remember.Harry once again takes the trip to Hogwarts, ready to go to school. But, things do not happen very smoothly. First of all, he learns that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, and may be searching for Harry. Second of all, during the train ride to Hogwarts, Harry gets attacked by Dementors, which are creatures who know how to replicate your worst fears and memories.If anything, Harry Potter remains to be a fun movie, even if Harry's worst fear is fear itself, is unrealistic, even for a fantasy film. (and a but clichéd too) Everything is different from the older ones. There are new teachers, new spells, new creatures, and even a great twist at the end. I'm not sure if this is the best of all the Harry Potters, but it certainly ranks among that region, at least until I see the new one.8/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic that I have been waiting for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) leaves early for Hogwarts after blowing up his aunt (literally) and quickly finds out that a man named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from a high-security prison called Azkaban and may attempt to kill Harry. Harry also learns that Sirius Black is partly responsible for the murdering of his parents and was a big supporter of Lord Voldemort.Upon arrival Hogwarts, the students are greeted with a new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher (this makes 3 in the past 3 years) named Professor Lupin (David Thawlis) and Death Eaters (The creatures that guard Azkaban who feed on emotion) who are now guarding the school grounds in search of Sirius Black. Harry quickly finds himself in another adventure with his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).This is the best Harry Potter movie yet. Alfonso Cuaron was exactly what the Harry Potter movies needed. He brought darkness that the others lacked and "Prisoner" had possessed throughout the book. The adaptation of the four hundred page book was outstanding. I wish the movie was a little longer, but the movie included everything that was important except for the story on how the map came into being but that isn't desperately important.The acting was finally the caliber of acting that I wanted to see in the franchise. Daniel Radcliffe finally showed me the complexity that Harry showed throughout the novels and Gary Oldman was also incredible. I was really looking down to having a big name actor in the franchise, but he played it very well. I can't say that Michael Gambon did as good of a job as the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, but he did a fair job and you can't really do anything about that. Overall, "Prisoner" had everything that the others lacked but is still not the perfection that I need to see from the Harry Potter Franchise. I can only hope that The Goblet of Fire can satisfy my need for the perfect Harry Potter film. This film is great, but I want incredible.I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

Gone are all the ludicrous CGI-moments from the first two movies, what we get are flawless and sometimes amazing effects with one or two exceptions **spoilers start like the werewolf-scenes. But even the are not too bad. But the way, the movie depicts the meandering and moving set af the Shrieking Shack, the horrifying dementors and some other creatures is just incredible! ** spoilers end Where the first two movies apologized their lengths with "sticking to the books", the script here is fast-paced, clever and atmospheric. Where most oft the roles in HP 1 and 2 felt like "cameos", the cast is superb in this one, even the kids are not only delivering their lines, but acting all the way. Kudos to Alfonso Cuarón!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read all the books so far, and enjoyed all the films so far. I didn't fault the first two films for their almost slavish loyalty to the books. This film, however, made more judicious cuts and a few more slight alterations, and I think it is to be commended for it. This is the first in the series that was truly and adaptation, rather than a transcription. As the books get longer, you can expect more changes as the series gets on, to get each story down to a manageable movie length.In this film, Cuaron keeps a very tight focus. Anything not related to Harry and his friends maturing and becoming young adults, or that doesn't contribute to the story of Sirius Black, is gone. The result is a much tighter story. The film doesn't follow the entire Quidditch season, or include the mystery of who sent Harry a replacement broom and why. In the book, that subplot serves to cast doubt in the audience's mind as to Sirius's guilt, since he obviously sent the broom, but it seems to have nothing wrong with it. That doesn't speed the story along towards its climax, so the gift is moved to the very end. The scene where Lupin confiscates the Marauder's Map was originally set after Harry returns from another forbidden trip to Hogsmeade. Here, he is trying to track down Peter Pettigrew, whom he saw on the map. Therefore, the scene ties much more directly into the main story. And if we weren't told who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were, so what? It's not essential to the story. You don't need that to know how Lupin and Black knew how to use the map. I could easily argue that the book was lacking an explanation for how the Weasley twins knew how to use it.Despite not dealing directly with Voldemort, this film, and the book it is based on, mark an important turning point in the series. Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew become important characters later on. Harry begins to grow up. And his relationship with Dumbledore, I think, begins to change as well. As Harry gets older, he needs more mentors than just Dumbledore, and Harry and Dumbledore need to relate to each other as adults, not as a kindly old grandfather to a young child. I think it's appropriate, then, that this is the film where we get a new Dumbledore, and that Gambon brings a new take on the role.</fullReview>

I know, I know, it's only BASED on the book, but still, he could have done a better job. Hopefully, the 4th movie is a bit better. i also didn't really like the fact that they didn't wear their robes.. And I don't really remember them making weird noises in their bedrooms. Some of it was okay though, but still, someone needs to fire that director and get the old one back. Some people say that the new Dumbledore was pretty bad, but he seemed okay to me. Actually he seemed to be the only okay thing about the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was OKAY but it could be better. If you've read the books then you'll see how much detail was skipped completely. Like when Harry gets his Firebolt broomstick at the end. He was supposed to get that in the middle of the movie. They also skipped about three quidditch matches that were somewhat important for the movie. Sirius Black was also supposed to infiltrate the castle TWICE. He was supposed to get inside the boys' dormitory and be standing over Ron Weasley with a 12 inch hunter's knife. But this movie was also better than the last two because in my opinion, the new actor for Albus Dumbledore was better than the last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent film but still lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is part of the highest caliber in literature. One that not only appeals to every age group; but shines with an excellent storyline full of plot twists and imagination. This book is part of the current most popular book series that has possibly ever existed. It is expected that the film interpretation of this book would be critically acclaimed with cleverness and great appeal to all audiences. Unfortunately this is not the case.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is directed by Alfonso Cuarón. After the first two movies were directed by Chris Columbus it seemed that films were not good enough for the plus- 10 million dollars that he was being paid. This turned out to be a dreadful mistake on Warner Brothers part. Alfonso Cuarón was definitely the bad choice to head the multi million dollar production that is "The prisoner of Azkaban". It is still questioned why Cuarón was hired for this job with his mere credentials being several low budget films, The Little Princess and the very disturbing Y Tu Mama Tabien. Cuarón brought his very unusual styles of directing to the mix. He adds very unusual cuts and makes a sub-par interpretation that would make writer J.K. Rowling ashamed. He doesn't bring the appropriate seriousness to the film as it often seems like a joke.The film begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) now 13 years old, starting his third year at Hogwarts. The wizarding world has been shaken up, due to the recent escape of Sirius Black from the wizarding prison of Azkaban. The significance of Black is that he was the person convicted of leading the dark Lord Voldemort to Harry's parents. It is believed that he is bent on finishing his task by killing Harry as well. Adding to Harry's troubles are phantom like creatures called Dementors. These heartless beings are sent to guard Hogwarts from Sirius Black. With all the stress of these terrifying beings and the person who gave away his parents location which lead to their death; Harry has become angry. No longer a helpless child Harry has grown up to become a darker and more powerful person.Harry reunites with his two best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson) to continue the wonders of Hogwarts Wizarding School. Harry is helped by the new defense against the dark arts teach Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) to learn to defend himself against Sirius Black and the treacherous Dementors. Harry doesn't ever seem to catch a break as his troubles only get worse.The movie overall is decent, the acting is surprisingly good for the young actors and the more experienced actors Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Gary Oldman all do terrific jobs of portraying their characters. However after the death of Richard Harris the role of Dumbledore was given to Micheal Gambon. Gambon however does in my opinion an inaccurate portrayal of the Headmaster failing to show the wisdom and care that Harris brought to the screen. Even so his appearances in the book are minimal as he does not affect the film in a big way. The CGI effects in this movie are excellent as the visual effects seem to get better and better. The realism in the broomstick flying and the creatures are phenomenal and the effects team deserves a pat on the back. Overall this movie is worth seeing for any Harry Potter fan, and should appeal for the average person to see it at least once. Unfortunately is seems like the opportunity to make a great film was squandered by Director Alfonso Cuarón and it is disappointing to watch and think "what could have been a great movie"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to turn in a great book into a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have done it before, ruin a great book by making a film about it, but this is by far one of the worst book movies ever. I love the Harry Potter books, every single one of them has a sort of magic that's very rare, a magic that both kids and adults like. The movies on the other hand, are a totally different story.The first movie was, well, OK, it wasn't bad, but it was no Lord of the Rings. The second one was a bit worse, but still, fun to watch, but the third, my god what were they thinking when making this movie?My thought is that they took the book, took some elements from it, the ending, the beginning, and some other small things that affected the story line and rewrote a completely new book from there on, because almost everything has been done differently. Now this could be a good thing, if the book wasn't the best Harry Potter book and virtually impossible to improve.So what has gone wrong you wonder, well, nearly everything. It starts at scene one, where harry blows up his aunt, the book didn't say she flew away and was never to be seen. And so it goes on, Harry doesn't spend weeks in London, now it's only a day, we don't see him, Hermione and Ron going shopping in Diagon Alley, and Harry finds out about Black in a totally different way.And the trend goes on, most things changing slightly, but some major events changing big time.One thing that probably annoyed me the most, was the ending, it sucked with a capital S. Harry get's his new broom and flies off. What, but didn't Black give that to him halfway his year, and didn't he won the quidditch season with it. Yes, but apparently not in this movie, in this movie there is no quidditch, except for the first match. In this movie, Harry is just scared of the dementors and that's the reason he's learning the Patronus charm. But why should he be, the dementors aren't allowed at school grounds by Dumbledore, so he has nothing to fear. I think they just wanted to squeeze the broom into the movie, and by doing so, ruining in ending.Now, if the story was all that went wrong, that would be one thing, but there are so many things, bad acting, bad lighting, bad casting (Emma Thompson never convinced me as Trelawney), David Thewlis wasn't bad, but good no. The only one who really convinced me was Gary Oldman. I really saw him as Sirius Black. Of the three main players, Rupert Grint was the best, Emma Watson wasn't bad either, Radcliffe, how in gods name he became Potter will always remain a mystery to me. But this was his worst acting performance by far.And so what do we have after 2 hours of film. Well, I really don't know, if you know the story line, the movie is entertaining, but nothing more than that, and if you don't know the story line, you never will, because everything is rushed into. It's a big book, and they fitted it in 2 hours, but that won't work. Nobody cares if it's a 3 hour movie, I didn't care with movies like LotR, and I wouldn't care with Harry Potter, even better, I'd love a 3 hour movie, but make it a Potter movie.What the makers tried was to make a film both enjoyable for the Potter fans who had read the book at least once, and to the lesser fans as well, who had only seen the movies. And this movie is a disappointment to both. The real fans will see a ruining of a brilliant book, and the movie fans will see a movie without a storyline. I'm really sorry I have to rate a Potter movie like this, even more because the third book is still my favorite one. But that's how it is, hopefully part 4 will be better, otherwise they might try to get Peter Jackson to direct the movie, because otherwise, I have little hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter and the Canon of Azkaban</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this opening day and was all excited because it was my favorite book in the series. Well, let me tell you. What a let down. As a movie by itself it was relatively okay. It just left to much unknown. More than one person who hasn't read the book has asked me question because they didn't explain things in the movie. My friend was utterly lost about the Maurader's Map and why Harry's Patronus came out a stag.The movie just left to many plot holes for people who were uninformed. My group of friends and I (huge Harry fans by the way) came out of the movie down-hearted. In the whole series, my two favorite characters are Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. I thought they screwed- up the portraying of these two men. Lupin, in the books is reserved and sensitive, not brash to Harry and a show tunes fan. Sirius is supposed to be sickly and dirty, but not decrepit and tattooed (anyone else wonder why it looked like he had a menorah on his chest). The story was almost so far from canon that I wanted to scream.Out of all the Harry Potter films so far, I must say this is probably the most entertaining, but the farthest from canon. If your a canon freak like me, stick to Chamber of Secrets. I can only hope that Goblet of Fire is somewhat canon, but from what I heard it maybe a downer too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When they released Harry Potter's first movie I must confess I was a little bit reluctant; I mean, I thought it was gonna be such an stupid thing like all those Walt Disney 90's products (Mermaid, Alladdin, and so?), those movies that are to be watched by stupid children. Anyway, I decided to watch it (I hadn't read none of the books neither), and it was quite a surprise. It reminded me of some great fantasy movies that I've always loved such as "Labyrinth", "Neverending Story", etc. I really liked it, and I liked the second part two. Mr. Columbus made an outstanding job to be enjoyed by children, adults, grandpa's? Now this "Prisoner Of Azkaban" came with some changes: first of all the director wasn't Chris Columbus anymore, and instead of him they recruited Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá También"). I thought that he wouldn't be as good as Columbus, just because he has no experience on filming fantasy stuff, full of special effects and with a big big budget? But then again I was wrong: Cuarón has demonstrated that he is as good in this genre than in any other else."Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban" is the darkest movie of this series, full of terrifying creatures, and with a nice plot. You won't look away for a second all along its 140 minutes of length. The story it catches you, that fantasy world, Howard's, the teachers, the talking pictures!, and some secrets that are revealed. The starring trio does it as well as in the two previous parts. We've lost Richard Harris as the director of the school (rest in peace, Mr. Harris), but Michael Ganbom makes a honorable substitution. We got some new teachers two, such as Emma Thompson's weird character (look at those glasses!!!), and last but not least, we got the Prisoner of Azkaban: the histrionic (that's why I love him, any problem about it?) and excessive Gary Oldman.The best that someone can say about a movie like this is that it is QUITE an entertaining artifact. I like drama, and social cinema? but from time to time you need to go back to your childhood, and escape from this adult world watching movies like Harry Potter's ones.My Rate: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey there. I've read all of the current Harry Potter books, and being in my late 50s didn't spoil the fun for me one bit. In fact I have a huge crush on Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Oh, I love Harry too, Daniel is a real cutey but, I feel so much for the Weasleys, all of them, because of how the horribleMalfoys treat all. It was like when I was a little girl and watched "Peter Pan" on TV for the first time, it was a play, and Mary Martin played Peter. That didn't matter, it was the adventure of it all that got me into wanting to read everything and anything I could on those sorts of adventures. Anything that took you away from everyday reality and lead you into another world! I never thought that I would actually get hooked on the Harry Potter books, but a young boy that I was baby-sitting for had gotten the book I think it was "The Goblet of Fire", for a Christmas present, and left it over my house for me to read. After I was through, I was thoroughly hooked. I had a sad feeling that the production wouldn't, no, couldn't be as magical as the books were. I thank heaven that I was wrong! To me it is right up there with the thrilling "Matrix" series. Yes, I say honestly that I love the Harry Potter movies, and I have seen them all to date, just as much as I loved, "The Jungle Book", the "Star Trek" series and the movies, the "Star Wars" movies, "Blade Runner", The TV series, "Farscape", "The X-Files", "Star-Gate", the movie and the series! I could go on and on, 'cause I am a SciFi fanatic! I even loved "A Wrinkle in Time", and if you haven't read that book, I really think that you should!!! You wouldn't be sorry! I loved Gary Oldman in Bram Stoker's Dracula, of course, but even more, I loved him in "The Fifth Element"!!! Zorg was a fantastic character for him to play, and he played him to the hilt! I watch any movie that he is in, when it comes on TV, (He is one of my favorite actors, next to Mickey Rourke, you know)? I also love Jason Isaacs in his part, Malfoy, he is so sleazy, and mean. So different than he was as Mr. Darling and so good as Captain Hook! Or in Resident Evil, which are the only other parts I remember him in! Oh my daughter, Cherokee just told me he was in Elektra!!! Another great movie. I loved Richard Harris as Dumbledore, I'll miss him. I do think that Michael Gambon is doing a wonderful job replacing him. Many people I talked to didn't know the difference, but then they aren't videophiles, like my three children and I am!!! Anyway, I just wanted to give "Kudos" to the entire cast of all of the Harry Potter movies!!! You've made me so happy to be able to "get away from it all" in your cinema world. Thanks J.K. Rowling for the books. True gifts at ten times the price!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw POA I was so disappointed I wanted to cry. I've read the books, so the unexplained parts didn't confuse me, but the people I saw the movie with, people who didn't read the book were left clueless. Now, I'm not one of those fans who wanted to see every sentence of the book on the screen, but important parts had been left out, things that needed explanation. If even just a sentence's worth, but should've been made clear. The names on the Marauder's Map meant nothing to those who didn't read the books, as did the reason for Snape wanting revenge on S. Black. The Hogwarts area layout change was quite rattling, although I find myself wishing things would've looked this way in the first two movies. I liked this arrangement better, but the difference was still jarring. The new Dumbledore was another shock, instead of the wise, twinkling, soft spoken old man we got a bit of a goofball. There is something "off" about Gambon's Dumbledore, he is a bit too loud for me, but since he had such a small part in this movie I'll wait for seeing him in GOF before I decide I really don't like him. Aside from him I found the entire cast excellent, Radcliffe and Watson more confident in their roles as ever, but poor Rupert Grint got the short end of the stick: he was more of a buffoon than ever. If that kid decides to leave the series I will not be surprised, his character is not treated very well. A pity, I really like him. Thewlis is great as Lupin, Oldman is just like I imagined Sirius, and Spall is delightfully revolting. I would've loved to see more of Alan Rickman, his character is another one not well treated by the screenplay. The rest of the movie is excellent. The music is beautiful, and the Special effects are incredible. The Dementors, the Patronus and Buckbeak simply blew my mind, although I thought the werewolf was a bit of a laugh. All in all, despite my first disappointment I learned to enjoy the movie. It simply grew on me, after I was finally able to slip over the unexplained parts, and just let my eyes go wide at the beauty of it. So this isn't a great movie, but certainly a pretty one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>don't get me wrong. i LOVE the harry potter series. i haven't fully enjoyed the movies as muck as the books, but this one has hit an all time low. the third movie has a new director. and he got the whole harry potter thing wrong. i should know, after reading each book 20+ times. first of all, he makes the night bus sequence all wrong. there is NO shrunken head no the bus, and when the night bus travels through the world, it doesn't get smaller as it runs into objects. the objects jump out of the way. second of all, the characters act all different than how Miss J.K Rowling portrays them in the books. thirdly, the quiddich scene sucks. the other guys did a much better job. doing the quiddich scenes. fourthly, why didn't he put cho Chang in the movie! she was an important part of the third book! fifthly, harry potter CRIES during the movie where in hell did THIS ALPHONSO GUY GET THE IDEA THAT HARRY SHOULD CRY DURING THE DAMN MOVIE! he does get one thing right though. the magical creatures look awesome this time around. the Dementors, Buckbeak, and Werewolf Lupin are portrayed perfectly. that is the only thing saving this movie from a two. i do not recommend this movie. if you wan't a good cinematic harry potter experience, watch harry potter one and two. it gets a five, out of tenGOOD POINTS: 1: portrayed the magical creatures well.BAD POINTS: 1:where is cho Chang?2; horrible quiddich scene!3: knight bus scene gone horribly wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great! The kids get better and better in the acting. they were a lot less tense this time around. I feel like a dork cuz I am 21 and like the Harry Potter movies. I never read the books but if they are like the movies they are great. J.K. Rawling has a very wild imagination. It would be great if we could all have friends like those 3. The effects in it are great. The scenery is awesome too. The bird type creature cracks me up. I think I would have a heart attack if I ever seen one of those. It would be great to fly on though. Whoever did they casting in these movies sure did pick a great Harry Potter. Looks just like him. He is adorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was visually a great movie, but if you're a loyal fan of the Harry Potter books (I am) then you'll probably be pretty disappointed. They left out some very important points.. The fact that Harry's dad, Sirus, Lupin and Pettigrew MADE the Mauraders Map, and that James Potter was an animagius who turned into a stag (ta da! Harry's patronus). I also didn't think Gary Oldman was a great choice for Sirus. He did pretty well, but just isn't true to how J.K. Rowling describes him. Chris Columbus was much more faithful to the books. This movie is enjoyable if you don't focus on how much it leaves out. So just sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is, but don't count on it to be an accurate representation of the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry's Keys to Success: Step 3 ? Supremacy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prisoner of Azkaban. To many, the most favorite novel of the Harry Potter series. Many expected much from this film. It delivers. The key to Azkaban is its establishment of supremacy. However the best film in the series came much short of the Box Office haul of Chambers and Stone. Azkaban takes advantage of the aging of the characters. For once in Hollywood, the damn child actors look like their own age. (Yes I'm looking at you Shia Laboeuf, Hillary Duff, Frankie Muniz, but especially you Ms. Alison Lohman. For shame, Alison...) As the movie takes advantage of this, it's easier for the actors to focus on building their characters from the books. Azkaban is also accompanied with many well-done visual effects including the Dementors and Mr Lupin's true form. And its biggest power boost, the addition of the new director Alfonso Cuarón mustn't be overlooked. He did a great job with the direction of the film as the story is told with great quality.This time around (for those who haven't read the novel nor seen the movie), Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) enter their 3rd year and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As a routine, there is a new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor but much more is behind that. A convict from the magical prison of Azkaban has escaped and everyone believes he is after Harry. With the help of his friends, family, professors, and more, Harry must overpower this convict. Except to that point of the book and movie, that's exactly what they want you to think.Overall, The Prisoner of Azkaban shines greater than the other Potter films. You just have to see yourself what gives this movie its edge of the others as it establishes supremacy to the series. The direction, acting, VFX, all of it is perfect and strongly satisfies the Potter fans. I don't really believe I qualify as a hard-core HP fan as I was before due to the fact that I haven't finished The Order of the Phoenix to this day and when I hear the name Half Blood Prince, my blood doesn't necessarily rush... Will Goblet of Fire match this film? Only time will tell and what element it will establish in 2005.My Rating: 8/10Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third of the Potter films is, by far, the visually most impressive one. The not-so-great effects from previous films are all gone, and replaced by some top notch work. Also, the overall look and feel of the film is darker and more interesting than before. That said, there are still huge problems.The plot is still virtually the same as the other two: Potter at home, mean foster family, some magic, meet up with Ron's family and off to school, a couple of new teachers, some new mysterious danger, nobody telling Potter anything, evil Malfoy brat bullying people, more talk about Harry's parents, Quidditch, and some incomprehensible talk leading up to yet another anti-climax. As before, it seems vital to have read the novels if you're going to get to grips with what's happening on screen.The acting is a bit better in this outing, but it's still far from perfect. And, the script is pretty messy, making little or no sense, and with some annoying things as well (Potter's fainting grows tiresome real fast). Now that they've got the film to look good, I'm just waiting for someone that dares to really adapt the book for the screen, making a "real" film out of it, rather than just an illustrated version of the book aimed squarely at the die-hard fans.

		<shortDescription>Cool Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a mad harry potter fan and i think that this movie is awesome and my favorite so far. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. My Favorite character is Hermione and also Harry. The first two were also very good and i can't wait to see the next harry potter film. My favorite part was when Hermione punched Malfoy. I reckon snape is trust worthy and will probably become friends with harry in a later time. The Demntors were very cool and spooky. It has a few differences than the book like when harry rides the Firebolt at the end well he actually rides it near the middle of the story. I would recommend this movie for people aged 10 years and over as it is rather scary and would terrify young children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again, Harry makes a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>have been a fan of Harry Potter movies ever since they came out. I really knew nothing of the books, but the trailers had me curious. I loved the first two, and this one is just as good. Some of the movie I actually like even better then the first two. The story isn't as strong, but the direction is great. I love the style of the film. The movie just seems darker, more dangerous, dirtier. The first two movies really seemed like movies made from books. This movie seems as though it was written to be a movie. ALl of the characters are getting older and learning more so I think the change in tones and feel of the movie were appropriate. Really the one thing that makes the Potter movies are the stories. Every story is well written and so are the screen plays. This is a movie for kids as well as adults. Everyone can enjoy this movie. It was one of my favorite movies of '04. Very good sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film, Very Well Done by Cuaron (Maybe Some Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the Harry Potter books a lot, they're really fun to read and have some good suspenseful moments (except for the end of Book Five, which only really evoked anger. Thank God for Fred and George) and great images that you can think of in your mind. Are the books the best thing ever written? No. Not even close, but they're still great. And my favorite one so far (waiting in anticipation for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and whatever Book Seven will be) is Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban. Don't get me wrong, the first two were great, but Book Three took the cake.I really like the books, but am not the biggest fan of the franchise.I was disappointed in the first two films. Film One wasn't very good at all, too much CGI and the kids weren't really working their characters Film Two was much better, but again, the kids weren't the characters and there was way too much CGI camera effects. So what did I expect about Film Three? First, I was stoked to see that Chris Colombus wasn't going to direct these films, and when I found out that Alfonso Cuaron (from Y Tu Mama Tambien and A Little Princess fame) was helming this project I was psyched out of my mind and I probably anticipated this film more than any other this summer (and third for the entire year, after The Incredibles and Kill Bill Volume 2).Was I let down?No. First of all, Cuaron says a nice "Screw You" to Colombus's vision of a happy castle where everyone gets along and little furry woodland creatures come up and sing songs. Hogwarts is now dark and mysterious, now maliciously lurking in the shadows. More like the Hogwarts I pictured while reading the books. And then there's this cool bridge thingy that stretches out, which is one of my favorite editions, along with the clocktower. If not for anything else, check out this film for its amazing cinematography and superb direction by Cuaron.The actors finally come into their characters. And Emma Watson becomes a total hottie. I think what helped a lot is the focus more on entering puberty and growing up rather than playing with magic. On a sidenote, Cuaron had the kids write an essay about their characters. Daniel Radcliff turned in one about 3 pages long, Emma Watson turned one in 16 pages long, and Rupert Grint didn't even do it. But the kids are now the characters and you're totally engrossed by the story.Which is: Harry Potter is going back to Hogwarts, but is being pursued by this escaped convict from the wizard version of Alcatraz, Azkaban. Everyone is scared pantsless and dementors (basically Ringwraiths that can fly and suck out your soul, but are still cool nonetheless) patrol the school grounds. We find out that the convict is Sirius Black, a friend of the Potters who betrayed them and wants to kill Harry because he wants Voldemort to go back to power (or does he?). Harry gets pissed and wants to kill him for doing what he did. I did have a few problems with the film, that kept it from being perfect. I thought the confrontation with Sirius Black was a little TOO rushed. And the werewolf really didn't do anything for me.But those problems are cancelled out by the best time-travel scene so far and the wonderful acting and cinematography. Not to mention the CGI effects are mainly thrown in the background, since Cuaron wisely wants to focus more on the characters, something that I think Colombus would have never done. That's not to say there aren't any. But they look good and fit with everything else in the film. Like Buckbeak, who is very well done, and then the return of the Whomping Willow, now more as a character rather than a prop. Still, this film also has my favorite CGI camera work, when we go through this clocktower...So awesome. I saw this with a friend and he had more problems than I did and complained about them before saying he overall liked the movie. I really only had those two problems so I really, really enjoyed it. With the fans of the books this is either their favorite (as in my case) or their least favorite, and from what I've seen on message boards and stuff, it seems to be the same for the films. I say check it out, because it's really worth it. I give it 3.5/4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure and utter crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoilers) I resisted going to see this film in the theater because it is my favorite of all the Harry Potter books, and I didn't want to see it butchered. I only watched it because I got a copy free at the grocery store for buying 60 bucks worth of groceries that I would have bought anyway. So I finally watched it, and was horrified and appalled.Where to start? At the beginning, because that's a very good place to start. The first thing we see is Harry studying under his covers-using his wand! He is not supposed to use magic outside the school, and here he is casually doing it! And this is just in the first minute of the movie! It just goes downhill from there. A miniscule and confusing plot line, lots of stupid and confusing add ons(why didn't they use that time to establish the plot and characters, instead of ADDING stupid bits on like the shrunken heads and choirs everywhere?)many, many ultra talented actors underused or cast in roles completely wrong for them, terrible special effects, no establishment of the necessary plot elements to carry the series into the next film, and large chunks of the story cut out altogether or changed in the most ridiculous manner with no logical reasons for it...I could go on, but I'll refrain. One example, though..Crookshanks, who is barely in the movie, steals the codes for the painting from Neville in the book and brings them to Sirius. He tries his best to eat the rat Peter or capture him. He is working with Sirius Black. But in the movie, the cat is barely there, and cut out of a pivotal part out by the Whomping Willow and in the Shack altogether. Why establish the cat in the movie and then never bother to use him?The castle has indeed changed, as have the grounds. In the new Hogwarts, you have to walk down a steep hill to get to Hagrid's house. The castle itself looks like a cross between Mad King Ludwig's Bavarian fantasy castle, a Roman ruin, and an Italian villa. The forest looks like a California Redwood forest, not somewhere in Scotland. In the scene where the students are first meeting Buckbeak, they looked like they'd wandered onto a nature trail in Yosemite national park. I kept expecting a park ranger to appear and tell them not to litter or start a campfire.People have commented that the young actors are becoming more established in their characters. That is correct-although those characters are completely different than in the books. Ron is a whiner, Harry a bitchy little twerp, and Malfoy a blubberer. When he begins to nearly sob when Hermione threatens him with her wand, and then runs away in terror after she hits him, i was snorting in disbelief and disgust. PUh-lease.The werewolf was the worst special effect of all, although none of the rest were very good. It looked like a cross between a hairless dog and a baboon. The Dementors were pretty bad, too. And that spider that Ron conjured as the thing he feared most-I haven't seen a spider that bad since the giant spider puppet that Miles O'Keefe was fighting in Ator the Fighting Eagle. How could anyone spend so much much and end up achieving such awful and lame special effects?Micheal Gambon's Dumbledore was just dreadful. He was even worse than Richard Harris, who appeared to be sleepwalking through the role. I have to ask-did all the cast split a keg of Robitussen before they started filming? Because everybody looked half asleep and bored. They weren't even trying to emote or put any depths into their characters. So most of the characters became caricatures of the ones in the books.I, too, noticed the fact that all the kids wandered around in normal clothes instead of their robes. And I have to ask-why did Harry resemble a billboard for DKNY? Where was he getting the money for designer clothes? Correct me if I am wrong, but he had to wear Dudley's cast off clothing in the books. But he's walking around in the movie in nice clothes that fit him perfectly?Sad, sad, sad. This was a pathetic film, and I am giving up on the movies altogether. And if the next book is as bad as number five, on the books as well. This is one fantasy series whose pixie dust shine is beginning to wear off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>okay....I'm going to quote my cousin on this movie..."It's really good, but it sucked compared to the books." It moved way to fast, all of a sudden it was Christmas, then it was the last day..if it would have been longer they could have added more of the better points...and the animation wasn't that good, and the grounds were different than in the first two movies, the terrain was way different, and it should have stayed the same. Personally I think the movie should be re-made with the previous director Christopher Columbus. I liked the way he directed the movies. I think the main thing I didn't like about the movie was the fact that it went to fast, Hermione didn't have time to be smart, and Harry didn't get his broom until at the end. But I think the acting got a lot better, especially Daniel and Tom's acting....I liked their acting way better than in the previous movies, but thats because they have had more experience two.~Amy Burghardt~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched Harry Potter 1 and 2 previously. Compared to the other two movie, I will say rather critically that Harry Potter was a bit of shock to me as the location of the set was changed. In the two previous movie of Harry Potter, it was set to be very like what the book wrote and I like the effects. However, In Harry Potter 3, in order to like this movie, the book must be forgotten as the plot is switched about and love-at-first-sight can be seen between the Ron and Herimone. The game that is played in the wizard world- one of them was not shown and that is the game where supposely Harry caught the snitch and won the cup. That was not shown as well as the fact that the mouse and cat's attacks. But after all, it is quite 'dark' movie and it is to highlight the power of the show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of the book I was a little disappointed with Prisoner of Azkaban. I felt it was too rushed. Lots of parts from the book which I liked were not there in the movie, and I was surprised not to see any Quidditch matches, the year Gryffindor wins the cup! I know its tough to adapt the book into a movie and please everybody.But even the pre climax sequence in the Shrieking Shack, was cut in half as compared to the book, which was almost three chapters long. Anyway, the performances were nearby excellent. Daniel and Rupert look and act their parts well. Emma was fantastic! Emma has a lot of screen time in this film as compared to the first two films, and she does full justice to the character Hermione. Of the adult actors, all were brilliant, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson and David Thewlis to name a few. The music score is excellent, the visuals are breathtaking, and the special effects are really good. I give it 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Bad... Not fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third book of the Harry Potter series has by far been my most favorite, and I would have liked its movie to go along with the book. The change of a lot of things have caused it to be slightly different and strange than the rest of the two movies. Hogwarts castle seems to be amidst tonnes of greenery and was much better in the first two movies.Professor Trelawney was not as she should be. Note: It says in the book that she is really thin (which Emma Thompson isn't!) and is always wearing a lot of shawls. Emma's acting maybe fabulous but they should've changed her appearance. She surely wasn't what came to my mind when i read the books. She is compared to a bee. She was supposed to wear a lot of glittering rings and should've spoken in a more misty voice, instead of a scary one! The voice she spoke in for the prophecy was really good though.They also made the movie really short and cut out most of the interesting parts and put in some unwanted ones. For example the scene of that scary head that says 'Yeah take it away Ern!' on the bus shouldn't have been there. They weren't even mentioned! They were also present in the entrance to the Three Broomsticks! Why? They're gruesome anyway! They've put in the boys' dormitory scene in too. It's pretty weird. They cut out the best part in the book about Harry telling Stan Shunpike that he's Neville! They also made out Tom the innkeeper at the Leaky Cauldron to be some sort of retarded kid or something! Another thing, They've made out Draco to be some sissy silly boy (which he isn't) they spoiled his good-looking evil hairstyle. His gang and himself are shown very awkwardly. I mean pushing aside kids and all! Of course Tom's acting was fabulous and he looked as good as ever! one of his croonies was different though. Everyone's slimmed down too!Something else i noticed was that there was less and less humour in it and that everyone's acting though different was somewhat unlike Harry Potter. And the use of robes had been given less and less importance by every scene! Emma Watson looks like an idiot in her short tops (they shud've been a bit longer to give them some style!) and they look like normal humans instead of wizards. The billowing of the robes is what makes Harry Potter! Emma's acting wasn't much like Hermione and so were her expressions. She was in a bad mood all the time and I think they should've made her fight with Ron and Harry. That was the best part!Harry's fire bolt should've been given to him long before and the worst thing about the movie is that there is not one scene including the dashing Oliver Wood (Sean Biggerstaff) and none with the Quidditch Cup either! They spoiled the scene halfway through the movie!And the Minister of Magic should've been shorter!Gary Oldman, no matter how good an actor he is shouldn't have been picked for Sirius's role in the very beginning. I imagined Sirius to be a cool good-looking wizard although he had spent years in Azkaban. In my opinion he should've been a bit tanner and not that foul-looking. He should've just been more cooler than he was a bit taller and more good-looking. I certainly can't see Gary Oldman as the perfect Sirius Black even with some makeup.The changes of Hogwarts castle are despecable and the portrait of the Fat lady is utterly idiotic! I mean, I know it says fat, not obese! And Parvati and Padma Patil could've been better! They are mentioned really well in HP5 and they're rather ugly shown in HP3. I think they should've been a bit more attractive! Mud is exchanged with snow, why? Also, along with Trelawney the Divination room should've been better! It should be misty and more red than it was!Along with the heaps of bad things there were loads of good things about the movie too! For example the presence of Draco Malfoy was cool enough! And there were several aspects really well done! The Boggart scene was really good and David Thewlis acted out Professor Lupin very well indeed. The Marauders Map indeed looked really good and Fred And George's acting has successfully improved. Dan Radcliffe can work on his a bit more because he really cant be as expressing as Harry should be nor as cool. He grits his teeth in half his dialogs.The Knight bus was really rad along with Ern and Stan Shunpike who couldn't be better! The stupid head thing was gross though! Crookshanks was fantastic, exactly like it was described (like it ran headlong into a wall!) it cute all the same. The way they made Harry's hair untidier this time was very well done and the Dementors were really superb. Dan has done a bit of improvement in some of his scenes but fails in all his others. The werewolf scene was plausible and so was the Time Turner thing. But removing most parts from the book is really stupid as it spoils the beautiful scenario JK creates. The movie isn't very good nor is it very bad, i would've preferred the previous director and not this one though... But whatever! All in all, it wasn't up to the expectations of most of the viewers I dare say, as it was not up to the standard of the book it represents as the third book is really awesome, just the thing the movie isn't!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This time around, I feel that too much of the story was sacrificed in making the film shorter. Characters, especially new ones, are not as fully developed as they should be, and explanations of past events are hurried. Also, I don't feel that enough time was taken to build a feeling of suspense and mystery. I was glad that I had read the book beforehand; otherwise I might have been confused about just who had done what to whom. On the other hand, the film had a darker tone, which will serve its maturing audience (and cast) well. Alfonso Cuaron is a skilled director, and I only wish that he takes more control of his mainstream films in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit. When the first teaser trailers came out in theaters I couldn't care less. I had seen the first and second potter films, but only rented them and watched them once. I didn't really care until one day I say who was the director. Legendary Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron. Because of this, I read and now own all the books and movies in the series. I knew this film would be better because of the fact that this book totally beat the first to books. But once I saw the film, I was amazed. This film is better not only because of the detail and stunning visuals. But because of the way the filmmakers took the essential essence of the books and made a film with new and interesting sub-plot points. All in all 10/10.</fullReview>

I love the camera shots and music that gave it awesome atmosphere to the movie. I was impressed to hear that two New Zealander's took part in the making of the move. Percy and Professer Lupin who was on Lord of the Rings as Faramir. I cannot wait for the next movie. The main actors must be finding it hard to grow up on film and I was impressed with their acting ability in the third film. I am worried that the main actors are to old to be playing their characters as they are so much older and it is starting to show.Especially with Rupert who plays Ron and the Weasley twins. It took half the film for me to figure out who the twins were. With the change of hair and everything. I am sure with the process of make up today for movies, it will work out that problem. But with movies everyone is to their own and I am sure there will be people who will disagree with me and think that the movies are ruining the books.I am a proud fan of Harry potter, and love the books and the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>easily the best movie so far in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Azkaban" was VERY impressive...I loved it. Of course, it wasn't as good as the book, and the 3rd book is my absolute favorite in the series. But still, enchanting and wonderful all the same. (I can't believe what Roger Ebert wrote in his review; he wrote some crazy stuff about this 3rd movie not being as good as the first two. I disagree completely; this 3rd movie is easily the best. Lots of heart.) Mind you, it will probably be difficult to follow if you haven't read the book, but if you have, this is what the movies are supposed to be about. Great, impressive acting in this movie, from all the adult actors (props especially to the new people Emma Thompson (Trelawney), David Thewlis (Lupin) and the always wonderful Gary Oldman (Sirius Black)...they were great) and surprisingly from all the kid actors too. I think Hermione and Harry are hot; whereas they were kids in the first two movies, they are turning into physically beautiful/handsome teens. Ron was good as always and is responsible for some of the funniest moments in the film. What I also liked about this movie was that a lot of it dealt with the kids going through puberty and their fears/pains of being 13. It was very sexually-loaded...there are some scenes between Hermione and Ron and Harry that are incredible to watch, not because I'm a kinky person, but because it was so beautiful. The look and feel of this movie are also wonderful. The setting (using cooler, blue and gray shades) and cinematography are totally awesome...it's a darker, scarier Harry Potter world, but still with a lot of charm. This movie is also far funnier than the other two, even though it deals with a lot more serious stuff. Also impressive: the CGI was neato. There's this cool thing that the Whomping Willow does that jockeys at the use of the CGI. (And a lot of it looks real...there's none of the fakey, used-car salesman kind of thing that they used in "Troy" with those terrible CGI armies.) In short, "Azkaban" ROCKS!!!! It's a wonderful movie and you should see it at least once on the big screen. Nothing short of magical. 10/10, definitely. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best Harry Potter yet. Alfonso Cuaron has an amazing vision. The screenplay writing is ten times better than the previous 2 films. They left out much of the book but kept in what was central to the plot. Visually, the film flows &amp; Cuaron does a great job of keeping the story moving along without skipping a beat. The acting has only gotten better among Radcliffe(Harry Potter), Watson (Hermione Granger), &amp; Grint(Ron Weasley). Grint has shown that he can be a real comic relief (the spider dream moment makes me laugh just thinking about it.) Watson is really coming into her own as the brainy girl who just keeps getting prettier. And Radcliffe....not only has he gotten incredibly adorable (he has total heart-throb capabilities), but he's really starting to shine as the lovable orphan destined to save the magical world from Lord Voldemort. Gary Oldman is perfect as Sirius Black &amp; David Thewlis gives a flawless performance as the Dark Arts teacher with a werewolf's curse. Emma Thompson pops in and is brilliant as Professor Trelawny (exactly as I pictured her!) The cast of teachers (Rickman, Smith, Bradley, &amp; Coltrane)is always great. I wish there was more of them but there will be plenty to see of them as the movies progress. Micheal Gambon takes the reins as Dumbledore. There is a slight loss of presence &amp; warmth that was once there with the beloved Richard Harris. But Gambon brings his own "magic" touch to the role that I'm sure will grow with each film. Over all, I LOVED IT! The film is hilarious although darker than the first 2. This movie has definitely lost it's cheesy Disney-like quality &amp; embraced the fact that it's a whole darker realm of mysticism &amp; magic. I cannot wait for the 4th one. I only hope that Cuaron will come back for 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen it more than once - so should you! 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who disses this movie is clearly a bitter lord of the rings fan or too proud to want to like it. The actors have grown into their roles so much more, and even though Rupert Grint's character Ron hasn't grown much, Rupert definitely has grown as an actor and is clearly the most natural of the three leads. And as much as i HATE Emma Watson, even she is really good in this film, making you forget about the ham she was in the first two. The biggest improvement however is in Daniel Radcliffe, who has improved incredibly and even drew tears in his emotional scenes from may in the audience. Tom Felton is also particularly good as Draco, and I think he is the most professional out of all of the child actors. Hey, even Fred and George are funny now, (though still not doing justice to the twins in the book). Although a little from the book has been cut, I have heard that it will be revealed through the other movies, and it just makes it more exciting for shrewd audience members to work things out for themselves. The story is a lot easier to follow than the Philosophers Stone, it is more fluent and carries the audience through the story nicely.As for those complaining that the famous adult actors do not appear a lot, I would like to remind them that this film is about the children and not the celebrities, and that the story has not been lost by reducing their screen-time - the kids have improved so much they hardly need the support of the adults. I would also like to mention that David Thewlis has one of the biggest parts in the movie and was absolutely perfect as Professor Lupin, I completely warmed to him even though he didn't look exactly as I imagined, and the relationship between him and Harry is very believable and wonderful to watch developing.Anyone who told you this film was darker was right - the atmosphere of the whole film is gloomier and scarier, and the dementors are horrifying and too realistic, and even as an adult i find one particular part hard to watch.This film is a LOT funnier than the other two, despite also being darker. Rupert Grint is a comical genius, inspiring laughter in every scene and gets the audience in stitches at the simplest of lines. Even Daniel and Emma get their fair share of laughs too, which is something we haven't seen before.Alfonso Cuaron could not have done a better job of repairing Columbus' botched-job in directing this movie. No longer are the children wearing foul, early 90s clothes, but they are dressed more casually which gives the film a more natural film. The CGI is so much better, and half the time I thought that the Hippogriff was real, it was so authentic. Little touches such as showing the season changes were humorous and visually awesome.I honestly can't find a reason why people other than the aforementioned would not enjoy this movie, I can see it will become a classic, and if the movies continue to improve at this rate we are going to have some incredible films on our hands.This definitely deserves some awards this year, 10/10</fullReview>

I really enjoyed this movie except for the fact that there was a lot of the story left out of the movie. I know this because I actually read the book. An extra 30 minutes in the movie would have allowed some more of the story to be told. I hope that when this movie is released on DVD, these missing scenes will appear as an extra on the DVD.I can't wait until the next movie, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" is at the theaters. And I hope that movie is much longer to be able to tell more of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New director = better movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban is indeed the best movie in the trilogy. This is obviously because of the switch of director from Chris Columbus to Afonso Curalon, and it is because of Curalon's impressive directing style that almost every aspect of the production is better, from the acting (especially from the kids) to the costumes (the students only wear their uniforms during classes, and outside classes they dress like normal teen agers)to the score, (Personally, I think The Chamber of Secrets score was just a mish mash of themes from The Sorcere's stone). Also this film gives Gary Oldman, one of my favorite actors, an incredible comeback and a great performance. Very good movie, lets just pray that the series continues this successful turn.</fullReview>

It was perhaps somewhat silly during the first 30 minutes, but the film grows darker and more interesting.*****Major spoiler*****I don't remember if this flaw is in the book also or just in the movie, but there is a great flaw when it comes to the time traveling. How can Harry Potter go back in time to save himself when he is already dead? He goes back in time AFTER the dementors has killed him. This makes no sense. Harry Potter dies together with Sirius fighting the dementors.*****End of spoiler*****The movie is well worth watching anyhow though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hail to Alfonso Cuarón! This film was easily the most exciting, not because of the story but because of the direction - The special effects were finally a bit "special" the previous films didn't even have smoking potions and every spell in the dual did the same thing.... $5 in dry ice would have gone a long way... I hope Alfonso Cuarón sticks with the series, he has vision and I think actually cared about the story in a way Chris Columbus didn't.Sure there were some minor flaws (how did Lupin know the parchment was a map?) but what film doesn't?If folks are concerned about it being dark, read the books, it only gets more dark - the bad guy is coming. I expect they will need to replace some of the actors as time goes by unless they crank out two or three movies at once like they did with LOTR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem when we take literature and turn it into a film, the reading purists never seem to be satisfied. The other problem is for the average movie goers, and why sequels are never good enough, is our expectations become too high for the film to succeed. Harry Potter is a series, not a trilogy, or whatever the correct term will be when all whatever are made. It is not one epic story; instead it is several small adventures that the characters experience. With that said, the ultimate "problem" Harry Fans are the fans that did not read the first book, until they saw the movie, then started reading, so in there minds eye, Daniel Radcliffe is used for Harry, and Columbus's vision of Hogwarts et all becomes our vision. So now we bring in another interpretation, and quite frankly I was very satisfied. This film had a more naturalistic approach to lighting and framing, and the Director used his style and the use of a grainier film to achieve something that this story has, that the others do not. A darker, more realistic use of imagery that goes hand in hand with the book. Think back, Harry was a mere child during the first film, and his vision of life and Hogwarts was more mystical and surreal. But as he grows, his vision of the world changes, matures, becomes more real. Now being a wizard is more realistic, and almost mundane to Harry and his friends. The cinematography and imagery portrays this very well.So get over it. The Harry we knew is now gone. So is Harry's innocence. I love's his outburst of rage and anger, it is very real.I'll have to admit, the landscape felt different, but I also felt this was the first film that gave Hogwarts a true location. We didn't just magically appear in the Quiddich arena, or just show up to Haggeret's Hut; we saw where everything was in relation to another, giving a better sense of reality. I like the change, though I will admit, still on my Director's Cut of LOTR kick, I would love a directors cut of this film to be longer, with more from the book. And that is why we have DVD's.PS. I've read some chatter about the misplacement of the Whomping Willow. Can't there be more then one. It is Hogwarts by all means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather good Harry Potter movie (at last)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing "The Chamber of Secrets" I promised myself not to see another HP movie in my life again.I'm not among those great fans that get angry at the huge but inevitable cuts that transform the very long HP books into an affordable screenplay. That's absolutely fine with me.But I have to say I'm among those people that do not like Chris Columbus's (er) talent as a director.This new HP by Cuaron is rather different, in that you get a lot of beautiful images, as Hogwarts is presented in a darker, yet more elegant way. The special effects look better, maybe because there is no 'final monster' to spend gazillions of money for, and so they could concentrate on those effects that are throughout the movie.The new characters add a new interesting twist, especially Prof. Lupin, whose final lines seem to allude at things that are definitely not meant for kids. Let's give it 7 out of 10.Shame on the producers that have given the fourth installment to Newell. We'll see if he can do better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Potter &amp; The Prisoner of Azkaban is a curious movie. It is probably the best of the 3 HP films so far, being a bit more sinister &amp; gothic in both the look &amp; content. It has, on the whole, better performances from the cast than the other movies. It doesn't seem to drag like the first 2 did in places. And the special effects are dazzling. Yet, as I pondered the movie a couple of hours after I had seen it. I found myself thinking `Yes it was probably the best of the 3 HP films so far, but what was missing' Well I eventually realised what was missing after watching the ?HP &amp; the Chamber of Secrets' with my kids later that evening. I shall come to the missing ingredient a little later. It's Harry's 3rd year at Hogwarts School of Wichcraft &amp; Wizardry, &amp; yet again he is caught up in mysterious goings on. The mass murderer Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard's prison `Azkaban' &amp; is making a B-line for Hogwarts &amp; in particular, it seems, Harry himself. It transpires that Sirius Black was the wizard responsible for the Death of Harry's parents, at the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort. As a result, the guards of Azkaban, or Dementors (think floaty Ringwraiths), have been stationed at Hogwarts to try to stop him. They do seem more intent on trying to suck the soul out of our hero. (That's what a Dementor does to its victim. It sucks all of the goodness out them until they are nothing but a living shell of a human). Add to this a Werewolf, a Hippogriff (a half horse, half eagle that can fly) &amp; a menacing black dog that seems to be stalking Harry, &amp; you have movie choc full of mystery &amp; marvel. Now to the positives &amp; negatives. Alfonso Cuaron has managed to get the best out of Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter). He seems to be more at ease in front of a camera, when delivering his dialogue &amp; you get the feeling that he has actually been given the proper encouragement &amp; coaching. He seems to be a far more confident actor than the wooden puppet of the previous films. The other child actors are also very good, with both Emma Watson &amp; Rupert Grint (Hermione Grainger &amp; Ron Weasley) showing that they could have big careers ahead of them. In fact, the cast as a whole are pretty damn good. Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane &amp; Dame Maggie Smith all slide comfortably back in to their usual rolls &amp; are, as usual, excellent. The new members of the cast are also very good, with David Thewlis excellent as Professor Lupin and the magnificent Gary Oldman (chewing up &amp; spitting out every scene he is in, with relish) as the sinister Sirius Black. The actor with the hardest job out of the whole cast was Sir Michael Gambon. He had the unenviable task of replacing the late Sir Richard Harris. Thankfully he slips in to Dumbledore's robes with the minimum of fuss, playing it more as a bumbling old hippy rather than the imperious &amp; imposing Harris' Dumbledore.The only real disappointment in the cast is Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney. She over compensates for limited screen time, with over the top, hammy nonsense. The visual effects, as you might expect, are top notch. Cuaron seems to have taken a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book, letting the visual effects fit around the movie rather than the George Lucas style of let the visual effects be the movie. The pacing of the film is just about spot on as well. It's not too long &amp; it manages to stick to the book fairly well (although the lack of explanation about the origins of the Marauders Map was fairly irritating).But. There were a few minus points as well as that missing thing I mentioned earlier. Again, as with the first two movies, Alan Rickman is woefully under-used as the bitter &amp; twisted Prof. Snape &amp; the same goes for the glorious Gary Oldman &amp; his movie stealing performance. And the biggest thing to be missing was a standout action set-piece.In both previous movies, there have been major spectacular set pieces that have really stuck in my mind. In the first one (The Philosophers Stone) there was Harry's first Quidditch match &amp; the Giant Chess match. In the second (The Chamber of Secrets) there was the flight to Hogwarts in the Weasley's Ford Anglia, another impressive Quidditch match, the escape from Aragog's lair (Aragog is a giant spider) &amp; the battle with the giant Basilisk (Snake). Yet in Azkaban, there is nothing that stands out (apart from performances which some would say isn't a bad thing). Harry Potter films need a good set piece or two. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of good action sequences. The journey by Knightbus, Quidditch in a thunderstorm, a Hippogriff flight sequence &amp; a werewolf/dog fight. It's just that you get the feeling that you've seen similar before, so there is no real wow factor.On the whole this is a mightily impressive movie. Alfonso Cuaron delivered a movie as magical as the first two movies but with more depth &amp; much better performances by the impressive cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potter just keeps getting better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't read books. I have mentioned this in reviews before, but every time a Harry Potter movie comes out, I feel embarrassed that I am one of what seems only a handful of people that have never cracked open a J.K. Rowling experience.It's not that I can't read or that I don't have the time, it's just that I find it simpler to have a director tell me a story on the screen from their interpretation of a book or screenplay. The best books and stories are usually purchased by Hollywood anyways, so by the time I finally get to the back cover of any purchase, the movie version would be nearing the end of its multiplex run anyhow.So when I went to see the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I immediately felt out of place with the young pre-teen kids in the line both in front and behind telling their parental guides what their best parts of the book were and what scenes they are most looking forward too. They seemed to be foaming at the mouth in anticipation while my lone spark of interest was the fact that the reins of the franchise had been turned over to director Alfonso Cuaron who also is accredited with the wonderfully, 2003 Oscar nominated film Y Tu Mama Tambien. Such a curious choice as the first two Potter films had been incredibly successful under the watchful eye of Chris Columbus who was known for his family films like Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone. Cauron, on the other hand, has a much darker side as evidenced in the sexually driven Tambien and his 1998 adaptation of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. I was then peaked when it was announced that Cauron vision would be applied to the next Potter film and thus my standing in line with a group of rabid looking kids who I had no doubt will cheer as soon as the theatre lights dim.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third of the Potter books totaling five and this installment follows the growing Potter gang as Harry is faced with the threat of convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from Azkaban prison and is expected to try and kill our young Potter as per his former masters' wishes. Of course, the books and movies would not be as popular as what they are if it wasn't for an array of magic, special effects, and mythical creatures and maybe even a plot twist or two to help keep us on our toes. And rest assured, this adaptation has them all. The special effects are top rate including the Dementors who are sent to protect Hogwart's and the tree outside the school, that later plays a big part in the climax, is both fascinating and provides some humor. There is a creature in the film that is a cross between a horse and a bird that was too Harryhausen for my tastes, but I am sure it made for a wonderful character in the book and therefore I can't complain that they kept things consistent.Pretty much every actor in Britain plays a role in the Prisoner of Azkaban. Emma Thompson, Maggie Smith, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon (who steps into the role vacated due to the death of Richard Harris), and the Julies (Christie and Walters) all show up on screen at one time or another. I guess anyone that couldn't get work in Altman's Gosford Park joined a collective and put their efforts into this film. Gary Oldman is one of the newbees to the set and he does the best with what is a very limited and understated part. The three main characters of Potter and his two best friends are back, and it will be interesting to see them in the next Potter movie as Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are now in their mid-teens and no longer the young wizards they were just three years ago.It's always hard when it comes to the third film of a franchise. Return of the Jedi is more of an embarrassment each time I watch it (sorry, Ewoks), The Lord of the Rings and the Matrix third entries also were a disappointment. But the Potter films seem to be getting stronger each time. I will no doubt agree that the change of director this time round was instrumental in bringing a darker storyline to the table, but to continue to better your achievements in both story and screen presentation each time is a feat not often achieved. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a delight. It was a children's movie with adult situations and effects and the story was complex enough to even have me wondering to myself how it was all going to tie in together in the end. Now, I won't pick up the next book just because of my recommendation here, but I will ensure I have a ticket for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire due out in 2005.www.gregsrants.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott really hit on something for cinematic fantasy with 'Legend.' Just think, how many millions of dollars has Warner dumped into the 'Potter' and 'Rings' franchises only for them to blindly rip from Scott's masterpiece?Peter Jackson shamelessly plagiarized the Unicorns with his own ugly mule and here the Dementors are Darkness (I should add that it's an appalling design). Besides, the plot influence of 'Legend' spread to Japan and helped forge the RPG video games. That's billions of dollars made from one source, so why duplicate Nintendo concepts? They've already been taken by anime (now under Disney control in the US).This is your only spoiler warning...The first two 'Potter' films stunk. The director, Columbus, was a hack from the Spielberg camp of amazing us superficially versus filmic stimulation. They weren't even competent in those regards. Rowlings' formula has come to the point where she doesn't need to write anymore and should hand the rights over to Disney. But, rather than risk what Disney would do with it, she leaves it to exhibitionistic Warner--currently financing the most expensive projects of late, including this.It's Rowlings' ineptness that will probably strike many as juvenile. The writing is dumb like before, but no one has been brought in to change that philosophy. Consider, Oliver Stone made Johnny Depp the translator in 'Platoon.' Besides being a communication tool between cultures, the translator is supposed to be a master of words and dialect. Obviously, Depp has taken that to heart in his method.So to tackle the words we get a Shakespearean cast including Thompson, Christie, and especially Oldman (I'll get to that later). We even get Davis back in fantasyland after Howard abandoned him. My only complaint is that Dumbledore is exceedingly dull this time, why couldn't Branagh have taken over? That would be interesting.But that's all pointless in this film. It's all about technicals. Our photographer comes from Alan Parker this time, not Gilliam, and we have the designer of 'Elephant Man'. This is probably Craig's best work since then. The editor is pedestrian and Williams shows he is running out of tempo ideas. What really got me this time was costume design. The first two were bland, but this shows real talent in understanding colors and shape.It's amazing to see such ability overriding 'Troy.' 'Troy' had enormous amounts of technical talent, but Petersen royally screwed up the vision. Here we have a newer, fresher vision. This is Cuaron's third adaptation and shows that he finally knows what he's doing. In many cases he borrows from images we've seen before--'Wizard of Oz', 'Matrix', 'Rescuers Down Under'--but that's not his focus. Notice how, unlike the first two, this is muted in color. For the first half, despite the stupid story, I was held in awe by this Fincher-grade work straight from 'Alien3'. Too bad it didn't last into the next half.Other impressive elements:--Many scenes are constructed visually straight out of 'Catch-22' and the more dramatic lightshows are less Columbus and more directly Spielberg. Yes, I'm thinking of 'Close Encounters' and 'Empire of the Sun.'--The werewolf subplot was fumbled, but compare it to 'American Werewolf.' Rather than emphasize the Batman concept of duality and regret, we get an appreciation of the British countryside. Very nice landscapes.--Speaking of which, the cast is finally learning how to use our eye Cuaron is more appreciative in his gaze than Columbus (that could be it). Notice how Watson and Radcliffe shine more exuberantly now than before. Even Thompson does.--Now comes, quite possibly, the biggest change. The notion of play-within-play has been used before (Cervantes made it common), but this is expertly handled. This is what Zemeckis tried in 'Future' with 'Run Lola' added in--and probably why they got a Hispanic director. Watch as the characters interfere with themselves and are concerned with the passage of time. I bet it's because of this quasi-parallel universe that Oldman got the title role. Now I just wish we'd seen more of him, he's the British Depp.So, given the hamhanded attempt at maturity, this is what 'AvP' should be...the fifth 'Alien'. Not as dark as 'Empire Strikes Back', but I give kudos for trying real hard. I'll probably regret my rating later, but this is probably the most interesting sequel we'll in the near future.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative, Charming, and Clever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfonso Cuaron has made a film worthy of the title "Harry Potter." Allow me to say: it's about time! After Columbus' slow and obtuse movies, Cuaron's creativity and movement seems like a work of genius. The photography, camera work, set design, acting, and writing are all far superior to that of the first two films. Cuaron has changed the layout of Hogwarts, yes, but changed it for the better, giving character to the landscape with lakes and mountains, changing the castle and interior for a more distinct look. One of my favorite touches is the dormitory, made much cozier and zanier by crooked bunk beds. Columbus' Hogwarts looks like a coloring book; Cuaron's looks like the pet project of a rather batty architect. The director and crew took some artistic license, which, in my opinion, is all for the best. The Knight Bus performs a great stunt, squeezing itself between two Muggle buses; the Leaky Cauldron has crooked hallways and ancient hardwood chambers; Hogsmeade is beautiful in the snow. Talking heads and candy that lets you make animal sounds add to the fun.None of Columbus' dull heavy-handedness is evident here. Instead, the audience must be prepared for hints and subtleties. Cuaron shows the changing of the seasons with the drop of a leaf of the bloom of a flower. The nature of an Animagus is revealed off-handedly during a Defence Against the Dark Arts class. From this bit of information, the audience must put together the pieces and understand why Sirius and Pettigrew can transform into a dog and a rat, respectively. Similarly, you have to catch Ron's constant complaints about Hermione's sudden appearances in class to understand later how she has been using the time turner. It's an active experience; we have to pay attention to get it. Cuaron gives is facts; we have to connect the dots. Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint have all improved visibly. Once again, the direction helps. Scenes juxtaposing the Dursley's at the table with Harry slaving in the kitchen give a better sense of his emotions than simply training the camera on his face. Radcliffe proves himself in a shot where he listens to Professor Lupin talk about his parents. Since Harry and Lupin are not facing each other, Harry lets his emotions play over his face, and we as the audience can witness them. Oldman and Thewlis are fantastic, especially Thewlis, who makes us feel for him even as he is transforming into a werewolf and attacking his friends. Oldman has the typical task of being an insane murderer one moment and an innocent, loving man the next, but pulls it off with his usual skill. The Prisoner of Azkaban also retains more humor. Aunt Marge inflating and floating into the sky is priceless. Trelawney is a blast. Clever additions such as Harry's accidental "volunteering" during Care of Magical Creatures elicit a giggle. The film is sharper, wittier, and more charming.The one criticism I could level is the shortness of the Shrieking Shack scene. The dialogue was too fast here, and Cuaron could have afforded to extend it by ten minutes or so. A mention of the identities of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would also have been good and not taken too much time. Overall, however, the film is such an improvement on the first two that this can be forgiven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>---SPOILERS---There are many good things to be said about this film - such as the beautiful CGI scenes, the Hogwarts castle's "new look", and daniel radclife coming a little closer to acceptable (emotional scene outside of hogsmede not withstanding...). Furthermore, it is fair to say it is an enjoyable film and not a bad use of a couple of hours of your time, if you should decide to go and see it...but that said...In places, this film is so jaw-droppingly pretentious that it makes my head spin! Its obvious that the new director wanted to make the films somewhat more mature than Columbus's previous efforts - but the scene-setting beautyshots of hogwarts, sunsets, flowers, paper bags dancing in the wind... (oh! sorry, wrong over-wrought film!) I don't know...they seemed somehow too much like a waste of time, and felt almost coldly mechanical and contrived. I guess what i am trying to get at is that the scenes which were intended to cause me to shed tears and grasp my heart upon seeing Hogwarts in all its (new found?) melancholy beauty...well, they just left me thinking "so what!?". I guess that said shots were simply too methodical and predictable - I'm sure they could be classed as art, but only in the same way as teenage goths scrawling copies of bleak nu-metal album art along with some heartfelt words from kurt Cobains diary into their GCSE sketchbooks is art...and though I'm by no means a die hard Harry Potter fan, I did read and enjoy all the books in the series and for what its worth I would definitely question the casting and portrayal of (for example) Lupin (who was far, FAR too camp) and Sirrus Black (who again, came across as a screaming queen rather than someone who had spent over a decade having his sanity slowly ripped apart by Dementors).Also, Richard Harris was utterly superb as Dumbledore - he was everything I would have imagined Dumbledore to be in fact. Michael Gambon seems colder and less credible in the role...Some summaries:-Emma Thompson. Emma Thompson is an utterly wonderful actress. It doesn't show in this film. Watch Angels In America instead.-The weasly twins. Why? Why oh why?-I Did not like lupin. He was portrayed as being too camp, and too effeminate. I felt that 2 scenes in particular let him down - A) the train - there was something very uninspiring about his entrance, and B) The bridge scene, discussing Lilly Potter - it was so utterly contrived that i found myself completely losing interest. And the boggart-scene music, what on earth was with the music...?-The dementors were beautiful. In a sick sort of way.I liked the film, but not too much. I still feel that the process of converting the Harry Potter books into the Harry Potter films has a long way to go.6.8/10 It would have been 7.8 but it lacked...something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PoA as I saw it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is remarkable just how much better this was than the first two films. The cinematography was better, the screenplay was better. Even the acting, though still not wonderful, was better. I have to say, I was supremely apprehensive about seeing this, being as it is my favorite book of the series. I was terrified for those bits of story that always somehow seemed to be left out. To tell the truth, there were plenty of bits left behind, but the rest of the movie was so joyous to an extreme Harry Potter fan such as myself that those bits didn't seem to matter. Anyone still defending Chris Columbus and his tendency to gloss the story over will hang their heads in shame at first sight of this film. Long live Alfonso Cuaron! If only he were coming back for a second turn. Long live midnight viewings as well, while I'm at it. ;D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's keep this short and sweet.I'm a die hard Harry Potter fan and this movie was suppose to be darker. Instead we get light and fluffy. I expected this movie to be different just not this disappointing. Yeah of course the special effects were awesome and there was some humor also. Now I'm not saying the other two movies weren't a little disappointing, because the truth be told they were, but not as much as this film. I can under stand some of the changes, but lets talk about some others. Hagrids cabin, When did an earth quake happen to slide Hagrids cabin down the hill? What happen to Snape? When did he stop being sinister?Why is the Whomping Willow in a totally different spot? Why is McGonagall in this movie only once? Why is Dumbledore a bumbling old man and this one instead the powerful wizard that he is supposed to be?This is only five things that disgusted me about this movie. Luckily they have a different director for the Goblet of Fire. Hey this is just my two cents,but save your ten bucks and barrow it from the library or someone you know when it comes out on VHS or DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Director, Same Old Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third Harry Potter film has finally arrived in cinemas after a rather long two-year wait. Alfonso Cuaron takes over at the director's chair while erstwhile director Chris Columbus becomes a producer. It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts and this time he must face a new foe in the person of Sirius Black an escaped murderer from Azkaban prison who is out to get Harry.There is always a risk for a successful movie franchise to take on a new director especially if the previous one did a good job. Well I got to say that Cuaron has justified his hiring as he has done a great job in crafting this film. He was really able to capture the dark moments of the film and I as a viewer was able to feel feelings of fear and uneasiness. I also felt that some of his rather unique camera angles were really good. Really breathtaking stuff that added to the overall feel of the movie. I thought that the effects were great. The dementors looked really menacing and scary. The Hippogriffs also looked good. Even if the effects were not in a grand scale like ROTK, they still did great job in crafting these creatures and make him look real.In terms of its story I felt that it was much richer and deeper than the previous films. Definitely a much darker and deeper story, which really helped the film in the long run. I wasn't so convinced with the performance of Michael Gambon as Dumbeldore. I guess it may be because Richard Harris did such a great job in previous films that anyone who takes over pales in comparison. Harris' had a unique atmosphere which Gambon didn't have. Even though the story places the characters a year after the previous film some of the looks much older than that especially Daniel Radcliffe. I guess you really can't blame the cast, as they cannot film every year just to make the grade. I would be really interested to see how the cast look for the fourth film. Overall Cuaron did a great job in creating a great film. I must say that this is the best Harry Potter movie so far. It is really a shame that this will be the only HP film he will be able to direct. Based on what I have heard of the fourth book I must say that the next film promises to be even better than this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than Columbus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Some (very limited) spoilers*I would seriously question the aesthetic judgment of anyone who didn't immediately see that Cuaron's Harry Potter 3 is in a different league altogether from Columbus's weak and humorless efforts to realize books one and two. It's not just that the overall look and feel of film three is so much more convincing; even in the small details, the superiority of Cuaron as a director is obvious. For example, where Columbus tries to gain a sense of the end of term at Hogwarts by inserting some ploddingly conventional "Christmassy scenes" (accompanied by some sickeningly jingly music from John Williams), Cuaron treats us to a much more subtle shot - Harry's snowy owl, Hedwig, flies across a beautifully composed wide-angle shot, and as the camera follows her, the landscape behind her gradually passes from gloomy late autumnal green/grey mountains to wintry snow. The effect is altogether more mysterious. Furthermore, Cuaron's grasp of cinematic language is so much more complex and assured than the rather basic vision of Columbus. From the very beginning of the film, we have references to the passage of time, a crucial theme of book 3: the large pendulum of an enormous clock swings menacingly in a school corridor, we see Harry's face through the face of a clock way before the final time-turning episode, while models of planetary movements set the action in a more cosmic frame. Equally, the issue of identity so central to the plot of Azkaban, is foregrounded by Cuaron's use of reflection - what better way to signal the fact that Harry is beginning to grapple with the mystery of his past and the absence of his parents? Thus, the doublings of the final sequence, where Harry has to avoid his other self while he rescues his godfather, are foreshadowed by shots of Harry's face reflected in the darkened window of a train and in the rippling water of the lake. Cuaron also brings a much more vivid sense of humour to these movies than Columbus. The jokes in the first movies are often painfully laboured - one can't help feeling that Steve Kloves continues to miss the distinctive and colourful humour of Rowling's prose, in particularly her wonderful delineation of character. Cuaron is able to relieve this by inserting some visual humour - when Hagrid produces the hyppogriff, Harry finds himself "volunteering" only because the rest of the class have backed off in horror!That's not to say that the movie is perfect. Some of the CGI shots are wonderful (the hyppogriff looks amazing), but the werewolf is distinctly dodgy, and there aren't enough scary shots of the Dementors. I can't help feeling that Cuaron was hampered here by the need to get a PG certificate for a film which would perhaps ideally have been a 12A. Also, the script misses out incredibly important material - such as the connection between Harry's father and the marauder's map. This will only make the near-impossible task which faces Mike Newell more difficult - reducing book 4 to a two and a half hour movie is a gargantuan task in itself, without having to fill in gaps which book 3 should have covered!There are some tantalising clues here to the (yet unwritten) final books. A speech by Lupin on a bridge stresses the kindness of Harry's mother in precedence to the rule-breaking of his father. Will Harry's obsession with his Dad in the earlier books yield to a better understanding of his mother's history and sacrifice in the later novels? Such a twist would surely appeal to an author who began to write as a struggling single mother...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bad choice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was such a huge disappointment. I am stunned Rowling didn't complain about the movie when she saw it. The director spent a good deal of effort on the scenery and environment, although he changed the location of places within Hogwarts, but seemed not to care about the plot line. This movie makes no sense unless you have read the books and seen the previous movies and even then it is sad. Lines by Dumbledore are given to Sirius and Lupine, their relationship with James is barely explained. The director also altered much of the story in a way that makes no sense in furthering the plot. Saddest of all might be his sacrificing character development as the relationships in the movie frequently make no sense, why are Harry and Lupine hanging out with barely an introduction? why is Harry pouring out his heart to him? The lack of character development, continuity and plot are further diminished by his seeking the cheap laugh. Random jokes are put in which supplant humor which makes sense leaving the characters awkward and sometimes behaving in ways they wouldn't according to their personality. All in all this was a very sad disappointment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a die hard fan of Harry Potter and I will always hate Alfonso Cuaron for what he did to what could possibly have been a classic in the fantasy genre. It was like a summary of the events of the third book and I was seriously disappointed because of the omission of the Quidditch championship in the film. The Marauders Map was not fully explained, the scene with Snape was butchered, the names of the Marauders were barely mentioned and the history of Animagi was not even brought up. The history of Snape and James Potter, the history of Remus Lupin, and the crucial scenes in the village of Hogsmeade were very poorly shown. I could go on and on but this film, as a film, maybe good, but as an adaptation the direction stinks, the main characters have no role to play (including Hagrid) and the only reason this film is so well liked is that the book its based on was so good that even though 86.7689% of it was cut out of the motion picture, it still had some charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Book 2 is my least favorite of the books, but this Azkaban was completely ruined by Alfonso Cuarón. He has characters acting out of character and crammed the movie together without sufficient explanation or character development. Most of his "cute" bits were just plain stupid.I read that he got the director of the fourth movie to do the entire book in one movie. If this is true, then he not only ruined the third movie, but the entire rest of the series. Boiling in oil would be too kind in this case.Oh well, give it a decade and the remake will be out. With this dog, it almost certainly has to be better, even though Cuarón had almost the perfect cast to work with. What a loser!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It feels like a transition movie, as the books become darker, obviously their celluloid counterparts will follow suit. But this film doesn't feel that dark, yet still managed to be less magical and less fun then the previous two films. Granted with "Chamber of Secrets", the bar was sat extremely high, but this film is definitely missing Chris Columbus's touch. The good acting is there (Gary Olman is great in damn near everything), the good special effects are there, and it's nice to see Rupert Grint growing into his own skin a bit and not looking so weird looking. The substance so much displayed in the first two isn't there, the heart isn't there (not in the same degree at least). This is not to say the the third film isn't good, I DO like it. It's just the worst of the three and I'm glad that Alfonso Cuarón isn't directing the next film "Goblit of Fire", as his eye is obviously meant for more pretentious Art-house cinema.My Grade: C+ 2-Disc DVD Extras: Disc 1) Theatrical Trailer; Trailers for "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", "Harry Potter and the Chambers of Secrets", "The Polar Express" &amp; "Elf" Disc 2) 5 Deleted Scenes; 11 minute and 50 second Creating The Vision featurette; 7 Interviews with cast &amp; crew with Introduction With The Shrunken Head; Catch Scabbers Interactive Challenge; Choir Practice Sing-Along; Quest Of Sir Cadogan Interactive Challenge; Self-Guided Interactive Tour of Honeydukes; Magic You May Have Missed Interactive Challenge; Self-Guided Interactive Tour of Lupin's Classroom; Care Of Magical Creatures featurette; Conjuring A Scene featurette; and Game PreviewDVD-Rom: Hogwart's Timeline; Trading Cards; Video game preview</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been an avid Harry Potter fan ever sense the Sorcerer's Stone. Books of course are always better because you jam more information and don't have to worry about time, I understand this. The first half of this film was jammed packed with so much information they should have just had a scrolling story like star wars does. The characters in the first half of the film was so dry I couldn't relate to the characters. The first two films left a lot out as well but it still felt it was following the story. Showing a cleaning witch for a funny scene in the movie or the womping willow killing a bird? What does that have to do with Harry Potter. Or the firebolt at the end of the film?! I felt thats a key part of the movie because it shows Harry in defeat. Which doesn't happen much in the films. I got to like oliver wood in the first two films and he just wasn't in this one?! Malfoy had no key part in the film they should have just not had him in the movie either. They talked so much about this director Alfonso Cuarón I think hes terrible. I saw Y tu mamá también I thought that movie was not good. Great expectations was a terrible adaption as well. He needs to stick with "Y tu mamá también" films.

		<shortDescription>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The previous two films were slightly lighter in tone, and this is when it does become much more than a family film, all the following films go up to the 12 certificate, this is obviously the third instalment, from director Alfonso Cuarón (A Little Princess). Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) runs away from home after losing his patience living with the Dursleys, and he gets picked up by the Knight Bus, taking him to friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson). They all hear that supposedly dangerous criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has done the impossible and escaped from Azkaban Prison, and he apparently has links with Lord Voldermort, and there are rumours he wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. On the way to Hogwarts the three friends and other passengers on the train are encountered by Dementors, the dark creatures that guard Azkaban, they are looking for Black, but they are not thinking when trying to suck out souls from people. Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon, replacing Richard Harris who died shortly after the second film) announces these Dementors around, that Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) is the new Defence of the Dark Arts teacher, he saved Harry's life from a Dementor. Lessons carry on like normal, including tea life reading from Professor Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson), and learning to fly Buckbeak the Hippogriff from Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), he is saddened the creature is sentenced to death after attacking Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Professor Lupin teaches a class where a creature called a Boggart is used, this creature turns into whatever someone can think of in the moment that scares them the most, and the given spell defeats it with laughter, Harry unfortunately think of a Dementor and is saved again. He also gets attacked by one during Quittitch, so The Professor decides he needs to learn to defend himself against them, and he also gets a Marauder's Map as he can't go without parental permission to Hogsmeade. After Harry gains more of a want to kill Sirius Black overhearing a conversation, where there is mention that he is his godfather, he, Ron and Hermoine visit Hagrid sympathising that Buckbeak will be killed, and then they run after Ron's rat Scabbers, also avoiding being caught by Dumbledore and others. Chasing him they find a secret passageway under the Whomping Willow that leads to the Shrieking Shack, and there they find a dog that is actually Sirius Black transformed, and Lupin, Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), who was Scabbers, also turn up. During the conversation they find out that Black is innocent, it was in fact Pettigrew that committed the crime, but when Lupin sees the full moon and transforms unintentionally into a werewolf he is allowed to escape. Harry and Black are almost finished off again by Dementors, but before fainting Harry thinks he saw his father James defeat them with the Patronus spell, he wakes and is advised by Dumbledore that he and Hermoine should use time to save a life or two. Hermoine reveals she has a time-turner, which explains why she is never late and appears in her lessons, and they have to save Buckbeak, retracing all their steps so as not to be spotted by their past selves, and not change too much. So Buckbeak is saved, the Executioner did not actually kill him, and they wait for the events in the Shrieking Shack to pass, make Lupin the werewolf come their direction to save their past selves, and it isn't Harry's father that saved him, but Harry himself, and they return to the present fine. In the end Sirius decides that it is best that he stays in hiding as he has not been proved innocent of the crime, and the final scene sees that he sent Harry a new Firebolt broomstick, the fastest in the world. Also starring Dame Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, Adrian Rawlins as James Potter, Geraldine Somerville as Lily Potter, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, Pam Ferris as Aunt Marge, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Dawn French as Fat Lady in Painting, Julie Christie as Madame Rosmerta, Robert Hardy as Cornelius Fudge, Paul Whitehouse as Sir Cadogan (scene cut out), Lenny Henry as Shrunken Head, Warwick Davis as Wizard, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley and Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom. The young actors grew up very fast and become much more mature, the other actors in the cast do great too, the story is easy to follow, it may be a little odd without Lord Voldermort but it doesn't matter, and of course the scene stealing special effects and action sequences are fantastic, a great fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Written Music for John Williams and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA Audience Award and the Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Production Design. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting to watch the money-making machine march forward.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, regarding my summary comment, I don't begrudge any of the money made off the Harry Potter books and now movies. Harry Potter was a good idea and few people in the history of literature have been able to create such interesting characters and stories. What I mean is, after the first movie there isn't much new. We see the continuing story of Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) at Hogwarts, supported by a cast that includes many of the best British actors. The movies are done in a style that makes it clear they are fantasy, so even when the protagonists are "in danger", wink-wink, we know that they aren't really in danger. because we know that Harry Potter and his friends will always prevail.SPOILERS follow. In this installment there is a mysterious "prisoner" who is out exterminate Harry Potter, already having been responsible for the death of Potter's mother and father. Of course this is not true, but is to cover up the real villain, who is one of the professors at Hogwarts. We are introduced to a wonderful animal (I forget the unusual name it was given) which seems to be half horse and half giant bird, which Potter is able to fly on. This comes in handy for an escape later. There is a tree that can move its trunk and branches fast enough to swat people. There is a trinket that enables Harry and Hermoine travel back in time, in a 'Back To The Future' type of manipulation that allows Harry to save the life of the strange creature. All done in a fine fantasy style. I enjoyed it, for what it is. Light fantasy entertainment, with no lasting aftertaste.I especially enjoyed, in the DVD extras, watching the trailers for the three Harry Potter movies. It is fun to see how the three young actors, the real people, have literally grown up during the trilogy (so far) from young children to young teenagers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well it beats the other ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The First Potter film hit theaters November 2001, it was a huge hit so the sequel was sure to come. Now what was wrong with the first one? Well to my opinion it was too boring to be for only kids, the children's acting was only mediocre(well you can forgive it, maybe...), and the believable paradox of a fairytale failed. Well it wasn't that bad, but with the exception of Dobby the house elf(though Gollum beats him 1000 - 0) the second film was even worse. It was better in terms of technical achievement since more time was used to that, but there was all the time a too linear story telling adapted like word to word from the excellent book. That doesn't work right. Well that movie still deserved it's 6/10 because of the wonderful appearances of such as Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs.Well the third movie is not THAT much better, but it's richer. The linear type of telling the story is forgotten and it feels fresher and more entertaining right then. Acting of the children is FAR better and the story of course gets more interesting. Gary Oldman is always great and this time it's not an exception, though his role is small. Now the characters still do not really develop since the story itself takes too much time. The film could have been half an hour longer though and it should've been. Everything is told quite quickly and it doesn't really get boring but it gets annoying. In some points only. All and all this is a bit better than the first two and I liked it, but i still wouldn't spend 25 euros(yeah euros you dumb asses :D) to buy it. To each their own, no?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst director in the Potter series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many things were out of character, and definitely out of pace with the previous movies. I understand that it strays from the book, the whole movie series has a life of its own and it has been great so far, leaving enough surprises to be found in the books for those who didn't get to read them first. Every character lacked identity for the first time in the series, which points NOT to bad acting, but to LOUSY direction. Dumbledore became the kind of school principal that everyone gets to hate too much instead of the wise old man he used to be, from his appearance, his lines, but most than anything his whole screen attitude. Same goes for professor McGonagall, and even Snape seemed less sinister and more fake than any other time.And off to the main characters, Alfonso Cuarón once again managed to try and "Imprint" His personal style thinking he is larger than Harry Potter and all of the magic that surrounds it, he added that grim quality which turns every single one of his movies into a "want to make art even if it spoils the movies", he gave Harry, Hermione, and Ron a "bitter" teenager quality that simply didn't fit. It was amazingly overdone and obviously he tried to hard, there are moments of brilliance among so many lousy embittered moments. Hermione lost her charm, Harry lost his cool and the feel he has in the books, and Ron came out as a completely "gray" character and Cuarón relied way too much in his "pouty" kind of performance, which in the previous films Columbus managed to make feel natural. Malfoy became just a cartoon in this movie, no opposition whatsoever and even his annoying nature came off out of character and fake.The story is really good even when Cuarón managed to make it a story with very little explanation which made it hard to follow at the start in his attempt to be "faster" in building suspense than Columbus did. Columbus is an artist and a magician in this sense, you don't need such hectic scenes to make a movie get off to a good start, Cuaron instead tried to give it a caotic and frantic kind of beginning which fell so very out of place.I'll buy the movie as well, since it's magically saved by the storyline, but it was a huge mistake to select this "wanna-be artist" director who is all the time trying to glofify himself at the cost of a very expensive, very awaited and very good movie. All in all it gets a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Could They Allow This Terrible Potter Sequel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disliked this movie enough to write a review on it. I want to start out by saying I have been an unsuspecting fan of the Harry Potter Books. I picked one up as a test, and couldn't put any of them down since.If you liked the books and remember any of the content in Prisoner of Azkaban, you will find this movie insulting. They added dialogue that wasn't remotely like the book, focused on unnecessary special effects that did nothing for the movie, and worst of all, there was ZERO, "I mean zero" character development. There is a scene with a creature called a "Hippogriff" that depicts Malfoy just exploding verbally at the creature, with no impetus whatsoever. The two people and I who went, were staring at the screen like "did I just miss something?" The random jumping of scenes and character moods was so un-potteresque that I am intrigued that they got away with releasing the movie. I would think that JK Rowling would be very angered by this movie. She has done an incredible job on her books, and this movie is just stupid.I realize that there was a lot of ground to cover in this movie, and I was wondering if that lead to the destruction of the actual storyline, but if that was the case, they should have broken the movies up differently as they did in "Lord Of The Rings"I know I am probably biased by reading the books first and comparing them to the movie, so maybe I just can't step far enough away to appreciate this movie for what it is. But that isn't my fault. I loved the books, and so did millions of people.So in closing I beg the true "Potter" fans who read this to skip it. Wait for it on free TV, don't even rent it on video. Sorry to squash this movie so hard, I really wanted it to be good. But it was terrible. If I have to give one good note on closing of this review, I would say the special effects were very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as good as the other two, but almost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the wonderful casting choices the directors of these films consistently make! Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawny was an inspired choice! What a hoot. I wish the filmmakers hadn't cut this film to ribbons, though. Clearly, there must have been other scenes featuring "the emmas" (Watson and Thompson). In the book, if I remember right, there are lots more sparks that fly between the two. I wanted to see more of Emma Thompson! Also, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was absolutely marvelous. I sure hope he signs on for the future films. He's always been a favorite of mine, anyway. I was unfamiliar with David Thewlis, but he was awesome as well as Professor Lupin. He managed to be weird and slightly menacing as well as a friendly mentor to Harry. The film felt a bit "rushed" as many points were left out (who, for example are Padfoot, Mooney, Wormtail, and Prongs??...the only reason I know is that I read the book. I wonder if those who haven't were completely lost...would it really have taken THAT long to explain who they were???) Many of the scenes felt rushed and the dialog was a bit contrived to move the plot along. I know this is often the nature of the translation of books to film; I don't think this film would have suffered had it been 30 minutes longer. But don't get me wrong. IT was a fine film and we all enjoyed it. Yes, it's a bit darker than the others (I was SHOCKED to see many many toddlers in the audience!! Hello, people?? What are you thinking???? Do you not read? Every review I've seen warns against taking small children to this as it is quite scary.) but older elementary kids and up will be fine, for the most part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring waste of time and film stock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fell asleep, literally, several times - at a noon hour showing. Very little that kept me even mildly interested. This 3rd offering is by far and away the worst. It's no Shrek 2. There were few scenes at the School. And very limited use of the School's teachers. There were a few scary scenes, perhaps too horrific for the younger ones (under 6?). The cinematography was pretty good. Both my daughter and I found this film's storyline and plot confusing and non-sensical. Okay, the Special Effects were pretty good, but that does not make a movie great. And this film is a long, long way from great. Boring bigtime. Bring your jammies and be prepared to sleep. Yawn!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My daughter and I have been waiting with anticipation for the third of the harry potters to be released, but sadly were both extremely disappointed with the results. This third film should have been excellent as the book was the best of all 5. How can it have been made into an absolute mockery of the novel? My partner never reading the books, was left wondering what was happening and couldn't follow the plot fully without myself filling him in. I sincerely hope that the fact that there is yet another director working on the 4th film, will improve the viewing,plot and relation to the novel.Hopefully the screen writers will heed the comments of people regarding this movie, but i hate to say that i know they won't. If they see the box office results regarding the showing of this film, then i'm afraid they will not be interested in reviews of any adverse nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is terrible, no wait, it's garbage. There is so much BS put in this movie, and the real stuff is removed! Harry and Professor Lupin don't walk around talking about stuff! They speak once in Lupin's office, then they have anti-dementor lessons! There is no toad choir! Harry doesn't even tell Lupin what his happiest memory is! And it's not even his mom! And the worst part in the whole movie, flying dementors, I mean come on!? That was the most stupid thing ever. Dementors glide an inch above the ground.. They just don't fly! I am extremely disappointed in this fake Harry Potter movie. They could have done so much with the material, but instead they say, here's Harry Potter, this is his year, love it. And oh, how could I forget Professor Trelawny? The just missed what her character is about completely. Really disappointing. I gave this movie a 1, and it barely deserves that. The actors are alright, but the script and directing is terrible, just awful. I can understand that people like the movie if they haven't read the book, but seriously, do read the book. It's just so much better.Can't they just stick to what's in the book? Why add stuff? The books are loved for what they are.. Why ruin it? I'm just gonna stop, please don't see this movie, it's a pure waste of time. Read the book, enjoy a true piece of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the movie adaptations so far! Minor spoilers in my quibbles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this adaptation is the truest yet to the spirit of Rowlings' books, though they clearly streamlined quite a bit. Sure, I missed some of the details of the books, like finally winning the Quidditch cup, but I think that it was actually a better movie for not trying to cover every detail. That's what the books are for -- all the wonderful details. I was sorely disappointed in the first movie, OK with the second one, and pretty happy with this third one.I think the characters got better treatment in general in this film; I've been particularly unhappy with the way Ron was screenwritten in the first two films (whiny, cowardly), and I think this one did him better justice. The student body as a whole also seemed more real, more like actual kids at a boarding school, in no small part because of the more relaxed way they wore their clothing. Give real schoolkids a uniform, and they'll modify it any way they can! Lupin was terrific, and I think the new Dumbledore is pretty good, too; the books have Ron describe him as "utterly mad," and with a quirky sense of humor.'Azkaban' also gives the best look yet at the extended grounds of Hogwarts; in the previous two films, nothing felt large enough to me, set-wise, and Hagrid's hut always seemed to be right outside the castle gate, instead of down at the edge of the forbidden forest, as described in the books and clearly portrayed in this third film. I wasn't expecting such a steep hill down to his cottage, but the books always do talk about the trio (Harry, Ron, Hermione) going *down* to Hagrid's hut &amp; walking back up the hill to the castle, so I'm tolerably pleased with this visual interpretation. Quibbles &amp; Spoilers (Get the details you *do* show right):1) In the intro, Harry is practicing magic under his covers in the Dursley's home. What happened to the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry?I'll grant you it's a cool intro, but it's a violation of a key plot point.(And not just for this book, either -- it's very important in Order of the Phoenix, too.)2) Dementors don't fly in the books, they glide, and they don't really need to fly to make the movie work. I can see that it was done to make some streamlining elements work, but it could have been done differently.3) I can't see Harry stealing a lollipop from Neville (in Hogsmeade). From Malfoy, maybe, but not from a friend, certainly not while invisible. I know it was done to give us a point of reference for the moving, invisible Harry, but still - let's be true to our character, hm?4) Why did they change the nature of the Patronus from a creature to a shield? In the books, once a wizard successfully creates a Patronus, it acts to protect the wizard with no further drain on him/her. It appears as a creature with a definite shape to everybody, including its creator. And Harry's Patronus is a stag, like his father's animagus form. There was just no good reason for this change.5) Where did Goyle disappear to, and who's Malfoy's replacement sidekick?Still, all quibbles aside, I really enjoyed this movie. It's really, really rare that I come out of a movie -- even a favorite movie -- without a quibble of some sort, so this movie is no exception.</fullReview>

I thought there is gonna be Pigwidgeon. Where is he anyway?? I think Alfonso did an OK job.. not an excellent one. The movie is all mess up. Most people that hasn't read the book will wonder like how did Prof. Lupin know how to open the Marauders Map, or, Who is Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs? Oh well, the movie has been made and I don't like it. I think the first two is better even though it is the introduction and has not have much things in it. The third one is suppose to be the "WOW" one.I just hope that the fourth movie will be better than this one. Just hoping...:S</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that I disliked or criticized about the previous two Harry Potter films (which I absolutely didn't like) were masterfully done in the third installment of the series, `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'. Alfonso Cuaron's direction is a triumph ? even scenes that I was cringing in anticipation over based on earlier CGI work, (the Quidditch match, the werewolves, etc.) were brilliant. Overall, the film was a lot darker, a lot meatier, and had an exponential amount of style over its predecessors. Among the many amazing techniques that could be mentioned, Cuaron briefly introduces hand-held camera work, experimental use of color in various scenes, and best of all, not being a fan of the fantasy genre, steady pacing that never once allowed me to be bored. Possible spoilersOf course, making this next statement is dangerous because I may eat my words after seeing the fourth installment, but it is encouraging to see that as Harry Potter gets older and edgier, the films do the same. This could solely be attributed to Cuaron's direction; only time will tell. The best assessment of this film is that coming from a highly critical, general hater of fantasy film viewer, there were only two miniscule criticisms I had regarding this film. One of them was the cheesy way the film ended, (meaning, the last three seconds) and the other is quite possibly my own fault, and that is the very neat and quick turnaround of Sirius Black. I was a bit confused as to how in one moment, Harry was in peril and the next, everything was cleared up rather easily, but again, that may just be a misunderstanding on my own part.The bottom line is that this is a first-rate film that (again, not an easy thing for a cynical viewer like me to say) truly is a film for any generation to enjoy. There are many other films that are accredited with this distinction (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Disney cartoons) but this is one of the first times I actually agree with them. The aforementioned films that I have seen, I feel, do not translate well into adult viewership; the most that can be said is that the film is `cute'. `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is not `cute', it is a bona fide good film and it has done what the first two films of the series couldn't do ? not only thoroughly enjoy myself, but give me a reason to see the next installment.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warner Bros. Does It Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Batman, then The Matrix, and now Harry Potter! Why does Warner Bros. have to ruin every series of movies they turn out?Where to begin? Lousy camera work, choppy editing, poor color quality, etc. And was that supposed to be Hogwarts?! It looked nothing like the first 2 movies. I guess for GOF, the Whomping Willow will be in the middle of the lake and Hagrid's Hut will be on the roof of the castle.I had hoped to one day be able to watch all the HP movies in succession and feel like I was watching one big movie with 7 parts, but obviously that's never going to happen now.I can only hope that one day New Line and Peter Jackson will get to do the series, since they've shown themselves to be capable of bringing great books to the big screen.POA and GOF are probably my favorite books in the series. I know that Cuaron won't be directing GOF (thankfully), but I imagine that GOF will be even worse since there is no way it can be made into a single movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a loyal Harry Potter fan I went to see this movie as soon as possible. Prisoner of Azkaban is a great book, my favorite, but this movie was so far from the book that I hated it. They took out everything that was important and added filler that did not need to be there. Also they had alignment with book problems. Such as, when Harry got his firebolt. Though the acting and all that stuff were excellent. In fact anyone who has not read the books will love the movie, but As I see it it was horrible. By far the worst Harry Potter movie yet. I am pleased to say though that there is another new director for movie four and I am confident that he will do a better job than Alfonso Cuaron. Though this movie in the eyes of a book reader is horrible it is still a great movie and I recommend seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book reader: beware of this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!! I have seen the film and am already rueing to change my decision to do so now. The reviews have already disappointed me. I'm a huge fan of HP books and films but if Cuaron has changed Hogwarts, removed the robes, altered the school grounds, Hagrid's hut and Whomping Willow, what's the use to this movie?What is go great about Harry Potter is its different. If there are no fascinations about the wizarding world and nothing different, what's the big deal? I like jeans but HP should always wear robes.I have heard all stuff that its darker and so better but I feel that it has been overly darkened. Hogwarts is a place to study and the safest place in the world. If its so dark and dangerous, what's the use of studying in there? Why would parents send their children to such a haunted place.Another half hour to the movie would have been a good deed. There are hardly any explanations. What about Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs? What about Snape's hatred to Harry? The werewolf was a scum and Buckbeak lacked the essence of Dobby.The first two films were slow but they were classical in their approach. They allowed the viewers to gulp in the tale. This one was a rush-over. Why did the Dementors looked like balloons? Why did Cuaron changed them so much? Was he afraid of the Wraiths of LOTR?Well, readers have already accepted them as they were and there is no need to be so different. Dumbledore should immediately be changed. Sign up Ian Meckellen. He is even better than Richard Harris. Sirius should not have been shown so terrible.I think it was great injustice to JK Rowling. I have sympathy towards her for I know what a writer feels when he sees his story being obliterated by poor direction. I too am a writer. I feel that she should step in and write the script for Goblet and in fact, bring Columbus back who managed to realize the essence of Harry Potter. She should help in the direction as well. If Goblet suffers from the same discrepancies, Harry Potter would be over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All HP fans will go and see this movie. Unfortunately, like me they will be less than satisfied. There really is no continuity between this and the previous movies. Hogwarts is not the same as in the 1st two movies. The sets have changed and you don't feel like you have visited the school before. If you have read the book, you'll notice that nothing gets developed; characters,story lines,sub plots and the HP magic.The movie moves along in sort of a jerky and hollow fashion. The director could have added so many minor details without adding to the movie's length and made a great film. Maybe the detail just ended up on the cutting room floor and it will be in the DVD but not likely. I hope for the millions of loyal fans that the next movie will be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointment. The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best written, most intriguing story of all the Harry Potter books. It has a great plot with many twists. It is the story and the actors that carry this movie. The cinematography and effects can not compare to the first two movies. The colors are dull and the film has a look and feel of a movie that is 20 years old and has faded or has not kept up with the technology of the times. The new Hogwarts looks old and run down and the colorful, magical feel is completely gone. Most scenes seem washed out as if you were watching an old TV set that had very poor color. The actors are superb and Harry has lost that awkward pre teen look. He has matured and has a confidence that accurately reflects his growth in the book. With the great story and incredible actors, this could have been an all time classic. However with the poor job the new director did and the direction they took with the look of the movie,the Prisoner of Azkaban just okay. "Just okay" for such a great story and incredible actors should be considered a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All fluff and no substance, so don't expect too much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My overwhelming reaction to the movie was, "Is the movie over yet???"How much you'll like the movie will all depend on what you're looking for. If you're the kind of person who likes lots of cute special effects, then you'll love the movie. If you're the type who wishes the novel had been followed more closely (like me), you're going to hate it.I honestly think Cuaron worked too hard on the visual effects of the move, which were breathtaking, and not enough on the plot and scene continuation and the actors. There were many times when a scene was simply too intense and seemed to highlight all of their worst acting skills. I think Cuaron expected way too much out of the young actors and did not accordingly adjust for their shortcomings. The result: lame scenes where the lines fall completely flat and the actors seem like they're reading their lines, or even worse: overacting.In my opinion, The Prisoner of Azkaban was the best novel in the series, and the movie should have been more faithful to the book. I understand that it's difficult to adapt a book to the screen and that many things have to be deleted, but they did much more than simply trim the story short. They changed the dialogue and added things that never happened in the book. Also, there's a tribute to Cuaron's Y Tu Mama Tambien, which I found completely inappropriate for a movie like this. Cuaron says the movie's theme is the fact that the children are growing up, but I don't think that it was even conveyed all that well. If a person hadn't read the book, I don't think they would have really understood what was going on at all. The continuation from scene to scene is too disconnected to really showcase any theme or story properly. All I can say is, bring the old director back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Harry Potter fan that has been looking forward to this movie ever since the credits finished rolling for Chamber of Secrets. To say that I am disappointed in this film is a huge understatement. I shall start with the characters. The two most fascinating and powerful characters in the books and first two movies outside of the three kids are Snape and Dumbledore, Snape is reduced to a seldom used butt of a joke and Dumbledore has completely lost his magnificent presence and aura and is closer to a doddering old man. One of the most effective parts of the first two movies is the magical settings and costumes, these are completely missing from this movie. Hogwarts looks shabby and stark, Hagrids Hut more closely resembles a redneck trailer home. The students spend most of their time in street clothes, the entire 'feel' of the movie is more like a cheap imitation of 'Lord of the Rings' than the wonderful settings from the first two movies. However the most disappointing part of the movie is its plot/storyline... While the first two movies brought the books to life in a vivid and spectacular fashion with a faithful presentation Prisoner of Azkaban is a choppy, mutilated version of the book, completely lacking the engrossing nature of the book. Many important elements of the book were completely overlooked or 'changed'. The most important omission to me was the lack of any explanation of the significance of 'Padfoot, Mooney, Prongs and Wormtail and their relationships. Also the book introduced Cedric Diggory as the Hufflepuff seeker that beat Harry and brought about a level of animosity toward him by the Griffyndors... Cuaron seemed to approach POA with an intent to make it a combination of 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Men in Black' it was a complete failure...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry to those who liked this film but i have to say that this film was disappointing. there were more bad things about this film than the good things. The good things about about this film were: 1. it was darker than the first two. they outlined the story in a dark way due to its background but that is not an enough of an excuse.2. i guess the actors were maturing and i will give them credit there and there was humour from them.3.the punch from Hermionethe negatives: 1.they took out a lot of important parts out as if they never existed. they took out key chapters like the owl post, the Qiudditch final, the owl post again. perhaps the only one i would edit is the Gryffindor vs raven claw otherwise it might drag on.2. the film itself was inaccurate. even with the chapters they kept in was not explained enough. they didn't talk much about the marauders map and the creators which is the key information for the 5th book and also they never explained why Sirius black is an animagus and that his dad was an animagus. they did not talk about how lupin was a werewolf, professor Trelawnys prediction was not explained enough. she was supposed to mention that not only will Voldemort return soon, that worm-tail will return and harry's shocking future. when it came to the important parts, it was either that it was skipped or rushed. in the book it explained the painting was teared and the fat lady was injured but in the film the fat lady was not injured and acted rather wimpish than shocked which also reminds me about Ron screaming that he saw a knife and no one believed him. this was not in the film. the hourglass was not explained enough either.3. this film wasn't really taken seriously. you would expect this whole film to be so dark you would be thrilled a lot more than the first two. the film seemed a bit like a young kids film and they portrayed malfoy rather annoying than a villain. 4. the werewolf looked liked a skinny greyhound. it said clearly in the book that it was large hairy and should have looked much more ferocious like the ones in van Helsing.5. what happened to the locations, Hagrids hut is elsewhere and the whomping willow is in the wrong place. if they are going to make a film based on a film it must be accurate.6. some of the important parts were mentioned at other point like the fire-bolt which was originally explained in the middle and in the film its at the end.7. the patronus charm was supposed to shape like a stag not a shield8. they may have matured but still could have improved and stop acting childish like Ron and Malfoy.my theory about this film being currently rated 7.7 is that first of all the book is known to be one of the worlds most famous novels ever. because of that a lot of people who haven't read the book would be curious about the film to know what makes it good. As a film, this can be quite good which explain why it is highly rated. but if you read the book and watch this, you will understand the disappointment. it has a darker mood but should have done much better.we all have our opinions, we are free to choose what we want but this I'm afraid is not what you would hope for if you are a fan. i myself thought that this would be the film of 2004 but it failed miserably.P.S Alfonso Cauron directed such a kiddish film called a little princess! what does that tell you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happy Birthday Julie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of movies over the years with Julie Christie. My favorite is Heaven Can Wait. But, her role in this movie is the very antithesis of the lovely Julie, that it is appropriate on her birthday.She played Madame Rosmerta, a minor role in a great film with the usual cast of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. Yes, I watch harry Potter movies. I have even read all the books three times each and anxiously await the next book and movie. Life is too interesting to get stuck in just a few types; whether it be books, music, movies, or women.This was director Alfonso Cuarón's (Y tu mamá también ) greatest film. He was actually supposed to do Children of Men when he was offered this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry goes back for his third year at Hogwarts and learns that a murderer is at large and after Harry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A real disappointment if you're a true fan of the books. If you don't read the books or didn't completely follow the previous movies, it'll be confusing. It was well-directed and really looked like the Hogwarts the books portray, but the acting is terrible and the plot-line is hard to follow. The movie has been built up to be a comedy and teen romance flick, where the plot line is thrown to the side, into the background, making it difficult to understand.First, the few good points: The directing was above average in this film and it's obvious that this is an improvement from the previous movies. Hogwarts is made out as it should be, following the books, again, unlike the last 2 Harry Potter movies. But this is really all that is good.The many, many bad points: The animation is absolutely terrible and completely fake. The movie has been so clouded up by unnecessary details that the main plot line is left in the dark, difficult to follow and, so the movie is made out to be, unimportant. If you're a fan of the books, this is a huge disappointment. As a matter of fact, if you've read the books, I strongly suggest you not go and see the movie. It will ruin your view of the Harry Potter novels and if watched enough, confuse you from what is important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well clearly Richard Harris is to be totally missed. He came across as a more sincere Albus. Michael Gambon is good at one thing. Being a bad guy. I can't trust Albus now. Not totally. Now not that Michael isn't a good actor. He's very good when he plays less than goodie tushu characters. He's perfect in Open Range. And not that Richard Harris never played bad guys. But Richard was a far better actor. He was convincing at a bad or good guy. I just can't help but wonder if there could have been a better choice. I suppose Ian Mckellen was taken. But the similarities in Potter 3 to LOTR are matched in more than just actors. So he could have been a great albus. I can't believe how much their ghosts/guards... whatever look like LOTR's Ring Wraiths. No creativity here. Certainly the CGI has massively improved here, but so much so they may have forgotten the characters themselves. I'm not gonna go on a blistering attack on the movie. It's hardly a letdown. But I'm not gonna swoon over it like the first two films. I just hope they get their act together. Because Potter 3 is missing the fun. Wonder if Chris Columbus will ever come back. It was good to see Gary Oldman again. I don't see him in many films of the type he did in the 90's. And he's hardly recognizable in Hannibal. I hope they keep the original 3 friend cast together till the end though. Although I'd hate to be growing up like that. 6/10Quality: 6/10 Entertainment: 6/10 Replayable: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst HP movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was truly disappointed with this movie. I was looking forward to it but the movie was a total mess. People might say Alfonso Cuaron 'got the real idea of Harry Potter' but the truth is, he didn't at all get the idea of Harry Potter. I must say Chris Columbus was much, much more better. He got the real vision of the world of Harry Potter.There were a lot of things that were messed up in the movie. In the Leaky Cauldron, you must have noticed that the bartender swished his hand and the chair went up and the fact that there was a wizard waving his finger around a spoon. Well, that's not supposed to happen since Wizards and witches in Harry Potter books can only perform magic using wands, the fingers and the hand are useless. Ron did not have a crush for Madame Rosmerta and the Three Broomsticks was not suppose to be closed. Lupin looks bit of than what I imagined him to look like. Hermione doesn't have bushy hair, which is just simply wrong cuz she's suppose to have bushy hair only on the fourth book, during the Yule Ball she made her hair looked sleek and shiny, not the third book. And by the way, Lupin in this movie sounded like he had a crush on Lily Potter. The script writer had said that that was an assumption but the way he is saying that he thinks Remus has a crush on Lily is wrong. They are creating a movie that shows the third book, not assumptions. The bad thing is people are going to assume that Remus does have a crush on lily. Well if it's correct, it's not a matter anymore but if it isn't, well, that's is going to be a problem for non-Harry Potter readers. Neville is thin, for goodness's sake! He's suppose to be plum and fat, not thin! The Neville in the 1st and 2nd movie looked like the Nevill I know in the books.People may not find this comment useful but I'm just saying what I think should be said. TQ</fullReview>

It also proves that girls can be just as good a boys when it comes to fighting. All members of the family will enjoy the third film of the collection.This is the best one of the harry potter films that have been released due to how the characters mature as the film does. And because more new characters have been brought into the new world of harry potter so over all i give this film 8 out of 10. i would recommend this film to anyone because it has been put together with such skill and perception that it is a masterpiece that every one should have the chance to see such a spectacular film and get pulled into the magical world of harry potter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Potters third adventure is darker and grimmer than the first two (probably mainly because of it's new director), but that doesn't necessarily make it better... or worse, for that matter.First shots of the movie are a nice touch, as it's shot from the hand, and it shows us the movie's gonna be a bit more for the elder, as there's a foul-mouthed auntie who's getting blown up by Harry, before he leaves the house of his uncle Vernon, for good as it seems this time.He leaves for Hogwarts where the place is garded by Dementors as known killer Sirius Black (who reportedly betrayed Harry's mom and dad to Him That Shall Not Be Named (or whatever)) has escaped the infamous Azkaban (probably named after Alcatraz?), who's out to get Harry as well.Harry gets help from his old pals Ron and Hermione as well as new teacher Lupin to fight of the danger, but things aren't as they first appear (as you would expect).Before we go any further, I'd like to state I haven't read the books of Rowling, so I don't care if Hagrids hut is further from the castle than it should, and things like that. So if Cuaron thinks he should do it this way, it doesn't mean it's better or worse the way Columbus did it, it's just different.Having said that, I like the athmosphere of this movie better than the first two. Maybe because it is aimed at a bit older public (I'm 25 right now), it was a bit more exciting and scary. In fact, the Dutch certification for this movie was 9 years and older, a certification never used before. No kids stuff, for sure.The actors themselves look and act older as well. Harry looks a bit tougher and Ron has his eyes set out for Hermione, and I think many 15 year olds in the audience can't really blame him.So we have grimmer athmosphere, a more mature cast for a more mature audience, what about the story?Too bad it is exactly here the movie goes wrong. The story has it's dull moments (with 141 minutes, this really is too long people!) and flies all over the place, with some characters with too little screen time (Hagrid, Dumbledore, but more importantly, Draco) and others with too much (Hermione in particular). The 'surprise meeting' in the (ehm, forgot how the place was called), well, you know, when they're pulled underneath the tree was really silly, and the worst thing still had to come.I'm talking, of course, about the 'going back in time' incident. Why oh why do they keep on doing this. It's like that old Superman joke: why doesn't Superman ALWAYS fly around the earth so that he can undo ALL evil. I had the same with (I think) the 8th Startrek movie, where the crew goes back in time to stop those who already went back. When they're stopped, why don't they try it again, or at another point. If you have this ability to travel through time, why not use it all the time?The same things happens here. By going back in time, Harry and Hermione save the innocent, as they say. Well, if they know how to do that (and it looked really easy), why not save Harry's parents then? Why not use it for more important things than simply being able to catch more classes?It's a bit of a let-down, how this ended, and I'm sure it's the same in the book, but having not read them I can only judge the movie and I think that was a terrible mistake.All in all: it's not a bad movie for sure, and it had some enjoyable moments, but can't really give it any more than a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, I am not a big fan of the HARRY POTTER saga, but I must say there y are good books, specially for kids about 10. Cuarón is a great director, and I thought he could improve the movie (compared to the previous films). Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban is definitely different compared to the previous films. In positive factors, this film performances are better (but still can satisfy my expectations), the scenery is better, but Cuaron's desire to change everything and brake Rollwin's traditional books is quite daring. Harry Potter and the sorceress's stone and Harry potter and the chamber of secrets are literal adaptations of the books (which are quite bad, boring and lame) some of the plot in the film is shattered by Cuaron's idea to do some changes. The 3 main actors look to old to be playing 13-year-old teens (Except Hermione). Gary Oldman's performance was insufficient and lame. The visual effects are quite bad compared to other features such as the Lord of the Rings and The perfect Storm. The costumes are not loyal to the book, and in my opinion, the changes of setting was very good. I was glad to find some references to Mexico. When at Hogsmade, Harry enters the sweet shop, you can see some colourful and attractive sugar `calacas' skeletons (Which are traditionally used in Mexico at Dia de Muertos, Mexican celebration of Halloween). I am definitely not watching the fourth one. 5.32/10.00</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Look" is Cool, But Story Hopelessly Truncated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may seem strange to say this about a film that already runs over two hours and twenty minutes, but "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" needs to be longer by fifteen minutes at the very least. The story is a complex one, by Potter standards, and way too many vital plot points race by up on the screen before they can really sink in. A person who had not read the book will likely not be able to tell what the hell is going on (but then that raises the question, do people who haven't read the books actually go to these movies?). Also, it is painfully ironic that while previous Potter helmer Chris Columbus' visual style was flat, obvious, and unspectacular in comparison to the moody, highly textured visions created by new guy Cuaron, his old fashioned simplicity did get the message across. You never had to ask why something happened or what a character's motivations was, there was always some blatant bit of expository dialog to spell it out for you. It may be unfashionable to say, but that's not a bad thing for this kind of flick in my book. "Azkaban" could have done with a few more explanations from knowitall Hermione, for example: "Don't you see, Harry, he has to fight the werewolf because?" Many, many plot points that are absolutely necessary for the audience to understand are either explained with a single line of dialog, or often not explained at all.But it is probably true that there at one time existed a longer, more coherent cut of the film, one which was then cut down to size to allow for kiddie attention spans and more showings per day for the multiplex owners.It makes you wonder how the producers of the Potter films are going to adapt the later, and much, much longer novels in the series. Will "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" be released in two parts, a la Tarantino's "Kill Bill" (or Richard Lester's "Three Musketeers")? Well, if Hollywood says that 3-hour family movies are a no-no, then "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Volume One" might be the only way to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just a kids movie - a good one though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess that I did not read any of the Harry Potter books, and I am afraid I will not have the time to do it during the current reincarnation of my soul. This being said, I am judging the film by what I saw on the screen, and I cannot refer to the many details the book afficionados seem to be that familiar with. My opinion is that this film belongs to the category of kids film, and should not be over-estimated or over-judged beyond. It is actually quite good in its own terms, and doing good kids movies should not be under-estimated in a world poluated with that many bad taste or plain boring movies targeting young audiences, unfortunately many claiming Disney descendence, or even bearing Disney labels. My young teen-age soon enjoyed the film, and so did my wife and myself. The good parts are the overall atmosphere, darker, and less surprising if you saw the previous films in the series, but still very consistent and catching. Computerized film graphics is by now an art in itself, and the makers of this film master it fully. I did not like that much the horse-bird character, which looks like being intended to generate some affection, but fails to bear a personality as some other recent film monsters.Acting is good, with the kids trio, now on the verge of their teen years growing up still as a consistent team, although Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter seems to have less acting resources than Emma Watson in Hermione, who may develop into a real screen star. Interesting to guess how the makers of the series will deal with the inevitable growing pains and crisis of the young actors. A good team of good and better actors surrounds the kids, with Michael Gambon having taken over the key role of dean Dumbledore after the passing of Richard Harris in a flawless manner.Sure, the fans can and will build a world around the books and the films. Even for the non-initiated or beyond the age groups, like the ones I belong to, there is enough good stuff to enjoy in this film. 8 our of 10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers) Okay, I won't make any more jokes about the director, but you really can't help making a crack or two about a director who just made an acclaimed nearly porn film and the turned to a wildly popular adventure series starring a lot of budding teenagers. As it turns out, of course, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, personally chose Alfonso Cuarón to direct the third installment in the Harry Potter films, so that should really end any controversy about how closely the movie follows the book. I read the third book not long after the second film was released, so it has faded a bit in my mind, but it's pretty obvious that the majority of the storyline remains intact, and quite frankly I generally find it boring to hear lists of things that were in the book but not in the movie, or vice versa. I got enough of that while reading reviews of Troy.The amazing thing to me is how much the kids have changed since the last film. They're at that point in their lives where they'll grow faster than at any other time, and it's amazing how different they are. Draco Malfoy, especially, looks like an almost entirely different actor. Clearly, despite the changing appearance of the cast, the largest difference here is in the direction. Alfonso Cuarón brings a much darker and sleeker feel to the series, which I think is a welcome and necessary change.The focus of the film is on the escape of Sirius Black from Azkaban, the infamous wizard prison (which I would have liked to actually see in the movie), and his apparent dedication to exact his murderous revenge on Harry Potter. Early on, the film slips a little bit when it starts with a gigantic cliché, which is that Harry Potter's Life Is In Grave Danger, but thankfully it recovers quickly. Hermione's ability to take on a massive amount of classes in quietly hinted at throughout the film, exactly as it was in the novel, and it leads to a great sequence that reminds me of the Back to the Future movies, where Marty traveled through time and had to avoid running into his other self. This movie even throws in a scene to show how the multiple selves are ultimately melded back into their originals when the time traveling is done, which the Back to the Future series never put a lot of effort into. Gary Oldman is tragically underused in the movie as Sirius Black, but he delivers a powerful and convincing performance and clearly had a great time of it. (Again, there are spoilers ahead?) However, given the fact that he turned out to be a vastly different person than everyone thought he was ever since he was thrown into prison 12 years earlier, it seems that he would have been better able to convince people that he was really a good man had he not offered such a menacing pose for his WANTED poster. Oops.As is generally the case, the new year at Hogwarts offers a few quirky new staff members, including the necessary addition of a new Dumbledore, the mysterious Professor Lupin, who has a tendency to disappear and then reappear covered in strange scratches, and the eccentric Professor Sybil Trelawney, a role which does not do Emma Thompson justice. Robbie Coltrane returns as the endlessly lovable Hagrid, now promoted to professor status, as well as the tremendously impressive character of Professor Snape, who I enjoy mostly because Alan Rickman fits the role better than any other actor in any of the Harry Potter movies fits theirs. Until the Harry Potter movies came along, I thought he would never top his role as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Turns out I was wrong!The Hippogriff that Hagrid introduces to his class early in the film is one of the most impressive and realistic computer-generated animals that I've ever seen in a movie, with expressions and movements that made it seem so real that it actually had personality, despite being such a mythical creature. Compare it, for example, to the ridiculous wolves in The Day After Tomorrow, and you'll know what I mean. The first half of the film, unfortunately, seems a little uncomfortable with itself. It tries pretty hard to get Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson to act like their younger selves from the previous movies, but it's almost like the awkwardness of their early teenage years is creeping into their characters, who are younger than the actors playing them.The film follows the novel as closely as is necessary, especially since Cuarón was deliberately trying to make the film noticeably different from the previous films, which followed the books with striking detail. A little bit of artistic liberty taken with a novel when adapting it into a film is a pretty dangerous proposition, but I think that, as in this case, the author of the work personally chose the director, a bit of artistic license should be granted, and I think Cuarón did a great job with the liberties that he did take. That being said, I can't help but end with a quote I read in a review of The Prisoner of Azkaban, in which Time Magazine's film critic Richard Corliss speculates on possible directors for the remaining Harry Potter films - 'How about Tim Burton (Sleepy Hogwarts), Ang Lee (Crouching Wizard, Hidden Snape), Pedro Almodóvar (All About My Voldemort) and, for the wrenching finale, Mel Gibson (The Passion of the Quidditch)?'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with the other HP movies and one of the main reasons that adults mostly have distaste for this series is that there is really no mystery or feeling in these films. A perfect example is the bus ride in the beginning. The driver is a complete moron, and you would think that witches and wizards would have a higher standard than the humans whom they always make fun of. But it's the fact that the bus can't just be a bus, with a interesting conductor,etc. It has to travel at a ridiculous speed where everyone is flying around driven by a half blind guy, people actually sleep though it and Harry is treated like crap. Why would you want to be a part of this? Is it funny, no. Is it creative, no. Wouldn't it be easier to just drive the bus in a normal way then have to squeeze it and everyone in it to go between two other buses while going the wrong way???All I ask myself during these films is WHY? Why would they have a school book that tries to attack you, don't they have laptops in 2004 in wizard land? Why is there a maid, can't they just snap their fingers and clean the room? Why is everything so dirty and old, wouldn't wizards have the best of everything instead of no light bulbs? Why would anyone want to hang out in a world where everything breaks down, children aren't protected and even the simplest things can kill you and nothing is in the least predictable, wouldn't this world be incredibly retarded? Why would they put dangerous dementors in front of every door to protect the children, ever heard of security guards, and their the ones attacking Harry? Why is a teacher almost blind, couldn't one of the other wizards cure her? What teacher would allow a kid to fly on a giant wild chicken/horse, could you see a tiger being brought into class here?Everyone knows Serious Black is trying to kill Harry but they leave him alone by himself as they all go off on a class trip?In what world, wizard or not, would a school allow dozens of 12 year old boys and girls to all sleep together on the floor overnight? I can say I truly don't understand these movies, why are they playing a game in a lightning storm? These kids are not immortal and can be killed. It's just really dumb. And again this stupid game where you can win it completely away from the other game that's going on which really means nothing? There is a killer on the loose, dementors all over and yet the kids are all allowed to roam free where ever they want?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Least of Potter Films So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I am too jaded today, or maybe I don't like a lot of change, but change came plenty in this third installment of the Harry Potter films. I have never read one printed word of the series, but I did see and enjoy the first two films immensely. They were gorgeous, splendid, exciting films laced with suspenseful action scenes, quirky, genuine acting performances, and likable heroes. Not so for this film. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione age and become teens, I found that I liked them a good deal less as rebellious teenagers(another viewer touched on this earlier). Don't get me wrong. I know it is the natural progression of events. But I see too much of this in real life(and am not fond of it at all), I just didn't seem to care or appreciate Harry's problems in this one. Point number two: the acting in this film was not up to snuff with the other two. There are I think two reasons for this. One, the "bad" guy Gary Oldman has virtually nothing to do or say. When he is on screen he gives one of his most boring, humdrum performances I ever seen from someone with his talent. Emma Thompson is wasted in her role as an instructor, and Michael Gambon has none of the charm Richard Harris gave to the Dummbledorf(?) role. There was no Jon Cleese cameo. Richard Griffiths has a very small role as Harry's bad uncle. Maggie Smith has maybe two lines. Why bother having her in the film? At least Alan Rickman and David Thewlis add some meat to this otherwise lean offering in terms of acting. The second reason is that the actors were not nearly as developed as they had been in the previous two films. Where was the tenderness between Harry and Dumbledorf? Daniel Radcliffe's angst over his parent's series of unfortunate events was not realistic nor was it even passably believable. Another thing that happens with child actors as they age is that much that they could get away with as younger children they cannot as they age. The cute factor or the believability factor decreases or in this disappears. What the film does have going for it are some well-shot action sequences with some impressive CGI effects. The game scene in the rain was especially breath-taking and the hippogryph was amazing. The movie is not bad, but, for me at least, it just doesn't conjure the same kind of magic the first Potter films did. Of course much of that change came with a new director with few legitimate screen credits to take on a project of this size. It is a bit darker in some ways, but the plot doesn't seem to be nearly as cohesive as the first two. I guess as its cast will not get any younger - I probably will never feel the same way about future Potter installments. Mouthy teenagers just don't seem to engage me at all but rather enrage me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of the books, I found this movie to be quite awful. I understand that the director has to cut parts of the book to make this into a condensed film, and I've made my peace with that. However, this movie seemed rushed and too many important details were left out. Not only that, scenes were added that weren't in the book which didn't add to the movie in any way. I tried to watch this as an unbiased observer, pretending I had never read the book, and that made it worse. If I were a neutral observer, I would say that the characters are not developed enough, and the story was too rushed and sparse of details to give any real clarity as to what was going on. I just got done watching the first two movies, and while the cut scenes annoyed me, I ultimately decided that it was okay. I do not feel this way about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and I can't believe anybody who hasn't read the books enjoyed this. As much as I cherish the books, I don't feel like this story is easily translated into film, and I think it shows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge Potter Fan, but this Movie sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read every book of the Harry Potter series and have liked everyone of them except for this one. This movie in my opinion strays way too far away from the book, and fails to hit all the key points of the book. I hated the ending of this film, as harry flying on his thunderbolt to a freeze frame was lame( Really never end a movie like that), and the exclusion of the quidditch house cup, a huge part of the novel is something that hurts this film. I also don't like any of the rest of this film, or at least its adaptation of the book, which was one of my favorites of the Harry Potter Series. The only movie I would compare this to in terms of being weak is the Half Blood prince, but that gets a pass, as it was much longer than this one. All in all, as much as I love the books, and liked all of the movies except for this one, this movie sucks big time compared to the book</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mercy is Sweet !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first 2 HP movies. Then forgot all about them after watching! Now, everybody told me that the third is the best of the best. After watching it, it's official : they're all wrong! I can assure you; the 3 leads were so fine (Yes, Daniel Radcliffe wasn't silly yet!). The directing was solid and beautiful. The music was hearty. And the imagination was the highest point at all (I adore the eater book.. priceless !). But save that.. I didn't find anything more to be loved! It's this script. I hated it so much. After the intro sequence of the flying relative I didn't run into something as complete. The facts were being discovered in non-exciting way. Even the time travel matter near the end wasn't a satisfying climax. I think, as a whole, the fantastic images kept the screenwriter away from the main conflict which transformed eventually into something latent, thin and uninteresting.I felt no comic moments. The actors themselves were out of being funny with so dry lines and situations. (Emma Watson) was creepy more than droll. I pitied great talent like (Maggie Smith) for playing an extra! And I need no confirmation to prove that (Michael Gambon) is the worst Dumbledore at all! The poor man isn't a peer to the late (Richard Harris) else being so pale and weak Dumbledore apart. This casting turned the character from 150-year-old wise mentor into uncharismatic and tasteless teacher.Despite the magical frame, this was humdrum. I was screaming at places : "Mercy.. have mercy on me people". Maybe it's for the die-hard fans' taste. But surely not for mine. BTW...After days of watching I forgot it as well, yet with irritation this time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite watchable, but Rowling's (flawedly conceived) world fails to impress me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read any of the books (I have much better things to do with my time), but perhaps that makes me more qualified to judge the movies on their own merit. HP 3 is a visually terrific movie, entertaining although not exactly gripping, with predictably good special-effects, and a top adult cast (Gambon, Rickman, Oldman, and Thewlis).However, I have some problems with the logic and the characterization. Rowling has fallen into the same trap as many authors of kids' books and movies to portray half the adults as raving morons. (Just pandering to the young readers, nothing new...) It would seem that Malfoy has more leverage hence real power than all the teachers combined; he basically gets that "chicken" to be executed and loses Coltrane the job, instead of getting himself punished. I'm told by an avid HP fan that Snape (Rickman) covers for him, but surely this Snape cannot have THAT much power in the school. (And if he does, then the other teachers are morons for letting him.) Additionally, Malfoy is such a walking cliché as the "evil brat" that he ceases to be either interesting or effective as HP's same-age nemesis. The constant snickering is too cheap a gimmick even for crappy comic-books, plus there is the total illogic of how Malfoy can possibly be a leader for his friends when he displays extreme cowardice every ten minutes. Fantasy or not, a movie has to follow at least the most rudimentary rules/laws of human (group) psychology. Why Malfoy isn't abandoned 20 times over by his friends is beyond me. Evidently, Rowling has never been a boy (or?) so she doesn't understand how boys think. A leader does NOT strengthen his position by whining like a school-girl ten times a day. It's just absurd i.e. Malfoy's behaviour is total overkill, lacking the slightest subtlety or logic.Another typical cliché is HP's character. Rowling succumbs yet again to a typical trap that female authors fall into when developing a main character who is a boy, and that is that she created the image of a semi-nerdy Harry Potter - much like Sue Townsend's absurdly unrealistic wimpy, annoying Adrian Mole. Why do women sympathize so much with the delta male boy? Why not make HP be an alpha-male in-the-making? But Rowling is more concerned with making tons of money as quickly as possible, i.e. cashing in on the hype while it lasts, than with writing water-tight stories or avoiding some unnecessary clichés. Sure, the books have more detail hence should be less illogical than the movies, but I have been told by HP readers that many of my criticisms can be extended to the books as well. Besides... even if the books were flawlessly written (which I doubt) she is ultimately responsible for the movies' quality hence its flaws.The scene in which HP is confronted with Sirius for the first time is messily written. If Thewlis and Oldman had a gram of intelligence they would tell HP straight away that it is the "mouse" that they want to kill, and not him. "Let's kill him" is a misleading plot-device meant to create suspense, but at the expense of logic. Why would HP prevent Snape from killing or capturing Sirius? Just because he found out Sirius is his godfather? It doesn't wash.If Hermione (what a dumb, dumb name) is so clever, so quick to make the right decisions, so strong-willed, so hard-working, so powerful, why doesn't she simply destroy Voldemort in this third part and solve everyone's problems? It's absurd that Hermione plays the leader in the movie's finale, with HP seeming lost and confused, never sure what to do next, following Hermione like some obedient, weak-willed puppy. Is this Rowling's nod to feminism? If HP is the main character - and especially "The One" - where are his leadership qualities or his cleverness?The casting of Harry Potter is weak. Radcliffe is bland, insufficiently charismatic for the role. But what could one expect? It was nepotism at work, yet again...There are some cute scenes, as with HP trying to open the "Monsters' Book".On the extra DVD, someone from the crew actually said that the dementors have been made out to look unique, "like something that has never been seen before" on film. Tolkien's/Jackson's wraiths, anyone?Rowling and the HP filmmakers have borrowed so much from Tolkien/Jackson, that they should at least have the decency to admit to it and not lie through their teeth.The director Cuaron went on to make one of the worst films of this decade, "Children Of Men". Watch it and laugh...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delight for Fans of the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is the most enjoyable and entertaining of the series so far.Director Alfonso Cuarón and adapter Steven Kloves just assume we've read the books and seen the other movies so focuses on new main plot points with little time spent on explanations and side stories. So while this not a good entry point for neophytes, it's a barrel of laughs and excitement for fans. The kid stars and co-stars are growing suitably along with the story line and I certainly hope they can continue with each movie, as their characters fit like gloves.The adults continue to be a stellar representation of British talent, though they ham it up a bit too much, with the addition of David Thewlis as the first nice guy defense of the dark arts teacher who surprisingly could have seemed a bit more tormented about his monthly problem, Emma Thompson playing the clairvoyant as just plain batty, Michael Gambon a bit too twinkly in replacing Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Timothy Spall literally as a rat.The very long, and visually delightful, closing credits show the extent of the special effects, but we do see them all on the screen. Well, not all the long list of accountants and the masseur.And they needed Cynthia Weil to come up with song lyrics that are taken straight from the witches of "MacBeth"? As it was a few weeks until my family could get organized to see it, the print we saw was pale and had poor sound, which made the noisy and noting-the-obvious all-ages audience particularly distracting. Though at the end of the 141 minutes, the kid in back of me (and inside of me, too) protested to his parents: "That wasn't long!" (originally written 7/6/2004)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This kiddies flick follows the continuing adventures of a young wizard in training, named Harry, and his bestest buddies, a redheaded goofball named Ron and a feisty female name Hermoine. A new director for the third installment in this popular series puts a somewhat darker spin on the proceedings, which involves Harry attempting to solve his parents' murders. The movie has some eye-popping special effects and a large roster of quirky characters, all played by familiar British actors. Other than that, this is strictly for fans of the series -- of which there are plenty to keep this fantasy franchise afloat forever, God knows. Everyone else beware. About halfway through, Harry and his buddies do some time tripping, resulting in the plot being played out all over again! I was cringing near the end, thinking they might go through the whole thing a third time. Fortunately and mercifully, it comes to an end before this can happen. Harry Potter fans will have fun. No one else will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was a disgrace to my Favorite book of the entire series. I was sorely disappointed with the complete absence of Quidditch (and I don't count the one scene where he gets attacked by dementors, they win the cup in the book), the constant unnecessary changes (talking heads hmm?), changes in the entire set, which was wonderful beforehand, The explanation of who Sirius is to Harry is severely lacking as well.This movie was such a disappointment for me. I read PoA enough that the binding of the book was finished and I was extremely excited for this movie. It was a sure let down and I did not watch Harry Potter movies for a long time afterward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although Being a Good Adventure, It Is the Weakest Story of the Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While travelling for his third year in Hogwarts, the grown-up Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is advised that the criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizards' Prison Azkaban. Sirius Black is blamed for being responsible for the death of Harry's parents and their best friend, Peter Pettigrew. In the train, Harry Potter faces an evil Dementor, sort of creature who drains good memories and life of their victims and which was sent to chase Sirius Black, but he is saved by Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). Once in Hogwarts, he realizes that the school is surrounded by Dementors, sent to protect Harry Potter and the students against Sirius Black. After many adventures, the truth is disclosed. Although being a good adventure, I found "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" the weakest story of the trilogy. There are many situations used in the other two stories, like the game they play, or the bad treatment of Harry Potter's relatives, the character of Emma Thompson is too silly and not funny and Daniel Radcliffe does not correspond in some dramatic situations. Emma Watson, in the role of Hermion Granger, has another excellent performance. It is funny to see how the cast grew and changed in a couple of years. However, this movie is a great entertainment and does not disappoint. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Harry Potter e o Prisioneiro de Azkaban" ("Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likability still intact despite director fault</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his third year at Hogwarts Harry Potter (Radcliffe) is under the watchful eyes of the Dementors, soulless creatures on the hunt for murderer Sirius Black.In the third instalment of what surely is now the biggest franchise on the planet, Harry and friends head back to school which is darker and more dangerous than ever before. We say this with every film but this was truly the point where the franchise went from family entertainment to dark and dangerous thrills.Chris Columbus dropped out of his director chair to be replaced by an unknown Alfonso Cuaron, and when reviewing all the films it is evident to see that this change was the biggest mistake in the franchise.Filled with awkward shots, an essence of predictability and many insignificant filling scenes (frozen planets, trees and clock gazing), Cuaron's direction is unbelievably inadequate, particularly for this dark transition. The adaptation of wide angled lenses gives too much information to the scenes and feels inappropriate in context. The camera is always on the move also. It never stays still and we never get a chance to settle on the moment which is a real pain as the significance of scenes is never properly justified. However if there is one thing the director handles well is the arrival of the Dementors. On the train the characters first encounter the Azkaban guards and the slow approach goes so well with the notion of the book you are right there in the heart of the moment, uncontrollably transfixed with the dark ghost like character.This was always debated to be the least thrilling book out of the franchise. Whereas Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets had a mystery to solve, Prisoner of Azkaban sits back and lets the tale come to the characters. Events happen and move on drawing all to a major finale which thankfully livens things up. The book had its moments and where this is still entertaining the fact is this is where the books became more like a soap drama than a family entertainment film.The young stars shine once again with Watson in her best role to date. Gary Oldman's Sirius is what the book represents and Michael Gambon's adaptation of Dumbledore does not do justice to Richard Harris' reflection as the Wizard.Despite the faults in direction and lack of story, this 2004 picture will still grip, shock and entertain with its stunning effects and bouncy performances. The fact is the likability is still intact and will please any fans of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie just sucked. the only decent harry potter films were 1 and 2. this one was unbelievable. what really annoyed me was the fact that dialogue was taken directly from the book, which is fine, but the character's say those lines (as a matter of fact ALL their lines) in a very boring and un-enthusiastic way, which brings me to my next point. this film was so depressing. just looking at it made me want to cut myself. not just because of the boring acting, but because of the color. THERE WAS SO MUCH GRAY! everything had a dark gray tint. the darkness level was so high, that the Ghostbusters game on Nintendo looks like a Van Gogh painting compared to this. the CGI is that bad, but could've been better. the only film that can use CGI and still be an awesome movie was 300. this film, had mediocre CGI. the only things that were even close to decent was the music and the special effects. that was probably their goal, to have all this CGI and great music to draw the audience away from such an awful film. WELL IT DIDN'T WORK ON ME WARNER BROS.! this film lacked what the two others had. originality. the two other films made up their own lines, amazing music, and they used CGI only when it was necessary. not this film. if you like this movie, fine, but i consider it an awful adaptation of such a great book in the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the Harry Potter that we've come to expect. This kid, and his friends Hermione and Ron, have become rebellious...like todays teens. Of course, they ARE teens now. But they've actually become disrespectful, yelling SHUT UP to adults and generally acting a bit too much like I see kids doing everywhere. It make it a bit more difficult to actually LIKE the kids the way we have in the past. The story is, as usual, very good, the acting first-rate and the special effects are better than the previous films. There is a little less "wonder" built in, with emphasis on the story and characters rather than the magical stuff at Hogwarts (floating candles and the like). The tone of this film is a good bit darker than the previous two also. However, I still enjoyed watching it and will, as always, eagerly await the next installment of the Harry Potter series. However, I only gave it a 7 out of 10 because of what I cited about the attitudes of the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A darker Potter... could have used more humor...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What strikes me most about this third Potter film is how truly dark it is during its two hours and twenty minutes of storytelling. Darker both in theme and in cinematography. Although the photography is striking at times, too much of the film is enveloped in darkness which is going to make a lot of the special effects look a lot less intriguing when it makes its transition to home video.This entry is first-rate entertainment all the way. Daniel Radcliffe looks considerably more mature than he did previously but his acting remains largely one-dimensional until he is moved to anger. The early sequence where he puts a hex on a boorish aunt by inflating her like a balloon is the most whimsical touch of magic in the whole film. All the other magic is mostly on the dark side and this is precisely what's wrong with this Potter entry--not enough bits of humor to lighten up when things get too tense. Apparently, kids will love it anyway.Standouts in the cast are Alan Rickman's hateful Snape and Emma Thompson's brief turn as an off the wall professor. Largely ignored is Maggie Smith who barely matters at all--another case where her zaniness would have injected more humor into the dark plot. She no sooner delivers a few lines than she is gone for the rest of the film.Most outstanding special effect is the half-eagle half-horse creation (the Hippogriff) which does an amazing job of looking both real and frightening as it takes Harry for a wild ride in the sky.Emma Watson's Hermione could have used some dubbing to clarify her spoken words for American audiences and Rupert Grint continues to be the most amusing of the leading trio with his expressions of fright or disbelief. Both have settled easily into their roles. Robbie Coltrane has some nice moments here.Imaginative and abetted by a nice background score--but a bigger dose of humor would have balanced all of the darker aspects of the tale. Noticeably missing is the sort of quirky humor that pervaded the first Potter film directed by Chris Columbus. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing that ever happened to the Harry Potter saga is the selection of Alfonso Cuaron to direct the film and bring the third installment to the screen. Mr. Cuaron is a huge talent, and his contribution to this movie is enormous.Credit must go to Mr. Cuaron in perhaps getting Daniel Radcliffe to be a bit less stiff than in the other two films before. Also, Mr. Cuaron has the advantage of bringing together most of the best actors of the English stage and cinema.David Thewlis excels as Professor Lupin. This excellent actor has never been better and it's a shame we don't get to see him much. What can one say of the tremendously gifted Alan Rickman? His contribution is also vital to the film. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is amazing. So is Timothy Spall, in the small role of Peter Pettigrew.On the other hand, the female roles are a bit anemic. One would have liked to have seen more of the incomparable Julie Christie, who is seen through a glass darkly! Emma Thompson is hilarious as Professor Sybil Trelawney.Let's hope that now that Mr. Cuaron has been found, the producers entrust him with the next films.</fullReview>

In the book(s), they do nothing more but hover above the ground. The same thing happens in the 5th movie, just as annoying.5. The knight bus scenes were WAY overdone and too wacky. And the shrinking head was just cringe worthy.6. Quidditch players do not have numbers on the uniforms.7. Also is it me or did Hogwarts look really small??? Compared to the first two movies where it looked grand and epic. Major effects/design fail.8. Pettigrew is supposed to be short and stubby, not taller than Sirius.9. Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup is not shown.10. The punching scene was so overdone. Without the line from Herminone it just feels like a run of the mill scene in any movie with a girl punching a guy. And the clichéd "That felt good" line just crowned it.11. The Shrieking Shack. First off it's not SMALL. It's supposed to be HUGE. Secondly that scene ended before it even began. It reminds me of the ministry of magic scenes in OOTP where it was reduced from many rooms into one giant room.12. WHERE IS CADOGAN???? Without him the entire movie didn't make sense!!! That's like cutting Aragorn from Lord of the Rings!!!! 13. The whole film just felt really rushed, like they were focusing more on the action as opposed to the important scenes in the book.14. The best thing about this is that at least Cuaron won't be directing another Harry Potter movie.This just hurt my soul. Thankfully Newell redeemed the series with the best yet, Goblet of Fire.</fullReview>
