		<shortDescription>Couldn't stop crying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not at all an emotional person,but this movie really touched me,i couldn't even stop crying after 15 minutes from the final.I just sat on my armchair,and started to cry. This movie,teaches us first of all about love,there is no power bigger than love,nothing compares to this strong feeling. I'm really objective when it comes about movies,and honestly no one till now,have cut me as deep. It's surprising...but true,that everything in this world,is ruled by love,and if you thought that only humans are aware of this,you did wrong. I liked the performance,i loved the music(it was so so calm)So glad to see this film,and i truly recommend it for everyone,i'm really sure you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Touching and Real!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie today, and I'm so glad I did.It is based on a true story and it's only natural that the movie is great because the real story itself is very touching. One of the things that sets this movie apart from the other movies that involve animals is how they stuck to reality instead of throwing in some a-little-hard-to-believe elements here and there just to make it more entertaining.Sometimes they show things through Hachi's eyes as opposed to human eyes, which helps you relate to him and understand how he felt and what he thought then, as well as emphasizes that Hachi is the main character of the movie.This is not just a kids' movie. In the end everyone including myself was crying because we were so moved. It is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I just came back from seeing this in Shinjuku earlier and I can honestly say that I have NEVER seen so many people crying at the end of a movie.... it really is a sad story.However, it's also a heartwarming tale of loyalty, about how people and dogs are more than just friends and, I guess most of all, about how a dog's love for its master never fades - even after his/her death!Richard Gere was fantastic in this movie, he bonded really well with the dog and it never felt like watching an actor at all - it genuinely seemed to be a movie with his own dog! I highly recommend this to people of all ages. There are enough bits to laugh at (seeing Richard Gere teaching his dog to play 'fetch' was brilliant!) and the story is portrayed really well (even if there were some changes made to the original Japanese tale)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unprecedented loyalty in a story of age-old friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing the real-life story behind it, Hachiko: A Dog's Story (2009) has been made in a sort of staged documentary style, similar to the kind of movies often seen on documentary channels (e.g. NatGeo), however without a narrator so common in documentaries, and including well-known actors (Richard Gere, Sarah Roemer and Joan Allen), making it more suitable for theatrical distribution.Before my last year's visit to Tokyo I've been unaware of the true-life story this movie is based upon. In time an occasion came up to meet a friend in Shibuya city, contemporary center of Tokyo's youth culture (shopping, fashion, nightlife...), and that's how I've learned about the popular local meeting point for all Tokyoites, the Hachik&#x14d; Akita dog statue just outside of Shibuya Train Station, but the real story behind it has been still eluding me ever since. After seeing this movie, and some additional research on the web, all pieces have fallen into place.In retelling the story of common bonding between the dog and its owner, so usual that it comes so natural, film is moving at slow pace, following events of an ordinary life, though not without occasional comedic and dramatic overtones. Even past the dramatic highpoint, when common acts of affection and loyalty evolve towards such an unheard-of faithfulness and ultimate devotion, pace of the storytelling does not change, relying primarily on fine details and emotional build-up. Of course, this might not attract everybody, providing that majority of movie audience today is highly dependent on fast paced, action packed scenes, getting thrills from 3D CG stylized ambiance and suspense, high volume amplitudes and aggressive, often rude highlights of any other nature. However, for those who can do without it, and keep alive their interest even in a simple story, who won't shy away from emotional involvement (as if this can be controlled), they shall easily find themselves consumed by its mere beauty and warmth. Usual man's-best-friend story, spiced with an intriguing yet inspiring detail, shall leave you a bit sad, inevitably pensive, but ultimately delighted. Even more so after the reading of the real-life epilogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enough to make a grown man cry!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachi is a movie based on the true story about a dog in Japan, Hachiko, who would wait at the train station every day for his owner to arrive even after the owner passed away.I have never seen the original Japanese version of the movie but know the story well as I have been told by many people here in Japan. There is a statue of Hachiko that stands outside of Shibuya Station in Tokyo. Now the statue is the most popular place for Tokyoites to meet their friends before going out shopping or dining in Shibuya.Unlike other Japanese remakes, this movie actually gives credit to the original story so that you don't get the sense that Hollywood wants to call it its own. All actors/actresses in the movie do a superb job in making you feel as if you were a part of the community embracing the dog. Compared to the original story, people were more accepting of Hachi rather than considering him a nuisance. Of course this is going to be released in the U.S. as a holiday movie so the goal is to make it uplifting.Just a warning, do take many tissues. I am a grown man and can honestly say that I have never really cried during a movie. I think the score of the movie plus the dog being so adorable made me lose myself. When I looked around the theater though, every single person was crying and I saw a lot of red eyes as I left the Men's restroom. Any movie that can make me do that deserves a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally a film without explosions, computer graphics, and violence. A family film with a message. Adults will relate to the story of life-long friendship and loyalty. Children will love the "dog story" A tender story will huge box office potential. The possible "sleeper hit" of the holidays. Pet lovers everywhere will relate to this film and will leave theaters in tears. A weepy, wonderful film about the bond that develops between one man and a dog after a chance meeting at a train station. Bring extra tissues! Based on a true story, this film was shot mostly in Woonsocket, Rhode Island at a historic old train station. Beautifully shot and edited. The film runs less than 2-hours. The film generally adheres to the actual true story of a dog in Japan. The dog became a national treasure and a monument was erected to honor him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not sad, but eyes red</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally a film from the USA (albeit based on a true story in the 1920s Japan) that is without guns, explosions and free of violence and not based at all on romantic elements!"Love and Loyalty" succinctly sums up the film. The love so simple, so pure and the loyalty so unfailing, so steadfast that it would melt any steel heart. I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red (!!)The main characters never "take flight" but that matters not at all. It's the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one, but profoundly touching, So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears.Hachiko, the Akita dog, has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.A must-watch film, especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You cannot get it any better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its really hard to articulate when you have so much to write and so little words to express. And even lesser words which could actually help you convey what you want to say. The closest word which comes to my mind in this case is 'stupendous'.Hachiko is a true story about a dog in Japan and the special bond he shared with a professor whom he met when it was a little puppy. The story has been put forward exceptionally well by the cast and the director.The movie has been kept extremely simple with minimum effort on the scenes, yet remarkably you are kept spellbound after a couple of minutes into the movie. And as the other reviews suggest, making the whole theater grab onto their tissues explains how good it really is.Lastly, coming for someone who also rates 'Eight below' as one of his favorite's, a high rating of Hachiko would seem a little biased to many. But in my honest opinion I don't think that anybody who has watched this movie can rate it below 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first knew about "Hachiko: A Dog's Story" because of Sarah Roemer, my favorite actress. When I read more about this movie and found out that Richard Gere and Joan Allen were in the cast too, I was really excited.I saw the movie on 29 Setember at "Festival do Rio de Janeiro" and I loved it! It's really powerful and touching. I loved how they showed the dog's vision in black &amp; white.The only thing that I didn't like at all was that the characters seems to "never take flight". I know Parker (Richard Gere) and the dog Hachiko are the main characters, but I think that the other characters could have been explored a bit more. But I do understand why it wasn't done.If you are a dog person, you will definitely love this movie! It's a sad, beautiful story that touches everyone's heart! A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will not leave you the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think at the end of the day, what matters in a movie is how different it leaves you after you've watched it. It could be technically brilliant and leave you in amazement about how a narrative can be structured, leave you thinking about an issue from a totally unique perspective or just leave you thinking.But if you believe that the impact a movie has on you is important - you cannot afford to miss this movie. I've never written a review in the past 7-8 years of using IMDb but signed up just so I could say how much I loved this movie.I read a couple of reviews talk about crying during the movie and thought it odd. I can't remember the last time I cried during a movie - but towards the last 15 minutes of the movie I didn't only cry - I cried from the depth of my heart, not out of sadness but from a much deeper sense of realization the power of true love and how it can manifest itself. You hear so many times that there is 'God' in all of us if we can realize it - at the end of this movie you will know why it's true.It's a must watch movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true story and one of the best films of all time ! (not exaggerating)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched some touching and moving movies in my lifetime and about 2 movies have made me cry, However i was crying my eyes out when i was watching this Hachiko movie. I was crying for a good 10 -15 minutes even after this movie ended. I have browsed through the comments and reviews on this IMDb board and on other online forums and have noticed that so many other people who watched this movie have also cried. I really think NO OTHER MOVIE has made so many people cry. Whenever i saw Hachiko go to the station and sit there waiting oblivious to the fact his owner died, my heart died a little each time.Knowing that this movie was actually based on a real life story set in the 1920s-1930s in Tokyo whereby an Akita-breed dog waited in front of the Shibuya train station day by day around the same time at the same spot for NINE WHOLE YEARS for his beloved university professor Professor Ueno to come back from work, really breaks my heart.No animal or human would ever sit in front of the station to wait for someone they love for THIS LONG (9 FREAKING YEARS). This dog Hachiko must have had such ENORMOUS love for his owner that he would throw his life away (9 years is like 7 decades in dog years) waiting in front of the station at the RIGHT TIME each day.How clever are dogs? Real-life Hachiko somehow knew how to read the time in order to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years. Waiting for 9 years- wow! I never knew that the extent of an animal's LOVE and DEDICATION and PERSISTENCE could reach those heights.In real life, Hachiko's was given away after his master's death, but he routinely escaped, showing up again and again at his old home. This showed that Hachiko loved his original owners (Ueno and his wife and kids) too much to let go of his master Ueno or his memory of him and wanted to return to his remaining living owners. Eventually, Hachiko's apparently realized that his Professor Ueno no longer lived at the house. So he went to look for his master at the train station where he had accompanied him so many times before. How smart and clever is that of a dog? The other original owners of Hachiko had moved to a different location and Hachiko could not find his other living original owners since he is a dog and so he decided to wait in front of the railway station like he always used to do for his master to turn up and be reunited with him, This real life story of Hachiko clearly demonstrated UNDYING, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR ANOTHER since both the PHYSICAL ABSENCE of his owner Professor Ueno and the PASSING OF TIME would not diminish Hachiko's love and UNFLINCHING LOYALTY for his original master Ueno. This real life story also reminds us about HOW LOVE CAN MAKE ANYONE (INCLUDING ANIMALS AND DOGS) do CRAZY THINGS for someone they love.Somehow I just wished that in real-life, the wife and family of Professor Ueno should have just placed lifeless body of Professor Ueno on the floor for a while for Hachiko to sniff and inspect the body. This might sound crazy to all you people reading this but i believe that dogs know about life and death and would be able to tell if a fellow dog or a human is dead. I am quite sure that Hachiko, being clever enough to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years, would be able to figure out that Ueno was dead. Then this would have given Hachiko at least CLOSURE, then he would not have to wait for 9 years. You can read up on the real life story of Hachiko in this Wikipedia page which also lists all the Japanese films made about Hachiko. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachiko Or you can just Yahoo! Or Google Hachiko's real life story for more information.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loyalty: A Trait To Be Admired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think you find a better example of a dog's devotion to his master than this one, a based-on-a-true-life tale of a dog who was into a routine of meeting his beloved male owner every day at 5 p.m. at the train station.I saw this movie a week ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. If the words "love" and "loyalty" mean anything to you, this is a nice story see unfold.The only major mistake made in this movie is that it should have been done as a 1920s period piece. I say that because throughout the story, the dog runs free around the town/city, which is impossible today with leash laws everywhere.Whatever, the story is still very good, very memorable and very touching in spots near the end. The only spoiler I'll use is a good one: if you fear watching an animal film with a bad/sad ending, you're safe: the dog survives....that's all I'll say on that.Kudos to Richard Gere for a nice performance. This is definitely not he kind of film he usually does but he explains in a bonus feature, "I read the script, cried, and couldn't say no." The story was too good for him to pass up. That's my recommendation to you: go rent the DVD, sit back and enjoy a nice memorable tale of man's best friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films that I have ever watched, it is the most heartwarming and yet the most heart wrencking movie, can't recall any film have such emotional impact on me. I still keep thinking about the story and every time when I think about it, I felt sad and so sorry for both the Prof and the dog, I am sure this is a film I won't forget ... the soundtrack is another praise.., definitely a classic for Richard Gere.. Although the movie centered on the bond/love between Hachi and his human parent, this is also a story about love between spouse, love between friends, father-daughter love and most of all, a close knit community of people with a big heart...My favourite scene is where Mrs Wilson come back to town after 10 years and found Hachi still waiting, so touching I can't control my tears... the closing scene is just devastating, Hachi died still dreaming of his master coming out of the train station.....This is a must see movie for every dog lovers. For human, dogs may just be a part of our life, but for the dog(s), we are everything they got. Again, Richard Gere is just superb and natural, so did Joan Allen. And lastly the dogs are so cute and adorable.A truly remarkable wait - 10 years... words failed to describe the amount of love, devotion and loyalty Hachi had for Parker...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is pure heart and soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first ever review. I have been a reader of user reviews on IMDb for a few years and this is the first time I felt I had to write something about a film. I will try and not spoil the film for you. The film is based on a real story which took place in Japan from 1923-1935 about a dog named Hachiko who used to wait for his master's return at the train station everyday for 9 years even after his master passed away. That's the basic plot, the rest you just have to see to actually feel the story.Just finished watching this movie yesterday and still can't get it out of my head. A feeling of sadness has engulfed me after watching this. I am at a loss for words to describe this movie as no other movie has ever touched me so deeply. I was pretty much crying and sobbing the entire second half of the film and by the time it was over, it brought me down to my knees.Richard Gere was at his usual best but the real highlight of the film was the acting of the dogs. They were incredible in how they were able to portray the range of emotions through their facial expression and body language. The music throughout the film was brilliant too and that helped in driving home the felling of sadness and loneliness that Hachi went through.I had a dog too and it brings back memories of how sad and depressed I felt for a month after he passed away. I have experienced such undying, unconditional love and loyalty from my dog too and it made this movie extra special for me. If there was ever a movie that I will remember for the rest of my life, this has to be it. This is a must see for any person with a heart and soul. I know I am a better person today after watching this and I am confident it might also have the same effect on some of you. Thanks for reading and do take care whoever you are. Love your dogs and always remember that he will always be there for you even in your darkest, loneliest hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If your date is late an hour or so , you would most likely leave. You wouldn't wait 2 or 3 hours , let alone a day for he or she. Think about it, would you wait all your life for someone to return. Over time we tend to forget, and move on with our lives. That's in our nature, We humans have the tendency to forget. This story is great portrayal of a Dog who's whole revolves around one man, Parker. Its a simple story told in a simple manner, yet it nearly brought tears to my eyes. The scene of Mrs. Parker returning to the town, and finding old and tired Hachiko still waiting explodes the screen with raw emotion.I have a dog, and he doesn't fetch either.Mans best friend has never been a man.SEE the movie............</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film with no preconceptions and not really knowing much about the story beforehand. All I knew was that it was based on real events in Japan. I deliberately didn't read the blurb on the DVD case because I wanted to "discover" the story for myself.I have always owned and loved dogs. Some people love their cats but I'm amongst the many who just really care for their pet dogs. Now I won't spoil the story for you except to say that after a bit of a slow start this film draws you in. As another poster said...it will teach you much about the quality of love and loyalty.I can only warn you to have plenty of tissues on hand because if you are a human being with functioning emotions you are going to cry...a lot! I am a fifty year-old "grumpy old man" but I bawled like a baby for nearly half an hour after watching this film. I also let my Staffordshire Terrier come up onto my lap (and she is VERY heavy) and I hugged her for an age! I will never look at a dog the same way again after seeing this film and I will treasure it for as long as God allows me to live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Touching Story of Loyalty and Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Bedridge, Professor Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) finds an abandoned dog in the train station and brings the dog home with the intention of returning the animal to its owner. He finds that the dog is an Akita and names it Hachiko; however, nobody claims the dog and his family decides to keep Hachi. Along the years, the popular Hachi waits for Wilson in the square in front of the station. When Wilson dies at school, Hachi keeps waiting for his owner along the years until the day the meet each other. I was quite anxious waiting for the release of "Hachiko: A Dog's Story" on DVD. I had read in the newspaper the story of the Japanese dog that had waited for nine years for his deceased owner in the 20's in Japan and I expected a good adaptation of this story of loyalty and love by Lasse Hallström. This melodramatic movie has a great cast, with Richard Gere, Joan Allen and the dogs that should be nominated to the Oscar with their expressions and acting, better than many actors and actresses that we frequently see on the screen. Be ready for tears and bring handkerchiefs and tissues together with the popcorn to the sofa, and watch a really beautiful movie with your family. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Sempre ao Seu Lado" ("Always at Your Side")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I joined this site to write a review on this amazing film. I walked into the video store this evening and grabbed it at random because of the dog on the cover and Richard Gere. I just had a feeling.What can I say, no other film has touched me as much as this and I don't think one ever will. Its off the scale. Its starts off slow but it quickly turns into such an endearing film, it makes you think about things you take for granted and a dog does this better than any actor.I'm a grown man, never cry, this film had me fighting back tears because I didn't want people to see me, I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out after it. I even joined this site to encourage more people to watch it.If you have to see one film in your life time, see this.It breaks all barriers. I was going to make a backup of it, but I want to reward the amazing people who made this film by buying it.I don't think I can ever sit through this film again, but I want it on my shelf as a wonderful reminder.Honestly, this is a film that I will never forget and one I will encourage people to watch at any given opportunity.This film will make any human being cry.</fullReview>

First half of the movie we are all feeling warm and fuzzy, laughing at the familiar goings on between owner and faithful dog. Second half of the movie, after owner dies, I get a big sore lump in my throat that won't go away. Shortly afterward I hear sniffles all around. Our dogs get bigger hugs. Tears begin to stream down my cheeks. Full out sobs by the end of the movie. Light go on. Not a dry eye in the house.The day after, I woke up with tears in my eyes. My son is still crying. My 17 year old daughter is mad at me for showing her such a sad movie. But their dad is reading all about Hachiko on the internet and I am writing a review about the movie (which I never do).This is a truly wonderful movie that will leave you feeling sad, but in a good way. But beware, my kids loved it but ultimately wished they had not seen it as it made them too sad.Cinematically well made. Slow moving but not boring. Kudos all around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that can make a Stoned Heart person Cry!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I considered myself a stoned heart person when it comes to watching emotional movies but not until I saw this movie. I am a 30 year old grown up and for the first time in my life I cant stopped myself crying. I never ever cried before during a movie but this movie is exceptional and I will not forget this movie whole my life.I don't like dogs and I am a big time Cat lover but the scenes were extremely emotional and I am thinking that it would be better if I avoided this movie. I know one thing I ll become sad whenever I remember this movie in my life and I have a deep impact of this movie.Its the most Emotional and Sad movie I have ever seen and I am sure it will remain the most emotional movie ever.I give this movie 10/10 for proving me wrong that I cant Cry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We had a dog like this for years and years and I always thought about her as something special. She was simply a gift. No other words can describe the feelings I have for her. So I'm just grateful that these guys made this movie and though it has its cheesy elements, the focus is always on the dog. Which is nice. Talking to friends, telling them the story I had to realise that everyone knows the plot from newspapers, from their memories. I think it tells something about it and I do hope that this breed will be recognized for their faith and amazingly friendly nature. Seeing this movie reminded me of her, of course. Though our dog has already died but I think that this movie is her legacy, too. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie again for the sixth time and I'm still crying. How on earth does someone decides to put this as a short shelf life and not consider this movie to come out during the Xmas holiday. You have two superb actors, Richard Gere and Joan Allen. Can you get better than that. Shame on the film industry. I couldn't get my own brothers to watch this film for a second time. They were so heart wrenched in watching it the first time around. The music, the dog and the acting made this film possible. I saw it six times and every time I saw it, I cried. It's based on a true story and everyone I know that has seen it, can't have enough tissues handy. You chose Marley &amp; Me to come out during the holidays and while I liked it and read the book, there is no comparison. This was a beautiful movie in every which way.This is an amazing story about loyalty and unconditional love. I saw the Japanese version of it and while it was very good, I stilled loved the US version of it. I don't know what possessed the film industry to ignore putting this film on the silver screen because it was so beautifully well written and the music was amazing. I believe this movie came out when Marley and Me did, and while I enjoyed Marley and Me, there were more lessons to be learned by this movie and not by a precocious dog, but one who was truly loyal. I guess because it was based on a true story, it makes it all the more heart wrenching that something like this actually happened. If you're a dog lover, you will love this film, because you could associate yourself with the character that Richard Gere played. He was actually very good, but the accolades go to the dog that played Hachi. I was so mesmerized by this movie, the cast. the music and the dog, that I ordered it from Amazon.com in Blue Ray.Modify review below:</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hachi: a must watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People say that once in a while, some random production house would come up with a movie that will change the way the average movie-goer would watch films. It wouldn't be right to say Hachiko is one such title; because it isn't. But what it does do is make you realize that there is love and faith in this world.I am a movie-buff and have seen enough "tear-jerkers" to know what that word means. But it was only with Hachi, did I realize that, at times, when things go dead silent and you have given up hope on yourself, there will be someone or something that will tell you, "You're not alone." It made me realize that in today's world, where people complain of backstabbing and disloyalty, this movie will always tell me what it takes to be loyal, and realize what true love is.Watch it. It doesn't matter whether you cry or not at the end of the movie. That's not what the movie attempts to achieve. In fact, I still don't know what this movie's objective is, if any. Anyway, try this out for once. I am pretty sure you won't regret it.</fullReview>

Lovely story and beautifully told too i'd give it all thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Japanese Canine Legend enters the world of world fame. What a movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can try to watch a movie for every day of the year and all the romantic drams going but nothing I swear will pull at your emotions more than this movie. Oh boy, what a movie and what a story! there are few of us in this life who don't love dogs or had a dog as a pet at some point in our lives. We know the Lassie stories of course.but this is based on a true story and the dog who plays in this movie deserves an Oscar for himself, if ever they give Oscars to canines! Richard Gere, as he was in Amelia, was peripheral but perfect in the companion role for the lost dog he finds at the railway station.You have been warned by others and I am warning you now, call it a spoiler if you like but don't you dare watch this without some back up[ - tissues or hankies at the ready. I am a grown up and I never stopped crying through this movie, its a sad but happy poignant movie at the same time.No blockbusters but it is unmatchable and unmissable entertainment for a movie, top drawer! OK, as with Veronika Decides to Die, they have transferred the story from its original location and having never visited Japan, though living in south east Asia, the film works perfectly. Hachiko is definitely a legend and one day I hope one day I will also visit his statue (I think there is more than one?) thank you for the production for such a delightful film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this short.I would normally steer clear of this kind of film as I find the saccharine formula hard to swallow. But this got such good reviews that I checked it out despite my better judgement.I've got to say that up to about the halfway mark I was regretting my decision and I was getting a little tired of the perfect family, pleasantville, schmaltzy overdose. And while that still kind of grates on me on some level, it really just serves as a set up for the rest of the movie(the important part) so try not to be put off by that and hang in there, safe in the knowledge that the story only really gets interesting in the 2nd half.I still don't entirely understand why this kind of thing is so touching but clearly it just is and I was crying like a baby by the end of it. So if you've ever had a pet you love and need to evacuate your tear ducts then look no further.Very sweet tribute to the bond twixt man and mutt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find myself giving this film a lower vote than it probably deserves and perhaps through no fault of the film itself. Let me explain. I am lucky enough that in my job I get to take people who I work with to the cinema. After planning on seeing a gangster flick, we ended up going into the wrong screen and ended up watching Hachi: A dogs story. We did not move to the right screen as by my watch the film had started 10 minutes before. The point is, from the start of the film when the 'U' classification came up (Suitable for 4 years +) I was a bit disappointed. Now as an actor I like Richard Gere but for the first few minutes I found his character a bit 'wooden'. At first I put this down to him having a bad film, but the more I think about it I think it was somehow done to emphasise his relationship with Hachi. Anyway, half an hour into the film disillusionment had gone and I was really enjoying the film. What was excellent for me, was that because I had never heard of the film, I had no idea what was to come. The film does an excellent job of surrounding itself around Hachi the dog. The only fancy gimmick is the occasional sight through Hachi's eyes which is done in black and white but this is only occasional. There are no doggy voices or doggy thoughts, but you still get involved with Hachi's emotions and how he is feeling. Towards the end of the film I was that into Hachi's character that I found myself bursting into tears, something that had not happened to me since I was 8years old watching ET. Luckily, we were the only ones in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I know about dog's movie, it was always Lassie. That's the best dog movie I've ever watch.But now, that opinion will change for there's another one that have the same vibe and emotional in some ways. That's Hachiko: A Dog's Story.Now, for all of you who likes Japanese culture, you should probably know about the real story of Hachi, the dog. And right here, at this very movie, you will encounter yet again the depiction of those time back there with Richard Gere as the main lead. So, you want to feel the feeling? Go ahead and watch it. You won't regret it.I couldn't say anything about this movie, except that this one is really a story that can really bring tears to your eyes. That's what happens to me right after I watch it and even better. The emotional feeling, the sentiment atmosphere in this movie, it's really marvelous.The dog is well trained and Richard Gere has proved himself again as a great actor out there. You dog lovers should watch this one.And remember to prepare a lot of tissue to stop your tear running down from your eyes.Great movies. I rate it 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hachiko leaves the audience bow to its loyalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent inspiration of 1970 Japanese movie. There were few movies in Hollywood that made my tissues wet near the climax and this is one. A very good depiction of dog's loyalty to his master based on a true incident happened in 1920. Must admit that I fear dogs but this movie brought much change with my outlook on dogs. The movie features an excellent BGM that did very well gel to the sentiment, I feel. The Censor board has approved this movie for General exhibition so it can be watched with your family. One small issue with the movie that apart from these two main characters the others weren't explored at all. The bottom line is that Hachiko's loyalty made me fear no dogs, instead love 'em.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** may contain spoilers ***I do not want to repeat all of the (quite valid) reviews.I do want to put a different interpretation on Hachi's emotions. I do not accept the notion that Hachi was too dumb to figure out that Parker was gone. After NINE YEARS, he could surely figure it out. This is not an intellect problem. Look at this from the perspective of a grief model (e.g. denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance). Hachi was stuck in denial with possible depression. Where others see loyalty, I also see an intensely emotionally wounded creature. Also, I wonder about the symbolism of Hachi taking up fetching a ball on the day Parker dies. It surely has to have some significance: Parker has the ball visibly on the piano and is clutching it as he dies. From Hachi's perspective, he has made some shift in the relationship, doing something "unnatural" to please Parker. The expectation in fetch is that the person having the ball returns it to the the other. Parker has the ball. The onus is on him to return it to Hachi so play can continue. Maybe the symbolism is that when Parker leaves that morning, not only will Parker return home to family and wife but that Parker will return specifically to complete a connection to Hachi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson about the meaning of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film I was left touched and remained thinking about it for hours. I realised that this film is not about a dog and a man, but about love and loyalty. Dogs, unlike humans, do not misconstrue love for the need for gifts, flowers and chocolates but recognise it as what it truly is; complete appreciation between two people, or of course any two animals. As the story is real it shows the unbreakable bond that love is. When Cate saw Hachi still waiting I exploded into uncontrollable tears, which continued until well after the movie ended. It demonstrated that although Hachi waited every day that Cate was also devoted as she still also felt that longing for her lost husband and made me empathise with the fact that, although Cate had moved on in her life, it was merely because of the different depth of understanding and responsibility between herself and the dog. Nevertheless, this is very much about the bond between Hachi and Parker, and the undying hope of a dog for him to return. Heartbreaking. 10 stars</fullReview>

There is something about this movie that moves in me a profound sadness and sorrow, yet a deep joy that love, as represented in this film, is possible.Even now tears well up as I relive in my mind the last moments of this film. It is a must for anyone who enjoys a solid plot, character development and animal acting that is imperceptible. As other reviews have said, it is as if Richard and the Dog were a natural fit.This movie is now on my favorites list, but I am not sure I can handle watching it again soon. Have a hand to hold, a shoulder to lean into and tissues at the ready. I am generally a stone, this movie brought forth water from a stone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Animal Tearjerker To Beat All Animal Tearjerkers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You choose to watch a movie such as this knowing darn well that it's going to turn out to be a tearjerker. You set yourself and steel yourself against it. There will be no tears, you insist to yourself. It's just a movie - even if it is based on a true story in Japan almost 80 years ago. But it's still just a movie. No tears. But in the end you have to succumb. This is literally an emotional roller coaster, with ups and downs from beginning to end. I've not always been really impressed with director Lasse Hallstrom's work, but he truly managed one of the finest and best told tearjerkers I've ever come across with "Hachi."The movie features a good performance from Richard Gere as Parker, the man who adopts (somewhat unwillingly and definitely against his wife's wishes) an Akita puppy who found him (for the point of the story is definitely that Hachi found him) and we follow the development of a bond of loyalty and even friendship between the two that transcends even death. Gere was good, but it wasn't an incredibly demanding performance, because the dog is the star. He waits anxiously day after day at the train station for Parker to come home from work, and Parker looks forward to the greeting. Then, unexpectedly, Parker dies, but Hachi never gives up, going back day after day to the station for the next ten years, waiting without hope for Parker to come off the train, all leading up, of course, to the ultimate tearjerker moment - both sad and happy - as Hachi finally dies lying outside the station one night, but in death sees Parker come out of the terminal and runs to him as they're joyfully reunited. A man and his dog reunited. If you're not shedding tears by the end of this - seriously, what's wrong with you?This is basically a much more serious version of the "Marley &amp; Me" type of storyline. Where that movie focused on the clumsy lovability of the dog, this one focuses on the undying bond of loyalty the dog shares with its master. This is truly one of the most emotionally wrenching movies (both happy and sad) you will ever come across. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes, a simplest of stories can be the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be the first to say I do not cry ever while watching movies (I can count on one hand the times that I have) and when I happened to come across this film today,I figured "why not?" It looked like a simple and cute movie about a man finding a dog and giving it a good home. Nothing special...oh how wrong was I.As many others have already stated, "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" is a beautiful tale of friendship, love, and devotion. A man who finds a small adorable puppy by accident enters a heartwarming friendship with the animal, who shows the loyalty a dog can have for its owner. Hachi (or Hachiko) is such a devoted and loving dog, following Gere's character to the train station every day and returning one the train whistled for the return of his master. It's truly one of the reasons why I love dogs so much. As time and tragedy occurs, nothing stands in Hachi's way to meet his owner at the train station every day until the end.The film's cast was superb (especially Gere, who also served as a producer) and beautifully shots. A great touch was seeing the world from the dog's POV in an almost sepia filmed shots (as dogs are colorblind). It is such a heartwarming yet heartbreaking story all at the same time! I've seen stories of owners who've passed on and their dogs staying faithfully by their sides (the US soldier whose dog didn't leave his side or the dog who stayed by his Japanese owner's grave). This is just but another example in a film format of the love that animals can bring in a person's life and vice versa.It reminds me of my dog Jett, a jet-black dachshund/rat terrier mix I picked out in elementary school. He was so tiny and I remember petting him thinking "he's the dog for us." Years later, I can remember having to take him outside, clean up after him every time he got into the trash or chewed my mom's shoes up, and playing with him at odd hours of the day. But it was my mom whom he bonded with the strongest, following her everywhere she went and waiting for her to play with him or take him outside. He was her constant companion while I was away at college and my sister worked all day and later moved out. Ten years or so later, it was the hardest time when the decision came to put him down to end his pain from an attack. Away from home and as my sister was at work, it was my mom who stood by his side as he passed. I imagine just like Hachi, Jett has images of happier times and of my mother's face as he passed on. I can only hope that when it is my turn, he will be there waiting for me.</fullReview>

I've been brought to tears through quite a few movies in 50 years, but I have to agree with my wife when she stated with the puffiest eyes I've ever sen on her, "That was the saddest damn movie I've ever seen."Why didn't we see this in a theater? I don't know, but I'm glad we did not get the opportunity. I could not contain myself through the last fifteen minutes of the movie. It's a film about love, compassion and loyalty.The synopsis of this film tells you what this film is about. These reviews you a reading tell you why you should see this film. If you are not afraid of sinking deeper into your emotions and exploding with tumultuous sorrow, rent this DVD.

		<shortDescription>Hachi and Richard Gere manage to touch our hearts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moment you start watching the puppy Hachi in the first scene of the movie being shifted from one country to another, you just cannot stop adoring the little fella. He is the highlight of the movie and thats quite intentional as it is centered around him.As many would have read in the synopsis, Hachi is brought home by Parker(Richard Gere) when he comes home from his daily work routine and finds Hachi abandoned at the train station. As many people would try to find its owner, Parker sets to find the true owner(but fails) and starts advertising for adoption. The story that unfolds later may be slow and drab but it is well told and the chemistry between Parker and Hachi is truly commendable and engaging. Small yet cute details such as showing Hachi's vision in the form of black and white are worth a mention. The characters in this movie are few but manage to deliver decent performances such as the hot dog guy, Parker's wife and friend. Without revealing much about the movie, let me point out that its Richard Gere and Hachi who steal the show. Throughout the movie you feel that two are meant to be together forever to the point you doubt sometimes that whether Parker has a daughter and a wife living in his house. Nonetheless, he loves them too.One of the most important talked about point about the movie is its ability to touch everybody's heart and make the audience and viewers shed a few tears for the second half of the movie. This is something I totally agree and this movie is one such rare gem that made me cry the most. Its just so sad in some scenes. I bet all pet lovers would love this movie and appreciate it as a highly engaging and emotional movie. This is certainly one of my favorite movies and since I am not a pet owner yet, am planning to buy an Akita dog and name it 'Hachi' for he is the hero just as the kid mentions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A benchmark for love and loyalty impossible to surpass.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had good expectations from this movie having seen it rated high on IMDb. I also knew that it was basically a dog's tale. From the opening scene where a boy proclaims Hachiko as his hero, I already had a plot in mind of some incredible deeds from the dog. But boy! Was I caught offguard! This very very simple tale just blows your mind. The single mindedness of devotion, love and loyalty is enough to leave you embarrassed, mentally and emotionally. There is no way you can stack up to this guy. I have seen some supposedly sad movies, but this one without any apparent sadness or serious moment still brings tears to your eyes. An incredible feat by any standards. A must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is a lively rendering of an incident that dated back to earlier 20th century in Japan. It's a beautiful depiction of perspective of humans and those of animals for each-other. Those who are compassionate, kind and have a soft- corner for all the innocent animals of the world and maybe specifically 'dogs' then it is a must watch for you. For others, who really don't much believe in such things, watch this movie, It'd make you do ! The soul-stirring loyalty offered by the pet will make you cry along.

		<shortDescription>True Bonds Never Die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the story about Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere, and the bond he forms with a Japanese Akita puppy, which is later found to be named Hachiko, he finds at the train station. Following is the chance relationship that develops between the 2 and how the soon become inseparable. Soon, Hachiko is noted by the inhabitants of the small Rhode Island town for showing up each day to meet Parker as he comes home from work. The Akita breed is most known for the loyalty they forge with their companions, whose loyalty is tested for nearly a decade after tragedy befalls Parker.At times, the point of view is taken so that we feel we are Hachiko, which allows us to see the curiosity, intrigue, and sometimes inquisitive thoughts he feels. One such event is when Parker attempts to get Hachi to play fetch, as he looks back at Parker curious of what is wrong with him. In other instances, when it comes to the onlookers, the angle is set such that we are looking up to Hachi. This leads into the end result of the bond formed between the 2, and that such love and loyalty is an admirable trait. After many viewings of the movie, it still manages to pull out the same feelings. The relationship between Parker and Hachi is believable, memorable and shows us what a true bond is really about. Some of you may have seen Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, or are at least familiar with movies relating to the bond between man and his companions, of the four-legged kind. These types of films show the viewers that whether from the view of the man or the animal, a deep bond means just as much to both.The story reached so deep, that I dreamt of seeing the statue dedicated Hachiko, whose loyalty to his master lasted until his last breath. Luckily, I had the privilege when I passed through Shibuya. Hachiko truly made impression on those around him, as this film will do when you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare kind of love not not expressed by humans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really made me cry for quite a long time. I somehow believed that the greatest love of all is not expressed by humans. Hachi waited for his deceased master for more or less 9 years and never gave up even though professor Wilson was dead. How many people do you think can wait forever for someone special to them? I admit I'm incapable of doing that.The story of how Hachi found Mr. Wilson may be unrealistic to some people since as if destiny brought them together, I wouldn't say anything negative about it or any of the flaws(if there is any) that critics may notice in this film. The way the master and his dog were finally reunited in heaven really warms even the coldest of hearts. In closing; to all the people reading this review, "Never forget those who you love so dearly; because they will never forget you".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, a dog's loyalty to his master, no drugs, sex, or bad language.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, set in New England, is a modern version of the true story of a Japanese man and his dog back in the 1920s and 1930s.It begins and ends with an 11-year-old boy in front of his school class telling about his "hero", and the movie that unfolds is about his grandfather's loyal dog, Hachi. His name comes from the Japanese characters on his tag, but no other information about where he came from.The small puppy is being transported by train, in a small bamboo cage, which falls off the gurney. No one notices in the crowd, and the puppy gets out. He then is discovered by traveler Richard Gere as Parker Wilson, who is a professor of music. He commutes daily by train.Parker doesn't want the puppy, we soon find out that they apparently recently had one die, and had agreed not to get another. But with no place else to put the puppy overnight, Hachi was brought home.Always good Joan Allen is Parker's wife, Cate Wilson. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is his good friend and fellow professor, Ken. And Jason Alexander is the train station supervisor, Carl.This is a fine story about the relationship between a man and his dog. Richard Gere is superb as he usually is in this sort of role.SPOILERS: Parker and Hachi develop a very close relationship, which turns into Hachi following Parker to the train station every morning as he left, then returning at 5PM in the evening as the train arrived, to greet his master, for several years. But one day Parker has a massive heart attack during one of his classes, dies, and is buried. Hachi is taken by Parker's daughter and son-in-law, but soon Hachi escapes and treks down the tracks to the train station. He makes himself a make-shift place to sleep under a rail car that apparently didn't move much. Every day he went to the train station, for 10 years, to wait for his master. He only quit when he died. The story is about loyalty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie about a dog and his relationship with his owner(s). Didn't we have something similar with Marley? Not quite! Where Marley struggled to keep up and keep you invested to the characters and/or the dog(s), this one hits all the right buttons. From beginning to end it grabs you and takes you on an emotional roller-coaster. You must be of stone, if this story leaves you completely cold (or you just don't care about animals or didn't like the movie) ...And although quite a few people seem to get the story wrong (saying something about the dog, that's not true that is), even if you knew where this was going, it still is very emotional. It's about friendship and loyalty. It's about respect and decency. And all this portrayed mostly without words.It is very nicely shot and the music score is good too. Based on something that really happened, this is a story that you should watch. And you don't have to be ashamed if a tear or two roll down your cheek ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first time, in a movie based on an animal, have I actually related to the feelings of the animal. This may sound very strange but it's true. The way the dog waited for his master every single day at the same time until he died is just heart breaking. All that hope of seeing his master was in vain until Hachiko was brought together with him after death, which is what I wanted to believe just to diminish the sadness I felt.It was so hurtful in the end that I felt like crying like a baby. After reading a few posts here for the movie, I found one thing common in all and that is how much everyone cried. It really is a tear jerker but a must see. I wouldn't just recommend people with pet dogs to watch it, but also people like me without pets. And not to mention, Hachi was a beautiful dog you are guaranteed to fall in love with him the moment he comes on screen as a little puppy. Over all, it was a simple film with all the lime light on Richard Gere and his dog and the rest, just background actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a heartwarming story about a man and his best friend. Based on a true story from the year 1925 in Tokyo, Japan, this film won't leave one eye dry. In this tear jerking film, Professor Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere, finds an Akita puppy lost in the train station. With no other option, Professor Wilson takes the puppy, Hachi, home with him. Throughout the movie an unsuspected friendship forms between the two, and they find themselves tangled in an unforgettable relationship that will change both of their lives forever. For such a strong movie, the script is rather simple and a little boring at times, being mostly monologue when Professor Wilson talks to Hachi, you can see the simple responses from Hachi in his longing looks and his deep caring eyes. The rest of the script includes side conversations between the professor's wife, played by Joan Allen, and their daughter, played by Sarah Roemer, just to name a few. Every side conversation throughout the movie connects to either Professor Wilson's past or to his relationship with Hachi. Even though the script is weak at times, I believe it was executed with great taste and worked well with the overall look and feel of the movie. To complement the script, the cinematography in Hachi was simple, but artfully done. The music playing in the background is always the same song - a song to which the professor is choreographing a dance to for one of his classes. The tempo of this song is slowed down and sped up depending on the mood of the scene, creating a more dramatic effect. Along with the music, the color of the scenes throughout the movie change very little. Much of the movie is bland with a gray overtone, causing Hachi's red fur coat to stand out. In some scenes the viewer gets to see through Hachi's eyes. In these scenes, the camera is angled from below, and the film is in black and white, just as Hachi would see it. This was a neat component that brings the viewer closer and more connected to Hachi. Along with the cinematography, the acting was outstanding. Richard Gere does a great job portraying Professor Wilson. Acting with a dog is a difficult task, but Gere did it effortlessly. Watching Hachi and Gere interact was as natural as a bee finding a flower. It seemed as if Gere and Hachi had been together for ages, even though they had only met to film the movie. The bond between them seems as real as the bond between two best friends - it's unbreakable.I don't see how anyone could stay dry-eyed during this movie. This unforgettable film is a great example of loyalty and friendship, and provides a perfect story to show the age old connection between a man and a dog. Hachi: A Dog's Tail is great for the whole family, which is rare to find in this day and age. It's a must see movie, not only for dog lovers, but for everyone.</fullReview>

The dog, actors, scenes, music exude so much emotion, are so righteous ... This film plays on feelings, with surprisingly simple but so authentic! I, who do not easily let go of tears at the sight of a film, I have confessed that there, I took a huge slap in the face, and I especially cried until 15 minutes after the end of the film. .. he is one of those films that mark you for life, and that you were watching one, two, thousand times, it will always make you the same effect: it will make you melt. A beautiful lesson in cinema too, as what we do not need to write wacky scenarios, special effects or place every 30 seconds to perform wonders ...</fullReview>

Over time the bond between them grows incredibly strong and the dog becomes extremely loyal to his owner. Then one day, tragedy strikes...Well directed, and often shot from Hachi's perspective. Ultimately you feel what the dog is feeling.Good performances from Richard Gere, Joan Allen and Jason Alexander (who shows that he can take on dramatic roles), but they are all just a supporting cast for Hachi.Warning: stock up on tissues!</fullReview>

For 9 YEARS hachi waits at railway station for his master to come back.. This is where emotions just cannot be held back by anybody.. While you are still crying your hearts out, when Joe Allen enters the frame, and when she says "oh hachi,, u poor thing... u r still waiting ??" gives you final push,takes you over the peak and then u just cannot CANNOT hold back...

		<shortDescription>More love than one can take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When man leaves to forget, the dog stays there to remember. Hachiko had shown feeling of love that most of us, humans, are incapable of. It has shown that love knows no boundaries. An impressive tale, stuck in my mind for more than a month,that has so much to teach us. An americanized - Scandinavian version of the original, that even though portrays ideal behavior of the community in an idyllic setting, invades the inconscient with soft images, a subtle but slowly penetrating soundtrack and Richard Gere in maybe the best and more human role of his long career. I saw him at first as the sex idol in 'American Gigolo' and 'Breathless' and he marked my adolescence, but his mature self is far more enchanting.When God realized Man was far from perfect, he created dogs to counter - balance.The dog sight that dominates the movie which rolls in a very slow pace - as dogs' lives usually do - let us penetrate in Hachi's soul, and that ends up to be both devastating and deliberating. I feel at the same time sorry and so relieved seeing how love triumphs over death. I'm sure that if the movie had the adequate promotion and was on the cinemas for a while, it would have gained a far more higher position in the list.</fullReview>

It was such an overwhelming feeling that my heart ached for Hachi and his family. I cannot think of a single movie that moved me in such a way that it almost felt real. Richard Gere of course did a fantastic job but, me being a dog lover the majority of the credit goes to Hachi. (I am a true fan!)

		<fullReview>I was told by friends and family that this movie was sad, having never cried over a movie before, I was skeptical. The film begins when Parker Wilson, a college music professor, finds a dog, Hachiko, at the local train station and decides to bring him home. Parker's wife, Cate Wilson, orders her husband to find Hachi a new home, but, after seeing Parker and her daughter, Andy, enjoy the dog so much, she decides that the dog will be kept.. Fast-forwarding a few years, and Hachi follows Parker everywhere, one day, as Parker returns from work via train, as he does everyday, Hachi is waiting for him, and Hachi walks home with him, this continues everyday for the next few months, until one day, as Parker is working, he has a heart attack and dies... This is only the beginning of an emotional and touching film, and I recommend you watch it as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first say that I really love this movie. Yesterday was the third time I've seen this movie and it still touches me a lot. When the professor dies and Hachi is waiting at the train station for his boss like always, not knowing he won't be coming back anymore, that is really devastating. But Hachi shows his true loyalty by coming back every day.I was very happy to see that Hachi, although he was living like a street dog after the death of the professor, was given good care by all the people around the train station. Even the grumpy train tickets sales man showed some affection after a long time.The saddest part for me is seeing old Hachi stumbling to the train station. At some day the wife of the professor is visiting the town again. On her way back to the train station she is so surprised by seeing Hachi still waiting there. It was really satisfying for me to see that she still had the change to say Hachi goodbye because he would die soon after she leaves again.At the end of the movie old Hachi closes his eyes to remember his boss. Running around as a little puppy side by side with the professor. He knows it is finally time for them to meet again. Rest in peace Hachi!</fullReview>

The last 20 minutes are heart breaking and that wonderful soundtrack....oh ...I just have to warn you not to be emotionally drained because it will make you feel sad....just remember that love is stronger than life and death! Finally a movie without all these artificial effects and a heart whelming love story that needs to be talked about and shared among people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hachi: A true once in a lifetime movie about love, loyalty and friendship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that Titanic will be the one which made me the most sad and bring tears to my eyes, well I was wrong. Hachi leaved me crying for a hour and I never felt so strongly emotional for a movie. I am dog lover, but still this one will brake even the most strong hearted. I have seen War Horse, it was a beautiful movie but this will still top that.Hachi is based on a true story which has explored many emotions in a single story. Joy and Companionship is the first half and Waiting and Sadness is the last. A touching story about a dog who waited for 9 years for his owner or should I write friend/father/who know? to come back from work and who took his last breath still waiting. The moment where Parker's daughter allow Hachi to go if have to and his wife when she meet Hachi on train station at last is heart breaking.Hachi a movie to remember. Must must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel proud that you cried watching this movie... Just that you will share the feeling with many others...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every other review here talks about crying at the end of the film. Yes, I cried too. Not once, but every time I watch the movie. I watch the movie just so that I can feel true love and cry it out.This movie is just brilliant. Dissecting it in to 2 parts - the story and the movie. The story - part of the prose in my primary school days (early 1990s) - is a must-know for every human being. Salute Hachiko!!!About the movie - it does all justice to the story. Performances, screenplay, music, direction have all been just perfect with no nonsense / artificiality to them. Spoiler - just that about half the movie is about Hachiko waiting for his master is probably the most impactful element and the highest tribute the movie makers could have paid to Hachiko!!Story very clearly teaches what is love and loyalty. But there is a very subtle message that the movie brings out which probably is hard to figure out reading the story. Spoiler - Hachiko's master dies. His wife moves on in life, children move on, students, friends, acquaintances, everyone moves on in life but for Hachiko. He waits all his life for his master (literally all his life) as if being with his master was the purpose of his life. I'd be proud of myself if I can do even 1/10th that i.e. wait for 1 year for any one person in my life. This subtlety brings out the contrasting attitude of human beings and some of the other lovable creatures - something that Japanese films have time and again portrayed and taught us in subtle as well as calling-a-spade-a-spade ways.This movie lingers in one's mind for a long long time and has a lasting impact - even if that is for just a day, I would think the movie has met success. Just watch this - can't think of another movie / any experience that creates such an impact in 1.5 hrs.Lastly little curious if not disappointed. The movie's overall rating is 8.1 despite almost every review talking about 10 and secondly this movie not making it to the top charts in IMDb (possibly due to fewer ratings). But this one tops my charts. 10/10</fullReview>

In 1924 he was brought to Tokyo by his owner, Eisaburo Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the University of Tokyo. During his owner's life, Hachiko saw him off from the front door and greeted him at the end of the day at the nearby Shibuya Station.Even after Ueno's death in May, 1925, Hachiko returned every day to the station to wait for him, and did so for the next 9 years, till his death.</fullReview>

It's emotional, gripping and touches you at the deepest level of your heart. the tears does not come out from the scenes. But from the deeper level of understanding of emotions such as love, commitment and loyalty. This movie changes a person completely. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is not a movie.

		<shortDescription>A feeling of detachment accompanied by a non-stop flow of tears!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachiko is by far the most amazing movie I have EVER seen. It is a simple movie about a misplaced puppy Akita who finds an owner in the brilliant actor, Richard Gere. From there, they build a story which is the dream of all animal-lovers, a story of love, loyalty, faith, and unconditional care.I have never cried in a movie in my life, and had no idea what it would feel like. Hachiko made me cry for the entire duration of the last half hour of the movie, and at some moments I was weeping so bad, I couldn't even keep my eyes open to watch the scene. Be sure to carry a towel, for your tears aren't going to stop even after the movie ends. It will leave you with a sense of detachment from pets, friends, and family members, you have lost in your life, and with a strong feeling to get a new pet dog.Based on a true story, the movie makes you wanna walk into the screen, pet Hachiko on the head, hug and caress him, and sit with him everyday at the station.And, please make sure you do not watch the movie alone, because that would be the most devastating experience ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very heart-felt story which will make you laugh , cry , love and feel for dogs who I believe are the most faithful animals in the world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachi: A Dog's Tale was a film for every pet and animal lover full compassion , heart warming true story which was unbelievable but yet so close to my heart. Hachi ( means the lucky number 8 in Japanese language) was an abandoned dog who ultimately is adopted by Professor Parker Wilson in Bedridge Town Railway Station. Parker , following his wife's constant complaining to keep the dog, tries to give it to someone else but destiny plays different role and no matter how much he tries to shove Hachi away , it keeps on coming back to him with nobody willing to take the lost puppy. Eventually , a deep bond builds in between the two and Parker finally decides to take him home. Hachi becomes so close to his master that everyday he waits for him to return home at 5 PM in the nearby railway station and this becomes his regular habit. Now , a dog's story has always moved me right from Marley&amp; Me to Red Dog and this film goes a one step ahead with such a delightful and touching story of a canine who becomes a legend in the small town after he waits for his master at the gateway of Bedridge railway station for nine years following his master's death. Lasse Hallstorm ( Chocolate , Whats Eating Gilbert Grape) has chosen a very heart-felt story which will make you laugh , cry , love and feel for dogs who I believe are the most faithful animals in the world. The direction is simply superb and script is tight that will keep you on your toes right from the beginning till the end. The cinematography is eye-catching , the art direction is wonderful with an awesome background score. The performances are stupendous. Richard Gere excels in the role of Professor who feel compassionate for the animal. The dog essaying the role of Hachi was gorgeous and full of expressions. Other starcast did a fine job as well.So , overall , a superb story to be told , to be heard , to be seen. " Dogs are the most beautiful animal on earth who needs only one thing from you - Love. IF you give them love , they will be your best and loyal friend"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never write reviews for any movie, but Hachi took my heart like no movie has in the past. I just finished watching it an hour ago on Showtime and I just stopped crying a few minutes ago. This movie has shifted my way of thinking and I don't think I will ever forget this movie. I just wish that every movie was as heartwarming as Hachi, the dedication, loyalty and love he showed for his owner touched me in a way that no other movie has. I wish all movies were this warm and touching, unlike the drug, violence and sex filled crap we get nowadays. I recommend this movie to everybody and anybody! After watching this movie, I am definitely considering getting an Akita when I get my own place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love dogs, I love animals, they connect with your soul in ways that humans sometimes can't. I know this film is based on a true Japanese account but it is not hollywoodified, it honours this story and gives full credit to it. This film is so moving, so touching and so honourable in showing a dog's loyalty to his master, beyond death, beyond all logic and reason. In the end of life and beyond, all the remains for all of us is love and the memories of love we have shared with others, be they human or animals. Hachi's devotion to his master, timeless, ageless and unrelenting, makes me weep, no film has ever moved me so much and so strongly. I first saw it in the cinema and was surrounded by grown men and women, some who had taken children to it thinking it was a touching tale that could be enjoyed by families, only possibly to find that it was gut wrenchingly sad and heart-breaking in ways that I can't fully describe. To see Hachi at the end, old, aging, weary but still, still, going to that train station every day at 5pm to wait for his master...I am crying now as I type this.God bless directors who can make films like this that touch people far and beyond the original intention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of the saddest movie I've ever seen in my life since The Notebook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the saddest movie I've ever seen after a year. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is sad, strongly emotional and beautiful movie. Hachi is a movie which is based on a true story about the dog in Japan, Hachiko.Hachi was a lost little dog at the station, but a man named Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) found him. At home, he cared for him all the time and learned him a lot things. But after a year, Hacki is a smart dog, he often walk with Parker to the station because he couldn't be without Parker. Hachi at the station always waiting for him to finish his job (he knows when he finish) and come to home with Hachi. But for a moment, Parker isn't returned anymore, it happened unbelievable about the dog Hachi after he didn't returned. This movie will show you a strong feelings. Strongly recommend for everyone! If you are an emotional person or not, this movie will make you cry. I'm sure you'll be glad if you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film literally ripped my heart out and threw it in the bin. When he keeps going back AFTER he dies, just destroys me. I'm a teenage boy, who doesn't really care about much other than myself, girls and school. But, I also enjoy watching films. And being a bit of a dick head when it comes to reviews. But, this. I enjoyed the bonding between Hachi and 'Parker', leading up to the end where Hachi begins to feel left out and has less attention from Parker, up until the day Parker finally dies. This is where it hits you. Because, (may I say this is very well portrayed) the connection between the two is so strong that Hachi goes back everyday after his death expecting him. God Almighty. I cried for days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I would like to say that this is going to be my first movie review I ever made and I am feeling very happy as I am writing it. I watched this movie today and what I felt after watching it that every movie lover must watch this one. The movie is well-scripted and well-acted at the same time that let you connect with the characters more personally. It clearly depicts emotions of an animal towards human especially when it comes to loyalty. The incidents in the movie are well connected and reveal how an animal could be so loyal to his or her master. No doubt, the main character of the movie is Hachi, the dog, but others have performed their part elegantly. Watching such kind of flick is unforgettable as it made me cry only because of its beautiful piece of narration and Hachi. Thank You...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn You Hachi! You Made a Tough Guy Cry!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been with my boyfriend, a tough guy from Queens for ten years. And in all that time, I've only seen him shed tears once. And it was at his mother's funeral.Well, last night, some acting Dog managed to milk his tear ducts for over an hour. BUT IT WAS TOWARDS THE END that he just lost it completely, CRYING TORRENTS when it was revealed in the epilogue that the movie was based on a true story with photos of the real Hachi.**** Possible Spoiler ******Hachi is an Akita, an indigenous breed in Japan that were prized the Samurais and nobles for their fierce and unwavering loyalty. There is an overlooked scene in which the Richard Gere's character is chided by his Japanese colleague for not fully appreciating Hachi's noble pedigree when he (Gere) can't understand why Hachi refuses to fetch a ball for his master's amusement. It's because Hachi is not a pet. He's a companion. This is a very important detail to look out for as it will explain Hachi's behavior when the movie takes a dramatic turn with the Richard Gere character.A nice break from the usual fare of over the top CGI, violence, sophomoric humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the best films I have seen. I saw many films based on "True Story". The actors were great. I felt has if they have been the real people in the real story itself. Hachi....he is a dog that I would like to have. He came with the professor each time to the train and would just come at the right time to pick him up. To me, it was as if Hachi was protecting him. I have so much to say but little words to use. I really wish that there are words to describe how I am feeling. Just at the middle of the movie, I cried. What happened in the movie just came all of a sudden, and we didn't even notice that such a thing can happen. But it can when it comes to stories that begins with a Wonder then joy and then... I'm sure you guys already know this order. Of what happened in this story, i literally hated it. I didn't want such sadness involved in this story but it was. It taught me something that is really hard to teach to others. All I can say is grab some tissues and a pillow to hug because this film will bring out such an emotion that you didn't think will come out.Thank you very much for taking your time to read this review. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Animal Movie Without Stupid Pet Tricks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With some films, the usual critical rules can be suspended; this is a dog movie, and it is a weeper, a story of animal fidelity, and its put together by a master of the genre, Lasse Hallstrom. Either you really get into such things or you don't, and there's not a lot of grumbling to be done if you know what you're getting into. Hachi is an appealing little pup who is found by professor Richard Gere, coming home from work one night and who finds himself helplessly captured by the beauty and unabashed attachment of the animal....Gere's curmudgeonly wife (perfectly played by reliable Joan Allen) thinks otherwise. Take it from there: this is not a stupid pet movie full of fire hydrants and stupid tricks--it's a very well-acted, sensitive film, knows just how and when to push a willing viewer's buttons, and you may want to rush right out and find a dog just like Hachi when you have finished using up all the Kleenex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving story of faith, love and devotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lasse Hallström's latest is based on a true story ? transplanted from 1930s Japan to contemporary New England ? about a faithful Akita dog called Hachi. Hallström's unfussy, effective film uses several visual techniques ? dog's eye-view black-and-white footage, sped-up time frames ? to tell the often moving tale of Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), a music professor and family man who surrenders to the charms of dog ownership. When Parker dies and his family sells up and moves away, Hachi legs it back to the railway station where his owner used to arrive home from work and keeps vigil there for almost a decade. Sensitively directed and rarely over-sentimental, this touching parable will likely ravish the emotions of dog lovers. Yet the film is as much about the emotional fallout of death as about a mutt's loyalty and devotion. As a dog owner, I must confess to having had a large lump in the throat throughout. So call me soppy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only a few movies can make your eyes wet, but this movie do more than that. It is so emotional to see the loyalty of a dog towards his diseased master. It goes quite normal till Parker's death but the emotions start coming when you see the love of hachiko for his master. Bond of the dog with Parker is so strong that it make him to wait for his master from the day of his(parker's) death to his(hachiko's) death. You can't really control your emotions seeing the dog waiting everyday at same time and how the other people like carl,jasjeet feeling the pain. The most emotional scene for me was when Cate comes back after 10 years of her husband's death and see Hachi still waiting for her dead husband at the train station and seeing the dog's condition you just feel a sharp pain. You ask a question to yourself "if the dog has so much love in his heart why the humans are becoming so cold?"Hallstrom did a commendable job, cinematography is great, portrayal of Hachi's pain and loneliness is very well expressed and Richard gere was flamboyant! My emotions really gushed out after watching this masterpiece! it has surely become my one of the best movies. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Simple, unconfused, just raw emotion and great talent. So many movies attempt to be so much more than they can possibly manage in 90 minutes, this movie does not do that. Its purpose is stated entirely in the title, a dogs tale. This is a simple movie about a dog. Unlike Marley and Me, the movie is not about the OWNERS of the dog. The owners are obviously in Hachi - but the movie is about the dog, its life and its devotion. Given that the movie is also based somewhat closely on a true story, it makes it that much more powerful. It is too bad that this movie was not released theatrically or more well known. Easily the best movie for a dog owner to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story came across from some friends who brought a DVD of "Hachi" for us as a gift. I knew of the story having lived in Tokyo in the 80's quite near where this great dog's statue is located today.I believe this story is everyone's story at one time or another, especially my Dad who under the same circumstances took in a stray Collie, he called "Dick", that wandered on to his Dad's farm one day when he was 12 years old. Fast forward 9 years later, while a senior in college Dad received a letter from his parents that Dick had died. By accident rummaging through our family heirlooms after Dad died several years ago, I came across a diary book of his and in it was an handwritten eulogy he wrote upon learning about Dick's death. He wrote this in 1934 (excerpts) : ...." No truer friend did I ever have than this dog. She had much to with shaping my character that is the virtue I possess for I learned from Dick much of the valuable principles of good living...." This movie is for those who had a strong and stirring attachment with their dog and it does bring tears to our eyes because of it. There was a Hachi in our life at one time another that made this story so compelling. Richard Gere deserves all the credit for a wonderful story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about friendship and loyalty that'd break you down into tears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I don't always cry for movies and even if I do, I've never cried so bad like I did when watching this one.It told a story where a cute dog forms up a solid friendship with his master. And a huge twist, something that this kind of dog wouldn't learn to do, happens the day the two friends' (dog and master) fate is changed. Then something very touching and sad happens, which tells us the fact that true friendship and loyalty will never be broken.And so, why was I touched by this film? While a dog can always wait for his master no matter what happens, we people don't always have that much loyalty. Many of us can be a bit "cold", or in another word, forgetful at times. We can be forgetful about the happy times and bitter stuff that we've been through with our friends, our loved ones when we argue or fight for just some little occasional conflict for instance. We can be forgetful about those good moments when we pretend that we can't forgive our friends for certain small mistake just because we like to pretend to be serious sometimes. However, this story reminds us of the value of cherishing something that's more worthwhile than some trifles which could possibly break our friendship and loyalty to somebody.The movie is a small-budget one, and perhaps that's the reason why so many still haven't watched it. I highly recommend everyone watch it, even if you're not a dog lover. Actually I don't have a dog either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachi is a great movie full of emotions. I can hardly remember to have cried and laughed so much and so often in a movie, than I did in this one. Some criticize the movie for being a bit too cliché. They wrote, that people who would care so much for the dog, that feel so much sympathy and compassion for him, would probably not exist. I don't know, if it's true. But watching this movie makes you hope, that they are wrong. It gives the watcher hope and warmth. And at least as long as the movie lasts, you are part of a wonderful world.It is a movie, which - without any doubt from my side - is worth 10 stars. Every minute is worth watching it and I highly recommend it for anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am French, but work and live in under developed countries, and currently in Mozambique. In my compound, my Brazilian neighbors gave me 5 days ago a copy of a movie: "Achiko" with Richard Gere. I got so moved that I am now browsing Internet for learning more about some other faithful dogs such as Greyfriars Bobby (Edinburgh - Scotland), Shep (Fort Benton - USA), Fido (Borgo - Italia),... and so many...My neighbors do not like dogs. They like cats! They were so moved by the movie that they knocked at my door a night, and gave me a DVD, saying, "JP, you HAVE to watch this..."I did. And days later I just think to myself: "This word is walking on his head. Here, where I am, I see people dying of hunger, malaria, aids... I should think: there are more important matters than just a story between a dog and his 2-legs companion... But, no. It does not matter if it is a dog or not. It matters if you are, again and again, shown that being loved is a true gem, wherever it comes from."Cinema is not always about technology, pre-conceived ideas about timing, 600 pages stories and things that should happen.Simon &amp; Garfunkel once sung "the Sound of Silence" This movie is the Sound of Silence. The silence of love.I am amazed to see the reviews in IMDb. I sorted by "Hated it", and discovered than only 8 comments were below the current average of 8.1 ... and the lowest reviewer gave a 7, which is very very fair! I have seen so many reviews about other films in IMDb where at least some reviewers were saying "it is the worst movie ... ever". Here no such thing. It is possible to be unsatisfied with some aspect of the movie, but, as it is based on a true story, and the film has not added "Hollywoodian" effects, it stays rather simple, somehow difficult to classify, but it lets a print in your soul.TO ANY ONE READING THIS REVIEW: GO, RUN, FLY, go see this movie. It will stay in you like a good little companion?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Waiting Is The Hardest Part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you thought the end of Marley and Me was sad? Oh, you haven't seen nothing yet. Hachiko takes the opposite approach. Instead of the dog dying on the owner, the owner dies on the dog. This is actually based on a true story except it happened in the 1940s instead of in the present day. Richard Gere, well, it's Richard Gere, what more can be said? Richard Gere doesn't need to do too much to light up the screen. But the real star is (are) the dog(s) that portray(s) Hichiko. You don't expect so much emotion and facial expression to come from a canine and that is why the last twenty minutes or so of this movie is so gut wrenching. We feel for the dog as if it is human, perhaps feel even stronger for it because it is not human and doesn't know that its master isn't going to someday reappear. This is a very fun, lighthearted movie that at the last moment turns into a true tear jerker. It becomes so sad that it is quite disturbing. Keep that in mind if you are planning to show it to the kids.</fullReview>

I don't cry often when watching a movie, last time I did that when I saw Titanic. The movies I can relate to this one is Eith below and My Dog Skip, of course i had something in my eyes then also. At the moment and just have seen this movie my heart is somewhere else.To a place I can't comprehend. This movie might not be for everyone, but IT should be. To everyone who loves animals whatever they may be, cat, dog, rabbit, bird, watch this movie with a opened heart. They love you if you love them back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't stop crying but i loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachiko wasn't a film i was expecting to see, due to the fact that here in Mexico the translation to Spanish sucked and the marketing did as well. But my brother had to see it for school, and i wasn't going to deny going to a dog's film. I love dogs, and i loved Marley and me with its drama, so i was expecting something like that. What did i get?? besides my unstoppable sobbing throughout the film and the fact that my red eyes hurt a lot later, i loved this film. This is the definition of an EMOTIONAL film. Richard Gere does it great here (better than in pretty woman, in my OP) with bonding Hachi, who was beautiful as a puppy, as the regular hachi, and even as the old one. He was extremely beautiful and i love beautiful and tender dogs. So even in the happy parts i started to shed a happy tear, but from the moment... (well, you know what moment) i couldn't stop crying throughout the film. I actually consider myself a sensitive guy, but i never cry OUT LOUD in the cinema. I tried to hold it, but just couldn't. This has to be one of the two films in which i have cried the most in my whole life, and that's a good thing. I actually love the emotional moments in every film. The story is greatly portrayed, and the relationship couldn't be better. God, when hachi dreams of him i just couldn't stop sobbing. Poor hachi, really. And of course what got me is the friendship and loyalty scent that this movie doesn't lack at all. I definitely will buy it, cause i love dogs and i love emotional films. And this film exceeded both things. I recommend it, even though it's inevitable you are gonna cry</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, Loyalty, Commitment, Devotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some films that deserve a five star review for reasons other that artistic success on every level; HACHI; A DOG'S TALE is one of those, for despite some minor technical problems with the film (the sound editing seems absent as the music - a fine score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek - too frequently covers the conversation, the slipping in color between black and white and color seems accidental rather than intentional, etc), this little film is a heart warmer, a film that makes us glow with a story about the love between dog and man that transcends so many naturally occurring barriers. Originally released as HACHIKO MONOGATARI in Japan where the true story took place in the 1920s, the screenplay and story were written by both Kaneto Shindô and Stephen P. Lindsey and the well-chosen director is the sensitive Lasse Hallström. The story really belongs to Hachi, a Japanese Akita who is befriended by a professor (Richard Gere) when left stranded at a train station (the film is transferred to an eastern American locale). The stationmaster (Jason Alexander) encourages the professor to take the dog home, much to the surprised annoyance of the professor's wife (Joan Allen). But the professor and Hachi bond, encouraged by the couple's daughter (Sarah Roemer), and Hachi follows the professor to the train each morning and waits for his return each night. Though a tragedy occurs, the strength of this dog/man bond is so strong that nothing can break it- not even prolonged separation. Hachi becomes part of the train station family and grows in respect when the ultimate test of his endurance occurs. And that is quite simply the story. There are some very beautiful little cameos by Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa, Erik Avari, Davenia McFadden, and Robbie Sublet, but the true feeling of this film is that of an ensemble effort lead so very competently by Richard Gere's portrayal. It is a little film to treasure. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some trivia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The puppies that played Hachi early in the movie were ShibaInus, not Akitas -- Shiba puppies are cuter than Akita puppies so the adult Akitas that played Hachi were selected to resemble the Shiba puppies' coloring (the original Hachiko was gray).My wife breeds and shows Shibas. Late in 2007 she was asked to take her litter of four puppies to RI to be used in making the movie. She scheduled a week's vacation but heard nothing more. Eventually she learned that the initial director had quit and filming was delayed. I think it turned out to be fortuitous because they got Hallstrom to replace the initial director. But by the time they resumed filming my wife's puppies were no longer puppies so she didn't get to go to RI. Still it's great seeing the puppies they did use in the film. My wife only watched our DVD until the professor died but no further. She's a nurse and can handle it when a person dies but loses it when a dog dies.In filming scenes from the dog's point-of-view they shot mostly in black &amp; white just as a dog would see it. Nice touch but not mentioned anywhere that I found. I also had Amazon send a Hachi DVD to my son Frank in Colorado Springs. Not only does he have an Akita but he visited Hachiko's statue in Japan and rubbed its nose. He says it's worn smooth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not review and discuss the storyline/actors as the others already summarized it; just want to make a recommendation to watch it, and - better - watch it at home so you can *express* yourself freely while the movie is running.I will not say that this is a very sad movie, but rather a very touchy movie. And yes, the music score is very good. Also, you don't need to see the original Japanese movie before going into this one, for this one is a very good remake. But you may select to go for the original.This is a movie that will leave something in your heart and memory for long long long time, so have it alone, with your loved one, or loved ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What goes on inside the head of dogs when they are waiting for their master? Why do they do it, time after time, why do they show so much joy every time their life companion shows up? Don't they get tired of us? I know we do, so why don't they?This is a film about a dog so loyal that he waits every day his master's return, even if the man died ten years ago. The story is a true story, only it happened in Japan in the 20's. The movie was really well done, with as much an emphasis on the dog as possible. People except his master were just secondary characters, a thing that further underlined the dog's single minded obsession and love.Rationally, if you think about it, any man doing what this dog did would be institutionalized as an obsessive compulsive. Would we respect the man in any way? And still, such a simple show of loyalty brought tears to my eyes that I could not stop from coming out. I knew I was inventing human traits for the dog, but it still would not make me feel any less miserable for that animal's sense of loss. I am also making an effort to not turn this review into a "stop killing dogs, you brainless simpletons!" so I stop here.Bottom line: Very simple story, very effective movie, the actors were a little out of it, except Richard Gere who did great. It will evoke more feeling in you than a thousand romantic comedies, even of those that are not a joke.</fullReview>

Its such a beautiful moving, and wonderful film.the best I've seen in such a long time. love it! I've told many people about this film already and they all want to see it, and I've warned them all.... you may think your tough when it comes to films, but be warned you'll need tissues. any one thats had a dog/has a dog or any pet really will feel this film get slowly stuck in their throat. Richard gear plays the part so well and its just an all round winner. I can only wish my Akita is as loyal and as loving as Hachi. I think we may even see a wave of little puppies names after him now!</fullReview>

Words are very few to express about the movie Hachiko but briefly "A small dog which was send to somewhere was lost with the attached description and was found by the teacher. He took the dog home and was so pleased to keep it with him. He found the tag on the dog and its meaning and dog was named Hachi. The story follows on and one day master leaves for the work and die there.. but Hachi who always waits for him at the station keep waiting for years and years still there waiting for him. This kind of love and inner connection between human and animal really breaks the heart of everyone who watches it.

		<fullReview>I am a grown man and I have never ever cried during a movie, so when my girlfriend suggested this movie on our date night I did not expect that sob story at all. I expected a typical dog movie, a little sad but not like that. The good thing is my girlfriend had to leave about 40 minutes in because her best friend needed help on something. But since she was gone I decided to call my best buddy over so he could finish the movie with me so I wasn't alone. I told him the summary of what had happened so far and I'm very ashamed to say that we cried like little babies. Im glad my girlfriend wasn't there to see my cry like that because that was just down right embarrassing. Nothing has ever made me cry that hard in my life, I decided to look up reviews on this website to see if I was the only one to cry that hard, and I wasn't which made me feel better. Glad to know that I'm not the only man who cried by this. I can't even believe this, I'm still crying hahaha, I don't think I'll ever be able to think of this movie without crying. heads up to all the guys in the world whose girlfriends want to watch this movie with them Don't Don't DO IT YOU WILL CRY I Don't CARE HOW TOUGH YOU ARE, YOU WILL CRY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>kind of an impossible film to truly hate, though I don't quite love it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachi: A Dog's Tale may be 'syrupy' to some, that word that is a euphemism for 'sappy', 'sentimental', 'feel-good'. It's all that, but I think that what sets apart this film from what this could have been (maybe Marley &amp; Me comes to mind) is that it sticks to being as simple as possible - it's a no-frills kind of light-hearted drama, if that makes sense. As soon as Richard Gere sees this dog at the station - basically as cute a puppy as one will see in a movie that's meant to be taken seriously - that's how the movie will go. It doesn't pump up much artificial drama at all, and the only real conflict is a major one that comes about halfway or maybe 2/3rd a way into the movie, and it's one that is meant to bring on the water-works for the rest of the audience in the remaining run-time.Who is Hachi (or Hachiko as his full name was in the original film and in real life, which this is based on an actual story in Japan)? A dog that is what is sort of written in the unofficial guide-book for good dogs: faithful, loyal and true. It also helps that Hachi is a happy dog, for the most part (maybe a few times he barks, but never really much at all except to be like 'hey!' to a human). It also plays on the universal truth for dogs that when their master goes away it's like the human is going away forever, and when he or she comes back it's like its the first time all over again that they're connecting. Dogs are great in that way, that their love and compassion is basically undying; in other words, the point of the movie is to show a kind of lesson for human beings as well - be more like Hachi, if you can.I think it also helps that Richard Gere and Joan Allen and (yes) Jason Alexander are very good in their parts, and keep things at the (in a good, clear way) simple level that director Lasse Hallstrom is keeping it at. While the score is the one part that could arguably be the sentimental part of the picture, with its soft and fluffy and sad piano and strings, it's perhaps necessary at times too for the story to work. If this were too quiet it might not have the proper resonance; it's one of those times with a heart-felt drama that I'm glad there's a score like this, even if it goes too far in certain moments. What works though is that the actors above, and even actors in smaller roles (the hot-dog vendor, the bookstore worker) have presence and have a good rapore with the dog.Is it a kid's movie? Sure. But it doesn't come with the Hollywood BS that so many movies get; the most wacky 'comedy' part is that Gere and his lovable dog get skunked at one point. Because it keeps it so... basic (is there another word for simple I can use), it can resonate with people since its not trying to pull a fast one or pull SO hard on the manipulation that its Hallmark channel. It's not quite great since there isn't necessary too much in the way of human character past Gere and Allen (there's also their kid and her family, but that's kind of weak), but it is all about the dog, as the title says. And hey, it's not Old Yeller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prepare for an Emotional Roller coaster like no other.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Original Score:4/4, Movie: ****1/2 (4.5/5), Quality: ***** (5/5)Note: This film is a remake of Hachi-ko (1987)The first few scenes of the film will begin to splash a wave of emotions upon you. That's what this movie did to me, isn't it? Precisely. The storytelling is gentle, the music stunningly moving and rich in emotions, the story itself is the main highlight of the whole film. I was astoundingly moved by the combination of the music and relationship between a Akita dog and it's owner. This film is a remake of the original film from Japan, and the story of this film was based upon the real story of Hachiko, who waited for his master Dr. Eisaburo Ueno at the Shibuya train station for nine years after the day his master died. It shows the devotion and loyalty of a dog, a man's best friend, to his master. Powerfully emotional and moving, it broke me down into tears at many moments of the film, even it was a story based upon the true story, it still has it's powerful impact upon it's audiences.This film, with the true story as it's base, creates a fictional story about a dog's devotion to his owner. When Hachi the Akita dog was found by Parker Wilson (Played by Richard Gere) at the train station one night, he was taken home by Parker and even though his wife Cate (Played by Joan Allen) doesn't agree with keeping him, he insists that he must find a home for him. Even then, he doesn't even know the Akita's name yet. Doesn't this evoke a moment of compassion? Caring for other living beings is a merit. I believe that animals all have their own feelings, and that is why I swore to myself to treat animals with care and never ever harm any animal, and that includes us human beings. We human beings are animals as well, how can we treat other beings as if we were superior beings?! I am a full time vegetarian, and from a recent visit to a pet shop before my initial viewing of this film (Which is shortly before writing this review), I found out that it is even possible to feed dogs and cats with vegetarian pet food. It's true. At that pet shop I also saw Hachiko's brand name and was reminded to watch this film when I mentioned the movie to a staff member who told me that she had already watched the film. Here I'll quote something from Life of Pi (2012), the film based upon the novel of the same name by Yann Martel. Pi said "Animals have souls; I have seen it in their eyes." I believe so too. Animals have feelings, like Hachi, he also has feelings and emotions of his own too, the same as the real Hachiko. Their stories prove it.Parker puts up posters to find the dog's owner, and when someone (who isn't the dog's owner) calls, he's busy out playing with young Hachi and therefore Cate picks up the phone. However, when she saw her husband and daughter playing with Hachi, she answers the caller: "The dog is already been taken". This line alone is enough to show the beginning of a beautiful friendship between Hachi and the Wilson family. Even though this is a fictional story based upon the real story, it is still a very emotional one and filled with themes about animals, too.I'll stop here, and you'll have to see the film for yourself to understand what I mean. Remember to bring tissues or a handkerchief, because there are strong chances that you will cry during your viewing of this film. And I hope that you will be changed by this beautiful, simple and emotional film about the timeless relationship between Man and Dogs.If you've already seen the film, I would recommend a novel that tells a story about the relationship between Man and Wolves, and that is Jack London's White Fang. Meanwhile, speaking of Wolves, don't forget to check out a Japanese anime film called Ookami Kodomo No Ame To Yuki (2012) as well. It's an amazing story and an emotional roller- coaster too.</fullReview>

Everything about this movie was really amazing. I can't stop thinking about how heartwarming it was. It will make you feel like a different person after this. Not only was it devastating but it teaches you how powerful love and loyalty really are. Makes you think twice about family, about your pet, about anything in life.

But, for as long as I have been using IMDb, this is the first time I actually created an account so I can write something...and yet, I'm completely speechless...This movie illustrates the bond between man and his best friend beautifully and effortlessly. However, it's the real story behind that made me sob some fifteen minutes after the credits rolled. It makes you think about the love you share and feel for those who are important to you and how far you are willing to go to preserve any trace of that love.

No matter how many times you will see it, dog lover or not, you will cry. 10/10, VERY good trained dog, good actors.After this whole story, you don't even remember the movie started in a class. and this slapped me. must watch this movie.If someone do not cry in this movie, he probably don't have a heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having now seen and reviewed) the original 1987 Hachiko Monogatari I have come back to this remake with fresh eyes and an upwardly revised opinion. While I still believe this movie in no way reaches the true potential of the "story" I think it at least matches and may even exceed the quality of the original.Perhaps of greatest surprise to me are the choices the director made in what he took from and what he rejected from the original story. He has moved the story from 1920's Tokyo to 2000's small town America, and this is not an unreasonable choice. However once the link with the original Japanese story has been so fundamentally severed the world is your oyster as far as story details go so having made that choice it does seem a little perverse to make the dog not just Japanese but an Akita, as in the original. The essence of Hachiko is essentially a love story between a dog and his master, and it matters not one whit if they are in Japan or America, if the master is a Professor of agricultural engineering or of music, or a street cleaner for that matter. It does not matter if the dog is an Akita, a Pekinese or a Great Dane. What is pivotal is the portrayal of a credible relationship between the dog and his master, and to achieve this the casting of both man and dog is absolutely paramount. The Akita is a magnificent animal but if these two movies are any indication it has a stoic personality that presents a challenge to a filmmaker who has only 90 minutes to bring the character to emotional life. Presumably the Japanese market for whom the original was intended knows this personality and compensated for it. In this American version the director cunningly introduces a Japanese character who is able to inform the viewer of the Akita's character, which somewhat mitigates and explains the dog's relatively passive behaviour, but nevertheless it still would have been nice to see a greater level of visible connection between the dog and his master.As I indicated in my other review the conundrum of this story is how to present it without inferring at least some hint of abandonment on the part of the master's family. I think this version does a better job of this than the original, and certainly the character of the Master's daughter and her partner are far more sympathetic than the original, although there is still some lingering unease as to how a dog can remain essentially a stray within the community for a decade or so. In both movies the subplot of neither wife not really wanting the dog is totally unnecessary and simply wastes precious time that should have been devoted to developing the personalities and relationships of the dog his master.Richard Gere is not called upon to do much before he pops off but never the less does a great job. He presents a far more consistently sympathetic character than his counterpart in the original, although to be fair his Japanese counterpart is saddled with having to exist in the less relaxed context and culture of 1920's Japan. It has to be said the director's conception of a music professor as someone who plays music with all the sophistication of three blind mice for beginner piano, and who supervises very strange dances is more than a little naive. We also have to suspend credibility in the first 10 minutes in which Hachiko makes his way from Japan to a small American town ? like people always send puppies randomly half way across the world in a rickety kennel with no documentation, no quarantine, no nothing, right? And they are routinely dumped on top of carts of luggage and accidentally dropped by people who seem to be deaf and blind...why did they even bother with this part of the story? This a waste of time that could have been better used to develop the man/dog relationship. In summary a solid if not magnificent re-telling of the Hachiko story and probably as good as can be achieved while sticking to the Japanese framework.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Highly-Rated Richard Gere Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A drama based on the true story of a college professor (Richard Gere)'s bond with the abandoned dog he takes into his home.Exactly how this film got into the IMDb Top 250 is something of a mystery. My guess is that there are a lot of dog lovers out there. Not that it is a bad film, but it starts off very much like an ABC Family film, and the production value never really increases.Luckily, the plot tends to improve as it goes along, and it is clearly an emotional film. Those who are more prone to crying during movies may do a bit of crying here, because it is a great encapsulation of how loyal a dog can be to his master. As summed up by Kim Newman, "Not a dry eye in the house - but not irritating schmaltz either."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't cry after watching emotional movies ,have a shot at it... and its a bet.you cry for sure.. awesome movie..!!! Brilliant play of the actual Hachi story.. Finally a film from the USA (albeit based on a true story in the 1920s Japan) that is without guns, explosions and free of violence and not based at all on romantic elements!"Love and Loyalty" succinctly sums up the film. The love so simple, so pure and the loyalty so unfailing, so steadfast that it would melt any steel heart. I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red (!!)The main characters never "take flight" but that matters not at all. It's the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one, but profoundly touching, So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears.Hachiko, the Akita dog, has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.A must-watch film, especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant but sometimes sad story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on a real story, though the real events occurred in 1920s Japan. This movie is set mostly in 1990s America.Students in an elementary school class are giving oral reports on their heroes. One child says his hero is his grandfather's dog Hachi.An old Japanese man out in the country is ringing a bell. He sadly puts an Akita puppy in a crate which is addressed to the United States. Once there, the crate loses most of its address label and is then accidentally dropped at the Bedridge Station. The actual location is never mentioned, but a newspaper reporter is from Woonsocket, which would suggest Rhode Island. The person who is supposed to be delivering the dog doesn't even seem to realize he lost a package. And the door opens and the Akita gets out.Parker is a college professor who teaches ballet and music appreciation and takes the train to and from work. When he gets off the train at Bedridge, there is the Akita. He asks for help finding a place for the dog to stay until the owner is found, and for help finding the owner. Carl, who is in charge of the station, is scared to do anything against the rules. He can only send the dog to the pound. Mary Anne runs a bookstore and would like a dog, but her orange cat Antonia doesn't like dogs.When no one is willing to take him, Parker does. His daughter Andy is delighted. His wife Cate isn't too happy at first. But one day he does get a response to his many flyers and the wife claims the dog has a home.A Japanese friend of Parker looks at the dog and notices the symbol "Hachi", or "good fortune" attached to the dog's collar. So Hachi is the dog's name.When Hachi grows up, he gets out when Parker leaves for work and follows him to the station. Parker has the hardest time getting the dog to go back home. And Hachi is there when Parker gets home in the afternoon.Andy brings home Michael. Parker wants to know if Michael really loves his daughter. He does, and they eventually get married. And one day Andy tells her mother she is pregnant.One day Parker doesn't show up. Hachi waits ...This is a good family story. Richard Gere is very appealing as the professor, who is so caring and so determined even in the face of obstacles.Even young Hachi is cute, and I don't even like dogs. Adult Hachi is very good--actually, the canine actor is, because Hachi is naughty, getting out and roaming all over creation. But the actor is well trained and quite capable. And the dog shows emotions very effectively.There are a few laughs, such as the time Hachi tries to protect Parker from a skunk. That's one of the few times he doesn't show up at the train station.Jason Alexander is appealing in his own way. He is a nicer George Costanza--afraid to do anything wrong but willing to lie, cheat or steal when he can benefit.Erick Avari stands out as a food vendor at the train station.If you like dogs, and maybe even if you don't, it's a fine effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For dog lovers such as myself and my hubby this is a very moving and emotional movie. The acting is very good. The story line is fantastically portrayed. I would highly recommend a box of tissues be handy while watching. Such a beautiful dog the Akita. We are the proud parents of two beautiful chihuahua's. A male and female and they are every bit as loving and loyal. They are always happy to see you whether you have been gone for many days or five minutes. They are our sweet babies and we love them dearly. They usually go with us every where we go!We went on a long three month tour of the USA and they went right along with us. They sleep with us. They love us unconditionally. I cannot imagine life without them. I highly recommend this movie if you are an animal lover, even if you are not an animal lover, it is a really heart touching movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Gere with a dog...Richard Gere with a grandson...Richard Gere in a G-Rated Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last part of that intro is perhaps the most surprising thing about this lovely family drama that will have you going through a box of Kleenex and reaching for toilet paper 'cause you ran out of Kleenex! An adorable young boy gets up in front of his classroom and starts to talk about his hero. The kids all laugh when he mentions that it is his grandfather's dog. But from the moment you see this cute little puppy being boxed up and sent overseas to the United States and found by Richard Gere when he breaks his way out of the box, you are hooked. This is no ordinary little puppy. He ain't "Marley", "Lassie", "Hooch", or "Beethoven". He doesn't easily learn how to fetch and he destroys one of Gere's wife's (Joan Allen) art pieces as well. But he doesn't slobber, pee, poop or chase the cat. He's a well behaved gentleman, the most adorable movie dog since the pug in "The Adventures of Milo and Otis".Gere, who plays a choreographer for a ballet company (and straight to boot!), has to travel into New York every day for work, and Hachi can't bear to be without his master. So he heads to the train station to bid him goodbye and comes back every evening like clock work. Yes, that is really the plot of this movie. No kidnapping, no nasty neighbor reporting him to the pound or any cruelty whatsoever. Just the story of a beautiful friendship that even destiny can't take away.Some people may say this a total manipulation of the emotions and they may be right. But for a movie to come out in the extremely cynical 21st century and be so sweet and express values that never disappear (especially the importance of loyalty) is a rarity today that can't be dismissed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hachi: A Touching Film About True Love And Devotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best dog films ever, surpassing Marley and Me.I had know idea this film came out in 2009, it is one of those sleeper hits. I lost my dog in July 2014, and was debating on renting this movie. I saw it on Redbox, and thought why not. The movie is about an Akita pup who makes it's way from Japan to the United States. It arrives at a train station,it gets loose from it's cage. Parker Wilson(Richard Gere) comes along and finds him. He figures the dog belongs to somebody and tells Carl( Jason Alexander), the train station manager. He asks Carl if he could keep him until the owner comes. When Carl says I can come in, in the morning; and drop him off at the pound. Parker has second thoughts, and decides to take him home. He finds a box to put him in, until he can find the owner. Parker has him in the den, and decides he his safe until morning. The dog wants to be with Parker, he gets loose climbs up the stairs to Parker's and Cate's room. The dog licks Cate's feet, and scares her. She tells Parker about their agreement, no more dogs. Parker get's up, and put's the dog out in the shed for the night. everyone in the house wants the dog to stay except Cate. A bond begins to form with Parker, and Hachi. Cate sees this with Parker, Andy( their daughter); and decides to give in. The Parker's have a new family member. As Hachi begins to grow the bond becomes stronger. Every work day, Hachi would go to the train station with Parke,r and meet him when he returns. Hachi is a very loyal dog, who is a one master dog literally. When Parker doesn't come home from work one day, Hachi sits there until the family picks him up. Parker had a heart attack teaching class, and died. Hachi seems lost after this, but he would do the same routine every work day like Parker was going to return. Hachi is a regular at the station, and is beloved by all there. They would feed him, look after him, and let him stay there. He was sent to live with Andy, and her husband, but he didn't want to live anywhere so lived close by under a train on the tracks . I guess he did this to be close to the station; he just wanted his master to return. As the years go by, you still see the strong devotion of this dog. He doesn't give up, the same routine every day, you feel for the dog. In a way he seems lost; but he is strong willed. This movie is very heartwarming, it has it's sad moments; but the humor it has will put a smile on your face. At the end of the film it shows a picture of the real Hachi. It also has the factual information with it, which is very interesting. In Japan there is a huge statue of Hachi at the train station, where Hachi would wait. This is a great film the whole family will enjoy. Even though it is sad the ending is touching. It is a tear jerker so have those tissues nearby. THX, Kris L. CocKayne</fullReview>

This movie broke me. I have been on IMDb for over five years, but this is my first ever review because god damn it I had to write something about this one. It touched me in a way nothing really ever has. My history with dogs might have something to do with that, but quite frankly you have got to be one especially heartless and cold individual if this movie does not get to you. I could probably nitpick if I really wanted to, but why would I? What little flaws the movie may have do not take away from the story. Not only is it one of the most incredible stories I have ever heard, but it also just so happens to be a true one. I don't know what more to say, I'm honestly at a loss for words. Just watch it and see for yourself, it is an experience you don't want to miss out on. Trust me, you will need tissues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pain of Unconditional Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Introduced to a little dog transported across the world, it's impossible not to fall for this puppy wandering a dark train station at night. Over time, you see the special attachment shared between Hachi and Parker and find warmth knowing he has finally found a good home. It's incredible how warm a dog can make a home that was once desolate. If you have ever had the fortune of owning a pet, you understand the strong attachment you have with one. You protect them, provide for them, and love them despite being unable to converse. You can see a dog's emotions just from its body language, and the dog comforts you when he/she realizes you're distressed. It's an amazing feeling to have such a unique bond to an animal that is so pure (like all creations), and views you as immaculate despite your imperfections. Unfortunately, you have probably had to endure difficult times of struggling health, senescence and inevitable death. It's this period of such great love followed by emptiness that is so hard to bear. Like any relationship, it is when there is a strain that you discover the true colours of those involved and discover everyone's true emotions. I once heard a story of a young boy saying that humans need more time in this world because they need to learn how to love and then reciprocate. Dogs on the other hand are born into the world already knowing how to love and that is why they don't need to live as long. Although I agree with the little child, I would also add that the pain that a pet would endure if its owner passed away would be unbearable. I wished there was a way to offer Hachi solace and tell him everything would be okay. I wish for a lot of things. Hachi was a loving dog who was saved by Parker. He's no ordinary dog...none ever are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most heartwarming films you will ever watch, and you WILL NOT stop crying throughout the entire film! I watched this film about 4 years ago, and I still remember the whole story line, and I will not watch it again because I cried more than expected! If you want to watch a sad film about a dog, do not watch My Dog Skip (still a very good film) or Marley and Me (not the best) you should watch this as you will have trouble breathing because of how much you will cry. This film is absolutely beautiful and will change your perspective on life.If I were to watch this again, it would be in many years and I would have pre-prepared about 10 boxes of tissues.The storyline of this film is very simple, it is about a man who finds a dog and looks after it. Every time the man (Richard Gere) goes to work, the dog would wait for him at the train station for him to come back, but one day, the owner had a heart attack at work and died. The dog then waited at the train station for years and years waiting until he too dies of age, the dog is just waiting for his owner to come back.A very simple film, with a simple storyline, but an effective that hits you straight at the heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A puppy at a Japanese monastery is crated and sent to the US. The crate's tag tears, and when the puppy pushes his way out of the crate at the train station of a small Rhode Island town, Parker Wilson, a professor of music in nearby Providence, takes the dog home for the night. His wife isn't happy, but after failing to find the owner, she lets the dog stay. A Japanese friend reads the dog's tag, "Hachiko" or "Eight," a lucky number. Parker can't teach the dog to fetch, but the friend explains that the dog will forge a different kind of loyalty......If this film doesn't bring tears to your eyes, then you honestly have a heart of stone. Its a beautiful movie from beginning to end, and Halstrom has made such a sad story, into one of unconditional love, a dog giving up a family home in order to wait for his master.It's based on a true story of 1923, and its a remake, but its classy and the additions of Gere and Allen make this movie all the more worthwhile.In anybody else's hand, it could have easily been a TV movie cropping up on some mundane station that nobody would see, so its lovely to see that this story shall be seen by more.A great film to watch with the whole family, and when you are feeling down.Beautiful.</fullReview>

I remember my own dog waiting for me each day and when she saw me get out of my car, she would try to talk to me as though to say, "I missed you. Where have you been?" Now that she's no longer with us, I'm the one who looks for her each day when I come home.

		<fullReview>Okay, it's not hip to love films that rely so much on sentiment, but...damn, I loved this movie! The script is a polished, clean work of high-level craftsmanship, and the acting by all the humans is high caliber as well. It is the dog (s), in the character of Hachi, who brings it all home, of course. I'm sure it helps to be a dog lover -- a lover of BIG dogs that demand time and attention (not the "toy" breeds, although they can be cute). It probably didn't hurt (my rating of this film) that my own dog (not an Akita -- a tall, muscle bound American staffordshire mix) is similar to the character Hachi, in smarts and personality (my dog is a bit more fun, 'cause he likes to be play like a rugby player, and be goofy).The plot is truly simple: abandoned dog finds man, Parker Wilson, at train station, wins over man with it's charm and cuteness. Man's wife, Cate, tries to interfere with the friendship/bonding process (don't all wives?), by demanding he not adopt another dog. Man's love for dog wins out, and wife relents. The rest of the movie focuses mostly on the bonding of Parker and Hachi, with small scenes of interaction between Parker's family (wife Cate, daughter Andy, and soon-to-be son-in-law, Michael), moving through life, interacting with each other and Hachi. And Hachi's penchant for leaving the backyard, on his own, and walking to the train station (everyday at the same time) to wait for Parker and walk home with him. Then a poignant story development takes place, setting the stage for theme of the movie. The event itself won't necessarily put a lump in your throat: but the things that happen immediately after...and for the remaining 24 minutes of film definitely will. Unless 1)you've been disconnected from the life-support system, or 2) You're one of those insufferable guys who feel they are too manly to admit they have emotions or too high-brow and sophisticated to be taken in by popular entertainment and "cheap sentiment." (Funsuckers). If those don't apply, be prepared to tell any women in the room that, you, um...got some dust in your eyes, or something.The script/screen story is based on a real-life story, only it has been Americanized. That's okay. The story still hits home. And the dogs which were used for this movie are brilliant actors! The cutesy angle (often used in films that feature dogds) is largely avoided; and the idea, when showing things from Hachi's perspective, to use some faded colors, instead of black &amp; white, was spot-on. I have to admit, I generally enjoy the majority of Lasse Halstrom's work "The Cider House Rules," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," etc). This is no exception. Two paws up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It does not matter if the place or location of the train station is correct or not &amp; it does not matter if the dog is a Hachi or not. i think people should focus on the core of the message or the content of the story &amp; am 100% sure that yes a loyalty of a dog can sometimes go to an extreme that even human being claiming to have amazing qualities cannot even avail among each other. for me this story is touching, true &amp; innocent by all means. this is a a very typical story of a relationship between a dog &amp; its owner. the fact is true that loyalty can always remain. remember...Humans hate..dogs don't. its is a true &amp; i had a dog when i was a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since Old Yellow have I enjoyed such a good movie, I give this movie a thumbs up. I have never cried as much as I did in this story, nor have I laughed. I loved this movie. I highly recommend this movie. Anyone that has ever been convicted of harming a dog should be made to watch this movie to show just how loyal a dog is. Dogs should not be used in fighting or abused. This is a prime story of Loyalty and Love of mans best friend. The cast that was picked was perfect for this movie. I had a Shih-tzu for 15 years, and he was my baby. he tolerated my husband and other people. He would morn for me when I went into the hospital, he would wait for me, he had to go where ever I did. He would even get in the tub with me. I miss him so much. Now I have a lab mix, she just turned one, and she is spoiled rotten. Dogs should not be under-estimated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loyal dog waits for owner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie found me. While looking for a theme to highlight mom's life on her 80th BD, I took her to the movies without knowing what was playing and chose this over the 6 other gore feasts. Family loyalty and fidelity are highlighted in a clear and succinct manner by Hachi's behavior, while contrasting the denial of any bond by the grieving?? wife(she came back first to see her lasting Theater legacy before other family remembrances). I agree the modern day setting makes the story implausible, but we will forgive the national narcissism. Gere is splendid in matching the dog's facial expression. The camera work surrenders to the view by Hachi only partially. Great cure for eye dryness!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finish watching Hachi with friends, when the movie finished we just couldn't breath from crying. It's based on a true story from Japan, story about loyal dog named Hachiko. Hachiko is more than statue or a tale, he was a real dog whose story is known throughout Japan and entire world. The word Hachiko has come to be synonymous with loyalty, and for good reason. Such loyalty, devotion, love, just stuns me. The real story set's foot in 1923, when real Hachi was born. I'm animal person, and I like this kind of movies, but so far this one was the best I ever seen.Who ever did not watch the movie, I friendly recommended that they do. You're not going to regret, and prepare a box of tissues, you'll need it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dog is truly man's best friend. Hachi: A Dog's Tale, which is based on a true story originally taking in place Japan, shows a emotional tale. The movie is a simple story of a dog and his beloved owner. What makes this film strong is that the owner is Richard Gere, a highly credited actor who once again did a great job in this movie. Another strength is that Gere is supported by many great supporting actors and actress, Jason Alexander of Seinfeld being one of them, who all together played their roles great and making this tale a masterful film. Hachi the dog is one overly cute Akita, portrayed by 3 different dogs (different time lines of the film) all trained well. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is truly the best representation of loyalty, love and happiness. No matter how sad you feel, a dog like Hachi will make you feel more happy than a billionaire. This film can change you for the better, highly recommended, open to all kinds of audience. Enjoy the heart warming emotional film, just keep a tissue box next to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prepare to be laugh,cry and be devastated by this extraordinary drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, to begin with a confession. I have been crying for nearly the last half hour. These have not been tears of frustration on watching yet another jaded entertainer or difficult to fathom artsy flick. These are tears of gratitude towards the director of the movie for what is easily the most sensitive and touching portrayal of the bond between a man and a dog. Richard Gere is the music professor at a college who finds an abandoned dog at the train station. He takes it to his home. His wife (Joan Allen) is initially against keeping the dog with them because of a reason. But slowly she understands that her husband had become totally crazy for it and he ends up becoming a part of their family which also includes a daughter. Gere finds out that its name is Hachiko. The film tracks the relation between Gere and Hachiko over their life time. The incidents are funny and poignant and you would be laughing as well as suppressing sniffles. Gere is in the acting form of his life and you can clearly see that he loves Hachiko. Their chemistry burns up the screen and lifts this from a very good movie to a truly extraordinary one. Allen is better than average as his wife. There are a bunch of characters that fall in love with Hachiko and they are sketched very vividly. But the film belongs to the titular Hachiko. The director uses black and white to show his point of view. Watching many scenes I thought I could understand that the director was trying to show that we may be thinking that our pet is really fine and cozy in its place but what it actually wants at that time is to be with us, in our arms. Hachiko wins your heart and bowls you over and devastates you by the end of the run time. I have never owned an animal in my life time. I guess it is time to set this right. As one of my friend wrote and it has stayed with me ever since, when you go and select a dog perhaps that may be the only occasion you get to select your relative. Unbelievable achievement. 4.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all,this is my very first review on IMDb,and although I'm a big fan of this site for couple of years,I registered only recently,mainly because of this movie. "Hachi" is a wonderful story about love and friendship.The plot is excellent,music is fantastic and acting is great,too,but this movie is absolutely breathtaking because of it's message,which is quite simple and yet so complex:love is THE prime power in the Universe.I haven't been so touched by a single movie in my life.Not even with "The Notebook".I saw this movie with my girlfriend in my room,and we didn't blinked for the last 30 minutes of the movie.Although I don't like to express emotions in this volume,I just needed to cry.In the end,we hugged each other and it was the best hug of my life. Sincerity of this movie is gonna blow you away,and I highly recommend it to anyone,action lovers,SF lovers,thriller lovers...It's impossible to stay indifferent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hachi &amp; Richard Gere = Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just watched this on DVD. I was intrigued with a synopsis and also, it was based on a true story. Not that I know it was a beautiful crafted story of a dog's loyalty of his master, knowing that his master was in danger and yet still HOPEFUL that he will return. And so he waited for 9 years after until his death.I do watch a fairly amount of movies with dogs or cats as the main actor. However Hachiko was truly different. This dog is smart, love his owner and doesn't really care about anything else. His whole world was about his owner and died with it.Richard Gere and Hachi relationship in the movie was truly remarkable. Both gave a sincere acting that makes you love the dog and love the owner. I ached and sobbed non-stop at the ending which shows Hachi that has aged, looked dirty, homeless and yet HOPEFUL and waited for his master to come home. I also felt relief when he died peacefully.It relates back to our own lives when we searched and looked and "gave-up" -- yet this dog never did give up.This is a wakeup call movie that inspires you to do more with your loved ones and love them with unconditional love. You should buy the DVD and watch it over and over again when you feel lost or helpless, because Hachiko never gave up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, this was more wrenching than "Old Yeller" as love and loyalty from a canine towards his human. This story was told in such a simple way and its raw depiction of plain canine love wrenched me emotionally. Few movies have the power to reduce me to tears like this nowadays.All the actors are excellent. Richard Gere as the human who follows his heart and bonds with the dog early on. The puppy and the grown dog(s) that act out the loving hearted Hachiko... Such pure love from another species... How can we as humans not feel touched by such devotion and loyalty? How can we, as a species, not feel awed by the trust that our dog friends bestow on us so freely? The movie did a very fine job of depicting the special bond in this human-canine duo. I loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this movie on the Hallmark channel last night and all I can say is - WOW. Not many movies move me the way this one did. I loved the scenes when Hachi was a puppy and Parker began bonding with him - especially watching the baseball game together the night he didn't want to leave him alone. I also appreciated the scenes that were shot through Hachi's eyes - watching Parker share his love with his wife and daughter, spotting Parker out of a busy crowd...so sweet. The scenes towards the end, when Hachi is old and still comes to the station every day had me bawling like a baby. Especially when Parker's wife returns and sits with him for a while. The dog that they chose to portray "old Hachi" with had the slow gait and sad eyes really stole my heart away. And when Hachi reunites with Parker in his dying dream - - that just got me thinking about every pet I have lost and hope to meet again someday too!! This movie is truly a beautiful representation of undying love and faithfulness and even though it made me very sad, it absolutely captures every emotion of the human spirit and that's what makes this movie so wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the BEST movie I have ever seen about a dog and his master. I loved how when they showed scenes through the dog's point of view that they made it black and white...if you don't already know dogs are color blind. It made the movie more realistic which is another reason why I loved the movie, they didn't add any out of this world plots and made it more down to earth and real. This movie made me cry, more than once too. I would have to say that my favorite part in the movie was when the dog and Richard Gear where watching baseball and eating popcorn together I thought that was really cute! I also loved the scene when the mom was coming through the train station and saw Hachi waiting at the train station and asked if she could wait with him...ya that made me cry lolThis is must see movie for everyone not just kids!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most touching film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to say that I already knew the real story of Hachiko before watching this film. Reading about it though didn't have the same effect on me as actually watching it for the first time on the Hallmark Channel yesterday. The acting was excellent, the storyline was excellent, and the three dogs that portray Hachiko (Chico, Layla, and Forrest) were absolutely precious. I'm a twenty-one year old man who's always been rather emotional (it doesn't make any man less of one), and not surprisingly, I was bawling like a newborn baby by the end. Hachiko's death and ascension into Heaven with Parker was truly the saddest part of this film for me. I literally can't stop crying and even as I type this, I'm sobbing. Hachiko's undying loyalty and devotion show us what love truly is. I think if I'd known him, I would've stayed right there with him. I'm quite sure that Parker's grandson and his own Hachiko will share the very same bond their predecessors did. No film has ever moved me so much like this one did, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. I believe as the human soul lives on after death, so does the animal. I'm sure I'll see my own pets in Heaven with me after I die, and I'm sure Hachiko is there, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving tribute, but be prepared for difficult scenes and lingering sadness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film left me in a difficult place to review: it's a beautifully told and acted film that I wish I'd never seen. After three days, I'm still melancholy and teary. I would NOT recommend this film if you are very sensitive, nor is it a film for children. I'm a dog owner who is passionate about all dogs-- and the underlying themes of abandonment, confusion and sorrow Hachi endured completely tore me apart.The film is an exquisitely moving story about the "real" Hachi (Tokyo, 1923-34.) I avoid cute tear-jerker films, but this is different. You'll see remarkable scenes of Hachi's face and the joyous bond he felt for his master. But be prepared for tough scenes of a collarless Hachi sleeping under trains in the snow and wandering alone in old age. Only searching out details of the "real" Hachi helped me move past the film: though Hachi faced difficulties on the street, he did have shelter and was cared for. After running away from several new homes, a train station manager gave him a storeroom to sleep, and Hachi had access to homes of shop owners nearby. Hachi still kept his schedule of waiting daily for his master to return on the train, but his basic needs were cared for as best as people did in the 1930's. He lived to be embraced by many who came to feed him and pat his head for good luck, even attended the ceremony for his own statue being installed. Some accounts even say Hachi saw his master's body at the wake, and sat faithfully near him all night. Stories are exaggerated after 80 years, but I hope it's true, as I've heard this helps dogs understand and ease their grief.If you can handle it, watch this film for an memorable interpretation of Hachi's story. If you have a hard time shaking things off, you'll be better off reading about Hachi's noble soul-- and the enduring devotion he felt for his master, far beyond death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, a long time ago, i had read the story of a dog in Japan. This dog used to wait for his master every day at the train station. One day, his master dies and never return from his trip. Nonetheless, the dog still waited for him... until his death. There is a statue in memory of the dog, Hachiko, a symbol of the strong bound between a dog and its master.This movie is an adaptation of this history, set in modern times. In the first frame when Hachiko makes his appearance, i fell for it, i got really fond of it. So, if you ever had a dog, you will love this movie. I'm pretty sure you will have some tears (or a lot of it) in your face, while viewing this movie. The film is beautiful, highly emotive and yet, very simple in many ways, keeping from be pretentious.I recommend this movie, i advise to have some tissues for you and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hachiko: A Dog's Story (2009)Please Please Please watch this Movie My rating is *********/10First - Its the best Animal movie till date (31/05/2010) and which animal could be best than our own loyal and friendly ....The DOG. 2.Dog owners would understand it much faster than the non dog owners. Only a dog owner can understand the vibes/connection/mutual understanding between him and his dog 3. I gave it 9 points as the movie is different from the true story. The true story is more touching. 4.Richard Gere is outstanding in this movie. Never felt like he was acting. Actually i was surprised to see him working in this movie.By his acting ,he added that extra touch to the movie along with the DOG. 5. You may find it weird, but the acting of the dog was remarkable... i mean ... if i had to give points in acting ..then the DOG will earn more points than Richard Gere. Yes ,the DOG acted in this movie rather than jump from one wall, kicking football or doing those crazy Home Alone tricks. 6.This movie is completely powered with acting performance by the DOG and Mr.Richards. They are the soul of this movie.7. Good work done by the Station Master and the Hot Dog Man. 8. Half the credit should go to the director Mr.Lasse Hallström ,as he has put a lot of hard work in getting those perfect expression of the dog and also captured those special moments between the owner and the dog.Summary ? I am a reviewer who does not enter the story in my review if the film is good. So , sorry ?. No clues . Just watch it !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Learned Humanity from A Dog Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hachiko" is based on the real story that actually happened in 1925 at Shibuya, Tokyo. There's a dog named Hachiko, devotedly waiting the return of his master every day at the train station. Unfortunately, one day his master died and never showed up again. But afterward Hachiko kept waiting on the same spot every single day. The story is widely spread and very well-known in Japan. The Director of thiz movie is Lasse Hallström. Hallström made many modest and effective dramas. His famous works are "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" (1993), "The Cider House Rules" (1999) and "Chocolat" (2000). The movie tries to capture how the event occurs, while the setting and characters are adjusted to United States background. Richard Gere played as Prof. Wilson. Joan Allen and Sarah Roemer played as his wife and daughter. Gere performs his character properly. He looks so compassionate and lovable. The storyline is also filled with simplicity. The plots try to build the sympathy from the beginning and mount up in the end of the movie. The movie simply tells you the story about what happens after his master death. I think thiz movie will easily affect on you, especially if you are a dog lover or a person who ever raise a dog. Thiz is totally just a powerful story behind the real event. The movie is luckily enough to have some good materials to make you cry.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was unaware of the facts of the story that generated this film. I happened to run across a reference to it online and decided to check it out further. I am so glad I did. Somewhere there was a statement that Richard Gere pushed hard to get this film produced, and if that is true then all viewers should be eternally grateful to him. In my life there had been three films that brought me to tears during my viewings of them: Bambi, Old Yeller, and E.T. Now there are four. This film is not perfect but the minor flaws do nothing to interfere with the beauty of the love and devotion shown between Hachi and his master. If I ever get the chance to travel to Japan, it will definitely be on my must see list to journey to Shibuya Station to pay my respects to the statue of such a beautiful animal. Hachi was truly Man's Best Friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I could easily characterise it as my favorite one since it's the only movie it've made cry for about 20 minutes.It's a movie which can easily make you love animals and believe in dog's royalty and all these stories have been told about it.It demonstrates the value of love without the demand of response, without conditions and selfishness. That's a love that only a pure and kind animal like a dog can share. It's almost impossible to be found in humans. That's why when you are surrounded by dogs even homeless ones you can never feel lonely or abandoned. Because these cute creatures will treat you like you are their beloved king.Some people unfortunately take advantage of this. So please never treat with cruelty an animal because this is not what their pure loveful soul deserves.Just watch this movie and you'll understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hachi-Ko. A remake of the 1987 film of the same name. Based on a true story of a Akita-Hachi dog from Japan. My response after the movie- How could someone like me, the staunchest, the hardest and perhaps the coldest of hearts crying like a girl? I don't know. Perhaps that just suggests that some part of me is still human, the emotions that were in all likelihood dead emerge again. Or maybe it is metamorphosis of my psyche even a transient one.Nothing is so profound. A walk to remember , and Oldboys were quite moving themselves but nothing comes so far as to turn steel into a stream of lachrymal fluid, or without embellishment make him cry.If you are in a mood to see something touching, that will rinse your soul, wrench every fiber in your body and let it dry in the pyre of emotions, it is this. Nothing ever comes so close in the simplicity of the theme. Two companions , a dog and a man, bonded beyond description. Undiluted Unadultrated Sacred Pure love and loyalty.I always had a soft corner for dogs and I tried to console myself when we gave our pet Diana away saying that this needs to be done. But I never thought how the canine feels. Hachi feels the pangs of separation and longs for the treasured companion. He waits for 10 long years daily waiting for him to turn up. Insanely moving. Must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This will change the way you look at dogs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am big fan of the movies based on true stories and this movie just turned out to be the movie of a lifetime. You cant just miss this movie if you are a dog owner or you love dogs. Believe me this will change the way you look at your dog. Hachiko portrays true soul of a dog.The music perfectly blends with every scene of the movie. I downloaded the soundtracks after I saw the movie and I can listen to them for ages. The movie touched me deep in that I raised a dog for about a year and then I had to leave him with my family. Hachiko movie made me realize how much I mean to my dog. Its been two years and I am still waiting for the moment to see him... Go watch this movie and I am sure you'll fall in love with your dog once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saddest and most entertaining movie of 2010!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is amazingly sad. You HAVE to see this movie if you own a dog.The direction is amazing and also the writing. From the moment you start watching you are pulled into the amazingly GOOD plot! It is based on the true story of a Japanese dog's unrelenting and beautiful loyalty to his owner.The only movie I've ever cried and still cried before I watched this film was Lilo &amp; Stitch. But this one... left me crying for the last 30 minutes! The script is that good!! It builds up perfectly.Props must also be given to the people in charge of picking the music or composing it. The score is about 50% the reason the film is so sad. The beautiful music is there for every heartwarming moment and it never disappoints.The acting also very good. Heck, even the one who sells hot dogs is good and Richard Gere is ASTOUNDING as the dog owner.Perfect direction, heartbreaking story and also beautiful acting and music all combine to make this movie one of the best, saddest (and most importantly, entertaining) movies I've seen in a long time.10/10 Amazing!! Must see if you own a dog or would like one :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>based on the true story ...Hachiko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this film on Hallmark channel and it is sad and wonderful. Anyone who loves a dog, must see this. It is based on a true story, and isn't just the Disney fiction story we are used to.Richard Gere portrays a music professor in New York suburbs who commutes to the city for work every day. One day he comes across a stray, a beautiful Akita puppy who has lost his way.He brings the pup home, hoping at first to keep him, but his wife, Joan Allen, is not really a dog lover. She wants the dog in the shed, or to find a new home.After back and forth of trying to get the dog adopted, Gere finally decides he cannot just give the dog to a shelter, where they put dogs to sleep after two weeks, there are too many which aren't adopted.He eventually names the dog "Hachi" after his Japanese colleague tells him the story behind the breed of Akita. They are very loyal and devoted, but do not expect them to play catch at the whim of a human.Over time we see Gere and his family, he becomes a grandfather, he takes the dog for trips (Hachi refuses to sit home while his master is at work, he will wait for him at the train station, even in freezing weather). The story is told in a natural progression, we also see in the dogs perspective, in black and white, with gray.While this film came out after "Marley and Me" it is not just another dog story. It will truly touch your heart. Indeed, I have not cried over any film in over fifteen years. Highly recommended and read the true story as well. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hardly ever write reviews as I feel that there are so many reviews out there, people don't read most of them.After watching this however, I really felt the need to convey how touching this movie was. It is based on a true story of a dog that loves his owner so much... he never forgets him.This is one of those movies that just stays with you. It is beautifully written, the music is absolutely wonderful. I couldn't stop thinking to myself how much I was enjoying the soundtrack. Richard Gere gives a wholesome performance and the rest of the cast are pretty good as well.I highly recommend this movie to you, especially if you have young kids. I believe it can help them develop an appreciation for animals. This movie truly touched me. I broke down crying for the last 15 minutes or so and I am a grown man... this movie is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can i say? I use this site for years now and i never wrote a comment here before but for this film i just had to do. I nearly died watching this movie.. this film made me cry for hours.For my it is definitely the saddest film of all time.I have never seen/heard such a sad and beautiful story before. And it is so simply made with no special affects,it focus only on the bond between the dog and his master.Richard Gere is superb in this film but the dog is even better.His facial expressions were truly amazing. I think this is a movie everyone should see and take a lesson from it!!!Many people should learn to treat their animals better because they have feelings too! No one will find a better friend than his own dog.</fullReview>

Well!!! This was one of the best movies I've ever seen showing how the friendship/love between a dog and its owner ever. I struggled to keep myself from crying as the story unfolded and we see how this remarkable dog idealizes its owner with unconditional love. Just the thought that this is a true story makes it so heart warming and if the whole world would treat each other with the love/respect as a dog does for its owner we would so much better off.I think anyone that loves dogs/pets should definitely see this as its the BEST movie especially of its type I've ever seen..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far the best dog movie I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts off with Parker (Gere) finding Hachi at a train station and not wanting to leave the dog alone. He takes him home for the night until the owner comes back to the station to claim him. His wife (Allen) clearly is not to fond of dogs and tells her husband that there is no way that they will be keeping the dog. Of course no one claims the dog and the wife realizes how much the husband and the daughter (Roemer) love the dog so she caves and lets them keep it. You clearly see the bond between Hachi and Parker with all the time they spend together and Hachi actually starts walking Parker to the train station and waiting for him when he gets back. One day Parker goes to work and has a heart attack and dies, but Hachi continues to wait for him at the station. Even after years of his passing Hachi continues to go back every day to wait for him.I'm going to start by arguing a couple of reviews I have read. First negative review was from UK critic who said he wasn't at all touched by this movie and the only real thought he had about it was how stupid a dog could be for waiting around for 10 years for his dead master to return. This clearly makes me angry, let's be real this is a dog not a human and I'm not saying dogs are dumb on the contrary I think there very intelligent, but I don't believe they no what happens to there master when they die and this movie is a perfect example of that. The last time Hachi saw Parker he was going to work so for all we know the dog just thought he had to eventually be coming back.Second review was how uninspired he was by this story and would have been more inspired if the community would have tried to help the dog understand that his master was not coming back. Parker's daughter, who probably loved him almost as much as parker himself, tried to take Hachi home with her, but Hachi didn't want too he wanted to wait for the one he loved most at the station. Let's be honest, when someone is stubborn and thinks what they are doing is right you can't convince them otherwise. Well that's how I felt about Hachi he was stubborn and no one was going to be able to get him to stop waiting.My thoughts on this movie are clear it was easily the most heartfelt movie in years. When I read all these reviews about how everyone sobbed I was thinking "Ok, I might tear up a bit, but there is no way I'm going to sob" Well I would just like to say that my wife and I have joined the sobbing club. I have shed a tear for very few movies and I see a lot, but there was something special about this movie. For me what made Hachi so special is most dogs I know love attention regardless who there getting it from, but of course they love there master just because they spend most there time with them. If a dog were to lose there master and someone else takes the dog and gives it just as much love and attention the dog will love there new owner just as much as the old owner. This wasn't the case for Hachi. He had an opportunity at Parker's daughters, but he didn't want to stay with her he loved his master so much that he was willing to not get the full affection that a dog deserves from another person for the rest of his life for just that one chance that Parker would return to play with him one more time.Hachi is a dog that could teach a lot of people a lesson or two on how to love one another and to not give up on love as fast as many people do now a days. Please rent this movie whether your a dog lover or not. This is not about how much a pet loved its master, its about how wonderful of a connection two friends had with each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hachiko Lives On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What many people don't know is that Hachiko was a real dog and the story is true. A Japanese Akita loved his master so much, he waited for him everyday at the Shibuya train station in Tokyo, and they walked home together when he came back for 2 years. Tragically his master died at work and never came back, but Hachiko waited 10 years for him to come home and died at the train station still waiting. Hachi, A Dogs Tale was a beautiful movie about the real Hachiko and the loyalty and love he had for his master. Richard Gere is a great actor and his character is believable and likable, and Hachi (a Japanese style Akita) is absolutely adorable! I seriously wanted to hug him throughout the movie. The setting was a little different (Rhode Island instead of Japan) but it didn't really matter. The story is heartbreaking and lovely as you watch Hachi wait for his master until they are finally reunited. As a warning though: Bring tissues, this movie is super sad!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was incredible. I was crying so hard my kids thought I was nuts and when I looked in the mirror my eyes were swollen. But all in all it was worth it, as it makes you believe in love and loyalty to the end, definitely worth seeing. The dog, an Akita, was so amazing. It made me want to look into the breed a bit, but I think the idea is that any dog could be this loving and loyal to their owner. The actors/actresses did a great job, and just knowing it was based on a true story made it even more profound in my opinion. I am glad I did not see this in the theater and at home as I am afraid of how much I would have cried with the big screen, bad enough on my TV at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hachi -Love and Loyalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kept looking for this movie in the cinema. It never played in my area. I finally bought it and saw it on DVD. This was very different for Gere. He finds a lost puppy Akita at a train station and tries to find the owner. Gere falls in love with the dog and names him Hachi. He gets the name from a tag that was on the Akita at the station. Whenever Gere goes to work in the morning to take the train, Hachi goes with him and always waits at the station for him to come home. One day, Gere never comes home on the train, but Hachi still goes there to wait for him for many years.This movie was based on a true story. The real dog and owner were from Japan in the 1930's. Gere says on the DVD feature that he cried when he read the script. I did also, and so will you if you see this very touching story. It is a story of love and loyalty. It probably got lost amongst all the other big budget films in the cinema but it should not be missed on DVD. If this movie doesn't make you cry, nothing will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad, touching movie for all ages...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I like to point out that I never wrote anything on IMDb, since I had nothing to tell, but after watching this movie, I felt an obligation to do so...As many people who already commented on this movie, I found myself to be very tough and emotionally untouchable by many things, but since I already have a dog (Golden retriever), I could not but to be touched by how loyal this dog, Hach, was to his master. Fact that this is a true story based movie, only made my experience far more deeper than I originally thought it would be. Yes, family of the professor could take this dog, keep him warm, give him home, or at least let him go every day on station to wait for his master and return him back home. I know I would do that, but somehow, producer of this movie wanted to make story even sadder, so he made it look like this particular dog was all alone on himself. I must tell that this fact somehow made me sad. Solitude is something I would not even wish for my enemies.Because story and family involvement could be better, I give this movie a solid 9 and I must point out that this is very strong rating coming from me because I tend to criticize movies for even a smallest mistakes.Must see movie for all ages. Definitively a movie I will always remember!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very touching movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My son loved "Marley and Me", which is cool, he's 10. His Father (me) liked it but loved this movie more. Being Japanese American I had heard about the original story from my Mom. I thought the movie was very well done, not going for cheap sentimentality but showing very well the bond between Hachi and the Professor. I have read some other posts where the readers took the family to task for seemingly "abandoning" Hachi after the professor died. For one, it's a MOVIE. Also, we don't know where the professor's wife was going, maybe dogs weren't allowed. Also, the daughter had more of a bond, so that is why Hachi went with her. I also don't think she "abandoned" him either. She was wise enough to know that she and her family would never replace the professor in Hachi's heart and would be miserable if he stayed.I really liked the way the "reunion" was handled. They say your life flashes before you before you pass on. In Hachi's case, he remembered the happy times with the the professor. When the professor "steps" through the door and they are reunited, it's like Hachi's 10 year wait has paid off. They are back together and now he can move on as well.The coda with the grandson telling the story to his class and getting a puppy of his own (which he called Hachi) was a nice touch, but not really necessary. The last scene of Hachi in his final "sleep" after seeing his master again would have been more powerful.My wife and I had tears in our eyes. My son liked the movie, but made me laugh when he said, "It's just like Marley and Me only the owner died" 10 year old kids are sometimes sharper than grown ups!</fullReview>

Background score is pretty repetitive although it just manages to do justice to the movie.Richard Gere's performance is neat, the rest of the cast put up a just above mediocre act.Hachiko is brilliant although his part of the script does not involve too much tricks other than waiting in the station.Overall ..

I was "ooing" and "ahing" at the sweet moments and crying during the sad moments. Lasse Hallstrom is one of my favorite directors, and this movie is no exception.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie last week and I have to say that it's the best movie I've ever seen. It's a wonderful sad story that leaves you heartbroken and tearful, and one cannot help but to feel the pain and sadness that Hachi felt. It leaves you wondering how a dog can have so much love and devotion when there are people out there who cant even show half the loyalty and love for each other as much as Hachi did for his master. Knowing Hachi's story I cannot help to feel wanting to be a better person and human, this movie leaves it prints in your heart/soul and is a story you will not forget. I have to say that Lasse Hallstrom did a terrific job with this movie, if not one of the best movies he has made.I give Hachi's story a ten because his story touched me deeply in a way nothing ever has. Living me wondering how unique this dog was and how loved he was and still is by us people who knows his story and devotion, and yes sometimes a dog really is a mans best friend, like Hachi. Undying love and bond for a master who did not return until the day they met again, a day Hachi waited for for ten years. Definitely a movie worth watching. Wonderful and amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate dog film weepie, impossible not to cry no matter who you are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one really will make you cry, even those who think they can't. Hachi, full name Hachiko, is an Akito dog from Japan. In this film he is sent to America, where his story unfolds. But there was a real Hachi, who lived in Japan, and this story is true, although it really all took place in Japan. So famous is the real dog Hachi that a life-size bronze statue of him was erected in his home town in his memory! By transferring the story of Hachi to America, it meant that Richard Gere could be 'Hachi's mother', the university professor who finds Hachi lost on a railway platform and with whom the little puppy bonds for life, with fanatical devotion. I was going to say with superhuman devotion, but I guess supercanine devotion is a better way to put it. I noticed that this film was distributed by a subsidiary of Sony, so perhaps that is how a Japanese tale ended up being transposed to Rhode Island, where Gere is presumably meant to be teaching at Brown University. (His educational and professional life is only roughly sketched.) The one false note in this film is Joan Allen, who plays Gere's wife. Although she was brilliant in OFF THE MAP (see my review), she gets the tone wrong here, which may be the fault of the otherwise brilliant Lasse Hallström, who has directed this film otherwise nearly to perfection. Allen falls into the trap in the early part of the story of acting the part of the censorious, sour and unsympathetic wife, who has become just as much a stock character in modern American movies as the embittered and vicious ex-wife or the 'angry young woman' who takes her revenge on men. Although Allen softens up as things go on, she is never convincingly warm either towards her husband or his dog, whom she initially fanatically opposes (for reasons which are entirely unclear other than the presumption that Gere's wife, not any potential girl dog whom Hachi might ever meet, is a bitch). I found that aspect of the film disappointing, disturbing, and incomprehensible. Hachi starts out as a puppy, becomes an adult, and then becomes an old dog, so there must have been at least three Hachis acting in the film. Hallström is known as a dog lover, and he aptly subtitles this film: 'A Dog's Love Story', as the attention is all on Hachi. Richard Gere is absolutely superb as the man who learns to love his dog more than anyone or anything. He and Hachi become inseparable, and every day at 5 PM, Hachi trots over to the railway station to meet his master's train and accompany him on the walk home. But Richard Gere has a heart attack and dies whilst teaching, and when Hachi goes to meet the train that day, his master does not appear as normal at the station door. Various events ensue, but Hachi cannot settle with any other member of the family, as they have all left the original house near the station, so Hachi returns to his post every day and waits for his master. He does this every day for ten years. (The real Hachi in Japan did it for nine years.) He faithfully waits and scans the station door every day at 5 PM, never giving up hope or losing his loyalty to the man he adores. He does this come rain or shine, he sits in the snow, he lives on scraps, but nothing can deter him or shake his loyalty. There are some really good performances by minor characters associated with the station, a hot-dog seller (sensitively portrayed by the Indian actor Erick Avari), some station employees, and other locals such as a friendly butcher and his wife, and even a real Japanese professor (excellently played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) who had been a friend of Gere, who comes and speaks to Hachi in Japanese, which Hachi from his facial expression clearly recognises. Hachi's point-of-view shots are all shot in black and white, from ground level, presumably on the theory that dogs do not see in colour. They are very effective indeed, which is not an easy thing to pull off. I don't know why poor Hachi was left outside at night in a doghouse. Any half sensible person would have wanted Hachi in the house at night, rather than in the cold during the winter, however thick his fur might be. But then people are weird, and only dogs are sensible and loving, as this film proves. If ever a dog could teach us all something it is Hachi. He can instruct us in the true meaning of the word 'loyalty', both the dictionary meaning of which and the daily application of which have become so unfashionable in our current narcissistic society, where no even looks at another person anymore, as everyone's eyes are now out of focus, staring into space vacantly while listening to someone talk nonsense on a cellphone, oblivious of all surroundings. This film is so sad and such a desperate weepie that even the most hardened narcissist might turn his Blackberry off for a few moments of reflection, that is, if he has sufficient attention span to watch two or three continuous minutes of anything other than a combat computer game. I had great fun watching this DVD with Dutch subtitles. I now know that 'Good Boy!' in Dutch is 'Brave Hond!', 'Really?' is 'Echt waar?', and if I ever want to call anyone 'Sweetie' when I am next in the Netherlands, all I have to do is say 'lieverd' and smile. So you see how much else Hachi has taught me? I really recommend turning on the foreign subtitles when you watch movies, as you can learn a foreign language at the same time as seeing the film. Such fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will touch your heart, based on the sincere love of a dog and his owner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like others have said,this is an absolute gem of a movie. No explosions,car chases,violence,nudity, vulgarity etc... Just a compelling window into the "heart of a dog" which leaves you drained far beyond the current "crap" that comes out of Hollywood. This film made me "feel" the sincerity of what it's like to love and miss another being when they are gone from your life. Sometimes a "reality check" movie is just what we need. Thank you Richard Gere and Joan Allen for giving us your gift of a real story instead of the high budget,brain dead entertainment that's so common. 10 out of 10 We've got another classic film here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Tug At Your Heartstrings...Have Tissues Around!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW!!! My husband had suggested this movie saying it was a sad movie about a dog...so of course I was hesitant being that I love dogs.Truth be told though, this movie was so touching, heartwarming, moving and made me realize all over again how powerful the love and devotion between ourselves and our pets can be. If you've ever had a dog, wanted a dog or just like dogs in general, this is a must watch.Without giving the story away...the premise behind the movie is about the loyalty that exists between a man and his dog even beyond life in the physical world. It's proof that love never dies and that animals...dogs in particular...have the uncanny ability to just feel and love without boundaries, logic or reason. They just do and once they're loyal to you, they'll love you forever.Interestingly enough, this movie was based on a true story...which makes it even more amazing. Richard Gere was wonderful in his role and Jason Alexander played a great supporting role and the dog deserves an Oscar. Who knew dogs could act so convincingly? You can actually see the thoughts and emotions in the dog's expressions, and what a gorgeous dog it was. I had never given much thought to Akitas before, but I'm deeply impressed! It'll make you want to jump through the screen and give him a hug.I highly recommend this movie. Just keep some tissues around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated dog movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like dogs, but I also appreciate good film making. Without spoiling I am safe to say, the best thing about this movie was the end. There is something wrong with a movie, if the last scene is emotionally most touching and it contains text. Text about the real events that are portrayed in the film (another example would be "Black Hawk Down")Everything before was mildly interesting. I was surprised to find out Lasse Hallström directed this, who is most famous for "Chocolat" and "The Cider House Rules". I must say I am not a big fan of his work, I thought some kind of indie, amateur or semi professional cinematographer filmed this. Hachi was released in 2009, why does it looks 15 years older? The film must have been a low budget production, because the camera equipment is poor and the soundtrack feels cheap. It contains boring monotonic piano strumming throughout the whole thing. Sometimes Hachi would have been better off without the music, especially towards the end, because you hear more or less the same score in every scene and it gets repetitive.The story is based on a true and mildly interesting story, unfortunately the storytelling has some major flaws. You don't get to know much about the characters, they are only sketches. Let's start with the beginning, we get to see a random Japanese monk who decides to send a dog as a puppet to the United States of America. Guess that makes a lot of sense, obviously lots of Japanese monks to that. The movie explanation is rather stupid: it must have been faith that Hachi and Gere met each other at the train station. Whatever. Another flaw is the first scene. There is Gere's grandson telling the story about Hachi the dog in school, the dog is his "personal hero". But later on we learn that his own family didn't care much about Hachi. Richard Gere died and later his daughter takes care of Hachi, but things don't work out well and she decides to let the dog stray outside and the dog leaves.Although she must have perfectly known where Hachi is, after he went to the train station everyday, she never returns to look after him. The whole town knew where the dog is and it was even in the news. Couldn't she at least try to bring him back home? Or bring him some food? She does not seem to care so much.Then the dog, Hachi decides to abandon his caring and loving family after his former owner died. But he does this to his own suffering and no dog would do that, not to a certain degree, not when it is freezing cold, there is no food and his later family actually cared about him. The story would have been much more understandable if the family didn't take good care of him. But according to the story they did. Remember the first scene? Hachi is supposedly some kind of "hero" for the family, and he is established as an intelligent dog, why didn't he return once? After several years Gere's widow finds Hachi surprisingly at the train station. Was she surprised that the dog is still alive or that Hachi wasn't at home? Didn't she knew from her daughter, the news or from other people? In the next scene we see her inside a house, showing a family album with photographs of Hachi to her grandson, but you know what, the dog is still out there, dieing. Why didn't she take him home, after all? How cynical is it to show off some pictures knowing that the dog is still out there in the cold. In the next scene Hachi dies, than we get text at the end that I mentioned before (which is the best scene in the movie)Like another reviewer wrote: Hachi is nothing more than a 90 minute stretched TV commercial: we see doggy in the rain, family albums, Christmas, happy couples, doggy goes to heaven, etc. but not much else. It is not a "bad" movie though, just not very re-watchable. The movie is not as cheesy as other dog movies and it truly manages to show the spirit of dogs. They are loyal and they always wait for you to come home. To be fair, from all the dog movies I have seen so far, Hachi is the best. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have ever truly loved a dog and that dog loved you this movie will bring you to tears. For about the last third of the movie I began to well up with tears and then after the time lapse, I could not stop crying.After the movie I was full of sad emotions about the dogs in my past I loved. This movie really connects the viewer with the loyalty and love of a great dog. Anyone who does not like this movie has clearly never loved a dog like a sibling or child.I felt Richard Gere played his role perfectly and was portrayed as a man who has a genuine heart for animals, which works even better to heap the emotion on the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>that was my Akita too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Akita was exactly like Hachi. She was so bonded to me, I couldn't bear to think of what my dying would have done to her. She would go to the window ten minutes before I got home; it didn't matter that there was no pattern to my schedule, somehow she 'knew'. Once I had to go away for a few months; I heard how sad she was, so I phoned and I sent home a shirt I'd worn, so she would know I was alive.She was the smartest dog I ever met. But she would never learn to fetch (sometimes she went to get it, but only if she wanted it, she almost never would bring it back), it seemed to me that she had too much dignity.I did always did everything I could to make hers the best life any dog ever lived; I knew how loyal she was, and returned every bit of it to her.That was 15 years ago. After the first few minutes of the movie "Hachi", I never stopped crying until the end. I loved the movie, the most moving one I ever saw. Beautifully made and unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't say I like it, but it's a haunting movie--maybe for all the wrong reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still can't stop thinking about it, so that says something. However, I'm really troubled by the behavior of the characters in this movie. Ultimately, the storyline doesn't work in the 21st century.I was troubled that Parker let his dog roam the streets and follow him without even a collar on. And the wife, whose name I can't even remember, doesn't seem to ever attach to the dog for no valid reason as the dog is adorable and loving. The fact that the poor animal is forced to sleep in the tool shed when these people have a huge house with a wonderful sun porch for just the two of them is more than annoying. In fact, the dog is NEVER shown in the house as a grown animal. Makes me think his loyalty is misplaced and nowhere near deserved by these people. Even after her husband dies, she never even says goodbye as her daughter loads the dog up. There is no explanation given as to why she doesn't keep the dog as any creature loved so much by a beloved husband should be cherished and taken care of. The daughter makes a half-hearted attempt to keep the dog, but gives up quickly and never goes to see how the dog is doing. Oh, and how do they explain to the son that they just left grandpa's dog to fend for himself? Makes no sense.The one with the most concern is the Japanese professor who at least attempts to give money to the local vendors for the dog's care. They refuse as they're willing to take care of him, but there's no true care going on. Couldn't the station master give him a broom-closet to sleep in? A dish with some real dog food in it? A blanket or two? And the hot dog vendor only offers some stray scraps of leftover hot dogs. That's not nutrition. And in the true story, apparently the station master did allow the dog to live in the station and made a home for him (which would have worked MUCH better here) rather than allowing him to live under an old train in all kinds of weather. The ending does work well in its uplifting vision of dog meeting master upon his death.The filming is well done, and the black and white images of life through a dog's eyes are creative and just enough to make the point. The setting couldn't be more beautiful and adds to the haunting tone of the story.The screenplay is ultimately really flat to match the characters. The daughter makes an impassioned plea for the dog to stay, telling him how much they love him and want him, and in the next breath says goodbye and opens the gate. Okay, so the premise is the dog needs to do what the dog needs to do, but that's like saying a ten-year-old should be allowed to do what he or she feels like doing. It doesn't make sense. No one goes out of his or her way to help the dog in any meaningful way, not even in a superficial way. And when the wife shows up at the train station ten years later to visit her husband's grave, her interaction with the dog is trite.Maybe the film would have worked if set in the original time period (1920s) if not the original country. And after writing this I know why I can't stop thinking about it. I'm haunted by the loyalty of an animal who is ultimately so neglected and ignored.This film is a sad commentary on human behavior and the emotional, physical waste of this beautiful animal is, even to anyone who isn't a major animal lover, a horrible tragedy. There is no redemption in this film. Just sadness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Surely Make You Cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Hachiko without knowing anything about the real dog. I saw the trailer in TV and thought, "Hey! Richard Gere is in it and it's about a dog and I love dogs so let's watch it!" So I watched it and by the first 10 minutes I was absolutely immersed in it. The cute moments Hachi and his master had with each other, &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3But then Richard Gere died and my heart broke. Still I kept watching it. My mom and my older sister were with me and my mom, being utterly emotional, began to sob. My sister and I were stronger than that so we kept watching. Joan Allen moved out of her old house and we felt sad seeing Hachi upset. The dogs who played Hachi did a marvelous job. Anyway, Hachi left his master's daughter's house and began to live homeless, just to get the opportunity to visit the station and wait for his master. Alas! He never came!Now my heart began to melt. The heartbreaking moments began now. Hachi lived by himself, and despite sufferings like cold weather and hunger and thirst, he kept waiting. Who does that?Only dogs! Soon nine years passed by and Hachi grew weak and old. He was slow and suffering yet he walked almost miles just to wait for his master at the station. Who does that? Dogs!One day, Joan Allen returned to visit her husband's grave and found Hachi at the station. Now she could fathom how deeply and truly Hachi loved her husband. "You don't have to wait for him anymore, Hachi. He's never coming back."This triggers a tear in me."Grandma, how did Grandpa find Hachi?" "Actually, it was Hachi who found your grandpa."More tears!"I never met my grandfather, he died when I was just a little baby. But when I hear about him and Hachi, I feel like I know him. They taught me the meaning of loyalty. That you should never forget anyone that you loved. And that's why Hachi will forever be my hero."I hide my face to hide the tears.Then came the ending. Hachi dying and reuniting with his master. The background music perfectly matched the melancholic yet happy moment.That did it!I sobbed and sobbed and so did my sister. Never in my wildest dream did I think that a movie would make me cry. :'( :'( :'( :'(If you want to see true love in movies, don't waste your time in watching fictional craps like Fifty Shades or Remember Me. Watch this movie. I guarantee you you will definitely cry.Unless you have no heart!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not only the beautiful movie that is completely well-made by every point of view but it is something that gives you something more. It is beautiful piece of art inspired by real life and the most strongest, most beautiful parts of it. I believe that this movie moves most of the people's feeling and emotions and for me it was definitely a catharsis-like experience. These people who are not moved by this movie...I must admit that I believe they are not been concentrated when watching it or they are the most cold-hearted beings. Movie itself is based on real life story and it's about the strongest connections and feelings between animal and human. And it is so beautifully made - structure, dialogues, acting, music, camera-work...everything is just perfect. It should be watched with your closest ones - with those in front you can naturally cry without holding yourself back because then the catharsis is stronger and you can fully express you feelings and after you get over this movie you can turn to life as a better person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many people think that this is such an amazing movie. I, however, do not. What I see is horrible cruelty for the dog. I know that many are using the fact that the dog keeps going back to the train station for years as a sign of loyalty (an it is a sign of loyalty), but him going back for all those years is also the cruel part.I have had dogs, cats, a rabbit and ferrets. All of them have been extremely attached to me and several did not even like it even if I was just outside the house and they could see me from the window. For years I have had a part in my will that states that if I die, my "babies" are to be shown my body so that they know that I will not be coming back. I do not want them to be waiting forever for my return that will never happen.I was crying throughout the last part of the movie, not that Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) had died, but that the poor dog did not know that and was now forever waiting for him to return. I had heard of a similar situation when a guy that had a dog with him in a hospital and had to have surgery, died in surgery and he too, waited for the rest of his life for his friend to return. I even make sure that any of my "babies" that are still alive see any of my "babies" that die, so that they are not waiting for them to return.I had seen a few reviews that had stated that you needed tissues, but I did not realize why. Had I known, I may not have watched this movie.I implore any of you that have an animal (or as I call mine, "baby"), that is very attached to you as this dog was to Parker Wilson, that you make sure that the members of your family know that the animal, or your "baby" is shown that you are dead so that they do not wait for the rest of their lives for your return. It is a very cruel thing to not allow them to see that you are not coming back. Believe me, when they see that you are dead, they will understand that you will not be coming back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bond between pet and owner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachi:A Dog's Tale is directed by Lasse Hallstrom, has a screenplay by Stephen P. Lindsey and is inspired by a true story from Japan. The film stars Richard Gere and Joan Allen.Hachi always goes to the train station each day with his owner Parker(Richard Gere)when he goes to work. He will then go home and will go and wait outside the station at the time when Parker comes home. One day Parker falls ill at work and dies. Hachi is waiting as usual and is very confused when his owner doesn't come out of the station. Every day after this one he sits outside the station waiting for Parker, not understanding that he will never see him again. Parker's wife Cate(Joan Allen)and local commuters are all deeply moved by Hachi's devotion and sadness. Over time commuters come and fuss Hachi as he sits waiting.The film is inspired by a true event in Japan during the 1920's and 1930's. Hachiko was a dog who's owner died at work and never returned home on the train. He sat outside the station everyday waiting for him to come home and attracted fame when commuters noticed him. After his death a statue was erected outside the station, Hachiko is buried next to his master.This film is so sad and proves that animals have feelings and are aware of things. I always have tears streaming down my face whenever I watch this. The film shows how strong the bond between pet and owner can be.</fullReview>

Who really sent the puppy to the picturesque U.S. suburbs? (And how did the professor afford so much house on his salary?) But no matter. We are taken in by the pure joy of the unshakable affection between man and dog. More meat on the human bones would have helped me as a viewer, although I suspect that others would be just fine with the film as is.

		<shortDescription>A Decent Interpretation of a True Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am struck deeply by the tale of Hachiko. Yes... My ID here on IMDb is based upon the story of Hachiko -- But let me be clear -- it is NOT based upon this film. I have reviewed many films prior to reviewing this one, here on IMDb, using my "Hachi Ko" ID. I feel that I can review this film objectively.First of all, after reading all of the accounts of the Real story of Hachiko, I can confidently say that this film is a decent story in its own right, but it is a Very Loose interpretation of the tale of the real Hachiko. It is, for all practical purposes, a Work of Fiction."Hachi", the film, barely works as a 1.5-hour film. I did enjoy watching it, but it's not worth a second look. The film is essentially a 1.5-hour melodrama that appears to have the sole purpose of making dog-lovers cry. There is very little in the way of a real plot in this film. The same instrumental music playing over and over and over again throughout the entire film doesn't help.With that said, I'm not going to pretend that I know how the film could have been better. Most likely, it probably just wasn't a good film story to begin with, and should have just been left alone.Basically, an empty-nest guy stumbles upon a dog, and falls in love with the dog, which also falls in love with him. The guy's wife gets jealous of the dog, but before that jealousy can become a serious plot issue, the guy suddenly dies of a freak aneurysm. Then, the dog waits for him at the train station for several years, until the dog finally dies. I'm not trying to make fun of the story. My point is that there is only so much that you can do with that information. Just getting this film to 90 minutes was a stretch. This story was better left on paper.A few points that were brought up regarding flaws in the plot, by some of those who commented earlier:1) 'The dog only went back to the station for the food that the station vendors were giving him.' Actually, in the true story, in Japan, the vendors initially hated the dog and shooed him away for awhile. Eventually, however, they began to respect the dog's loyalty, and began feeding him.2) 'In the film, no one in the family seemed to realize that when the dog disappeared, he was waiting at the train station.' Well, the guy's wife was the only one in the family who would have known that, and she supposedly hated the dog. She certainly didn't want to go retrieve the dog, and she didn't talk about the dog with her daughter.3) As for the dog... Is it loyalty or obedience? Akita Inu are known for their "loyalty" and strict "pack mentality." If the guy was the "Alpha", then the dog would have waited out of Fealty as much as out of Loyalty. Since none of us is a dog, we can't know for sure exactly which emotion drives a dog to be loyal. I have my opinions, but they are just that... Opinions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A difficult movie to review , because it IS emotionally wrenching, but then having said that, I found myself very angered by the actions of the daughter and the wife of Richard Gere's character.The daughter takes the dog home and then bids it "Goodbye Hachi" and opens the gate and lets the dog wander of to it's lonely last 9 years of life. The wife finds the dog at the end of the film, aged and still mourning his owner, she hugs him and weeps and then she too leaves(abandons ) him. Does any dog lover think that these are appropriate actions? To see this poor animal, every winter sleeping under a train in the cold/ frost and ice is very upsetting. Yes, for the emotional tug of the story it works, but totally inappropriate to treat an animal like this. If a spouse was so upset at the loss of their partner, and they wanted to haunt the railway station for the rest of their life to be linked to their lost spouse would you let them do it? To put it in human terms the animal was traumatized and needed love, care and attention. They should have taken him to the train station at the time of the professor's daily arrival and then taken him home, loved him, and made him comfortable. But these people just abandoned him. I admit at the end I was sobbing, but I also was very angered, by this story. Poor Hachi...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the loyal dog Hachi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SOME SPOILERS ARE IN THIS REVIEW BE WARNED.when I first saw the preview I was like "its just another story about a dog" then I saw the movie it was a story about a dog but not just any dog the most loyal dog ever. Hachi would always meet his owner at the train station at a sir tent time ever day. Hachi was just a pup when the owner found him left at the train station. Hachi was a very good dog. Hachi is a great movie I would watch it again and again if I could. the movie is happy but then sad I'm not going to tell you way cause that would be a big spoiler so your going to just have to watch the movie. its a very good movie if your a dog lover you will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heart-warming movie, one of my favorite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a beautiful and a very touching story about a dog devoted to his owner. I watched this movie for about fifth times and I can't help not to cry every time I watched it. But then, I still love this movie. It was a great movie, if you've ever had a dog or longed for one, you'll find yourself pulled whole-heartedly into this story.Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a 2009 drama film directed by Lasse Hallstrom, based on the true story of a faithful Akita Inu. Written by Stephen P. Lindsey&#xff0c;Kaneto Shindo and stars Richard Gere, Joan Allen, and Sarah Roemer. The subject is a remake of the 1987 Japanese language film, Hachik&#x14d; Monogatari literally "The Tale of Hachiko" .An Akita puppy was born in a Japanese monastery was being shipped to the United States. Along the way his address tag was lost and his wooden crate falls off a cart and breaks open.Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), who has just gotten off the train on his way home from his teaching job at University found the puppy. Parker, who loves dogs, takes him home. A Japanese friend reads the dog tag "Hachiko" or "Eight" means a lucky number. He then name the dog Hachi, according to the word from his tag.Parker teaches the dog to fetch the ball, but Hachi didn't learned, his friend explained that the dog will forge a different kind of loyalty. As Hachi grows, he bonds more deeply with Parker. The dog is so devoted to the professor that he accompanies him every day to the train station for his commute to work. At night, Hachi waits for him to return just outside the train station doors and together walk home.People around notice and appreciate this loving ritual. The master fails to return to the train station one evening. But his dog continues to wait at the train station every evening, day after day, year after year, no matter whether it is hot or cold or rainy or snowing. Although Parker's daughter and her family try to take care of the dog, Hachi keeps escaping to return to the station to wait for his master. Well-done to all the cast for brilliant acting. I like Richard Gere, the way he acts, it's very natural.I recommend the film for family viewing and for all ages, especially for those who has a dog. Parental guidance is recommended as the film contains some intimate scene.Although the movie is a drama, there are also some funny scene, like, when Parker was teaching Hachi to fetch the ball, he looks stupid demonstrating it hoping that Hachi would understand what he wants him to do.Another one was the scene where in Michael threw the ball and asked Hachi to run and get the ball, but Parker told him he better go and fetch the ball because Hachi won't do it, and when he's about to get the ball he stumble.I am not sure if other viewers noticed the death premonition of Parker through Hachi. I heard a lot of stories from old people and some middle aged people, that sometimes they observed death premonition of one person's death, but they just realized it after the person died. The scene, where the day that Parker died it shows premonition through Hachi, he tried to keep Parker not to go to work by acting strange but since the first attempt didn't work Hachi still did his best by chasing Parker before he get into the train and it works, Parker was delighted to see him , he is surprised but pleased that Hachi is finally willing to play fetch with him. I think that day, Hachi knows or felt that something bad will happen to Parker and he's doing his best to keep Parker stay but unfortunately it didn't happen. I also read in one article, that some dogs can even feel if one person in the family have a serious health problem, those are the dogs who were very attached to the owner. I was also caught in the scene, wherein after Parker died Hachi was waiting outside the train station and the ticket seller approaches him and said "You don't have to wait anymore, he's not coming back". It is true that the painful goodbyes are the ones that are never said and never explained. I am just thinking, why is it after Dr.Parker dies and Hachi keeps returning to the train station, no one thought to adopt him or at least help him get over his grief? Even Parker's daughter lets Hachi leave and never bother to visit or check on Hachi again knowing that Hachi will only stay at one place, only outside train station waiting for Parker. And Parker's widow did nothing when she encountered Hachi at the train station 10 years later. I wished someone from the family realized Hachi's longing &amp; grieves for Parker. Why not any of the family thought the idea to build even a small house that may serve as Hachi's shelter in front of train station?After 10years the movie shows that the family has recovered from the death of Parker but poor Hachi until his last breath he's still waiting for his master. It was a great story about the loyalty of a dog to his master. Tragedy tests that loyalty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-watch movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tells the story of a family and its dog, Hachiko. It is altogether incredibly touching, and most families with dogs will be able to relate with the story. It has a very sad ending, which most people have been either told or have figured it out themselves. Before watching this, one should be prepared for a devastating ending. Go and buy tissues before pressing PLAY. This movie can be watched with the whole family, as it does not contain explicit sexual material, but parents should consider whether they want their children to be hit by this movie, as it may affect and impact kids in a way that not all parents would like. All in all, Hachiko is a moving, very beautiful story about family bonding with their pet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing story of true devotion. As someone who have dogs for many years and knows all the qualities they have, and how dogs should be treated, even though this movie has many realistic things and it's based on true story, there's some things that made me mad and hopefully people who watch this movie will not repeat the same mistakes the family (In this case, Wilson) made:First of all, even though the dog loved Parker, he still had family, but since they didn't give him much attention he was focused on Parker. It's one mistake the family did.Second, after Parker died, the family tried to take Hachi to his new home but he wanted to return to the train station, they shouldn't have let him do it. They had to re-train him with professional help and never let him stay there. I hope anyone who have/will have dogs will never act like the Wilson family did. They abandoned Hachi. They shouldn't have done it. This made me really mad and sad. Maybe if they were a good dog owners, this movie would never existed but Hachi would got a home.I hope dog owners that see this movie would understand better how NOT to treat your family dog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is 89 min long, and really it could be even another 20 minutes shorter. Very uneventful. Very simple. I guess this allows for focusing on emotional connections, but I must say , it is just a bit too slow for my taste.Still, the emotional value and high quality of this movie is undeniable.I always value good casting and this movie has done an excellent job! (Not that the actors are great, it is that they fit their roles very well! With Richard Gere being the absolute perfect choice for the leading role.)A movie that can not be forgotten.

But let me tell you that my big brother is 26 at that time, and he was crying even harder than me. He even sobs a lot. And the only time I have ever see him cry was when our Grandpa passed and when we were watching this movie. The moment we got out of the theater, we saw a lot of people with red eyes holding tissue and some even still trying to suppress their sobs. No one talked, no one excitedly chat about how awesome the movie is to each other because I really think that everyone already know and feel how awesome it is without them having to say a word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's hard to hate a cute doggy film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hachi: A Dog's Tale" is a remake of a Japanese film, "Hachi-Ko" (1987). Oddly, however, this American version keeps SOME of the original Japanese story (such as the breed of dog, the dog's name and SOME of the events in the dog's life) and completely changes so much--especially since "Hachi-Ko" is based on a real life Japanese occurrence, not in America. Back in the 1920s and 30s, the real Hachi was a dog owned by a Japanese professor. One thing that set him apart from most dogs was that Hachi would meet the professor at the train station after work each day! But, even more unusual is that after the professor's death, Hachi CONTINUED this routine--waiting patiently for his master every day! In many ways, the story is like that of the very famous Scottish dog, Greyfriars Bobby--who is memorialized in Edinburgh outside the pub and church where the do would do its daily ritual (lying at his master's grave and then visiting the pub). In fact, I did some reading and found several other similar accounts throughout the world. This leads me to wonder WHY the film did a semi-remake. Why not just make a fictionalized story? Why keep a few details and change others--especially when this Japanese dog inexplicably shows up in Rhode Island!So does this lack of attention to detail mean I hate the film? Even as a retired history teacher, I cannot, as I must confess that I've owned dogs for years and currently have two massive hairy beasts who adore me (in addition to my two cats who alternate between adoration and ambivalence). I am a sucker for a film about a cute dog--and the Hachi in the movie is one of the cutest Akita's ever (much cuter, by the way, than the original Hachi). You cannot help but like the dog and enjoy seeing him interact with his owner (Richard Gere). But, there needs to be more than a cute dog to make a really good film--and currently this fame has an astonishingly high score of 8.2! Is this number, at least in part, less about the quality of the production and more a vote to signify that most everyone loves cute dogs? Well, yes. Objectively speaking, the film is a remake--and that's one strike against it at the onset. And, I just cannot imagine a pleasant doggy film making it to the IMDb's Top 250 List--but it did and it's currently #190--giving it a slightly higher rating than films like "The Best Years of Our Lives" (one of the greatest films of the 1940s), "Rocky" (the first one was very nice), "A Fistful of Dollars" and "The Celebration"--as well as the original Japanese film!! Overall, it's a nice doggy film that is VERY family-friendly at that and with a lovely and evocative piano soundtrack. By all means watch it-- but don't be surprised if you like it but don't love it.A few final notes: First, I noticed that AFTER the master died in this American adaptation, it ALWAYS seemed to be snowing in this town--for years and years after the death! Second, what's with the professor's wife?! Her husband dies and she finds Hachi at the end years later at the train station and is surprised to see him?! Where was she at the time...off-world or taking a very long nap?! Didn't someone bother to tell her about HER dog or didn't she ask about how old Hachi was doing?! This seems to be a missing plot thread. Third, if you are curious, Hachi's actual remains were stuffed after his death and he is on display at National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo. And, there is a statue to him as well as annual celebrations in this country. How these people view an American film company 'appropriating' their story is something I would love to know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those few movies which anyone can relate to easily and end up crying in their handkerchief. I saw the movie on my television and i can never forget this one. hundreds of movie come and go .. some stay with you for a day and some stay with you for a month and some stay with you for a year or so. Movies like this stays with you forever.Anyone who has a heart will be able to relate to the movie. It doesn't requires one to have a dog in the house to like a movie like this. But in case you don't have a dog then you will feel like having one after watching this movie.In case you haven't watched this then go find a CD/DVD and do watch it.There's no way anyone will get disappointed after watching this one.My Rating 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my brother asked me to watch this movie and give me a little overview of the story, honestly I thought I would be bored if I'll give this a try...but man.. I was wrong! Until now I keep on thinking what made this film stood out. I did not cry, I almost wept! This movie is not the kind of film that will move you because of too many dramatic scenes (e.g characters crying a lot), it shows the reality of what normally all of us do everyday and how we relate to our pets. I appreciate how the story was presented, it's hard to tell a story about patience without it being boring at the same time making you feel how hard to wait. More importantly I wanted to praise the sounds that was used, the music itself conveys the story of undying love and devotion. All in all I just love the simplicity of the film that will not give you a doubt that this had happened before. Recommended not just to all pet lovers, but for those who wants to watch a story about faith and love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful (and true) story of loyalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, I had not seen "Hachi" until late last year. But after I saw the movie, I have seldom gone a day without thinking about the loyal dog. "Hachi" has a great cast in Richard Gere, Joan Allen, Jason Alexander, Erick Avari and others, but the real stars of the movie are three Akitas that play the role of Hachi. Chico and Layla play the younger adult Hachi while Forrest plays the older Hachi. And together with the two Shiba Inus that play the role of puppy Hachi, they really steal the show."Hachi" is based on a true story of one dog's loyalty towards his master. The dog is adopted when he was a puppy, by a professor who sees him wandering at a train station. As the dog grows up, he gets into the habit of seeing his master off at the train station every morning, and is back at the station in the evening waiting for the professor when he returns from work. After the master fails to come back on the train one evening, his dog shows up at the train station every evening, day after day, year after year, no matter what - whether it is hot or cold or rainy or snowing. Until finally, one evening, the master finally returns, in a manner of speaking, and takes his beloved dog Hachi with him on a special journey.One of the highlights of the movie is the superb background score by Jan Kaczmarek, who won the Oscar for his work in "Finding Neverland". In particular, the closing track, titled "Goodbye", is a masterpiece. The beautiful music certainly adds an extra dimension to the movie and heightens its impact on the viewer, and the tunes will linger in the mind long after the movie.While Chico and Leyla, the Akitas that play the younger Hachi are both very impressive, it is Forrest, playing the older Hachi with his melancholy eyes, slow walk and a once-gorgeous coat that has dulled with age, who really tugs at the heartstrings. My heart went out to the 10+ year old Hachi the first time he is seen in the movie. I found myself fervently wishing that something good will happen to him after so many years of waiting for his master! All credit to the actors and the director Lasse Hallstrom for bringing the true story of Hachiko from Japan to an American setting and making a memorable movie of it. I would unhesitatingly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and undoubtedly the best dog movie I have ever seen - even when I consider other beautiful dog movies like "Marley &amp; Me", "Red Dog" and "My Dog Skip".</fullReview>

Loyalty doesn't come along with everyone and most people lack such a good trait but a dog has shown me so much more than a lot of people.

		<shortDescription>A sweet and touching story of loyalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachiko, a Japanese Akita dog, is the hero of the film Hachi: A Dog's Tale directed by Lasse Hallstrom, yet he has no super powers, cannot talk and act like a human being, and doesn't even care to "fetch." He is just being a dog but he is a special breed, strong, independent, and wary of strangers, one that is noted for gentleness and affectionate loyalty with family members. The film, based on a true incident, was the subject of the 1987 Japanese film, Hachiko Monogatari in which Hachiko, born in 1923, was owned by Professor Hidesabur&#x14d; Ueno who lived near the Shibuya Train Station in a Tokyo suburb and commuted to work every day on the train.Hachik&#x14d; accompanied his master to and from the station each day and waited every evening at the station for him to return from work. Today a bronze statue of the Akita can be seen at the same station. The American version, which went straight to DVD after a showing at the Seattle Film Festival, stars Richard Gere as Parker Wilson and Joan Allen as his wife Cate, the caregivers who develop a long term loving relationship with the Akita they name Hachi after a Japanese symbol left on his collar. Parker, a music professor who commutes each day by train to the university, finds the pup (or he finds Parker) at a train station in a small town in Rhode Island after the dog breaks out of the shipping crate that was bringing him to the U.S. from a monastery in Japan.Parker is drawn to the adorable little pup but, knowing that his wife is opposed to having a pet, plans to give him away. He puts posters around the town and talks to the local pound but when the dog is not claimed, he convinces Cate to keep him. Parker's day consists of rehearsing his students in a ballet and giving lectures on different composers but he looks forward to stepping off the train each day at two minutes after five to be greeted by the friendly train conductor (Jason Alexander) and by Hachi who waits lovingly for his master.Wilson attempts to teach Hachi to retrieve a tennis ball in the yard but Hachi is not into it even though the professor sticks the ball in his own mouth and runs around the yard as he is observed by his wife and daughter, Andy (Sarah Roemer). As the years pass and Hachi becomes a fully grown Akita, he develops a friendship with the hot dog vendor Shabir (Erick Avari) at the train station and the librarian Mary Anne (Davenia McFadden), while he continues to wait day after day for his master to come off the train at the appointed hour.Hachi: A Dog's Tale can undoubtedly be classified as a tear-jerker but no classification is really needed. Though many will be in tears at the end, it is not through audience manipulation but through the ups and downs of a genuine relationship that sadly cannot go on forever. It is admittedly a rather slight story and perhaps one that is stretched to its limit to fill its hour and a half, but it is a sweet and touching story of loyalty that you may want to see many times. You might even give your dog a big hug or think about owning one if you don't already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I wasn't expecting too much from this movie when I first saw it. The start is pretty standard as it sets the scene and you are therefore caught unaware when the emotional tug of the film kicks in halfway through. I'm pretty pleased that I watched this film on my own one afternoon as I found myself crying more than in any other film I've ever seen. It was almost unbearably sad at times but in an uplifting kind of way. I challenge anyone who has a heart to watch it without feeling any tinge of sadness at all. The fact that a family orientated film has a rating of 8.1 on IMDb shows just how good it is. If you like animals though make sure you have a big box of tissues to hand as you will definitely need them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hachi is a movie based on the true story about a dog in Japan, Hachiko, who would wait at the train station every day for his owner to arrive even after the owner passed away. It is the story of bonding between the dog and its owner. The film is moving at slow pace following the events of ordinary life and has been kept extremely simple with minimum effort on the scenes. Hachi is found on train platform by a professor (Gere) when it was puppy and the professor wants to keep it with him. It is a faithful companion and friend to Owner, alerting him of potential dangers and accompanying him to the train station each morning and meeting him there after his return trip each evening. One day professor passed away, but Hachi comes every day to the station and waits for him to arrive.This film moves around Richard Gere and the dog. Richard Gere makes awesome performance, he bonds really well with the dog and it never feel like watching an actor at all it genuinely seems to be a movie with his own dog. His bonding with the dog is very authentic in its essence. This is a fantastic, feel good movie and recommendable to people of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Hachi invented loyalty?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi, I think it's around 4.37pm (just finished the movie)?it's been years, I close my heart and its emotion part for everyone. It's been three yr or more. I didn't heartily weep what I had or slipped or not even for favors. Nothing can break this locked door but I guess now it is unlocked a little for peek may be. Today I cried like baby, tried hours to hide from my room-partner but at last he came &amp; told me, "It's OK to watch hachi with wet eyes!" Cry ?not because of another fight or break up?any human effort but because of sense and gravity of loyalty."Loyalty does not need any compulsion but devotion". We are human, we are best breed or creation of God?But this word 'loyalty' usually we didn't get from humans. I got it from "Hachi A Dog's Story" is really heart touching, ice-breaking and in real means of loyalty. I really salute Hachi because of Hachi now I also want a dog like Hachi but it's great if didn't get but if I get that's means it's a miracle. I don't know that much loyalty came from his heredity or what. Nine years' of waiting what kind of love is that? Even a smart dog can tell that no one will come after waiting 24-48hr. Don't you think that he was dumb?? No, he is more than that.I also tried long distance relationship so I kind of knew that keep waiting and waiting without any response in real. It looks like dumb specially when you are not there to feel or ever felt it before?but this waiting part is became hard, harder and hardest with long due process of time. Some left broke but unique one died not because they were miserable but one of strongest one who can stop killing himself and make it own allies to remember its love for one who they really loved or still loving or catch a sense of love with dark-bright faces.The golden question of life is-" where is the Challenge?"If I apply Golden question of mine here ?Where is the challenge?To leave and go to next owner even she's a daughter of his real owner or to wait him after his death even if I knew that my owner will not even he wants to. I don't think so that much Hachi can think. He just knows my life is around, from and by Master and he is still waiting for life to catch with his master like the way we spent our time in past time.At last he caught up, surely with his master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Beautiful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really want to break down this film into its specifics, cuz it's such a beautiful story and it really hit me and got me down to tears when I was young, and I think that's what you need to know. The film really captures the quirks and character of Hachiko, and takes you through his whole life, and it's so beautiful and emotional, I don't think you can get through this one without at least shedding a few tears, and for that, I think this film gets a full on 5 stars, even though it's not a perfect film if you'd go into the specifics. The only issues one might have with this film is the human aspect, because you aren't really too bothered with that, but it didn't and still doesn't take away from the film for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Multiple Watchers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know the original Japanese film on which this is based, but of course I do know the real life story.I watched this with 3 and ten year olds, and watched them squirm with the slow, very slow pacing. I found it not very nourishing myself, and am surprised that it is in the top 200 on IMDb. But it is well made and one element struck me as interesting.The challenge in telling the story is that the basic elements are not cinematic: a dog is loyal after death, standing by the railway station waiting for his master. There are some incidental family and professional qualities that slightly bear on the story. To bring the story to a cinematic vocabulary, you need to introduce a host of on screen watchers. We have all manner of watchers here: the railway station has three: the stationmaster, a street food vendor and a nearby bookseller. This forms the first tier. We have a Japanese professor friend who is more informed and wise, who watches from afar.But then we have all sorts of novel embellishments on the watching theme. Our main guy is a professor of art, someone who pre-watches performances and whose death is watched by students. His wife is engaged in the restoration of a watching venue, with the further embellishment of revealing lost watchers of the watchers (murals in a theater). And then we have the rather odd POV segments from the dog, designating him as a watcher.The narrative drive here is weak, I think. But the narrative construction is amazingly well considered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies i've seen, the bond between Gere and the dog is excellent. Joan Allen is also great, she not thrilled to have a dog but you can see that she actually loves the dog very much. The first time i saw this movie i cried the whole time after Gere dies and I'm not really a crier type of guy. You really get in touch with your emotions and appreciate what you've got after seeing this movie. We also have a dog really similar to Hachi and we always see Hachi in him. When the dog dies in the end i cried my eyes out, the devotion and the commitment the dog shows to Gere is the most beautiful i've ever seen. So to sum up this is really a fantastic movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How I Tried to Resist this film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I reckon that Hachi: A Dog's Tale has been shown on one of the Sky Movies channels graveyard slot almost every day, for months now. Hmmm. Another shaggy dog story, no thanks.Radio Times online has a photo of a young boy with a puppy to go with it. Doubly no thankyou! So, I resisted even longer. Then I noticed the director was none other than Lasse Hallstrom, who not everybody knows, made as one of his earliest films in his native Sweden, 'My Life as a Dog', back in 1985.That being quite a favourite of mine, I then recorded Hachi. But, My Life is a Dog it isn't and is very different and much more 'normal' and grown up and sober. For much of it though I still found myself sceptical; instead of my worst fears of having a small boy playing with his puppy, we have a fifty-odd year old man playing with his dog. All very cute and life-assuring but hardly high drama.Of course, this is a family drama and one that is obviously loved and so I adjusted my perceptions and then, enjoyed it. It benefits from a good cast - Richard Gere and Joan Allen as his wife and being filmed in the old school tradition - simply, slowly, beautifully. The simple piano-led music is evocative, emotive and fitting - and universal.Hachi is a touching tale that certainly brought a lump to my Tarantino- hardened throat and certainly made me think and ponder.

If one ever wants to know what love really is, then one should watch the movie and see for oneself through the heart of Hachiko.We assume humans as the most intelligent species but watch for yourselves, isn't there an abundance of intelligence portrayed by the dogs which played the character of Hachiko? If so, then what can one say about the real Hachiko? A very special being indeed. Thank you Hachiko for proving that love, does exist!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare Breed for Sure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In times of high concept, big explosions, multi million dollar extravaganzas, Hachi is a rare breed. He's not a flying dog. He's not a talking dog, either, let alone a computer generated mutt. Hachi is a living, breathing Japanese Akita who - as a puppy (cute as a button which he continues to be even when he gets older) - stumbles upon music professor Gere who gets smitten with him and takes him under his wings. For the next ten years, the faithful four-legged friend returns to the place of their first encounter - the local train station. The reason why and to what consequences is subject of this simple but moving story, straightforwardly told by director Hallström without frills or audience manipulation. Based upon the Japanese film "Hachiko monogatari" about true events that took place in the early 1920s. A bronze statue of the dog can be found at Shibuya Station in Tokyo. Strangely enough, the film was never released theatrically in the U.S.. It premiered on the Hallmark Channel, instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hachi is a very very standard movie. For the whole family. For Richard Gere fan. For dog lovers. For very young people. It's a flat story with a direction devoid of panache. If you are looking for free emotions and want to switch off the brain, HACHI is your movie. Really, i couldn't find anything special in this movie. Sure, there are no blooper in this movie, a good cast and the right screenplay, but it's not enough to make of HACHI a great movie. Morover, this is a remake of the Japan movie "HACHIKO MONOGATARI" (1987): another Holloywood version of a beautiful foreign movie. It's better to see the original. This will be forgotten in a few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm pretty aware that movies involving relationships between men and animals tend to be sad and depressing. Even thought, I decided it was a good idea watching this movie. And it was. First minutes are reasonably predictable, since we all know that, in the end, the family would adopt the little dog anyways. It is nice the way Gere's character became friends with the little animal, and it was beautiful to see their activities together-- specially when Mr. Wilson tries to teach him how to catch a ball or any object. In a moment I couldn't imagine how the movie could become sad if the dog didn't die, but some scenes after I found it could be worse than that-- I'm not spoiling on that. Photography direction is beautiful, and so are acting and story. I won't deny I almost cried in the last minutes, given that the ending is completely hopeless, but makes it become a strong movie involving emotions and feelings. Worth watching, of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes the less said the better.Hachi: A Dog's Tale is simply a beautiful film for everyone and anyone who has a heart and believes in true love. Watching my own Aussie grow old over the last ten years, I couldn't help but well-up with emotion watching the final scenes of Hachi.What's most special about this film is that the story is based on the real life Hachiko who lived in Japan in the 1920s. Here the story is fictionalized by having Richard Gere play a college music professor living in the town of Bedridge, circa 1995. Arriving home at the train station one evening he meets a stray Akita puppy and, unable to get anyone to care for him, takes him home. His wife, effectively played by Joan Allen, is initially reluctant to take in a pet, but after seeing how much joy he brings to her husband, gives in, and the love story between man and dog begins to unfold.Make every effort to see this wonderful, heartfelt film on cable or by renting a DVD, if available.</fullReview>

The musical score is also very good and appropriate at the most important scenes in the movie. This also let me see the movie through Hachiko's eyes - which really invoked more and more emotion and then totally broke my heart. I would recommend this to dog lovers everywhere. With this movie, you are going to appreciate and see how a dog shows unconditional and undying love for his master/friend. After I watched this, I promised myself that if ever I'll be going to Japan, I'll definitely go to Shibuya station and spend some time beside Hachiko's statue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best animal movie of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even as one of the few movies where an animal is the main character, this one is special. It's about a relation between a man and a dog like no other, and gives a new meaning to the phrase "Man's best friend.".Based on a story of a real dog Hachi that waited for his deceased master for 9 years in Tokyo's Shibuya station, Hachi is a moving story about dog's loyalty that transcends animal - human barrier. Nowhere in the world has a story of this likes has been reported, and in his native Japan, Hachi is still the symbol of how families should be faithful to one another. This is no ordinary animal's movie as the animal not only gets the top billing, but gets it above a Hollywood A list actor Richard Gere. Although the movie's setting is transplanted to a town in Rhode Island, the story is essentially the same as that of the original Hachi. Richard Gere makes his second appearance on a Japan themed movie, first being "Shall we Dance ?", as the University professor.For the real dog Hachi, a bronze statue of him was erected in 1948 at Shibuya station in front of an exit that now bears his name "Shibuya eki Hachi ko guchi" (Shibuya Station Hachi Ko Exit), and is a popular landmark for people to use as a meeting place.This certainly is one of the best movie Richard Gere starred in, and also one of the best animal movie of all times. It will move you in a way no other movie would, and is highly recommended for viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hachiko: A Dog's Story is a true story about an owner of a Japanese Akita dog famous in Japan for being loyal and faithful. Now, the story is shared all over the world. A college professor (Richard Gere) takes in an abandoned dog, Hachi, and they form an unbreakable bond. After the professor dies while away from home, the dog keeps vigil waiting for his master hoping that one day, he will return.Hachiko: A Dog's Story is one of the best movies I have seen so far in 2010. The plot and story is so moving and heart-warming and sends a positive, strong message about loyalty and friendship. There is no faults where the acting is concerned and Richard Gere gives out a terrific performance as Hachiko's master. Hachiko is directed superbly and the timing for the movie is marvellous, the movie didn't feel long or short and the ending was brilliant. The music added so much emotion to the scenes filmed even though the movie was emotional enough without it. The only fault I have with the movie is the characters. While the characters are lovable, you didn't know enough about them which made them a little underused. However, that could have been intentional to show the audience the loyalty and love between Hachiko and his master.I would recommend this to everybody as this one will tug your heartstrings and make you cry. This is one movie no-one should miss, this isn't your normal dog story, this is one story you won't forget in a hurry.Read more reviews on: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you first watch the film , your instinct maybe that it will be another story about a dog, that wont get anywhere, this film is far beyond that from the moment it started the film i was hooked, didn't take my eyes of the screen, didn't get distracted by anything else, i love this film so much because we look after an Akita a lot an the temperament the behavior is just the same as Hachiko, the Akita we look after a lot never played fetch, looked very lazy an had a face you fell in love with, Most of you will realize that there isn't much dialog in the film but don't let you put you of as the emotion, the body language a simple face expression says more then a 1000 words.Richard's performance was amazing he should the audience everything he was feeling, thinking without having to say much thats a great actor, the way the music played the soft piano music in between dialog set the scene and he mood though out the film perfectly.At the end of the film i couldn't help cry because of the fact the dog missed Richard after he past away and still waited for him after 10 years of his death for his owner, so loyal yet so sad because you can no Tell a dog that he owner has passed away and he will not understand, the relationship between man an dog is so beautiful i this film it makes you understand by the bond between man and dog are so strong even in today society with so much technology.I couldn't stop cry because all i could think of was poor Hachiko and then i got me thinking with me and my soul mate how it would be ideal to be with your soul mate for eternity as i'm sure the dog would have wanted with his owner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family film is a bit underfed...still a worthy heart-tugger for animal lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Akita Inu puppy, transplanted from a Japanese monastery to a picturesque town in Rhode Island, becomes lost at the train station but is soon adopted into the home of a music professor and his wife. Low-keyed American remake of a 1987 Japanese film, "The Tale of Hachiko", itself based upon a true story, has sweet and lovely passages, though overall content is lacking. Family-friendly movies about the bond between humans and animals nearly always work if the casting is right; here, the canine who portrays the older Hachi is a gorgeous, expressive creature--so how could the filmmakers miss? Co-produced by its star, Richard Gere, and directed by Lasse Hallström, the film touches on universal emotions when it comes to our beloved pets, but the human interaction (disconcertingly subdued throughout) is under-nourished. Playing Gere's wife, Joan Allen is unable to find a character in the writing; and when the dog is moved around in the film's latter stages, Allen's actions (and her subsequent disappearance) are puzzling. Gere doesn't really have a character to portray either, but he's appealing and unhurried in his scenes with the dog, projecting a warmly lackadaisical presence. Hallström, minus his barbed sense of human dynamics, must have helmed this project as a lark. He indeed guides the narrative with an assured, steady hand, but "Hachi" is far too subdued overall to make a big impact. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

It showed all the time how the dog went to wait for Parker, but it showed that for too long, i think.But apart from that, the film was very good, and I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone. It is not boring, which attracts both adults and children, however it is not childish and has no unsuitable what so ever. Very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty entertaining experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It will be more efficient to talk about Hachiko: A Dog's Story dividing it on two different aspects: on the one hand, the intention and the message of the story it tells; and on the other hand, its attributes as a cinematographic work.That is because, even more than with any other movie, I am afraid of losing any objectivity thanks to the combination of a canine theme and my obvious predilection for dogs.The story from Hachiko: A Dog's Story is based on a true event (which was previously adapted to the screen in a Japanese movie from 1987 I have not seen), something which makes it more touching.The main reason I liked this film pretty much is because I saw many attitudes and virtues in the dog from this movie I have admired in my experiences with animals during my life.And sure, even though Hachiko: A Dog's Story will be better received by those who love dogs, I think it is impossible for it not to take a few tears even on casual spectators who do not have a particular affection for the canine species.Or even in those who prefer cats (I am not judging them).And besides, the movie is very entertaining, even though there are some redundant scenes which do not add too much to what we already know.Another fail is that some details from the screenplay feel a bit forced.For the rest, I liked Richard Gere's performance, Lasse Hallström's direction and, most of all, the screenplay, because it never betrays the characters and it does not explode the sadness from the story with cheap sentimentalism, since instead of that, it shows a sober and honest portrait of the level a relationship between a dog and its owner can get, something which will not surprise anyone who experimented genuine connection with a pet.In summary, I enjoyed Hachiko's: A Dog Story pretty much, and because of that, I recommend it with confidence.</fullReview>

And I would hate to think that the real owners of Hachiko treated him with such disregard. But what shines through even in this shallow version,, is that a house, and all of our possessions are nothing compared to love, loyalty, and friendship of a beautiful dog like Hachiko. Too bad they didn't go for something with more substance. I would someone would do this story justice. Never was there a better dog story than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i am writing review no 132 for a movie,then it clearly suggests i would not have much to say.But still,despite the repeated calls,my heart disobeys my mind and here i am scribbling something about a movie which is beyond the realms of any accolade or criticism.That's what this movie embodies.It is the call of the heart over the mind.It's an eternal classic which goes on in your mind forever.The greatness of the movie lies not just in the fact that it struck a hitherto concealed chord in your heart but in the fact that it will continue to do so even if you watch this movie again and again.It's as pristine as the first ray of sunshine after a long thunderstorm,as melancholic as "The Autumn of the Middle Ages" by Huizinga.It grows on you like a vintage single malt.It's prose lies not in the words but in the expression.It's as beautiful as Dante's Divine Comedy,and as long and enthralling like "The Mahabharata".I would just like to say that if human emotions were a artist then Hachiko would be the oeuvre of that artist.I would not tell you the story as many people have done that but i would just tell how this movie changed me as a person and what this change means to me.There's a concept called "Interspecie Altruism" which even Darwin failed to explain.Now i know why...this movie was god's way of telling us what loving someone truly is all about.To say that i was sobbing by the end of the movie is just as understatement.I should say i was weeping heavily and i can say with firm conviction that anybody who has even an iota of a lovable heart will be deeply moved by this wonderful movie.It made me understand myself better as a human.The essence of Hachiko lies not in being lovely in looks but lovely in heart..and indeed he is.Now if i can say that a dog was more adorable than Richard Gere then you can just imagine what it would have been.His wait for his master is not only epic but the slow pace of that wait signifies a much deeper feeling.The feeling of solitude.When one loses someone in life,life seems so be eating us,leaving us crippled.Anyone who has lost his or her loved one will be very familiar with what i am saying.We usually see pain of a human of that sense of loneliness which overwhelms us.This movie gave us an insight into that sense for a Dog and it was more than i could take.It's a movie which cuts across all genders,class,age and appeals to everyone.It's a bonding shared by everyone who has been loved and who has loved anyone truly.I am truly amazed that how this movie has not been released in USA.In this age of vulgar comedy,bloodbath combats,this movies comes across as a lesson for all of us that you can make a truly timeless movie with the bare minimum one has.Finally a word for the bonding between Richard Gere and Hachiko...the subtle expressions which this movie shows can truly be comprehended by those who have had a pet.It's too real to be taken as just acting.I saw some reviews here which criticized the movie.As i have earlier stated that this movie is beyond any criticism but still i would like to say something to those who disliked this movie.All your points like the movie being slow,too predictable,loose and boring stand irrelevant when we try to get hold of the central message of this movie.It was never intended to be technically perfect or poignantly sharp and witty.It was intended to just make everyone of us realize our most basic emotion-Love. If you have ever loved anyone,human or animal,you have to love this movie.In an era when one can like and even recommend craps like "American Pie" and "Euro trip" then i find it hard,almost impossible, to comprehend how one can even dislike this movie.Richard Gere has effortlessly produced a gem of a movie for humanity and has brought us closer to the universal truth of love and peace.If a dog can teach us what love is,we can definitely spread the message.To rate this movie is merely a futile exercise as i truly believe that masterpieces like this are beyond any judgement or analysis.It's simply the most touching movie i ever saw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it suffers from being overly sentimental &amp; comes off as emotionally manipulative on few occasions, Hachi: A Dog's Tale still qualifies as an affectionately crafted tearjerker that has a lot of warmth, cuteness &amp; heart but purely from a story perspective, all it tries to do is to force its viewers to fall in love with its premise by using their sensitivity when it comes to a cute dog as its strength &amp; eventually succeeds.Based on a true story of the now legendary Japanese dog named Hachik&#x14d; &amp; his well-known loyalty to his master, Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the Americanised version of the same story &amp; concerns an abandoned dog who is found at a train station by a local professor; who takes him home &amp; eventually adopts him. The story covers their budding relationship and Hachi's faithfulness &amp; endless wait for his master when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Nicely directed, finely photographed &amp; evocatively scored, the film doesn't have much to offer other than the adventures of our titular character which probably is enough to make most of its viewers go "aww" at every moment &amp; forget about every other shortcoming the film has. There are moments when you genuinely feel for what's portrayed in the film but then there are also moments when it feels like the film is trying too hard to make us react in a certain manner.The dog in itself is given a special treatment as if it's some extraordinarily-gifted pet possessing an ideal personality &amp; is shown as a mystifying character who never really does what other members of its species generally do. I'm not denying that Hachik&#x14d; never happened but I'm not really sold by its portrayal in this film at least. Also chipping useful contribution to the film is Richard Gere as the professor who found Hachi and his bonding with the dog is the core element that drives this film.To be honest, I'm not really surprised by the positive reception this movie has received ever since its release. After all, who doesn't love dogs? Well, I don't... not since the one that bit me when I was a kid although that crazy son of a bitch died a few days later so that cheered me up back then. Anyway, on an overall scale, Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a heartwarming &amp; heartbreaking story of faith, devotion &amp; undying love that guarantees a lot of tears to its sensitive audience &amp; successfully delivers it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real tear jerker from a simple premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a real dog, Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) is a music professor. One night, he finds a stray puppy at the train station. Despite his wife (Joan Allen)'s objections, they take him in and name him Hachi. The dog loyally waits for Parker every day at the train station even when Parker passes away and the family has to move away. He becomes a staple at the station.It's the thinnest of premise. Based on a Japanese film based on a real dog in Japan, it takes that premise to its simple tear jerker conclusion. Dog lovers will love this movie. The story is very simple done with a very light touch. Nevertheless the movie is very effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull characters, but the dog is darn cute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true story of Hachiko might be very touching, but how can you translate it to the screen? It's a dog waiting for his dead owner to come back while sitting in the same spot for years, how do you make that visually interesting? Director Lasse Halstrom partially solves this problem by having Richard Gere die very late into this movie, a bit too late perhaps. The whole family is just so bland, what do we get to know about these people throughout the movie? They're happy. That's pretty much the character development. There are only so many scenes about Richard Gere playing with a dog you can stomach without wondering when something's going to happen. The last half hour of this movie manages to save a lot though. Seeing Hachi interact with all of his owner's old friends who can't convince him he will never be back, watching him badly age while everyone around him knows he's wasting his time, it's all very strong because the build-up does work to some extent. It's kinda boring, but we do feel like we get to know Hachi well and that makes it all the more sad when we see him suffer. Everything that concerned Hachi I loved, the rest I can sorta do without.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this film shall definitely bring tears to your eyes as you see it.This is certainly a tale of friendship, devotion and love enduring.While this is a true story, what's wrong here? We are taught that prolonged grieving is not good. That doesn't mean that we stop thinking, loving or caring about the departed person; it just can't be forever. Remember, we are told that life must go on.I've never seen Joan Allen go from being an anti-dog person to one who came to realize what Hachi meant to Richard Gere.Gere's sudden death in the film at such a young age is shocking to say the least. Imagine the emotional outburst of the class he was lecturing to when this happened.It is quite predictable how this film will end. To me, that was no surprise at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I use Hachi: A Dog's Tale as a litmus test for screening out psychopaths in my social circle. After all, what kind of heartless cynic pans a dog movie? And some people have the gall to dump all over this. For shame...Hachi is not without its disappointments, however: I kept holding my breath for the "there's nothing' in the rules that says a dog can't play baseball" moment that never transpired. I also found myself questioning Hachi's loyalty for a few brief moments. A famine or, perhaps, a devastating pyroclastic flow enveloping all in its path could have convinced me of his loyalty, but the director removed these scenes from the final cut for some reason.The dog wasn't credited at the end of the film. Which can only mean that Hachi was likely portrayed by ten different dogs that each knew one or two tricks. That really took me out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like dogs (maybe cats a little more).I like Richard Gere. He's talented, he's kind, he sort of deserves a bit more attention.But I just see this films popularity only boosted by dog-lovers.Mostly this film is just nothing but transference - mostly predictable. Depressing and predictable in a lot of ways.I don't really care either if it's based on a true story that happened in Japan - I live in Japan, and I just despise all the false occultist practices done every where, here and there.I thought I liked this movie, first time around - but upon second-viewing, I can find no real point to it.Want a better Man-Dog related movie?? Watch either "Iron Will", "Air Bud", "Beethoven" or "101 Dalmatians." And want a better, uplifting, feel-good movie with actual good messages to it?? See either "Groundhog Day" (with bill murray) or "The Encounter" (with bruce marchiano).5/10</fullReview>

Ms Allen has the unique talent &amp; skill (as very few actors do), that after 5 minutes into the film, you don't see her as Joan Allen, but as the character she playsMr Gere has those expressions where no words are required, that occasional simple head nod, or that gesture continues to be one of his hallmarks.Excellent all the way around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having been a dog owner throughout my life I know first hand what pure, unadulterated love feels like. I had heard of this film, knew the story, and was hoping for a film about a dog and their owner that wasn't trite, sappy, overly sentimental. This film exceeded beyond all expectations. Richard Gere's performance is spot on. The relationship is deep and honest. It is 180 degrees in the opposite direction of all other animal/dog pics. The POV of the human world by the dog in black &amp; white (dogs are color-blind, BTW) only heightens the finale. If you are not crying by the end of this film, check your pulse. You are dead. RIP. Great film - for all people, not just dog owners.</fullReview>

Died in the same spot waiting, make sure you have your tissues at the ready. Well worth watching Based on a true story of a dog in 1934 There is a bronze statue of Haichi outside the station he waited for his owner to come back. So sweet!!! Richard Gere is the main character in the film (not for long enough I say) but main star of the show is the dog. A real tear jerker. The dog is most cutest Japenese Husky ever. I would watch this over and over again just to see his little face waiting for him.</fullReview>

Knowing this is not a spoiler it just makes it even more impacting when completely engrossed in this film! Richard Gere is superb as always and helps build a relationship with the character and story, other familiar faces too gives it a quality feel with believable characters.

		<shortDescription>Review for 'Hachiko: A Dog's Story'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachi: A Dog's Tale, had extraordinary potential to be a great film. The film starts of with Parker Wilson taking in a young Akita puppy. At this point in the movie, the gentle playful music, coupled with Gere's performance was well done, and I though that the movie would go on from there. Realistically however, there wasn't much plot to go on from this point.Hachi: A Dog's Tale is definitely worth a watch, I'm sure that many people would enjoy this movie, however I found the pace a little slow. The plot is good - however as a film, its quite limited. This movie does however have a very good ending (magnificently done) and it does have its moments in which the audience was captured.I would actually like to see a Japanese, Asian produced movie of this, as in the original, it worked well. The background, Tokyo, would also add a nice touch to this film. The highlights of this film include the interaction between Hachi and his owner, Parker. Overall, this film wasn't bad, but it wasn't excellent either, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a Hollywood remake that certainly does not disappoint. It's a story that will go to every dog lover's heart - and everyone else's!I don't think I've cried so much during any other movie - ever.The film is, of course, based on a true story, which happened in the 1920s in Japan. The great thing about this movie is that Lasse Hallström resisted the temptation to make it "more exciting" by adding hard-to-believe scenes. The whole film thus comes across as very believable, and one gets the feeling that the bond between Hachi and his master is absolutely real. Richard Gere does a fine job there indeed.For me, he is in fact one of those actors that are like expensive wine: They're getting better with age. I was never very fond of him in the 90s, but his performances in "Hachi" or "Shall We Dance", for instance, I find outstanding and extremely believable.But anyone watching this film is advised to keep a box of tissues handy, as I cannot think of anyone who would not need them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable tale of undying devotion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachi: A Dog's Tale never got a US release, which is quite sad. This is a very heartwarming movie, that is VERY mature, despite it's G rating. There is no language, violence, sex, or drug content in this film. Just pure, raw, emotion.Hachi is loosely based on a true story. A professor in Japan in the 1920s discovered a Akita puppy at his local train station, and adopted him. One day, the man had a heart attack at work and died. The dog, named Hachiko never figured this out, and waited for his master to return every day for 10 years.Replace Japan with northern Maine, the 1920s with the 1990s, and add Richard Gere, and you have Hachi.Prof. Parker Wilson (Gere) discovers an Akita puppy at his local train station, and adopts him. His wife Cate, is not exactly keen to the idea of having a dog, but Parker's daughter falls madly in love with this sweet puppy. Through learning more about Akitas through his Japanese friend (Akitas are a Japanese dog breed), Parker and Hachi form a wonderful bond. Then, unexpectedly, Parker, a music professor, has a heart attack while he's teaching, and dies. Hachi never figures this out, and, so every day for 10 years, Hachi makes the trek to the local train station to wait for his master, who he believes will one day return. This is a WONDERFUL movie that is quite sad. As I stated earlier, this is not exactly something to show to younger kids, despite it's G rating. I am 16, and I bawled my eyes out. This movie is a MUST for any dog lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film. Yes, it is rated G, but it is a G with a lot of substance. If you have ever had a dog before, and know what it is to have love for a dog, it will certainly bring back memories, and thoughts, as it did for me. It is a bit of a tear jerker, I almost had tears, and my girl friend certainly did. Other people elsewhere have written how they were very moved. I could not understand how someone seeing this film would not be moved.The film I believe did not have much of a release in the US, and appears to me now to be discovered on DVD in the US, appearing to have had more of a release in England and Japan, am I wrong? Had the film been widely seen, I believe that lot of people would probably want to be visiting the locations of the film in Road Island. The photography of the film is really first rate. Their are wonderful performances, Richard Gere is very believable as a dance and music teacher, and it is real nice to see Cary Togawa in a film (a very much underused talent I think, I remember seeing him in a film with Ali McGraw that took place in Thailand, and how his performance really made what would have been a dismal film more interesting). A must see film.My second review is not about the film, but about some of the critical paid reviewers who have slammed this movie. They appear to be primarily from Great Britain, and I don't mean to insult the British, as many of the readers of these reviews in Britain have slammed the Critics who just have to hate this movie. I thought I was cynical, but at least I have some heart, what do some of these reviewers have. They just can't believe that Richard Gere could do this film, but for goodness sakes, he is an actor. See the film first, and then go read the reviews that you can find from some of these "so called movie experts", either hear at IMDb, or at Mrqe.com, simpily amazing.Finally I do have a quibble with the film. The film for me somewhat gets hurt when you realize that this film is really not the true story. The real story, as the film in the end lets us know, took place in Japan from 1923 to 1934, not in the recent years in the US. Kaneto Shindo, the screenwriter and director of that version made in 1987 is credited in this film. We in the US, have not had access to that film. Perhaps the Gere produced film will be shown to be the superior film, perhaps not. I have never known a film to be made, which is based on something that did happen, but has been moved to a different locale. Some who have seen the original Japanese film have had some criticism, preferring the Japanese version. I believe it was the trailer for the film, that said it was based on a true story, but never have I known to have a film based on a true story to have its locale changed. Gere's produced film somewhat become disingenuous. While I have been moved by the film I have just seen, I am also bothered because of what I know. I wonder what they have thought in Japan.Perhaps Gere's produced will spark interest in people to see the Shindo 87 film, and get a wider release outside of Japan. Had the film made in 87 been released in the US earlier, would the Gere's film have been made? I would suggest that it would not have been. I wonder how well this film, so much loved by people now, will be viewed in the future. I have difficulties in expressing my disappointment in what the producers of Gere's film did, perhaps anyone who reads my thoughts here will understand my feelings, and have some similar disappointment. I guess one could say, I have seen a wonderful film with Richard Gere, yet feel somewhat like I have been had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the American made movie was well done, with very well trained dogs, I feel that the original 1987 Japanese Film was more realistic and even sadder, especially the last third of the movie.Contains Spoiler: At the very end it shows Hachiko laying dead in the snow for about 3 minutes. The stark bleakness of the scene really summarizes the heart breaking story of Hachiko's lifelong enduring love for his master very well.And, perhaps being made in Japan where the real events happened serves to making the 1987 movie seem more like a documentary rather than a Hollywood production. There is a short version of the 1987 movie "Hachiko Monogatari" on you tube to compare for yourself.its easy to locate.</fullReview>

I'm not a dog movie fan; actually I can't even say I'm a dog lover either. Yes I like them, and when friends visit with their dogs, I have no problems, but not enough to own one myself.

		<fullReview>Hachi: A Dog's Tale seems to be no different then any other animal- slash-pet film made to target children and families. It is a sweet tale, but not as grand as it has been led to believe. It's a pretty generic story, much like Marley &amp; Me, but for any animal lover, this film may be closer to your heart then for people that aren't so close with nature.Hachi is a cute looking dog, but the film is the same, cute, but nothing stunning. It may be the case that this film feels pretty unrealistic in a sense, or that the actions that take place are dumbed down for a younger audience, but this film is pretty average, but enjoyable nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This moving tale is based on the real-life story of Hachiko (aka Hachi), one of the Akita Inu breed. It really shows how much dogs are our friends... they are loyal even well after our death! Loyal forever and ever. This loyalty captures your attention and melts your heart.To find a good movie nowadays is not an easy duty, including animal movies. Well, this is a good doggy movie and one which brings back some of the formula that stopped being used long ago but was once so common, even though it's not in the same league as the greats from the past.Richard Gere leaves his leading gentleman roles and image behind and goes ahead with a far more serious and dramatic role as a professor who finds an abandoned dog and, after finding no one who wants to keep it, keeps it for himself. The two become best friends in no time. One day the professor unexpectedly passes away and that's when the pivotal part of the dog's loyalty comes up. It touches those who appreciate dogs and this genre of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think Richard Gere is a bad actor, not at all...but it's too evident that he is one of the producers of this movie. The first half hour is TOO long. We all know he's going to keep the dog, I don't feel remotely related with him and/or his family. I want to see Hachi's life (without the creepy shots of him looking at the bedroom). I also think there's maybe too much music, although it's a good one. The bottom line is I think it should have been shorter and keep the humans for specific moments. The reunion of Joan Allen's character with Hachi is one of the greatest moment of the movies. And what about the ending? It's TOO Disney for me. I want to embrace the sadness of the real life story. I want to keep that with me, not thinking there's another hachi there. There was just one and that made him special. I really would like to see the original movie, I bet the famous faces are less distracting and they focus on the story and in producing emotions, not putting them all out there for the ones who have a hard time understanding the subtlety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8.2!! Are you serious?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly a nice and moving film as it is hard to go wrong with such a heart wrenching story like the one it is loosely based upon. Unfortunately the film is not elevated in any way, feeling somewhat forced and implausible. Being executed as predictably as possible as well as unable to shake off an aura of artificiality and hollywoodization for placing the story in the suburban United States instead of Japan does not help.If you wish to see a better American film about a dog which is more entertaining, fun and far less predictable you should see the underrated "Marley &amp; Me".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not because you care about animals and find dogs cute that any movie about a cute dog and his sad fate makes it automatically a good movie. Because that is why this film is scoring so high on IMDb. Director Lasse Hallström was probably eager take make a film where he could jerk the tears out of people. I just couldn't help feeling constantly manipulated and pushed around by the slimy piano music and the forced script and acting. I was thinking before I saw this film: how can they make people care so much for a dog it would make them cry and there really is only one way, the easy way which they took here (No spoilers but futurama episode 1 has a 1 min dog-sequence which this film ripped off which works so much better then Hachi). I have to say the dog is cute -although I'm more a cat person- and he does look sooo very sad at times in this film you can't help but feel sorry for the poor animal, but this is the manipulative effect this film has on people and Lasse knows and uses it so well. The dog trainers did a good job, kudos there but you do sometimes notice the dog is looking at something (the dog trainer) out of frame who is directing the dog to do certain things. The cinematographer also scores some bad points: this film was filmed digitally on a Genesis camera, but the picture has a very video/TV-like look which reinforces the feeling this is simply a low budget TV movie and not the cinematic masterpiece a lot of people seem to think it is. I know people who loved this movie won't understand and think me unempathetic for saying all this, but I love films and sometimes you need to dare point out the bad as well. It's like when a bad actor dies. Nobody dare say he sucked coz emotions have the upper hand but he was a bad actor all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a touching movie with flaws. (i cried for hours :'()</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1987 Japanese film Hachiko Monogatari, as well as on a true story, Hachi: A Dog's Tale stars Richard Gere as a college professor who finds an abandoned dog and takes the poor lost animal in. The film follows the two as the man and animal soon form a strong and unexplainable bond. Joan Allen co-stars in the Inferno Entertainment production.i wish to have given it a much higher rating, it really touched my heart and brought tears into my eyes. but lets be real honest the movie as i feared and felt during the movie that it wasn't that good.this is such a heartwarming story of this dog showing us how much of a attachment a pet can have with us. it is very emotional and sad story. screenplay has some blank or empty patches which is why the movie overall is not that good. good cinematography and art direction. Direction of this movie could have been better. it is directed by Lasse Hallström.it stars Richard Gere, Joan Allen, Sarah Roemer, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Erick Avari , Jason Alexander, not great but nice performances. but my favorite character was Hachi of course.background score is good. i loved this dog in it. i was crying so much towards the end, its heartbreaking to see Hachi waiting in that exact same spot for his owner everyday even when he is gone. i was touched by this bond between them too. its sad, touching and true story that you will like watching even this movie has some flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should never have been a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time I am going to disagree with IMDb's ratings.Hachi should never have been made into a film. My main reason being that a dog and its master's relationship is not something that can be completely explained, analyzed or documented. I don't know the details of the true story, but I'm pretty sure not many people do - as it happened in the 1920s in Japan. This just seems to be another example of American filmmakers trying to cash in on someone else's story.While the acting wasn't abysmal, it was pretty damn Hallmark-y. The dog- vision was a bad decision, as it didn't add anything meaningful to the already sentiment-laden mood. This mood pervaded the entire film - which had no real emotional ups or downs. Not helping matters was the monotonous, unremarkable piano theme that never paused while dog or owner was on screen.Supporting cast were typecast and dull. Several big plot holes as well.All in all very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great film but, a beautiful story even if tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hachiko: A Dog's Story tells the tale of Hachiko, a faithful dog who would walk his owner to and from the train station every day. But when the man unexpectedly dies, Hachiko continues his daily routine of waiting for his master at the train station for the next nine years, becoming a fixture in the community. The story is based on real life events and the film is a remake of the 1987 Japanese film Hachik&#x14d; Monogata. Hachiko is a simple story of animal attachment and loyalty. But as simple as it is, it's also a very powerful story. The film doesn't waste much time showing Hachiko as a puppy, instead it fast-forwards to a grown up Hachiko, showing the relationship between the dog and its owner Parker (played by Richard Gere), and how they spent their time together and the bond that they had. There's even a weird camera angle suppose to emulate dog's vision to shows us the animal perception. This only makes the film sweeter. And then, the "twist" happens. Parker dies and Hachiko, unable to move on, keeps following his daily routine waiting for Parker after work, every single day. This goes on for years and goes to show you what an amazing animal dogs are, and how loyal they can be. The third act is the most powerful act of the film but at the same time, it's where the film looses sense and direction because there's not much more story to be told. It's a sad and tragic on-going event(the dog waiting for its owner) that lasts for years. As I said, Hachiko is not a great film but the story is beautiful. However, it's so tragic and heart-wrenching that it almost hurts to watch. Hachiko is not a feel-good movie. In fact, viewers will probably feel quite lousy after watching it but I guess the film is a good homage to this dog and a good reminder of how marvelous animals are.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Hachiko: A Dog's Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to know of the Hachiko story from one of the film screenings during the Japanese Film Festival more than two years ago, and having visited Tokyo, who would not have heard and noticed that one of the exits of the busy Shibuya station had one exit named after the famous dog? Why an American version of the story would be made baffles me, if not only to tell of yet another dog story following the likes of the Lassies and the Marleys that because dog is Man's best friend there will always be a ready market for it?Directed by Swede Lasse Hallstrom, at least there's the sensibility to still ensure that Hachiko remains Japanese, only for it to be accidentally transported from a Japanese monastery, and thanks to a botch up in cargo handling, Hachiko the puppy's destination ended up to be an American town with the Bedridge train station, where his first night wandering around the station's platform brought him to encounter Professor Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere. Taking pity on the puppy whom he thought was abandoned, Parker brought it home to the opposition of his wife (Joan Allen), but who can deny a homeless dog especially one that looks as cute as a button?The gist of the story you would already know from the trailer which decided to tell all. The film curiously didn't spend too much time with Hachiko as a puppy, and decided to fast forward to when it became an adult dog, starting to walk with Parker to the station, and at 5pm every work day, promptly made its way back to the station to wait for its master, and then walking back. The Japanese version did this very well with people interaction along the way, which this version decided to erroneously gloss over. It's not about just the Professor and his dog, but the community around in which the dog's loyalty, faithfulness and street- smartness touched. Sure there was some attempts at that in this version, but there was too little and probably wanted to approach the story in a different direction.Unfortunately it got a little carried away, and after the pivotal turning point, it somehow went downhill with the narrative being dragged out because here's exactly when the relationship between community and the dog would have taken over to move this to another emotional plane, and didn't because the foundations were not established, granted though there were enough moments and scenes to tug at your heartstrings.One cannot deny that the Akita breeds are cute, and many would have missed the disclaimer toward the end of the credits that the dogs are for experienced dog owners, so don't you be heading toward the pet store to get one puppy on a whim, as the worst thing that shouldn't happen, is an abandonment because fancy has worn off, and would have been very contradictory to the message preached in the film.Between the American update and the original Japanese film, no prizes for guessing that I much prefer the latter for the simple reason that it had more genuine emotions with a better focus on Hachiko, and the locale which the American "Hallmark" version just tries so hard to replicate. Good news is the Japanese film made in 1987 is now re-released locally on DVD and is available in the shops now, and hopefully, the homage paid to the original story and the dog at the end of the film would pique interest in more picking up that version to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heart-warming tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had better state first of all that I'm not particularly a dog lover, I'm more of a cat person, but I appreciate the bond that can exist between an owner and his pet. I should also say that if it wasn't for the fact the Richard Gere appears in this film I very much doubt I would have watched it. Having said that, what I saw was a very heart-warming story that will most definitely not be for everyone, but for those that can appreciate it, it's well worth a viewing. Here's a very brief summary first before I tell you what I really think (summary haters please wait outside the railway station while I write the next paragraph).Parker Wilson is a music professor at a university and he commutes by train every day. One day he finds a puppy wandering about on the platform. Unable to find anyone to claim the dog he takes it home. His wife, Cate, is not best pleased and tells him he must find the real owner soon. He puts up flyers and asks around but nobody claims the dog. He even asks Ken, a Japanese colleague about the dog. Ken tells him that he has a symbol on his collar that says 'Hachiko', which means 'eight' in Japanese. As you can guess, Hachi (for short) becomes the dog's name. As the days pass the bond grows stronger between Parker and Hachi and Cate eventually relents and allows the dog to stay. Once fully grown, every day Hachi would follow Parker to the station and then go home until the evening when he would return to wait for his master. This goes on for quite a while and Hachi becomes a bit of a celebrity amongst those that work in and around the station. But something is about to go badly wrong and this will test Hachi's devotion to his master. Of course I'm not going to tell you what that is as I really don't want to give away too much.You may be surprised to know that this film is based on a 1987 Japanese film called "Hachiko monogatari" by Kaneto Shindô, which is, in turn, based on a true story. There is a very nice musical score that complements the visuals perfectly and I love the occasional shots we get from the dog's point of view. Nobody does a long stare quite like Richard Gere, and he was excellent in his part as Parker Wilson here. Also worth a mention are; Joan Allen as Cate Wilson, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Ken, Sarah Roemer as Andy (their daughter), Jason Alexander, as Carl and Erick Avari as Jasjeet.Although this has the feel of a TV movie of the week, it is a very well done TV movie of the week. If anything the ninety minutes running time is a little long for the story and you begin to feel there is a little too much padding in there. But having said that I still found it a decent watch. Over all, although it is not for everyone, it did bring out some emotions in me that I rarely show and so I deem it? Recommended.My score: 7.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hachi's dedication and soulful, selfless, immortal love for his master and Hachi in waiting for next 9 years till his own death for his already dead master is awesome and moves even the toughest heart, i am sure. This is one movie in my lifetime that i cannot watch again because it was most difficult for me to watch Hachi's loneliness and yet his never ending love and wait for his master. I actually cried and felt difficult in breathing and I was happy crying because it made me more humane, sensitive and understanding. It told me much about life that its not about being with people for materialistic reasons but its about being and waiting for our loved ones for no reason even if they are not coming back because if we love and care for someone it should be true to our own hearts. I am sure I am going to be more like Hachi and wait for my own people even if they abandon me or leave me or they are not in this world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly overrated and in fact quite silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I got interested in this movie seeing it had received such good ratings on IMDb and also since people unanimously shared their tearful experiences with this one.My initial gut feeling was: how irrelevant a movie must be that centers such a great deal on an animal character. Was this yet another Lassie type movie? The cover certainly made an impression of this. 1,5 h, also seemed like a pretty modest run time for a movie that is supposed to get you carried away. Despite conflicting thoughts, I decided to not go with my cynical side, caught this movie and loaded it up. Straight away I found my empathy button pushed. The little Hachi is easy to consider cute and I wondered what events would follow the dog's entry in the life of Richard Gere's character, let alone the little creature interacting with the rest of the family- not as thrilled over sudden thrown upon dog ownership. As the movie progressed I got increasingly more unfulfilled, though. There really is not much going on story-wise and the acting is mediocre at best, which makes it hard to feel for any of the characters. Furthermore, the-world-seen-through-Hachi's-eyes-shots are embarrassingly trivial and the absence of these would have made a better film. I guess this story about the dog who waited for his dear master to arrive better suits as an exceptional anecdote, shared on an encyclopedic website, rather than as a full-length feature film. After all, is it possible to depict animal depth with credibility, which this movie tries to do? I started watching this movie with a smile but ended up feeling horribly regressed for having given it a chance. Lessons are to be learned from this, IMDb ratings should be taken with a grain of salt and from this point on I shun movies that feature dogs as main characters. If you wish to get moved, "The Elephant man" is a better choice; it has incredible acting and displays immense beauty in the worst ugliness. Moreover, I believe the film "Turner &amp; Hooch", which is dog-oriented too, is more enjoyable than his one whilst not claiming to be a masterpiece or as heart-wrenching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I could not stop crying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few movies make me cry. The CHAMP (1977) I think when the father dies and maybe one or tow other ones. But this one creeps up to you without notice. I did not really see much going on for a while other than a very adorable puppy. I watched this movie with my cat and by mid movie all I wanted to do is hug my cats and show them how much I love them for being so unconditional to me. It a timeless and very simple story and all can watch and learn from. Some basic human emotions that trancends to animals alike. It hard to keep it together toward the end as the story concentrates on the dog. I was speechless towards the end and could not stop sobbing. The kind of film that will stick with you and learn to appreciate the power of love and loyalty no matter whom or where it comes from. Highly, highly, highly recommend you watch, rent, buy, borrow this movie however you can find it and just pop it in alone, if you are to scared for other to see you open up to true emotion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but this is just manipulative and serves no other purpose than to tug the heart strings. How does it do that? By exploiting just about every human's love and affection for animals and personal experiences with their own pets. Yes, this movies is well filmed, well acted, and effective in tightening the audiences throat. But let's not forget that this is a film, and there is no plot or dialogue here - nothing happens. What does happen is a perfect idea for a 1 minute heart-warming TV adver. Instead it is stretched to movie length. Also, if you're going to steal a real-life event from Japan, steal it properly and drop the forced links with Japan - the professor hangs out with a Japanese guy and happens to get a Japanese dog....aha, OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The films main focus is on the dog so you are bound to be interested in watching the film. But I must say they focused too much on the actual story and should have inserted some interesting elements deliberately because it all looked like a boring story in the end. The actual story should have been told verbally by people coz the interesting part is only in the beginning and somewhat in the middle. I got bored in the end and was hoping to get something interesting in the end. A disappointing experience I must say. Well the part that I appreciate is that there were not too many characters inserted just to increase the length of the film. Than at sometimes I could not understand some of the things that the dog was doing. May be I was not able to understand. In all the humans as well as the dog performed very well but the story seemed to be a little bit uninteresting."Do not waste your time unless you are a great film buff."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tearjerker with flaws for genuine dog lovers (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree that Hachiko was a well made tearjerker. I enjoyed the film.However I feel that the story was flawed by the fact it was clearly written by someone who has never owned a dog or even liked dogs.This is shown at several points in the movie where those who supposedly have en emotional bond with 'Hachi' do things that no genuine dog lover could ever bring themselves to do. (spoilers follow) If a dog is truly a part of someone's family they won't keep it locked up in a shed at the bottom of the garden; They won't open the garden gate and tell the dog it can run away from home if it wants to; If they encounter the dog in the street once it has strayed they won't simply pat it on the head then leave it there.I don't mind the fact that the story was switched from Japan to America. But I think it would have been better to stick much closer to the true story. This would have made the movie even more heartbreaking and poignant. It would also have inspired those who saw it to be kinder to dogs rather than condoning bad behaviour towards them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: This review is a spoiler fest, so please do not read it if you're yet to watch the film.This is a very emotional movie, it WILL break your heart. Based on a true Japanese story. Hachi is an Akita dog who is brought up by a caring music teacher. After forming a very close bond with his dog, the owner dies and we are made to endure the most depressing 30 minutes in the history of cinema. For the next 9 years, Hachi waits outside the train station for his master to return. Until he passes too.The reason I need to include spoilers is because I must express my frustration with this film. I cannot understand how the owner's family didn't make an effort to let the dog realize his master was dead. He should have been allowed to interact with the dead body. Dogs understand death by experience, they need to smell and see the body and experience it to mourn and find closure.What we had in this movie is animal torture and not for one moment do I believe this was inevitable and normal.I understand that this is what happened in the real story that the film is based on. In that case the story doesn't deserve a movie.Unfortunately in today's world we are made to be tough, objective, a bit heartless and detach ourselves from our personal memories and feelings. This movie educates us to be loyal to our feelings and memories. In that respect, I applaud the film. Of course it's no secret that this particular breed has been domesticated for their companionship and loyalty. Come a long way from wolves.But about how so much of this dog's life was needlessly and painfully wasted on an illusion, I am very upset, and it does not make for great viewing. There is no message, there is just tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Be a Fabulous Film, But It's Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad to see there are reviews here that don't just eat this story up with a spoon. It has the potential to be an amazing, inspiring film, but it falls way short on all fronts. As one blogger said, "it tries to impart an Asian sensibility of 'animal as individual' that doesn't work in a contemporary American setting."If the filmmaker/screenwriter is going to take the fact-based story (and who really knows how much of that is true) as the bones of a contemporary film set in a completely different country, then he needs to elevate all aspects of the story to match. There are plenty of reviews here that illustrate the major flaws in screen writing, characterization, and the like. But how could the movie have reached the level of that inspirational, life-changing synopsis it claims to be? First of all, there is no rule that the wife can't attach to the dog and love it, and still have the animal's primary loyalty be toward the husband. Many animals bond much more with one family member. Creating a character who comes across as not caring for the animal her husband so loves, leaves the viewer wondering what he saw in her in the first place. It's contradictory to love.If the animal really "inspires a whole town" as the synopsis claims, why doesn't a whole town come together and take care of him instead of patting him on the head, saying a brief hello, and throwing a scrap of food? When the dog refuses to stay at the daughter's house and travels miles back to the train station, it's reprehensible that she opens the gate and lets him again find his way back over dangerous (and being an animal on the streets is always dangerous) territory. Why not have her take him back and work out something with the people there (train master, vendors, local store owners) that allows him to live at the station as he so desperately needs to do. She never checks on him again, which leaves the viewer cold and wondering how she sleeps at night.Her son (who starts and ends the story about Hachi his hero) is growing up the whole time the dog is waiting at the station, yet she never takes the child to meet the dog. What a lesson and inspiration it would have been to visit him and bring food and bedding on a regular basis in order to ensure the dog's comfort and safety. Teaching the child that sacrificing for those we love, including our four-legged family members, is part of the experience of life would have enriched this film in so many ways. Instead, the boy, at the end of the movie, says this all happened "a long time ago," as if it were decades before his birth. No one in the family ever seems to check in or make sure Hachi is okay, and the wife only stumbles across the dog, and is surprised to see him, when visiting her husband's grave on the ten year anniversary of his death. The dog sleeps under an old train in freezing conditions, and no one seems to care. The scene where the family is looking at old pictures of Parker with Hachi is heart wrenching and dumbfounding. What did they tell the child: "Oh, yeah, the dog wanted to wait for Grandpa so we let him run free and fend for himself on the streets. Not sure if he's still alive or not."Had the town come together to watch over this loved animal and offer him solace and physical and emotional comfort in his grief as a tribute to the man they all have so much respect for, it would have made this the inspirational, uplifting film it has the potential (and right) to be. It never does that.This is not a film any child should see and one most adults (and animal lovers) should avoid. It breaks the viewer's heart--for all the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

I think other spectators will understand something for myself and I will make for myself correct for myself deduce. Thanks the director actors and the fine dogie who has very well served its purpose in this film, thanks all of them for this fine film.

		<shortDescription>Lame Movie - so unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**This review contains spoilers** Aside from being really boring (not enough to work with for a feature film), there are so many unrealistic parts to this movie, I am not going to go into them all. The true story does not translate well to American culture or modern times. What normal family would let their beloved pet live on the streets for 10 years, even through harsh winters? I don't care how compelled the dog was to wait at the train station, no responsible pet owner would do that.And then the wife visits the town she left nearly ten years after her husbands death and acts like she is so surprised to see the dog living at the train station, like she didn't know that. It was her own daughter who let the dog out to return to the station.The wife didn't seem that distraught at her husbands funeral: the love of her life who died suddenly and prematurely. She acted like she was at some distant cousin's funeral. OMG, I could go on and on.I did cry, rather harshly, at the end; but still thought the movie was the worst I can recall ever seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I watched this movie all I knew was that it had an IMDb rating of 8.0, and I'd seen a one-line comment that called the movie "heartwarming". I was therefore expecting a family-friendly movie that would be warm and uplifting. It is exactly the opposite.Be prepared for an insipid production that, despite Richard Gere, has no noteworthy acting. The characters are not engaging and even the dog is detached and aloof. There is little of visual interest since virtually the entire movie is filmed at the protagonist's home, or at the small railway station in a dismal town.Although the message the movie tries to portray is one of commitment and devotion, it is a slow-moving and depressing story filled with disillusionment and death.Unless you enjoy movies that offer little other than tragedy, stay away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give the dog an Oscar, but everyone else punch in the face! they made Joke out of real story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I never cried during watching this film, It was so predictable, and boring, wooden acting of the whole crew was annoying and laughable, and when Richard Gere died in the film, I didn't cry, I started laughing and I said to my husband, look Richard is ruined, they will not let him act till the end of the movie anymore, and then we both laughed... First of all did you people notice how actors in most today's movies act like wooden puppets just going around and talking random words which they do not feel AT ALL, I noticed it, and I noticed how unnatural Hollywood characters are, shallow and impossible to like... I will stick to UnAmerican movies from now on( it seems that Hollywood makes everything through very old recipes, they will make something well known to audience, they will not experiment, they just want money, they don't make films anymore)... Most people here said that this story in unbelievable , but it is very common, it is just that Japanese people appreciate every hero, even the dog... In my country there are many stories of dogs who spend their lives near the master's grave, or died the same day, and for that thing for following their masters to work and back....WELL EVEN MY CAT DOES THAT... if you are connected to your pet you could expect that... But what was really annoying was that plot hole which I noticed when Richard Gere practiced katana, and I noticed it was fishy , and then at the ending, when they said that man who owned the dog was Japanese, and everything happened in JAPAN, I got depressed, very depressed. Here there was again CHEAP Hollywood, they had to move the dog to America and Americanize everything, but that story would be impossible in America, you know why, because the law says so, no dog should be on the streets, without muzzle and so on, you people are full of laws which are taking your money away( well in my country they do the same)...anyway if we would hope your state was not full of those laws back then In 1924 ( professor used internet in the film), lets say story is possible to happen in America at that time... I get this is JUST BASED on a true story, not that it is true story, but why did they butcher so much the true story? People who made this film know nothing about dogs, and they just put one stupid scene after another to make film last longer, it was agony,farce, they made JOKE out of everything! The only one who knew how to act in a whole movie was a dog so give him Oscar, and apologize to him because you put him in one manipulative LIE/JOKE of a movie... Read about true story and see what really happened...One more thing, it is impossible to make movie out of this story, because it is too simple, and it is too beautiful, it should be passed on , but through different media... and at the end I will give this movie 4 out of 10, because I give dog 10, and to the rest I give -2...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cautionary Tale about Sepsis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a dog with a heart of gold could not allay what we were all pondering in the theater that day: the fear of sepsis. Sepsis is a b---- goddess that can strike at any moment and take our precious limbs away; a fate that befalls Gere's character. This movie spoke to me because I like my elbows, and like Richard Gere, I too have once owned a Golden Retriever. This movie makes social commentary about civilization and the human condition: Hallström takes a few liberties and sets the story in 1990's America instead of 1920's Japan with the intent of showing how similar and, if anything superior, 1990's America was. I remember WWII, and the Japanese didn't fly all the way to Hawaii to sell us defective airbags. Now my daughter liked this movie, but my only complaint is that for all of Hachi's supposed loyalty and intelligence not once does he solve any mysteries or help bring a ragtag team of misfits to the World Series. I'll never look at popcorn again without sobbing uncontrollably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a bad movie, regardless of the story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was dull, lethargically paced and tailored to those who are the dog equivalent of a "cat lady." I don't hate dogs, I generally hate the owners who won't properly discipline their pet. Many times I'm better at keeping their dog in check because I treat them as a master, not a friend. I digress...Burn me at the stake, tell me that I need to be put down (because a dog's life isn't equal to a human's, but in fact much more valuable according to many who lash out at those who don't love the film), but this movie could have been 20 minutes and have the same impact. I'm not commenting on the history of the story, but the horrid execution of the telling of it...one which I'm not convinced even needed to be made into a movie.Many of those who have rated this movie a 10 are falling into the same trap as women who think movies like Dear John or A Walk To Remember are great. This movie is aimed directly at those who invest too much in their pet (ex. dressing their dog up, carrying them in a purse, making a facebook profile for them). They should have just made this a short bedtime story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the loyalty TO the dog?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Putting aside the trite story-telling, and the cheap camera tricks, this movie has two glaring problems.For one - it's another example of the white-washing of Hollywood. This is a Japanese tale. Why did it have to transported to America? Why couldn't it be told in Japan, with Asian actors? Why rob more minority actors of roles that should by rights be theirs? Think how much richer and more interesting the movie would have been if it had portrayed an accurate portrayal of Japanese culture for American audiences! But my larger issue is from the animal welfare point of view. Of course Hachi shows great loyalty to his owner - but where is the family's loyalty to him? They abandon him to the streets for 10 years, to survive on scraps and hot dogs, and sleep under rail cars. And then they hug him, and cry, and talk about his amazing loyalty? Then, after Hachi freezes to death, they give the little boy his own akita. Sure, that makes it all better.Thanks, Hollywood, but I expect and demand better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film I am sure but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am almost certain this will be a fantastic film but surely a rip off of the tale of Greyfriar's Bobby (1961) set in 1874's Edinburgh, Scotland.Bobby belonged to John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a night watchman, and the two were inseparable for approximately two years. On 15 February 1858, Gray died of tuberculosis. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, the graveyard surrounding Greyfriars Kirk in the Old Town of Edinburgh. Bobby, who survived Gray by fourteen years, is said to have spent the rest of his life sitting on his master's grave. A more realistic account has it that he spent a great deal of time at Gray's grave, but that he left regularly for meals at a restaurant beside the graveyard, and may have spent colder winters in nearby houses.In 1867, when it was argued that a dog without an owner should be destroyed, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Sir William Chambers?who was also a director of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals?paid for a renewal of Bobby's licence, making him the responsibility of the city council.Bobby died in 1872 and could not be buried within the cemetery itself, since it was regarded as "consecrated" ground. He was buried instead just inside the gate of Greyfriars Kirkyard, not far from John Gray's grave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could there be spoiler warning in any review concerning this movie when all that happened is that Gere and the dog met and than Gere died and the dog waited and waited and waited... He pretty much waited the hell out of the movie! Some say that his waiting for Gere to come back taught us a valuable lesson about love. I say it taught us how to waste a perfectly good life, it taught us not to move on, to dwell in memories and stay sad and depressed for the rest of your life! That was not love! It was death and withering! Also, I don't know if it was just a bad script or the influence of Hachi, but every time someone got close to him, they got really really frantic, started to call his name again and again and again, saying random phrases like, lets go, good dog, come on! etc... The family that adopted the dog was perfect, so there was no room for a plot developing there and... I don't know what else to write. There was more nothing in this movie than all the other movies I've seen put together!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hachiko: The Story of Neglect and Abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(I checked off that there are ***spoilers*** in this, but if you have watched the trailer, you saw more spoilers than anything you will see in any of these reviews. That said, if you want to know nothing about the film, don't read this, just understand that if you *truly* love animals and know how to take care of them, you will be disturbed by this film.)We watched this based on the 8.1 rating, and the numerous 10 and 9 star ratings I saw on the mobile app. Little did I know that the mobile app puts all the best ratings first without giving you a way of re-organizing them into love/hate like the regular site does.The idea that so many people liked this film is ... beyond words. Why? Because it means *that* many people think it's acceptable to neglect and abandon a dog without even an *attempt* to assist the dog in it's grief over it's lost guardian. There are so many disturbing abuses in this film it's hard to recount them all but the ones that come to mind are: -- Making a family dog sleep outside in a shed or doghouse as if that's care-taking -- Letting a dog run the streets alone. -- Letting a dog run around without a collar, no matter how small the town -- The abandonment of a loyal and heartfelt friend of the spouse who crossed by the remaining spouse -- The willing allowance of a dog to become homeless (as one person stated here, would you let a 10 year old do anything s/he wanted to do just because s/he wanted to do it?) -- Lack of any obvious nutritional or medical care -- The callous disregard of the dog's grief without an ounce of compassion for the dog or trying to help the dog understand that his human friend isn't coming home. Not only do they do all these things, but the film tries to make it look magnanimous on the part of the characters. Anyone who believes it is acceptable to treat any animal this way shouldn't have an animal under their care. Anyone who thinks this film is 'heartwarming' clearly doesn't have a concept of animals as family members. If they think they do, they are delusional. I work with animals every day and everyday I have to deal with animals who are in grief and emotionally lost because their people treated them like *property*. If you wouldn't do it to your child, don't do it to your dog, or your cat, or any other animal you consider your 'pet.' I just am so angry that a film like this would even be made. I don't know how animals in 1923 Japan were routinely treated, and perhaps this film could have worked setting it in that place and time, and showing other animals being routinely treated badly so that this treatment might look kind in contrast. BUT the film was set in modern day U.S. and as far as I'm concerned, it is *NEVER* okay in *ANY* time or place to treat a dog like they did in this film. I'm just sorry I looked this film up on the IMDb mobile app first. If I had seen some of the more negative reviews with regard to the treatment of Hachi, I would have never watched this film. If you *truly* love dogs, and are a capable pet parent, this film is not for you. It is upsetting and disturbing.</fullReview>

The rating of the movie just makes no sense. I guess IMDb would never put it on top 250 no matter how high rating it gets. The story and plot is given almost before the movie starts. The actors are good, but they make no good acting in this movie, where they are just as anemic as the plot. Life is just too short to waste on this movie.

		<shortDescription>Dumber than fiction...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll tell you right now what happened in this film. Spoilers or not, you should not care either way as not much happens in this film.Richard Gere finds and befriends a puppy. Puppy gets dependent on Richard Gere because all of his underdeveloped movie family are a bunch of indifferent, neglecting and sometimes even hating a-holes. Puppy turns into a mature hound, every day giving his farewell to and welcoming his owner back the only way he knows how: mainly following Gere to the train station and then waiting for him to return in the evening. Richard Gere gets a heart attack and dies. The dog does not and I emphasize - does NOT get invited to his master's funeral. Dog naturally assumes that Gere will come back one day, since he had seen nothing to prove otherwise. Dog keeps waiting for Richard at the train station. Dog dies of old age. The end.The moral of this story: always invite everyone close to the deceased to the funeral, that includes pet animals. One more thing: this movie is apparently based on the real events that happened in Japan almost a hundred years ago, which goes to show that reality can be a lot dumber than fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disposable Pet Takes Center Stage In Mushy, Pointless Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is purportedly a movie about love and loyalty between a man an his dog, but in it they manage to show you everything you absolutely shouldn't do as a responsible pet owner. I wanted to like this movie but I was too busy cringing at the danger the dog Hachi was constantly placed in due to the neglect of his absentee owners. If you really love your pet you should watch this movie and do the exact opposite of everyone in it.Here are some thoughts I had while watching it (*spoilers ahead*):- Magic puppy that just sits there being cute and doesn't pee / poop / tear up everything. In reality, raising a puppy is a lot of hard work, and it doesn't get a lot easier once they grow up. This movie will probably encourage more people who shouldn't be pet owners in the first place to go get a pure bred puppy as they make it look way too easy, meanwhile tens of thousands of dogs die unwanted and unloved in shelters. - This dog runs all over town but has no collar - what, no leash laws, no mandatory rabies tag? The town I live in would never tolerate this, and for good reason as it is a very real danger to both the dog and the townsfolk. - Dog runs all over streets and around active train tracks and "loving" owner is unalarmed. If that was my dog I'd be having a cow. - Complete absence of cars, even parked ones, till near the end when son-in-law comes to pick up dog. I think this was to keep you from thinking about the dog getting hit by a car while it's roaming the streets unleashed and unattended. I couldn't stop thinking about it though. - The dog is anthropomorphized to an unbelievable degree. Look, dogs don't understand complex English sentences, but that doesn't stop every character in this movie from behaving like they can. The two most grating scenes in the movie revolve around this: 1) The first time Hachi follows Gere to the train station, Gere tells the dog to go home and somehow expects the dog to know what he's saying - Gere doesn't seem to care if the dog goes home or not, as long as it leaves the train station long enough for him to get to his job on time, and 2) the sentimental speech delivered by the "loving" daughter to the dog right before she opens the gate and allows the dog to run away and roam the streets homeless. - The zoned-out wife didn't even realize the dog escaped from the backyard, even though she just got a soft spot for it and fed it treats. - Wife quits job and leaves town right after husband dies - with a daughter &amp; grandchild living in town? What, hubby didn't have any life insurance to go with that cushy job at the university? I kind of don't believe it. Perhaps some critical setup / background scenes were cut as it makes no sense? Then again, nothing in this movie makes much sense. - Magic Asian meets wife at the graveyard, completely out of the blue, like he's been standing there for ten years, flowers in hand, waiting for her to appear. - Entire town seems to be aware of dog story, but entire family that owned dog is completely clueless? - Relentlessly syrupy movie music telegraphing every emotion we're supposed to feel - it made me hate the sound of strings &amp; piano (and I really like strings and piano). - True story taken so far out of context and time, and given the complete Hollywood treatment to the point where it makes zero sense. - Dull, uninspired plot, script, characters, acting - except for depraved indifference to Hachi, nothing really happens. - Jason Alexander can't do anything but be George Costanza, why was he in this movie (or any movie for that matter)? - Puppy leash removal on train tracks at end, so the whole absentee owner thing starts over again - wasn't once enough?I never thought I would say this, but even Free Willy is a better animal-centric movie than this one.</fullReview>

Why the dog doesn't die in the first ten minutes to solve all the problems I don't know. If I was blind and deaf I still wouldn't give it 10 stars. Frankly, Richard should be ashamed of himself.He has let his country down. My sum of all fears is this movie becoming a success, unfortunately it appears that it may be, so my final question is, who do we blame, the director, Richard or the dog. This is the peoples decision. I can't make this. But you can, please everyone think what you have watched. is poison to the mind and an insult to humanity.

The cover on the DVD showed a man happily smiling with his cute dog, so I was anticipating some sort of a happy story.The beginning was kind of intriguing, but as the movie wore on, the music was so slow, boring and sad that I knew that someone was going to to die. I had to force myself to stay with this movie, hoping that it would get better. It didn't.I don't know if was the directing or producing aspect of the film that made it so boring, but there was just something missing.I agree that the real-life story is an amazing and interesting one, but watching this movie version of it was not at all enjoyable for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tend to only consider reviewing movies which I either think are great, or, despise. This would be one of the latter. A fluffy tale about a fluffy dog. Carter (Gere) is the perfect American father and husband. He's handsome, carries a briefcase. He wears an overcoat, yet, is artistic, sensitive, educated. He loves his wife. He finds a lost puppy in a trainstation and, reluctantly, brings it home to his perfect American wife, beautiful, artistic; playful, yet stern; in their perfect Conneticut house. Before long, the puppy endears itself to man and woman (as well as perfect daughter) and they decide to keep it. Joy precedes tragedy, etc. The lead character, hachi, is a dog. He is not great, not bad. He had no trouble sitting there, looking cute. But, when it came to expressing himself, he lacked. "What is it boy?" I never could quite figure that out. All in all, a film about a sad dog who refuses to let us in beyond his stoic and stubborn gesture of grieving. A montage of familiar actors ooohing and aaahing. A cookie cutter vision of life. It didn't make me weep. Perhaps I am a hard hearted cynic. Perhaps I want to learn something from a movie.... I didn't learn anything here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw a test screening so take the following with that in mind - changes may be made both small and large - one of the very questions was which title of 4 we responded best to.The Hatchiko story is a real one and it is that fact which most carries the movie. This is a story of companionship and identity...or at least, it wants to be.Unfortunately, the movie never takes flight. No character is explored at any level deeper than that which a young child would understand. While a tremendous amount of talent was assembled to encircle the gorgeous Akita (the dog is very much the star of the movie,) with such flimsy roles, no great characters are born. And in the case of Joan Allen, a somewhat forced performance gives way to a rather unbelievable character.But it is the pacing which most cripples the film. At least a dozen slow fade blackouts exaggerate the emotional side of the film, thus, lessening the impact. The passage of time is portrayed very poorly, with nearly 15 years passing and few physical alterations made in any human character.Still, the story is profound enough to carry it as a quality holiday flick. And if you are a sucker for animals, this one will play right into your wheelhouse.Neither a particularly skillfully made or daring movie, Hatchiko's got its dog going for it and not too much else.5 out of 10</fullReview>
