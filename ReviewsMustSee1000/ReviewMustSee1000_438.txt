		<shortDescription>Harold &amp; Kumar do it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, I really didn't think they could recapture the magic of the first film in the sequel. Sequels are, so often, horrible disappointments. But the World Premiere of Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Gauntanamo Bay last night as Austin's SXSW Film Festival was simply awesome. The audience loved America's favorite slackers on their next adventure as their trip to Amsterdam goes incredibly wrong.Whereas the first film challenged racism and stereotyping, this one continued the theme into issues of racial profiling and War on Terror paranoia. These multicultural slackers are becoming American every-men that we can all relate to. While there are times when Harold &amp; Kumar's antics are just plain silly, they are also incredible human characters who are struggling with real challenges around parents, romance, friendship, the law, and race. Harold &amp; Kumar make us laugh while they also challenge our perceptions and expectations of social and political reality.Cho and Penn were wonderful reprising their original roles. Neal Patrick Harris was back again as a strange variant of himself. Rod Corddry provides a wonderful addition to the cast as the completely paranoid government agent. Overall, the film is perhaps a tad below the original, but a tad below excellent is still a wonderful comic romp that all fans of the original and many new fans should enjoy. Unlike the first film which gained a cult following on DVD, Harold and Kumar Escape from Guatanamo Bay will undoubtedly be a huge hit in the theaters. The audience here in Austin absolutely loved the two lovable anti-heroes. I look forward to many more adventures from Harold and Kumar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am getting so addicted to Harold and Kumar's crazy adventures, it's just pathetic, when I saw Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, I was hooked and bought the movie the next day. So obviously I was so excited to see Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, saw it opening day and it's non stop laughs still! Now, I do hate gross humor, it's disgusting and unoriginal, yet, somehow, Harold and Kumar make it so unbelievably funny. They're back and this time they are taking the world by storm! Kal Penn and John Cho are such a great pair and made this sequel so much fun to watch. I agree, it does get offensive at times, but if you don't take this movie seriously, I think you'll be laughing too. Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay is one of the funniest movies I have seen this year in the theater.Harold and Kumar are on their way to Amsterdam to visit Harold's love, Maria, but of course, Kumar just can't wait until they get to Amsterdam, so he smokes on a plane, but everyone mistakes the bong for a bomb and Harold and Kumar get thrown into Guantanamo Bay. When they have the chance, they take it. When they finally arrive back in America, they got to meet Kumar's ex girlfriend's fiancée who could pull some strings to get their charges clear, but the way to Texas is a long road and they have to face some interesting obstacles.Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay was so much fun to watch, I loved this sequel, the cast looked like they had the ultimate blast making this film. The scenes that got huge laughs from me was when the FBI agent offers grape soda to a guy to get information about where Harold and Kumar were, and some guy in the back round says "How about some Kool Aid?!", also the scene with the return of the weed bag with Kumar and his ex girlfriend was so weird, that it was actually funny. If you loved Harold &amp; Kumar go to White Castle, you'll love Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, it's a comedy not to miss.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware! Its a comedy roller coaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my god, I still don't know what hit me. I have been a big fan of the first part but this one is a different league guys. Not a single boring moment, very nice editing. And our favorite characters have done it again. They didn't leave a single stereotype and ignorance untouched in the movie.Trust me it will not be fair to compare the White Castle part with this one, as this is just a different experience no less than a roller coaster ride of genuine comedy. This movie has taken what it did in the first one, to the next but different level. To point out, as pretty clear from the uncensored trailers, it was awesome to see NPH and G "Dubya" Bush. Cho and Penn are just non-stop fun and have some really hot girl friends. From Ta-Ta's of girls to bottom less parties, nothing felt out of place. We also get to know allot about H&amp;K's past.It deserves a standing ovation and that's what it got from the audience in the theater. Oh man, I am so getting this on DVD when the extended unrated version comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Y2K??Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoyed Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle and have any reservations about the sequel, fear not. Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay may not be quite the same as its predecessor, but it brings enough of the story mechanics back and the stoner humor that made it a cult success. Writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, also serving as directors this time around, have upped the ante like the sequel cliché goes. There is more nudity, (with a bottomless party, how could there not?), a lot more swearing, and just plain old vulgarities every single second. As for the premise's blatant sending up of racial stereotypes and epithets, even those get a shot of adrenaline going from the city streets of Alabama, a KKK kegger, and the bigoted government officials unable to decipher the weird Chinese dialect, called English, spoken by Harold's parents. It definitely isn't pretty, bodily fluids flow freely, but the laughs never cease. When your goal is to bring the funny and there are times in the theatre when one can't hear the next line because of uproarious laughter, you know success is yours.The beauty of this film is the amount of fun you know these guys are having. To get all the principals back for a second go round of a film that did no bank at the box office is quite the feat. Sure DVD sales and internet buzz was huge for the original, but did anyone ever think the boys would actually get to Amsterdam on the big screen? I know I didn't have that much faith. People could badmouth this effort very easily for many reasons, most obvious is the fact that it is pretty much the exact same film as the first. Yet, there were very few instances where I wasn't laughing let alone smiling at the proceedings. When else can you see a nod to the classics like The Goonies done so well? My biggest concern going in was with the war on terrorism satire that the trailers tried so hard to get across. When you put in an actor to play someone like George W. Bush, it can backfire and go completely awry. Surprisingly, though, that scene, amongst others, is actually pretty well done. The ineptitude of the American government is portrayed often?and actor Rob Corddry is the worst part of the film spearheading that aspect; I just don't like his schtick?yet there is always someone there to play the other side (Roger Bart) and show that while they know there are mistakes, they aren't a bunch of buffoons going around willy-nilly. If nothing else this film should be credited for finally having the guts to poke fun at the tragedy of 9-11. It's been so long and I think that humor is necessary for any sort of healing process. To have the fortitude to do the airplane scene with Kumar laughing in his Taliban garb motioning a crashing airport is not something to tread with lightly. Hurwitz and Schlossberg decided to go pedal to the metal with this film and they never make a compromise, kudos to them for that.The film begins right where the first left off and everyone is still in the same frame of mind. To add a little spice to the mix, we do get introduced to a new character, Vanessa, an old flame of Kumar's. Being that she is about to marry an aspiring politician, the inclusion not only plays into the need of a love interest, (Maria is still in Amsterdam, and of course we all know the boys don't make it off the plane to see her), but also into the ability to bring the government in through his connections. Being on the cusp of even having the President attend his wedding, who better to go to for help in absolving their terrorist accusations? Vanessa is well played by the attractive Danneel Harris in a role that doesn't get much screen time. She is, however, involved in probably my favorite scene of the film?a flashback on how she meets Kumar and shows him the world of narcotics. It is a fantastic sequence helping to align his brains with the lifestyle he has begun to live in?and there is a brilliant cameo by Harold that brought the house down.Of course the movie would be nothing without John Cho and Kal Penn, the titular characters respectively. Their rapport is fully intact and the shenanigans they get into are the impetus of the story. It's a shame that Cho is in practically nothing and Penn has been relegated to roles without lines (Superman Returns) and television ("24" and "House") because they could do so much better (as evidenced with The Namesake). This is their film and they do not disappoint, right until the end credits. There are a lot of cameos here as well, mostly from people that we saw in the original. Playing themselves in either stereotypical ways or as the butt of a racial joke, it's good to see them have a sense of humor. If only everyone in real life could have that attitude they wouldn't be cultivating racism by the sheer fact they accuse everyone of it. While that is probably another discussion for another time, at least this broad comedy has enough cultural value to realize it and put it into the minds of college kids for whom the film targets.Oh, and did I mention Neil Patrick Harris? No? Well that must be because he is so brilliant words can't even describe. What a conclusion to his arc, just fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say this movie was hilarious. Definitely a stoner movie, and as funny as the first. Actually, it may be funnier. Like most sequels they don't usually top the first one, and in most cases rehash the same old jokes. The story beings hours after their "White Castle" gorging ("Prepare to gorge yourself"),and after mistaking a "bong" for a "bomb", on their way to Amsterdam, Harold &amp; Kumar are sent to Guantanmo Bay, and a chain reaction of foolishness and tomfoolery ensues. Lots of cameo's in this one, so you movie lovers keep an eye out. See if you can spot Freakshow from "White Castle" in a completely reversed role. If you're a fan of the first one, you will absolutely love "Guantanamo Bay." Go Roldy!! Go Kumi!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophomoric Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 7.4 IMDb rating, I went to a theater tonight to see this latest H&amp;K flick. White Castle was appealing. This one seems to be an attempt to compete with the lousiest movies of recent years. Any smatterings of funniness are overwhelmed by the unnecessary raunchiness and absolute war on political correctness. There's a way to subtly insert non-PC stuff that maintains the entertainment level. White Castle had that. This story's framework had the potential to become a much funnier and nicer-spirited script. One character is so over-the-top and offensive (even for this film) that he seems to have jumped in from a different movie set. Why the two leads would agree to be in this product is beyond me. I walked out after a half hour. Ten bucks (literally) down the toilet. Now I see that it's up to a 7.6! Are the almost 7500 votes exclusively from 15 year-old boys?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The complete lack of laughs in Harold and Kumar 2 isn't the least of its problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Harold and Kumar wasn't a financial hit on its initial release, but became somewhat of a cult-classic on DVD. Yes, stoner comedies are far too many and often unfunny, but Harold and Kumar succeeded where most failed. The jokes were fresh and original, there was barely even a plot (which was part of the appeal) and it starred two ethnic minorities, which is a rarity for film these days. It's no wonder that a sequel has been released; the only surprise is how much this new Harold and Kumar film misses the mark.Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay picks up immediately after the predecessors end, with the two stoner buddies heading on a plane to Amsterdam. However, Kumar's bong is mistaken for an explosive mid-flight and the two buddies are arrested under suspicion of being terrorists. Despite their best efforts, the duo are sent to Guantanamo Bay, where they end up breaking out and going on a road-trip of sorts across America, evading the authorities.I don't mind crude humor in comedies. Vulgarity can be funny in certain jokes. However, when the joke is the vulgarity itself, well, that's not funny. Penises, semen, flatulence, urine and excrement can be funny in jokes, but in itself are not funny. There's nothing comical about Kumar masturbating and spraying semen over himself, nor is there anything funny about Kumar's friend revealing his pubic hair entrenched penis. This is below low-brow humor; it's the type of jokes that a 12-year old who just hit puberty would come up with if asked to write a movie. In the first Harold and Kumar, there were plenty of funny jokes and almost none of them were vulgar. In this installment, there's lots of vulgarity, but there aren't even many jokes. Just crudeness for the sake of being crude.The rest of the jokes pretty much consist of the antagonist making stereotypes about African-Americans, Arabs and Jewish people. Once again, I don't mind jokes involving stereotypes, but simply having a man suggest Jewish people can't resist picking up pennies or blacks love grape soda isn't funny. It's the type of humor that might make a kid below the age of 10 laugh, but no one any older, unless they are indeed stoned. There's no substance to it. There's nothing remotely clever about it or even funny in a stupid way, just stereotypes acted out on the big screen. The movie is painfully unfunny, which is a shame because there's some decent talent behind it. John Cho has a certain charm to him as Harold and Kal Penn, although slightly annoying, has proved himself funny in the previous installment. You get the feeling that with better writing, the duo really could have delivered a hilarious film.But even the films complete ineptitude in the laughs department isn't its biggest fault. The most aggravating thing about Harold and Kumar 2 is how this low-brow, schlocky comedy tries to make it appear as if there's some political message behind it or it had anything important to say. It seems to have worked, because it currently holds a 54% at Rottentomatoes (meaning more than half of critics liked it) and most of these positive reviews mention the political undertones. Simply put, this movie has nothing to say. Sure, George Bush is in it. That doesn't mean it has anything thoughtful to say about the Bush administration. He smokes pot and acts stupid. If there is any political message behind the film, it's nothing any deeper than Bush is stupid.And frankly, that pisses me off. Not because I like Bush (to the contrary actually), but because the movie takes no risks. Bush-jokes have become so common and so over-done. This movie bills itself as offensive. Making fun of George Bush is possibly the least offensive thing you could do these days. Everyone has done it. Same goes for implying that America is racist. If there is something offensive about Harold and Kumar 2, it's that it plays it safe. There's nothing remotely risky about any of it. Why not take a different slant and say that the American Government really isn't racist? That minorities are overly sensitive about issues such as searching people at customs? How about saying that often stereotypes can be true, and that if a 6-foot tall, African-American man dressed like a gangster and holding a lead pipe comes at you during the night, he is probably trouble and not a good Samaritan trying to help you (which happens in the movie by the way)? It's not that the film goes contrary to my point of view. It's that it tries to appear offensive and politically incorrect, when really it isn't any more offensive than an Ashton Kutcher rom-com.That's what really sinks Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay. Not that it isn't funny, but that it has nothing to say, and doesn't take risks. The reason that South Park can be appreciated, even when certain episodes are unfunny, is because the creators aren't afraid to voice their minds. They go against the grain, often against my own opinions, as well as the majority of the publics, and you have to respect them for that. All that can be said for Harold and Kumar 2 is that the creators try to be as appealing and un-PC as possible, while appearing they're not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest Movie this Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on Saturday and laughed aloud throughout.This movie is not for everyone. There is nudity as well as drug and bodily function humor; however, it is definitely funny. Unlike most drug-themed movies, Harold and Kumar doesn't show the boys as being a couple of baked idiots, but as an intelligent sensitive individual paired with a baked idiot. Much like Bruce Willis' Blind Date, it only takes one person with absolutely no impulse control to make your life hell. As they said in Star Wars, however, there is another.Neil Patrick Harris, after a cameo in the first movie, plays the same character only much further off the deep end than before. He is a mushroom-gobbling, whore-branding sociopath who makes Kumar look like an ivy league professor.I must warn those who have seen the first movie. There are no cheetahs.I am sorry...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first one, and couldn't wait to see the next one. Most of its humor is either racial, sexual, or drug-related, so if you aren't into that, steer clear of this one. If you can appreciate that type of humor you will be laughing throughout the entire movie. It is also filled with many ridiculous "wtf" funny moments, reminiscent of the cheetah scene from the last movie. The movie itself isn't offensive, but a lot of the characters are, and Neil Patrick Harris returns once again and really stole the show for me. Some of the jokes are derived from the first movie, so I really recommend seeing the first one before you see this to get acquainted with the characters. So go grab some friends and get ready to laugh, one of the funniest movies of the year!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kal Penn has done it again. The premise was set perfectly and the movie took us through the different oddities about the paranoid and mad ways of American reactions to war against terror. These two gentlemen are put behind bars and sent of Guantanama Bay. The journey begins there and its a fun ride ahead. The movie apart from being rip roaring funny, also brings out lot of mistaken or rather true clichés of American society. Be it geographical ethnic or even racist. The sensitive subjects are treated pretty nicely. I should say hilariously too. The expression Kal Penn brings about for different situations are perfect and fits the scenes very well. Trust me he's got a funny looking face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes Police Academy VI look like Pulp Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like the Harold and Kumar sequel make me wish I had the old BOMB system again. The movie isn't just juvenile, uncreative, and pathetic; it's sort of a clinic on how to suck as a movie. It's extremely predictable, which would be fine if the jokes and raunch were any interesting. It's also viciously mean spirited - and not in the broad, over-the-top blunt (no pun intended) humor of the 2004 original, either. Back then, everything that the titular duo did was wrapped in a drug-induced haze, and that justified the lowbrow comedy. Hey, it's funny because they're stoned, man! Get it? But not so with this one. Sure, drug use figures prominently into the plot, but there aren't nearly enough drug scenes to save the movie. Harold and Kumar do things that can be obliquely traced to drug use, you see, but most of their problems come from their unimpaired decision making, and that makes for a dull, pointless film.Originally, this was titled "Harold and Kumar Go to Amsterdam," but eventually the filmmakers figured out that our buds (no pun intended, I swear) don't actually make it to Amsterdam. As the trailer showed, they're mistaken for terraists and are deposited in Guantanamo Bay. Well, the prison, not the actual bay. And then, as you might have been able to predict, they escape. Wild shenanigans follow, including a visit to a "bottomless" party (which was clever), a run in with nonstereotypical denizens in Alabama (not bad), an encounter with a stereotypical inbred hillbilly couple (including that "Hemi" guy from those old Dodge commercials), and a mixup with a Klan gathering. The latter was funny back when Chevy Chase did it in Fletch Lives, and no so much now.And of course there's the obligatory appearance by Neil Patrick Harris as himself. His was a huge boon to the original movie, and he's back, fortuitously showing up to save the lads from the Klansmen. And that's about the only time that the movie has any spark at all; Harris wolfs down mushrooms while driving to a whorehouse, and at one point he sees a unicorn. It's the exact kind of trippy awesomeness that helped make the original movie a cult hit, and there's so little of it here.Aside from that, the movie's pedestrian. Kumar wants to get to Texas and, in a staple of generic teen comedies, break up the wedding of his ex-girlfriend to the world's biggest douchebag - no offense to you other douchebags out there. Adding a complication we would NEVER have foreseen, he's also the One Guy who can get Harold and Kumar out of the mess they're in. And Harold wants to get to Amsterdam (eventually) to meet up with the girl he met at the end of the first movie (she's there on business; won't she be surprised? If so, it would be the only surprise in the movie.) At its heart, the movie's problem is that Kal Penn and John Cho don't have nearly the degree of on-screen chemistry that they had in the first movie, for whatever reason. The two kids from Superbad covered similar ground, and they were infinitely more believable and funnier. Harold and Kumar are bitter jerks to each other at various points in the story, and it's not the wild exaggerated-for-comic-effect kind of bitterness, either, which makes it a little uncomfortable to watch at times. Quite a disappointment.Constipating the humor even further was a howlingly awful performance by Rob Corddry as some deputy Homeland Security canker sore who's out to get Harold and Kumar. There's broad performance, and there's one-note. Corddry can be funny with a good script to follow, but if the writing's terrible, so is he. What should have been hyperbolically funny was instead discomfiting and annoying, huge debits for such a big role.I want my $10 back, to paraphrase the delivery boy in Better Off Dead. Harold and Kumar Escape from Gunatanamo Bay is a rip off, best enjoyed (if that) at home, ironically, with many friends who pay you to see it. Which would be illegal, I think, so don't do it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The occasional good laugh among the crudity but too few and delivered with too little intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason I actually found the first film pretty enjoyable and it had enough laughs for me to justify coming back to the second film. The title made me think that the story would also lend itself to be a fairly one-sided p1ss-take of the US handling of the terrorism issue and I hoped this would add a sharp element to the otherwise stoner comedy. That the film opens with Kumar taking a dump and then ejaculating up over himself amazingly did not dissuade me from this belief. However as the film went on I realised that there would be nothing particularly smart about this film and that it is all about the stoner comedy as per the first film - which, like I said, I enjoyed.Sadly though the second film falls way short of the mark in terms of laughs. In terms of being graphic, crude and obvious it is right on point though, but the problem is that little of this material is funny when it comes to execution. So in theory the scene with George Bush (one of the worst impersonators of him I've seen) could have been barbed and cutting, instead is just basic and surprisingly lazy. In fact "lazy" is a word that sprung to mind several times throughout the film mainly because of the lack of creativity within it and also the amount of box ticking. The lavatorial humour, the excessive nudity and usual homophobia (except of course when it comes to girls) is all present but only appears to be there so that the target audience can tick them off - at very least they linger long after the joke is made. In terms of playing with stereotypes and racial profiling it does offer more and there is a certain delight in seeing so many groups generalised and slandered, however again it is hard not to feel more could have been made of it. Maybe I'm expecting too much but there was opportunity for satire to be slipped in here but it never came and it is a lesser film for its absence.It did still make me laugh but way too infrequently for me to enjoy as a comedy even if it does have really enjoyable hits. As before the sheer juxtaposition of Neil Patrick Harris' public image with that presented in these films makes his parts easy to enjoy, even if it is a bit too "easy" on this occasion and just feels like a retread of the first film. Cho and Penn make engaging leads and they play well to the material - that much of it isn't that good is not down to their performances, if anything they deserved better. The support cast features a wonderfully daft turn from Corddy but mostly just minor roles doing the basics.Harold &amp; Kumar 2 may suggest a political edge with its title but ultimately it is not much more than a repeat of the first film but with increased nudity and crudity but decreased laughter rate and entertainment value. It will probably still please teenage boys with the basics but offers little to a wider audience.</fullReview>

Only Kumar couldn't make it to Amsterdam without smoking a bong, and the guys are thrown into Guantanamo Bay.The bromance between Harold and Kumar is still holding up strong. The movie works best when it concentrates on them only. This one introduces Vanessa (Danneel Ackles) as Kumar's college girlfriend. It's nice to get some depths to Kumar.Rob Corddry is annoyingly over the top as the government agent coming after the pair. He's so stupid and annoying that it becomes a major problem.

		<fullReview>Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (2008): Dir: John Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg / Cast: Kal Penn, John Cho, Rob Corddry, Neil Patrick Harris, Danneel Harris: Every bit as crude and hilarious as the adventure to White Castle. This time Asian American Harold and Indian American Kumar are mistaken for terrorist and sent to Guantanamo Bay prison. After escaping they set out to clear their names. Directors John Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg equal the first film by broadening the racial issue. John Cho and Kal Penn return as the stoner duo who escape from prison only to encounter many odd situations that eventually lead to smoking weed with President George W. Bush. Kumar wishes to stop the wedding of his ex-girlfriend, and Harold is along for the ride because getting in trouble together is what friends do best. Rob Corddry steals every scene he is in as an agent who uses racial interrogation, which act as a statement to every racial argument in the film. Neil Patrick Harris returns as himself. He picks up the duo and smuggles them past a check point where he has visions of unicorns while stoned. He is eventually in trouble at a brothel where hookers try to kill him. Danneel Harris plays Kumar's ex-girlfriend who is now engaged to a scumbag. It regards stereotypes, skin colour, reputation, position of power, and breaking out of one's own emotional prisons.

"White Castle" meditated in a rude but sophisticated way on racial stereotypes in America, and made a point that sometimes we can stereotype ourselves even more than other people can do to us. "Guantanamo Bay", as the title would imply, is more about the political or social aspects of discrimination in America. It's a more crude film, and it dwells less on the way the characters define themselves than on how other people define them.The sequel picks up right where the first one left off, with Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) about to head off too weed-mecca Amsterdam in search of Harold love Maria (Paula Garces). Unfortunately Kumar can't wait for the plane to land to try out his "smokeless bong", which is mistaken by an elderly passenger for a bomb. Harold and Kumar find themselves in the grips of the unbelievably incompetent Homeland Security official Ron Foxx (the Daily Show's Rob Corddry), who sends them to the federal prison of the title.Like any comedy of this type, the "set pieces" are where the big laughs are delivered. But the best of them aren't quite as good as the best of the original. For example although Neil Patrick Harris is funny in this one, again playing a kind of fantasy version of himself, the novelty of his performance from the first is irreplaceable. Sometimes the movie seems to be stretching for emotion or genuine empathy where in the original it seemed to flow more naturally. For example we have to endure a whole flashback sequence with Kumar and his lost love Danneel (Vannessa Fanning) that explains how Kumar started getting high and fell in love.But I'm not going to say it's a bad movie, because it really did make me laugh out loud at least a half dozen times. The people who are writing these movies have a rare eye for humor that can be found in the banal. Sometimes with this one though they seem to have tried for jokes that are fairly obvious. But again the "set pieces" are hilarious. For example there's a sequence with Harold and Kumar getting high with President Bush (James Adomian) that felt therapeutic to me. I loved when he called Kumar a "hypocritizer"! That whole sequence might seem odd if our children end up seeing this movie 20 years from now, but at this very moment it's exactly what we need.A sequel can never be as fresh as the original, so many of my small complaints might not even really matter for anyone who sees this having missed the first one. All in all it deserves credit because the decline wasn't as great as it could have been -- most of the flavor of the original is still here. And this is a film that makes us laugh at ourselves at a moment in history when a lot of people are trapped between a perhaps justified self-seriousness about the morality of the situation and a ridiculous denial of the same. I like Harold and Kumar as characters, as human beings, and I'm surprised to find myself still hoping for yet another adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked the first one but this movie was absolutely terrible!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so bad, SO stupid, such a complete waste of time. I was insulted by how bad it was. I've never walked out on a movie but was very tempted to on this. I enjoyed the first Harold and Kumar and expected much of the same humour but this movie felt like it was thrown together in three days on a shoe-string budget. Many of the gags were embarrassingly bad and poorly executed. Even the actors felt like they were bored. The only decent scenes were the ones with Neil Patrick Harris but he needed to play a larger role. I give the movie some credit for not pulling any punches when making fun of stereotypes and by buying a ticket and watching this trash...well I guess that's the film's way of making fun of stupid people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would not say I was excited to see this movie, but I can say I did plan to watch it at some point. Luckily, I did not spend money on this movie and even contemplated walking out towards the end of the movie.The character of Ron Fox is perhaps one of the worst movie characters in recent memory. In no way was his character funny and he completely took away from the other characters that at least had some talent in the film. I am hoping that any of you that are on the fence whether to watch this film or not will think twice and save your time and money. The first of the series blows this atrocity out of the water and I don't know how anyone can say any different. Other than a few one-liners I sat in disbelief of how anyone could enjoy the film. This movie should have never been made and I hope they think long and hard before another of these films is released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me say I was a big fan of the first Harold and Kumar film.This sequel has none of the witty elements of the first film. The movie seemed like a weak student film with novice acting, poor direction, and no continuity (forget about how bad the writing was for this movie - here is a tip to the writers; that thing about smoking weed to get creativity, it is a myth so you might want to put the bong down next time). If this was the writer directors first film, it would surely be their last because it was so bad. Luckily, I didn't pay to see this junk and even so I feel like I should ask for money back!

		<shortDescription>One of those films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the only movie I saw in theaters back in 2008, yes I know I missed a lot of many movies in theaters only to see them on DVD.Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay is the sequel to the stoner movie Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle. It would be wise to watch White Castle first before getting into this film.However this is one of those comedy films that will throw a lot of humor some of it is pretty funny but other pretty much just feels like it shouldn't be in the film. The reason for it was that some of the jokes were not really that funny but there were other jokes that were better just have to be keeping in mind this was listed under the "Stoner" comedy So don't expect the acting or the plot to be up there with the best of them because it is not but it does have a plot that make you go now that's crazy It's just one of those comedy movies that you have to watch to get otherwise it wouldn't be making any sense. The film does feature some comedy that make you laugh out of control though some of the characters could have been without the film is only for fans of these two I give Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay an 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice concept expansion from the original movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie presents a story that differs not much from its predecessor. But it did a pretty good job in expanding the concept of the story from just a wild night of mischief to a more serious base of being mistakenly captured as terrorists. There concept expansion also put a lot more on the racial and sexual issues and converting them into some crazy humor. Although I should also say that maybe not everybody can really enjoy those types of humor. The acting overall is slightly better than the first movie. Kal Penn and John Cho reprises their roles quite exactly as they did in the first movie, which means they did quite well in the case of consistency. Neil Patrick Harris playing on more screen time makes his role here even more entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the first film the duo appeared in, Get the Munchies, that was actually really funny, I only knew there was this follow up from seeing the DVD cover numerous times, but I had no idea of critical opinions until much later, I was going to try it regardless. Basically, following the events of their road trip adventure to White Castle, Harold Lee (John Cho) and Kumar Patel (Epic Movie's Kal Penn) are taking a flight from New Jersey and heading for Amsterdam, there Harold hopes to continue a romance with his neighbour Maria (Paula Garcés), and Kumar wants to stop his love interest Vanessa (Danneel Harris) getting married, but during the flight they are mistaken as terrorists when a lit bong is seen and misheard to be a bomb. They are arrested and at Washington D.C. obsessive and racist Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ron Fox (Hot Tub Time Machine's Rob Corddry) sends them to Guantanamo Bay, but not long after arriving they get the opportunity to escape the military prison in Cuba, and catch a refugee boat to Miami, Florida. Harold and Kumar meet up with college buddy Raza (Amir Talai), at one of his parties when women only wear tops and nothing else, he loans them a car and they travel to Texas and get some help from politically linked friend Colton (Eric Winter), and while Harold and Kumar's English fluent parents are being interrogated by Fox and the incompetent Interpreter (Ed Helms), the duo end up lost in Birmingham, Alabama. They crash their car and spend night in a well-kept trailer home with a friendly hunter, who shares marijuana with them, they also get a shock seeing the guy's inbred cycloptic son, and then the next thing they know they end up in a Ku Klux Klan rally disguising themselves in the robes trying to avoid getting caught, but failing and being chased. While Fox is still ignoring any indication that the two escapees are actually American, Harold and Kumar are saved by Neil Patrick Harris, who is under the influence of magic mushrooms, takes them to a brothel where he spends time with a large breasted prostitute, and the duo talk issues with the girls, but they flee after a prostitute is branded, and Harris is shot in the back. They do eventually arrive in Texas and get to Colton, but get caught by Fox and end up almost heading back to Guantanamo Bay, they end up falling with a parachute from a plane and getting assistance from George W. Bush (James Adomian), he helps pardon their crimes, they rush to Vanessa's wedding to Colton, he gets a punch in the face from Harold, and Kumar reconnects with Vanessa, the three go to Amsterdam together, where Harold reunites with his ex Maria, oh, and Neil Patrick Harris survived getting shot. Also starring Jack Conley as Deputy Frye, Roger Bart as Dr. Beecher, Jon Reep as Raymus, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Missi Pyle as Raylene, Beverly D'Angelo as Sally, Echo Valley as Tits Hemingway and Eddie Kaye Thomas as Rosenberg. The leading actors were much better in their previous film but relatively alright, the road movie could have been done much better, and the slapstick and some gross jokes just go a little too far on occasion, I didn't find myself laughing all that much, bits and pieces that weren't too disgusting or predictable made it sort of alright, but it was a bit of of disappointing comedy adventure. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few laughs can be found here and there, but it's a weak follow up to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this follow up to Harold &amp; Kumar go to White Castle, our inept duo are taking a trip to Amsterdam to see Harold's (John Cho) love interest who is working out there as a model. In typical fashion, the lads cause trouble before they are even on the plane when airport staff ask to carry out a 'random security check' on Kumar (Kal Penn). Kumar argues with the security staff member for checking him and no-one else and brands him a racist. He is let through after he causes a scene. This proves to be one of the better moments in the film. Once through security, the pair bump into Vanessa (Danneel Ackles) - Kumar's old flame and Colton (Eric Winter) who are due to get married in a week's time. This upsets Kumar as he still has feelings for his old flame.Once Harold &amp; Kumar are on board the plane, Kumar decides that he can't wait till he gets to Amsterdam in order to get high and proceeds to smoke a bong in the toilet of the plane (this explains why he caused a scene at the airport and didn't want to be searched - security staff thought he was trying to make a point, but it was actually so that he could get through without being searched - which I thought was a good double bluff). When a passenger spots the bong, Kumar announces that it is a bong, but the pair end up being arrested when Air Marshalls on board mishear him and think that he said 'BOMB'. The pair end up being sent back to the US as suspected terrorists where they are subsequently sent to Guantanamo Bay where they will await their trial. The pair escape when 'actual terrorists' in the adjoining cell overpower the 2 guards. They flee to the US and head to Texas to track down Colton as they believe that his influence in government will help them to prove their innocence. However, government agent Ron Fox ( Rob Corddry) is hot on their heels and is determined to bring them back to Guantanamo Bay.This was a bit of a mixed bag for me so I'll start with parts of the film that for me weren't funny - the Klu Klux Klan scene for one. I also thought that Neil Harris was funny in the first film, but in this film I found him irritating and it almost felt like he was trying too hard to be funny. The scene where the government agents are interviewing Harold's parents and they wrongly assume that they can't speak English was funny at first, but then when the same joke was repeated about twice more it quickly became unfunny.There were good points to H &amp; KEFGB; I thought that Rob Corddry was excellent as the arrogant government agent Ron Fox. His ineptness was one of the highlights of the film. The chemistry between Harold &amp; Kumar was great again. There were a couple of other good scenes (the airport security check scene and the scene where Harold &amp; Kumar wrongly assume that a group of black men are going to attack them when they approach them with a tyre iron and decide to flee - they were actually going to help them to fix their car after they damaged it). This was a clever scene as the audience are initially lead to believe that they are going to attack our hapless duo.In summary, there was the odd moment of gold here and there, but not enough moments for me to recommend watching H &amp; KEFGB. The writing in this sequel seemed uninspired and the writers of this sequel have clearly chosen to use crude and arguably offensive humour to try and get laughs. I don't object to crudeness in films as long as it is funny or original (or both preferably), but this is what lets H &amp; KEFGB down as a lot of the gags come off as being crude without being funny or original. The first film was much less crude and still managed to be much funnier than this sequel. I would suggest watching the first film and leaving this one well alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold &amp; Kumar continue their smutty, profane, nudity filled, oddly enjoyable adventures.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold and Kumar gained a tiny amount of publicity because the two titular leads are of non-Caucasian descent, not because of their pilgrimage to a burger chain restaurant. They got a sequel because the first film was funny and not mean spirited, and because the two leads Kal Penn and John Cho are so effortlessly likable and share strong chemistry.H &amp; K 2 is not as fresh or amusing as the first film, and it reaches a little much in trying to bring something new and R rated to the table ? everyone is searching for their own MILF type idea ? but it is worth a look all the same.Picking up immediately after the first film left off as the lads prep for their trip to Amsterdam to chase down Harold's 'elevator-action' buddy Maria, the film wastes no time in reminding us of the tone of the first. The first 3 or 4 minutes are built around a diarrhea joke and a masturbation joke inclusive of an unwanted money shot?Once the film proper starts it is just a case of hijinks aplenty for our American friends, as the film finds them;Being waylaid on their way to Amsterdam thanks to a drug related mishap.Before; Being incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay as suspected terrorists, where they avoid physical and sexual torture by immediately escaping. (Seriously, while the film informs us that they will be escaping the prison, you might have expected that this part of the plot might warrant more than 5 minutes of screen time. It doesn't.)Then; Trying to break up the impending wedding of Kumar's ex to a wealthy, powerful and privileged young man who seems 'too ideal' for her.While; On the run from the continued dogged pursuit of the FBI, primarily Agent Ron Fox (Rob Corddry), who is the one guy in America who is clearly incapable of seeing the facts.Then; Enjoying some Southern hospitality in all of its forms while once again in the esteemed ? and constantly intoxicated ? Doogie Howser MD aka Neil Patrick Harris (the 'P' stands for Poon-handler!).Before they; Run into a recently retired President of the United States, who helps them get high and resolve the entire misunderstanding in 5 minutes flat, and to think he is not remembered fondly by some folks.Harold and Kumar 2 is almost as enjoyable as the first film, though it has to try harder to entertain and misses the mark a couple more times than the original. Many of the jokes are recycled from the first movie ? some work, some? and it uses every stereotype in the book as fodder for its humour, somehow deciding that as it boasts two Asian-Americans on the cover (India is part of Asia!) that this is somehow its exclusive right to do so.I doubted that I would enjoy the sequel as I was so surprised to find value in the original to begin with ? and in truth it isn't as good a film. But in keeping with my rating scale I must say that it is indeed a film with a few notable moments, and as such warrants a 'pretty good' 5.5 score.Also I can't go without mentioning the strangely decent soundtrack. Same as the original the film contains many songs -none of which I have heard before ? and while none of them cause me to google them for more info, none of them make me cringe and recall just how out of touch with modern music I am. That doesn't happen too often these days, especially with a film so obviously not aimed at my demographic as this one.Final Rating ? 5.5 / 10. Harold and Kumar continue on their smutty, nudity filled profane and oddly enjoyable adventures. The rules state that this series will rapidly become a lame comparison of the original, for now they have avoided the jinx.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good as the first one with the duo, but this one is alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a more of a ballsy sequel with a more adult humor that is in your face. But the first Harold and Kumar is better than this one, the first one just worked for the most part despite all the random situation. It's not a movie you can take your kids to watch for sure, I saw an adult with two kids just walk out a few minutes into this movie in the theater. But these kinda movies are for adults so that is fine but sometimes the jokes felt a bit too forced at times. It just seemed like the movie just seemed to be pushing the limit with adult humor and it seemed a bit too focused on that to try and make it flow in a hysterical manner. But it just wasn't as funny for the most of the way through, it's interesting because of the shock humor but that is about it for the most part. The first Harold and Kumar although random most of way through was engaging because the direction flowed pretty well but that isn't really the case for this sequel. There is also more stereotypical and sexual and toilet humor this time but I didn't really find the movie all that funny as the original. Yeah it has some shock humor than and there but this time it seems to really just rely on the shock humor aspect without it flowing very well. Some reviewers say you can't really compare the previous movie to this one, but I personally think you really can since it's a stoner comedy once again with bunch of random things happening in between like the previous movie. If your drunk while watching this with a couple of friend it might be more funny and entertaining than it really is. Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad comedy, in fact it does have it's moments but it just isn't a great one that I personally could watch again and again later along the line. But for the first watch, it's a alright stoner comedy but nothing great. I give the movie props though but having some clever comedic parts revolving the comedic duo, although very few. At least the first one had scenarios that connected with each other, that isn't the case this time around. Anyways to get the full enjoyment out of this movie, be with a group of friends and get drunk while watching or something. Even when sober it's still a alright stoner comedy to watch but like I said nothing all that great, unless your really into shock humor. Plus the situations in this movie is just way too over the top ridiculous like South Park, but South Park is a cartoon show and a TV show at that. But as a movie this one just comes off as mediocre.6.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Develops more on plot and includes better likable characters than its predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without reading much into the film, I wasn't sure whether or not I would enjoy this film. After disliking the first Harold and Kumar film, I wasn't sure if should even bother watching Escape from Guantanamo Bay. However, I slightly liked this one better. It seemed to have a better plot, and was more constructed. Also its supporting characters (Rob Corddry, Daneel Harris, Eric Winter) were better and had more to offer. The writers developed them more and seemed to give them more to work with. The film started off where the first film one ended. Guantanamo Bay seemed less silly with its gags but also included some unfunny jokes. One scene that was intended to be funny but really wasn't, included a scene with Ed Helms translating English from Harold's parents in an investigation room directed to Rob Corddry. The scene made no sense and just didn't end up being funny. However, I think this film had more funny moments and I laughed more than I did while watching the first film (I laughed about once watching the original). Some good and memorable scenes in this film include: Rob Corddry intimated a black guy by pouring a drink of grape soda on the ground slowly, the scene with Harold and Kumar going to a party included females nude waist down (no pants), Neil Patrick Harris first appearance as a trucker who pick up Harold and Kumar, a George Bush character smoking and discussing weed in his house by H&amp;K randomly dropping by, and a hilarious yet slightly offensive scene with Harold and Kumar dropping by a KKK camp with members in costume, and a final scene on the airplane with Harold and Kumar dropping out the plane, following Rob Corddry dropping by taking shots with a pistol. Overall, I didn't really find the jokes funny, but they were better than the original. Though, the ending of this film was a little predictable, but it was better done than the original. I don't know if the third film in this series will be better, however, I think it can actually be pretty decent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing that made Harold and Kumar so appealing in their first film, "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle," was that they were just two ordinary guys driven by the very modest goal of finding the perfect burger to satisfy their munchies. But turn them into suspected terrorists on the lam from Homeland Security, ship them off to GITMO as detainees, and have them sharing doobies with none other than George W. Bush himself - all of which happens in "Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay" - and they lose the very thing we liked best about them: their relatability.John Cho and Kal Penn are as disarming as ever as the endearing potheads who'll go to just about any lengths to get a good high, and Neil Patrick Harris returns in a good-natured appearance playing a satirical version of himself, but the script reduces the movie to just another dumb, disjointed, anything-for-a-laugh action comedy that is long on gross-out gags and vulgarity and short on anything even remotely approaching genuine wit or humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the first Harold &amp; Kumar movie. If this one is any indication, the first one must have been one giant litany of teenage boy humor. Basically, our heroes (John Cho and Kal Penn) are on their way to Amsterdam with the aim of smoking as much pot as possible when a passenger mistakes Kumar for a terrorist, and our heroes get sent to Gitmo. They escape and the rest of the movie is one silly thing after another. I suspect that it was a fun experience to film "Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay". In my opinion, former "Daily Show" correspondent Rob Corddry - looking almost exactly like Alan Arkin - is the best cast member, as an FBI agent whose approach to everything is based on ethnic stereotypes.Anyway, it's a fun romp, if rather stupid.

		<fullReview>but I liked the comedy Harold and Kumar Go to the White Castle pretty much,mainly,because behind the rude humor there was intelligence.In other words,the vulgar humor was used as a medium for exposing valid messages and for making an acid satire on different stereotypes of the society.Plus,the humor had a touch of honesty which never made it offensive.Now,Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay is a disappointment because it tried to make the humor from the first part much more extreme and,by that way,the humor feels forced and it lacks of the honesty the first film had.This sequel tries to make a politic satire but I think it failed on that because it does not result too funny.Still,there are some good elements on this movie.John Cho and Kal Penn show the same charisma they had shown on the first film and I think they both made this movie better than what it really is.Besides,this movie did not bore me and it kept me moderately entertained.Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay is a disappointment.I think this film deserves a slight recommendation for Cho and Penn and because it is not boring but,for a much better comedy,I recommend you the first part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as bad and profane a movie as you can find. No redeeming qualities.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start off admitting that I enjoyed the first "Harold and Kumar" movie, but this one is a total disappointment to me. Within the thin story line are non-stop references to penises, vaginas, and body waste. It is as if they decided to see how "dirty" they could make it. There are many, many low points, but the lowest may be when the man from Homeland Security tore a page out of the book containing the Bill of Rights, reached into his underwear with it, and came out with a large brown stain of feces across the page. If that is your idea of an entertaining movie than by all means see it. For me, and I suspect a lot of other folks, this movie is just dirty, sophomoric material with no entertainment value.In the thin story line Harold and Kumar are on their way to Amsterdam but when Kumar insists on smoking some pot in his "smokeless bung" invention, a passenger sees him and incites "terrorist" panic. So the two boys are taken to Guantanomo Bay, where they escape after some very dirty homosexual references and eventually have to get to Texas to try and save their skins.Neil Patrick Harris is back as Neil Patrick Harris. He is giving them a ride and has to stop along the way to be serviced by a hooker. There we meet pornstar Echo Valley as Tits Hemingway who reportedly has a 65NN bust size, but not only is that not at all attractive, there is nothing else about her that is attractive.Total waste of a movie. If any of my friends were to ask, I would say "stay away." But I believe all my friends already know that.</fullReview>

It was like being on a roller coaster and feeling that you heart was going to give out.There cannot possibly be any ethnic group that was left out of the insults and racists jokes in this film. It also included every single crude fart and toilet joke they could think of.And, of course, it makes the government look like a complete bunch of boobs. Well, that part was accurate.It was still funny.It didn't hurt that it had Paula Garcés and Danneel Harris in it either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other than being more political (Anti-Bush), I can't see one thing that is new in this sequel. The "nude girls", "the busty wh*&amp;^", "the lesbian sex, "piss", "shit", "fart", "Doogie Howser". I think these "slacker" comedies are becoming too predictable and maybe too gross for sake of it. Another gear up and it will "Salo".Can't recall one laugh out loud moments. A few giggles here or there, but thats about it. Really not much to write about in terms of performances or writing. I get a feeling most of the stuff on these are impromptu. I mean if you run out of ideas you can always go back to nature "piss", "shit", "fart" and "f@#$".All in all, clearly makers were in a hurry to cash in a new found attention for the franchise. Harold and Kumar had basically gained attention after the DVD release. The first one was a decent effort where some of the jokes clicked. This one was a "bummer". Check it out if interested in "bottomless" young chicks. Can't think of one single incentive. Then again maybe that is a good enough reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't think the first Harold and Kumar movie was all that good, I would rate it at around 6 out of 10, maybe 7, but at least it had more than one funny part. In this sequel the only funny part, to me anyway, was the scenes with George W in the secret room. Other than this, it just plain sucked ass. The filmmakers seemed to rely on gross gags with little or no build up and while I like many films that are stupid/gross, I just could not like this one. It just seemed to fall short of funny, it was predictable and kinda boring and maybe a little uncomfortable. I regretted seeing it while I was watching it.I have been a fan of stupid, juvenile, slapstick, gross etc...comedy for my entire life. I think 40 year old virgin is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, same for knocked up, Dumb and Dumber so I thought this movie would be right up my alley, bummer! I wanted to laugh but it simply was not funny. Not well written, well acted nor well executed. Sorry :-(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few Comic Moments are it's Saving Grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I love the first film. "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" is enjoyable on so many different levels, mainly because of the complete and utter lack of thought behind it; that being said, the filmmakers managed to distract me from the fact that everything that was happening was absurd by the simple act of comedic timing.I was neither surprised nor shocked to find out that a sequel was in the works and had little doubt that it would probably be a terrible film. Not only because it is so hard to recapture an almost nostalgic feeling from a preceding film, yet also because it is so hard to try again the second time."Escape from Guantanamo Bay" seemed like and hour and half of trying way too hard to be funny. What was so great about the first film, at least to me, was that the filmmakers knew they weren't making an Oscar worthy flick, nor a film that would be widely accepted: they were making a movie that they found funny, pot jokes and toilet humor included.And while the sequel included all of these immature things, it also came with a sense of being forced, all these cliché jokes which have been overused so many times by countless up-and-coming comedians that anyone could see them coming a mile away.I will give credit where it is due, however. There were a few times (very few, however) where I could not help but laugh incredibly hard. Somehow, and I'm not exactly sure exactly how, they managed to recapture what was so funny about the first film. Mainly, they were the scenes involving Neil Patrick Harris and the guy playing President Bush. Those scenes were so very different than I was expecting that the comedy that happened in them seemed liked gold, even if what was happening was the same stuff I have seen in countless other films.I usually try to leave the brain at the door when I am seeing these kind of movies...and that usually works. But it was almost too hard to even do that as I watched "Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay." Even the thoughtless stoner comedy had me going..."Um, this is stupid." I'm not saying it's not funny...nor am I saying it isn't enjoyable. However, if you are looking to enjoy it as much as the first film, you'll probably be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I Love Harold and Kumar... the characters are a great couple of friends that do stuff that are funny and you get a great feeling of appreciation of them.As Soon as me and my friends watched the first one, we waited like 2 years or so for the sequel to come out because we thought H&amp;K was such a great movie that the sequel HAD to be good. As soon as we found out, it was out, we watched it and it started quite good but after like 15 minutes the story just got quite weird and the jokes were terrible, but because we taught "This movie HAS to be good, come on it's Harold &amp; Kumar" but the further we got in the movie we found out that it makes absolutely no sense at all... the first movie had a point, a goal, in the second movie that goal is more the side story.After we saw the cyclops-scene we almost turned the movie off... come on people ... Harold &amp; Kumar are simple characters, doing simple stuff (exept for the cheetah and the paragliding off course) but the sequel is soo going over it that it's just awful.I'm not writing off H&amp;K (I really hope the makers make up for the sequel) and I'm definitely going to watch the third one but the makers really have to put some work in it ... go back to the basics ... special effects aren't the point in movies like these.To other people who like H&amp;K: H&amp;K rule, The sequel is an abomination</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing sequel, to an unexpectedly funny comedy franchise. I watched the original after constant insistence by nearly everyone around me. It was ridiculous, but funny, sure of itself, and had a decent enough message, it was good zany, bong curdling fun.This was kind of all over the place, and not in keeping with the laugh a minute pace of the first film. Also some of the jokes feel like bad revisits of material in the first film,(yet another rural house with a crazy hick and attractive wife).The reason this movie fails is that all of the secondary characters and actors from the first film, were funny, and unpredictable, here there either not funny, or not interesting. The entire Guantanamo Bay scenario seemed underdeveloped, like they were trying a on a parody a few sizes too large. Things were much funnier, simpler, and entertaining when the trip was just to White Castle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Example of Suffering Sequel Syndrome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as I finished Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, I couldn't wait for the sequel. And now I didn't have to wait any longer. Going into this movie I expected a extremely funny, dirty, and a possibly racism driven adventure. I thought the the writers from the last movie would exhibit their talent for making Dick flicks of a high quality. Unfortunately, I was hugely disappointed. This film did not warrant as many laughs as the last movie did. It carried the same flow of the first film but became progressively bigger and bigger, too big for the movie itself. The racism jokes I was so eagerly expecting, as i am of Indian Origin ha ha, came off as extremely stereotypical and stuff that I hear everyday. Watching the movie was like living out a day at school except without the whole crazy adventure part. I will admit that there were some hilarious scenes but they drowned in the depth of horrible jokes and nonsensical plot line, even for Harold and Kumar. I'm all for a little display of skin in such a movie as this but H&amp;K:EFGB was a borderline porn movie making it disgusting rather than edgy. I went to this movie with a couple of testosterone driven big boys to enjoy some good old sex comedy movie but we were all hugely disappointed after it was over. It portrayed itself as funny, it was at parts, when it really wasn't. I'm a 19 year old guy from Montreal: I laugh at stupid nudity jokes, south park episodes and I am a huge fan of the first H&amp;K movie so hear this, Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo bay is at best a 2 dollar download from Itunes or a 1 dollar rental from your nearest store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold and Kumar Escapes from Randomness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched the first Harold and Kumar, I thought the film was hilarious. Two Asian dudes that goes on a crazy adventure just to get themselves some burgers. Memorable scenes were, Freakshow, Bobby Lee as the student, EEXXXTRRREEEEMMME, the Black guy in jail scenes and beating the Bag of Weed wife.Unlike the first film, I don't think there were such memorable or funny scenes. But does that make the sequel bad? No. Why? Because this time, we have a plot! The quest is not just one linear goal now. The first film had Harold believing in himself and not doing other people's work, whereas Kumar had accepted that he is good at medicine. This second time around, their emotional goal is to grow up and find love.Having hilarious flashbacks, EMO HAROLD, the writers "plant the seeds" for what happens later on in the film. And it works effectively. It gives the film a full circle appeal and much more touching than the first film. Neil Patrick Harris cameos in this film again, but I don't think his scenes were that funny. Not as funny as how he humps Harold's driver's seat in the first film.Again, this film really is just a series of gags and racial commentary from start to finish and this time with more boobage. The love story is the icing on the cake which made me enjoy this film more than the first. Not all the scenes were good though, I didn't really find the George Bush scene that funny, but I guess it was written as a device to get keep the story going.So the writers and directors, Hurwitz and Schlossberg, have definitely matured form the first film. At least in their writing, mimicking the Apatow group, IE, 40 yr old virgin, Superbad and Knocked Up, has given the characters more depth instead of just randomness. This film, I would say, has grown from Family Guy to South Park quality. Harold and Kumar are will probably be memorable characters in film history. Whether or not they will make a third movie remains to be seen. The ending closes up nicely, but seeing that they made over $14Mill in their first weekend might say otherwise...3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold and Kumar cannot escape the awfulness of this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though sequels usually have a hard time measuring up to the first movie, I was expecting at least a few laughs from 'Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay'. I ended up wincing and cringing more than anything. This is among the worst movies of the year that I have seen. Sure I was expecting crudeness and vulgarity but this one reaches a new level and it is more of those things than funny. Add to that, the none-gross or pornographic scenes were plain boring. 'Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay' takes off where 'Harold and Kumar Go To White Palace' end. John Cho and Kal Penn reprise their roles and pretty much walk the same line but I found them less funnier here. Though one good thing that comes out of the film is that it implies how ignorant Americans have become towards other cultures since 9/11 and how they are quick to judge based on stereotype. The only sequences that I found amusing were the airport check-in scene and the sequence in the airbus (with the suspecting old lady). However, this is too bad of a film for me to talk much more about.</fullReview>

I loved it the first time i saw it and loved it when I watched it the day before yesterday.I really, really wanted to like this movie. I would have been happy to get just a little bit of the feeling that the first movie gave me.The first movie was just so fresh and funny and made me feel good. I liked harold and Kumar and wanted them to get to white castle and have the feeling that R&amp;G got at hotdog heaven.I just sat there listening to unfunny line after another and the audience wasn't laughing except a couple of idiots that laughed at everything including the unfunny previews.This was your typical sequel with a LOT of T&amp;A to make up for the lame plot and script. Remember,the first H&amp;K movie really didn't have a plot. Think about the lampoon movies and how the first was sometimes good but the sequel was all T&amp;A. Remember Animal house and how great it was seeing it? Then they give us Animal house 2 to try an rekindle the feeling the first movie gave us.I would have been much happier watching the first H&amp;K movie at the house with myself or some friends.I give it a 2 because of the few funny lines from bush and the doogie thing but for me, I'll be happy watching the original again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly can't believe all of the great reviews people are giving this "film". I have seen White Castle, and it was nothing short of brilliant. The sequel is absolute tripe. First off, many of the scenes will just plain make you cringe--and not in the good way. Over the top, stupid, gross. Nothing works in this movie. Secondly, the few funny scenes were not that funny--more like "heh". Rob Cordry is the only reason this gets a 4/10. He was great. This movie had a lot of potential, and the directors/writers really blew it. BTW, isn't Kal Penn the biggest box office poison ever?***************************Spoilers**************The threesome scene with Kumar, the chick, and the big bag of dope might be the most unfunny scene in comedy history. (The dope bag has a vagina, and both humans proceed to screw it.) Kumar masturbates and ejaculates on his own face. Again, over the top makes-you-cringe type stuff. Neil Patrick Harris was great in the first one; but he was not convincing this time as a drug abusing, sex-addicted straight man.</fullReview>

Maybe if you are a 15 year old male (or extremely immature adult) you would find a few laughs but it was obvious these guys were just collecting a paycheck. Disgusting, implausible story lines and even Doogie Howser looked like he was just going through the motions. Note to directors and writers: don't work while you're high, wait until the end of the day. Don't get me wrong, I loved the first movie because it showed their personalities and quirks. The sequel showed their mannerisms exaggerated to the point of being forced and phony.

I won't ruin anything for anybody, but I will tell you to go out and see the movie immediately,and drag your friends along with you. And then buy the DVD when it comes out so that we can have another adventure with our Marijuana Minorities of Movie Magic!! I for one am going again on Saturday... and Sunday. I know a lot of conservative people that post on here were concerned about it being too political, but it really wasn't. The movie isn't like anti terrorist punishment or anything, it just shows how ignorant a lot of Americans are post 9/11. And if that's the way the real Bush is in real life, he just went up like 12 points in my book.I never thought I'd say that, but this movie makes the impossible possible.Very few people seemed to know they should hang back after the credits. I usually do anyway, so I got to see the little peak into the possible H&amp;K3.And a magic thing happened. Where usually after an awesome movie, me and my friends are the only ones who stand and applaud at the end, this time, we were joined by all of our fellow audience members...

It felt as if the director was trying too hard to put crude after crude situations with no reason other than to make the crudest of all movies.

		<fullReview>Recap: Harold and Kumar has decided to go to Amsterdam, following Maria, the girl of Harold's dreams that he finally met in the last movie. However, when they are mistaken for terrorists the trip takes a detour to Guantanamo Bay. To prove their innocence they have to escape, get back in to the US and go to Texas were a friend with connections can help, who by the way is about to marry Kumar's old girlfriend. But the government agents are just a step behind and Harold and Kumar is yet again set for an adventure.Comments: Not hilarious but still funny kind of a road trip movie with a lot wacky events for the two main characters. The jokes are a little too obsessed with drugs, getting high and female anatomy. Some unmotivated nudity, but it is in line with the movie. If you would find that disturbing, this movie is certainly not for you. If you don't, this is movie to relax to. Don't think, just watch and enjoy.A sequel that is set precisely after the original, but filmed and released four years later, it still seems that it could have been made at the same time. It is just more of the same, but as the first movie obviously met with success, why change? After having seen the trailer I expected that this would have evolved a little compared with the original, but it didn't really meet my expectations. The first, Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle are still a little better.6/10</fullReview>

On the plane, Kumar lights up his new bong, but the air marshals think it's a bomb, and Harold and Kumar are arrested as terrorists and sent to Guantanamo Bay. They manage to escape, make their way to Florida, and head for Texas to find Kumar's ex-girlfriend's fiancé, the well-connected Colton, and get him to intercede with Washington on their behalf. Kumar still has a thing for Vanessa, the feds are in hot pursuit, and the legal weed of Amsterdam seems a long way away.The first time I saw this movie, it was very late and I was pretty drunk, and I found it pretty good. Three years later, I'm watching on a Sunday afternoon, and I see the movie for what it is, a quick cash in on a sleeper hit.It's really not that funny, and Kumar has to be one of the most unlikable characters ever committed to screen who is supposed to be the hero.Gags are flat, Nudity is cringeworthy and prolonged too much making it unfunny, and the saving grace is NPH, but he's in it for such a small time, it's hardly worth it.If you enjoyed this, it's because of diminished expectation. The first movie was a little treat, and between that and this, not many good comedies have been released, so you believe that you enjoy it.I didn't.</fullReview>

But walking out of the theater I was blown away at just how much funnier this one was. It had way funnier jokes way more actors also very funny people and much higher production values which is great because a couple of the scenes from the first one were almost hard to look at.This movie is about Harold and Kumar who decide to go to Amsterdam. They board a plane and Kumar who brought a bong on the plane decides to go smoke weed in the airport bathroom. He has made this bong smokeless so you cant smell any of the smoke but a person sees them and thinks its a bomb instead of a bong. Over this mistake they get sent to quantanamo bay.This movie is absolutely hilarious one of my favorite comedies by far. It blew away the first one and it blew away the third one.

		<fullReview>Follows the cross-country adventures of the pot-smoking duo as they try to outrun authorities who suspect them of being terrorists when they try to sneak a bong on board their flight to Amsterdam.It's rare to see a classic comedy SEQUEL to actually be a good one. I expected, but not too much. And I received, a lot more honestly. The first Harold and Kumar was especially one of the best comedies I have ever seen. It has the formula of the classic stoner comedies, but it brought more to the genre. I praise it for it's HIGH entertainment factor and it's hilarity. So this all meaning I had high expectations for this sequel, except the whole different director thing. Now the film does give us what we didn't expect, but it also has, yes... the flaws. The film is a throwback to the predecessor. It has the right timing, the right lines, and the right stuff. The sequel, respectfully lives up to it with giving it a flair of extra controversy, stereotypes, and of course the extra load of vulgarity. While all this sounds GREAT, we finally move on to the bad stuff. The film TRIES to hard. Yup, it gives us what we want but it seems as if they wanted to give us that in the hardest way possible. Scenes like the "sex scene" with the bag of weed tried TOO hard to get the magic of the first, but nevertheless, I must digress: the film still has it. Sure, the film stalls at points, and we're yelling at the screen telling it to move on but as the first did, the film redeems itself with classic scenes. If you don't enjoy South Park, your not going to enjoy this because that's the closest thing Harold and Kumar compares to. I found the last 15 minutes pointless, as well. It wasn't needed nor funny, but we still had something. Bringing in a romantic sub-plot to a stoner comedy in a tricky thing to do, but I admit Harold and Kumar somehow, someway made it happen, almost. The following is a message to the offended and the action-takers: this is a movie, MEANT to offend. Thank you. I found this installment good, but not great. I found the first to be more of a classic, and this one being quite a well-done sequel. The final score for Harold and Kumar: Escape from Guantanamo Bay is a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (2008) ** (out of 4) Sequel picks up hours after Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) got to munch down some White Castle burgers. The duo board a plane to Amsterdam so that Harold can follow his true love but on the plane Kumar pulls out a bong, which an old lady mistakes for a bomb. The two are thrown into Guantanamo Bay because it's believed they're terrorist but they manage to escape and must try and reach safety. This sequel isn't nearly as good as the first movie and I think the majority of the blame can go towards the screenplay. The original movie certainly wasn't CITIZEN KANE but it was charming enough because it took the viewer on a strange ride for something as simple as trying to get food after smoking weed. This sequel isn't nearly as creative and instead of trying to come up with something original we basically get a rehash of the first film. To make matters even worse is that it's clear the screenwriters ran out of ideas and instead of trying to come up with something original they elected to go for some cheap gross-out humor. I love the over-the-top humor that you can get through gross jokes but this film misses the boat entirely. It seems as if they thought as long as you were gross that it would get laughs but it's not that easy. Two of the dirty jokes happen before the credits are over and deals with a masturbation joke and a toilet one. Neither joke gets a laugh and they just come off so cheap and lifeless that it really gets the film off on the wrong foot. Things slowly start to pick up in a form of humor that was the most dangerous. The entire terrorist plot certainly reminds people of 9/11 and the filmmakers were walking a very tight line but they managed to make these jokes funny without being offensive. Every racial group pretty much gets made fun of here and the majority of this humor is funny. Especially memorable is when the boys run into some "thugs" in Alabama and then run into the KKK a short time later. One of the best moments in the film is when the boys get high with President Bush. I won't ruin what happens but this is the perfect example of the creative writing that was sadly missing from the rest of the film. Both Cho and Penn fit their roles just nicely and Neil Patrick Harris does another good job playing himself. The supporting players are fairly good as well. HAROLD &amp; KUMAR ESCAPE FROM GUANTANAMO BAY is a major letdown from the first film but there are enough laughs to make it worth viewing. Still, you can't help but wish it was better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Doper Bob and Doug Mackenzie Return</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rent and see the "unrated" version. This could be the most over-the-top live action film since "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle." What appeals to me is the extremely extreme toilet humor: it is meant to send the audience into hysterics, rather than challenge cultural mores or push the envelope. That envelope was pushed long ago... What's perhaps not appreciated of Harold and Kumar is their genuine lack of immaturity. Say what? Indeed, they're adults and get themselves into adult situations, albeit bad ones. They also do their best to get themselves out of said situations by their own bootstraps. Harold works for a living, Kumar will, soon, blaze through medical school. Buut for now, it's time to light up... This kind of high-minded, deadpan bathroom humor can trace itself back to Monty Python's Flying Circus. The drug humor is a direct descendant of the best of the Cheech and Chong films (my favorite is "Nice Dreams"). The completely off-the-wall physical comedy is straight out of a Three Stooges playbook. Watching "Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay," last night, I realized that I was watching an NC-17 version of "The Great White North," where the Mackenzie brothers scheme to get free beer but end up getting involved in a nefarious conspiracy... all the time either not really caring or questioning things that look out of the ordinary. Consider their brief stint at Gitmo: when faced with the imminent prospects of a "cockmeat sandwich," Kumar, rather than think his way out of the situation, is genuinely perplexed at the sexuality of the guards. he's not trying to be slick or think his way out of things: he really wants to know - a very funny "how can you think of such things at a time like this" moment. Most of the film is like that and, of course, Neil Patrick Harris' reprise of his "Ubermensch" persona outdoes what he did in 2004.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first film was an excellent comedy consisting of two stoners going on a road trip to find the most delicious tastiest burgers. Kumar is a laid back Indian dude and his buddy is Harold, an uptight Korean dude bordering on the obsessive compulsive.The film picks up the story from before and the duo head off for Amsterdam in order to get Harold's girl. On the way they encounter all manner of weird and wonderful situations and characters including the President!Having read the criticisms on IMDb I gave this film a miss before stumbling upon it on. In actual fact it is just as funny as the original.Pros - Funny!Cons - Sticks to a winning formulaOverall - Dope</fullReview>

The trailers looked hilarious and the movie was hilarious as well.The plot involves the two stoners going to amsterdam to meet up with Harold's girlfriend from the first movie.In the airport they see Kumar's ex who is about to be married.On the plane, Kumar tries to smoke up in the bathroom using a weird looking bong, an old lady confuses it for a bomb and shouts "TERRORIST".The two get sent to Guantanamo Bay, escape and go on a series of wild misadventures trying to clear their names.This is a funny and great stoner film and I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were some genuinely funny sequences that caught me off guard and some really messed up twists. I won't include any spoilers so check it out for yourself. I personally like this one better than the first. John Cho and Kal Penn again have on screen chemistry per usual and I thought that gov't agent did an amazing job. Overall, the casting was spot on with 'W' one of the best spoofs I have ever seen. Surprised I have never seen him before on late night television. Is there going to be a 3rd installment? (Pun intended) This film is not a 'family' movie so I personally wouldn't recommend parents to watch this with their kids. Enjoyable nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo BayStarring: John Cho, Kal Penn, Rob Corddry, Neil Patrick Harris, David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas and Paula GracesGenre: ComedyRated: ROur favorite stoner dynamic duo return in another hilarious adventure. The movie picks up where our heroes left off in the first movie, where they had their night adventure of founding White Castle. Harold &amp; Kumar (John Cho &amp; Kal Penn) are on there way to Amsterdam to see Harold's girlfriend, Maria (Paula Graces) until Harold &amp; Kumar get mistaken for terrorists when Kumar brings a smokeless bong onto the plane and get sent to jail in G-bay. Now our heroes must clear their names as they go on the run from the Homeland Security team led by Ron Fox (Rob Corddry). The movie delivers a lot more laughs for a sequel. I really can't wait for the third Harold &amp; Kumar movie! The only thing that they did like in the first movie was all the quirky situations that Harold &amp; Kumar run into while on the adventure and of course the return of the womanizing (yet fictionalized) Neil Patrick Harris. I also liked how they made a love interest for Kumar and to see how Harold &amp; Kumar were in they're college days. Harold &amp; Kumar are my freaking heroes and I so can't wait for the third movie! Good sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I must say about Harold and Kumar's second trip is that in my opinion it was just as entertaining as the first. Sure, the plots silly and all but I didn't really care as the movie had hilarious gag after gag, and again Neil Patrick Harris stole the show. And Rob Corddry was great too, which is surprising because the only other thing i've seen him in was that rather terrible television show The Winner, but he was pretty enjoyable as the fbi agent in this movie. As for flaws, again some jokes didn't work but hey it's still pretty good and well worth the time. I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first movie. well worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, I was pretty impressed and I wanted to see the sequel real bad. So when it came out on DVD, I rented it and watched the unrated version. It was pretty shocking to find out that Kumar used to have an actual girlfriend before. Even more shocking that it was thanks to her that he started smoking weed. And like in the first one, this movie shows that there are still racist people in this world. So if you want to get a good laugh, see some crazy things(a.k.a the bottomless party), and have a good time, I totally recommend this movie. Some of it was ridiculously over-exaggerated, but overall, it was still a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie and I loved every moment of it. I was really thinking this would be a super simple standard jokes comedy like American Pie or the likes and in a way that's even true! The weed and sex jokes, the stereotypes, everything is included. But (big but!) brought in such a great way, you could almost say classy (compared with the rest in the genre at least:)). The characters aren't stupid noisy simpletons but intelligent funny people. They play a believable part and you just cannot not like them!So although it's still a typical stoner/sex/stereotypes comedy, with a super standard storyline, even with quite the corny ending, it's very refreshing and even puts a lot of things in a nice perspective. There is not a dull moment in it. I really have a good feeling now after watching it. Loved it!</fullReview>

It's on par with the first one, but dirtier. Penn and Cho do a really good job reprising their roles as Harold and Kumar, and the girl who plays Vanessa is the sugar on top of this masterpiece! I was surprised to see Eddie Kay Thomas in this one, but having him in the film made it better! I would have liked to see the "Extreme" punks return and would have preferred that NPH not been shotgun blasted and left for dead, but there's always room for improvement in the next one.This film has full frontal female nudity in it which was deliciously sweet and hilarious. The male full frontal nudity, not so much. That particular scene was hilariously disgusting. This one isn't for children, but it is good for laughs.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing I could remember about the first film was Neil Patrick Harris. So to me, that wasn't a great push to watch the sequel, but it came on HBO as part of their free weekend, so I watched it.It was good. It was so politically incorrect and crass that I loved it. I was on the lookout for Mr. Harris again and he didn't disappoint, but the ideas in the movie, though crude, where fun and original. It didn't skate totally on pot jokes like the first one. A lot of the humor was smart. The math poem was very interesting too, almost a bit too smart for this film, but that added to the overall enjoyment that a stoner type comedy could be fun.I like this more than Pineapple Express. I don't smoke pot, so maybe if I did, I would get the references more, but too much pot humor and it gets very boring for me. The sex jokes weren't constant and a lot of times ironic, like when neither guy gets it on with the ladies in the whorehouse. It's a smart stoner film. Can there be such a thing?</fullReview>

How great is Rob in every scene...totally dedicated to Home Land Security and racial profiling! NPH is given a small role...he needs his own movie and I have a feeling that he could pull off a couple hours of big budget movies as the main character! The comedic atmosphere is so over the top...the Bottomless Party with nothing but hot chicks with full frontal nudity in every shot while the guys are conveniently covered up...perfect for the 80% male dominated audience.Also just for the overly stoned audience this movie makes sure you know what is going on because they repeat the plot verbally at least twice throughout.9/10!!

		<fullReview>They're back! Years after the widely successful "Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle," comedy's most underrated duo returns for yet another hilarious outing in "Escape from Guantanamo Bay." On their way to visit Harold's (John Cho) girlfriend in Amsterdam, an elderly woman accidentally mistakes Kumar's (Kal Penn) homemade bong as a bomb, and they're promptly arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay, where they endure some pretty cruel punishments.They escape and hitch a Cuban boat to America, and make their way to Texas, where Kal's former lover is getting married to a prominent man who has sway with the government. Along the way, once again, they come into contact with some of the best people in the world (including an Alabama family with more than a few skeletons in the closet, as well as a southern brothel). Neil Patrick Harris also reprises his role as...Neil Patrick Harris, and once again he delivers comedic gold.Throughout the humor in the film, you can also find some political satire. The man who's chasing after our bumbling heroes repeatedly makes harassing comments to African Americans, Asians, Indians, and Jews. And the overzealousness of stereotyping especially Middle Eastern people as terrorists is the basic premise of the whole film.I would highly suggest seeing this film, not just for the laughs, but for a personal reflection about how we view different people in society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched White Castle a while ago, and I can definitely say that this is one of the rare cases where a sequel surpasses the original, and does it with style. One of the reasons is that it references the first movie in many interesting ways, as well as many other movies.This is a brave movie. It pokes fun at very serious subjects, like racial stereotypes and the failed/criminal efforts of the American government after 9/11. But it does so in a way that raises awareness as well as laughs from the audience.Also, it's a movie that isn't afraid of getting down and dirty. Watch the Unrated version to see what I mean. This movie features some very graphic scenes, but it doesn't get in the way of the fun. The gross factor is reduced, which helps, but there's enough humor to entertain nearly anyone.And it departs from the "Stoner" genre too much, which is a welcome change. Harold &amp; Kumar are this century's Cheech &amp; Chong, albeit much funnier. But the same spirit of freedom and freshness are here.I also have to agree with other reviewers and take my hat off to Neil Patrick Harris - he steals every scene he's in. All the other players are very good, and the caricatures are so well done that you sometimes wonder if that's how people would behave in real life - such is the level of irony and absurdity, which are just the right weapons to deal with heavy subjects.8/10</fullReview>

There are so many funny funny parts to this movie!!! Unfortunately the representation of our president was miserable! Didn't they do a better job with the actor who did That's my Bush! They shoulda got him, it woulda made it alawt better. Anyways I highly identify with Vanessa. She was a great addition. I definitely for see a Harold and Kumar beginnings movie. Depicting them in school before White Castle... Because there are alawt of references to people they knew before, but we as the audience, aren't familiar. I believe that the American Pie genre is way over and the the Harold and Kumar genre is about to begin!!! I can't wait for another movie!!! I love that they advocate marijuana in this movie! The more we portray it as an average American thing to do, the quicker it's going to become just that! God this movie is just filled with great writing and jokes, and i believe in no way that Neil Patrick Harris is dead!!! He will live again!!!! Hope you have a great time seeing this movie, and know that i didn't really spoil anything!</fullReview>

The DVD gives you two version: rated and unrated. Definitely stick to unrated if watching with the rest of the Frat House. Otherwise, if you use and your 18 year old son or daughter you may be fast forwarding through scenes.I would usually write there are a ton of Tivo moments. In this case use You Tube.

		<shortDescription>Terrific Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*TONS OF SPOILERS*The sequel "Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay" picks up only a few hours where the first film left off. After a 4 year span between the two movies it's incredible the stars don't change a bit. They still, look the same, act the same, and continue their misadventures while encountering strange people. Is this film a rehash of "White Castle?" NO. Does the hilarity and cleverness equal the first movie? Hell yes!! If you enjoyed the first movie, you're in for a real treat in the second one. But beware, for the raunchy jokes come rapid-fire and nonstop. If you have a weak stomach you might not want to eat when you see this. I felt queasy mostly when Kumar took a big, loud dump while Harold was in the shower. Eating dozens of white castle hamburgers can do that. Later in the film there is the "bottomless" pool party. I wouldn't go too much into detail. Finally there were KKK members urinating on Harold and Kumar.Harold and Kumar decide to go to Amsterdam, for Harold to be reunited with his love interest Maria. But they are mistaken for terrorists and then imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay by a blundering special agent (Rob Corrdry). Note: I couldn't stop laughing when he interrogated witnesses who although told the truth he thought they lied. He bribed people with items associating to racial stereotypes. They break out of prison easily, but now the hard part is getting to a friend in Texas who has a high position in the govt. He's the only one who can clear their name. While on their adventure they meet members of the KKK, meet a cyclops-like offspring of a brother and sister, meet the president, stop a wedding in Texas, and go to a brothel with Neil Patrick Harris who also comes for his share of laughs. John Cho and Kal Penn are more appealing now than they were in the prequel. Especially Kal Penn who has achieved fame through past films, House, and the internet. This is a laugh-out loud comedy not to be missed.</fullReview>

At times the movie was educational and lent hand in showing some aspects of people who are not well traveled. Dump portrayal was best,romanticism was thrown in such a way that people might look in a different way now arranged marriage guys. Having packed so much fun in this short time, it needs a sequel besides the improvement from White Castle is huge. Personally, I would not like to see president the way they showed but not bad if we compare to David Letterman's Jo Leno's show.

		<shortDescription>The Journey Continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of the most hysterical and absurd scenarios Harold and Kumar (John Cho and Kal Penn) smoke dope with George W. Bush (James Adomian) at the Bush ranch in Texas. Kumar says,"Sir, you are so awesome!" Harold, Kumar, and the President bond while smoking pot and talking about never living up their fathers' expectations. Kumar's acknowledgment follows George W. telling his Dad to f--- off. Director and Writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg's sequel "Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay" is hilarious absurdist fun. If possible "Escape from Guantanamo" is cruder than "White Castle". Although more ridiculous, Hurwitz and Hayden's script is not as clever as the original which had a weird stoner charm."Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay" boldly offends all ethnic groups, with no one left out. This is really props for the movie. Hurwitz and Hayden navigate treacherous waters by nailing stereotypes, while being completely irreverent. When Harold screams at rich and politically connected golden boy Colton (comically smug Eric Winter), "I'm going to kick your ass!" Colton dismisses Harold, because he is not a "kung fu Asian guy". And Neil Patrick Harris returns as Neil Patrick Harris. This time mushroom high Neil is the Boys' unicorn riding spiritual guide?Harris is awesome.The movie pretty much starts where "White Castle" left off. Harold and Kumar board a flight to Amsterdam, so that Harold (Cho) can follow the love of his life Maria (beautiful Paula Garces)?but not be a stalker. However, Kumar's insistence on smoking his smokeless bong on the plane, along with an elder passenger mistaking the Indian Kumar as an Islamic terrorist, result their in federal arrest. Under federal custody our heroes are at the mercy of insipid substitute Homeland Security Director Fox (funny psycho Rob Corddry), and the more rational Dr. Beecher (stable Roger Bart) of the NSA. Convinced Harold and Kumar are North Korean and Al Qaeda terrorists, Fox sentences them to Guantanamo Bay. Though puzzlingly short lived, Harold and Kumar effect an escape before experiencing the dreaded "meat sandwich". Lucky for them. They make it to Miami, where Harold and Kumar seek out their bud Raza (funny flighty Amir Talai). Harold and Kumar experience the hysterically wild "bottomless" party at Raza's mansion. According to Raza, topless is "highly over hyped".An equally bizarre collision of coincidence determines Harold and Kumar's quest for Presidential pardon in Texas, and reuniting Kumar with the true love of his life and college sweetheart Vanessa (kooky and charming Danneel Harris). All shall be revealed in the movie viewing, and the spiritual guidance of Neil Patrick Harris. Harris is complete whacked out charm and cool."Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay" does not break new ground as a sequel. Although it contains gratuitous quality nudity, consumption of vast amount of recreational drugs, and ridiculously drawn stereotypes of just about everyone. The one constant is John Cho and Kal Penn's unwavering comic partnership and smarts. Cho gives an unnerved edge to Harold, who is really edgeless. Harold is the straight responsible one. Kal Penn is the misunderstood party animal, who really has a big heart. What works is that amidst the complete absurdity of their outlaw predicament, they are true friends and loyal to each other. Ultimately, their charm rides out some of the more contrived spots and formulae. After all running from the Klux Klux Klan in this movie is strangely predictable. Very strangely.See "Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay". It is hysterical. Okay, this sequel may not be the freshest of its kind, but it certainly delivers huge laughs and high jinx. Yes, "Harold &amp; Kumar" may be the most high jinxy movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, but I must say that in Québec, today was a pretty rainy day. So I decided to kill time by bringing my friend to the movie theater and watch Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay. Was it worth it? Definitely! Kal Penn and John Cho are so hilarious in this movie, and I really mean it. Of course, the film had it's nudity scenes, a lot of swearing, but still, it kills an hour and 40 real fast. I got pretty familiar with Harold and Kuamr right after the movie started, which was pretty nice. A cameo appearance by Neil Patrick Harris (as himself) was also pretty hilarious. I think that this movie, without being racist, is recommended to all Americans because you guys see terrorists about everywhere just like the paranoid old lady in the plane. Overall, great movie, but I don't recommend it for anybody under 14 years old (despite it's R rating)</fullReview>

Maybe I expected too much, at the very least I expected something original, not re-hashed jokes that weren't done well. The Whole "let's throw off people's stereo-types" didn't work for me.

Yeah, yeah, its a movie, but for a joke like that to work there has to be some believability to it.And what was up with George Bush's make up! It was freaking me out, bad latex mask didn't work for me, although I liked how the actor portrayed Bush, I could get past the bad make-up.The best parts of the film were with Niel Patrick Harris. They were great. But then the movie wtf pwned him :-/ .To sum up: not original, not very funny, not a good way to spend your $20 bucks on a Friday night.</fullReview>

That should tell you all you need to know about the quality of the comedy writing in this monstrosity.If you want to see a funny stoner-buddy movie, rent Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

		<fullReview>The rampant xenophobic paranoia of the US, heightened by the attack on the World Trade Centre, should have been easy pickings for anyone to ridicule and satirize to great effect. One has to wonder then why the best that the writer/director partnership can come up with is a muddle of insultingly predictable, unoriginal set-pieces and gags, presumably aimed at an audience which can barely tie its collective shoe laces let alone conceive of an original thought.Anyone familiar with the first 'Harold &amp; Kumar go to White Castle' film should expect much the same this time; very much the same in fact, but without any originality, creative humour, spontaneity, sensitivity, inventiveness, (the list goes on).While the first outing addressed significant issues with a refreshing lack of pretension, this sequel fails miserably from the outset and just goes downhill fast from there.Definitely aimed at the sub-100 IQ audience.IF YOU CAN READ THIS YOU ARE TOO SMART FOR THIS FILM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny at times but don't waste your money seeing this at an over-priced cinema. If you feel you must see it, then wait for the DVD (which you must rent for free at your local library) instead of paying for this crap. I don't normally see films like these but a friend of mine convinced me to go see it and while some bits were funny the film was mostly gross and offensive on all levels. I thought that John Cho was a cutie and he acted well but that's about it. I walked away from the film thinking about 101 ways to distance myself from any loser Kumar-like friends I might have. I'm rating it two stars because I liked John Cho's performance and because some bits of the film were actually hilarious. Like the scenes on the plane &amp; the part where a creepy inbred child climbs into bed with Harold. But, that was about it for me. If not for that, the film would deserve zero stars. I hated the female characters, especially Vanessa (her character was very irritating) and Maria was practically NOT in the film and whenever she did show up it was to irritate the heck out of me with her lack luster performance.</fullReview>

Me and my friends went through a bunch of crap to finally get tickets, including canceling our plans on the opening Friday, just missing every show (as they were sold out on sat. and yelling at each other about not missing the NFL draft) and we finally made it a late show on sun. The relief that we all felt after the movie was over couldn't have been a more welcomed emotion, as we all reflected on what felt like our own miniature adventure.As the title of this critique suggests, i've never enjoyed a movie so much. Alls i could think about when going to the movie is the soundtrack in the first one, just one minute element that made that movie as "hip" and "cool" to me as it did. There are always going to be dumb comedies featuring pot-smoking, but the array of characters, relationship among harold and kumar, the soundtrack, and sense of being a part of the adventure in the movie are all the components that make these two movies sooo much freakin fun.harold and kumar escape from guantanamo bay is flawless!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Raunchy Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay may be funnier than the time they went to White Castle. The same no-holds-barred low humor prevails, the screw turning tighter this time in a bottomless party (both sexes) and smoking serious weed with the president.The two picaresque heroes have been mistaken for terrorists, escape from the infamous Guantanamo, and finally travel to Texas to gain their freedom from the charges. But that's just the plot; the real joy of this slacker/stoner story is lampooning the conservative, sometimes neoconservative, power structure of America today, be it the over-profiling of Homeland Security or the hypocritical lawmakers who smoke the stuff but jail those others who do.From the first sequence, where the two attempt to get stoned on the plane even before they arrive at smoke-free Amsterdam to an evening with a redneck and his voluptuous wife, with a wild threesome in between, this film is recklessly ribald, exploding pretense while it evokes gut-level laughs. Neal Patrick Harris as himself visiting a Texas whorehouse to "get his f--- on" after eating way too many 'shrooms is just one of the many sidebars to this raunchy ride. Dialogue like this reveals an insidious intelligence behind the dorm-like humor: "Chloe: You remember that time you stole that monkey and put it in Rosenberg's dorm room? Kumar Patel: Had I known that the monkey had AIDS I never would have done that." If you didn't like the Slyders first time around, you won't like the bong this time. But if you demand your base humor be as low as it can go, you'll laugh as I did and wonder at your taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sober Stoners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going to White Castle need not be a particularly challenging endeavor. For Harold &amp; Kumar (John Cho &amp; Kal Penn), two perpetual stoner best friends, it proved to be the most monumental of achievements. Still, no matter how difficult the terrain became en route toward 30 burgers, four large fries and countless free refills of soda, they never lost hope. They overcame ignorance, confidence issues and Neil Patrick Harris to get what they most desired and solidified an already rock solid friendship in the process. Picking up at exactly the same point HAROLD &amp; KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE left off, HAROLD &amp; KUMAR ESCAPE FROM GUANTANAMO BAY finds the boys packing their bags for a spur of the moment trip to Amsterdam and the jokes about perfect pubic hair and messy bowel movements follow suit. Nothing has changed essentially (except for perhaps Kumar, who looks as though all that burger weight went instantaneously to his face), but it feels somehow different. Somewhere within the first few frames, maybe when Kumar ejaculated on to his face, I don't know, the high times come crashing down into a sobering and painfully unfunny trip.Do you know what else works about two stoners determined to reach a burger joint destination? It's plausible. It's two ordinary guys in an even more ordinary situation that must surmount a series of extraordinary obstacles. The fact that they're stoned the whole time only adds to the ridiculousness of it all, especially if you're also stoned at home watching. Although I have yet to test the theory, I'm fairly certain watching Harold &amp; Kumar's second caper high might make the whole mess that much more tedious. And while I'm on the subject, where was the weed in this movie? Sure it isn't all that likely that they would be able to find weed in Guantanamo Bay but scoring would be no less believable than their being there in the first place. Now we have a stoner movie where no one is getting stoned. What we're left with instead is a dulled teen raunch movie designed for the mind of the adolescent male, the one at the back of the class sketching boobs and penises because he isn't getting any action with either, when he should be paying closer attention to the history lesson being given. I resigned myself to my fate when the expected groans grew from the groins of all the teenage boys in the audience at the thought of Harold &amp; Kumar having to eat a cock-meat sandwich while in prison. If you're wondering what kind of delicacy this sandwich might be, don't. The name is self-explanatory. Naturally, the boys attempt an escape from Guantanamo rather than bite the sandwich, risking an almost certain death in the process. My hat is off to you for proving yet again what the obvious choice is between homosexual experimentation and death. With that, the gays are the first to be insulted by this horrifically ignorant film. While the film tries to expose the American population's generalized views of minorities, it does so in such a ludicrous fashion that it actually reverses upon itself. Tempting Jews with loose change or making a black man in street wear a credible witness by arguing that he is actually an orthodontist are examples of the writers asking us to laugh at and not with the characters. Seeing as how the jokes are dead long before the punch arrives, the audience is given a lot of time to think about just how unfunny a Korean guy and an Indian guy in Klu Klux Klan garb actually is. Two hours and I think I only laughed once (Thank you, NPH!). Harold &amp; Kumar themselves barely seem to like each other so seeing as how they're not having any fun, it sure isn't easy for us to have any. Stepping up their game from just writing last time out to both writing and directing this time around proves to be too much at once for Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. Their script is aimless and rehashes a lot of the same shtick from the first film. Their style is ? well, they don't actually have one. The cult love Harold &amp; Kumar found in the years since its initial release has gone directly to their heads and now they seem to live in this delusion that no effort is necessary and that they just have to show up to get the same results. Hmm, deluded, aimless and only funny to the guys telling the jokes, I guess it is a great stoner movie after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious - Much much better than the first one :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see a lot of people saying it was a dumb movie, waste of time, or not as good as the first one. I totally thought it was so much better than the first one, and I'm a girl! Yeah, I was the only girl there without a guy. But I had just watched the first one, and no guy was available to go with me! I am confident enough to go to such movies without a man :). Anyways, I thought it was extremely hilarious, had to groan in a few parts for the raunchiness. And as for the female nudity factor, and myself being a girl...i didn't care because I'm there for the comedy, not the nudity and Harold and Kumar were hilarious in the whole movie, so it made up for having to go through watching vagina after vagina. I thought Neil Patrick Harris shined in this movie, along with the guys who play Harold and Kumar. I was a fan of Neil's when he was the infamous teenage doctor to everyone...so it's truly hilarious to see him in the light he's put in in this movie. I thought it was funny that if there were any girls in the theater, they were with their man...i never heard one girl laugh...but I was laughing just as much, if not more, than the guys. I don't consider this just a guy movie. It's an ADULT COMEDY. I usually get tired of the fart jokes and stuff like that, but for some reason, in this movie, I thought they were extremely funny. My face almost hurt from laughing throughout the whole movie. So, I'd say, go see it, and don't think too much of what is going on (because you WILL be offended)...it's a comedy, so just have a good time :).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Send those Indians back to Africa!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In its obsession with race relations, the first "Harold and Kumar" movie was somewhat unique. We had East Indian and Asian heroes (itself an oddity in white-centric Hollywood, where even the most ethnic movies ooze off-screen whiteness), a constant bullying of ethnic minorities (via white privilege or parents who desire overachieving kids), and a fairly sustained reversal of various ethnic stereotypes. It was ultimately just a stoner movie, but it did some original things.The second "Harold and Kumar" film pushed things further by having our heroes mistaken for Arabs and terrorists. It mocked Homeland Security, Guantanamo Bay, flipped around African American and white-trash stereotypes and amped up its xenophobia. The villains of both films took the form of racist cops, racist state officials, skinheads and wealthy, WASP fraternity boys.The second film's jokes are crasser than the first. Where the first had some warmth, some heart, the second is almost completely cringe-inducing, relying wholly on shock value and gross-out gags (as grotesque art, its aims are actually oppositional to both comedy and satire). Hardly a moment goes by when the film isn't baiting you with some form of sexism, homophobia, racism, or other ism. It's Pasolini's "Salo" for slackers. Indeed, most of the film hinges on fears of men being penetrated (typical teen sex movie stuff, but treated more literally here), fears of homosexuality (giving and receiving blow-jobs, being urinated on, being raped, accidentally touching a penis etc), all of which are then aligned to a kind of invisible fascism. Everyone's fearing being penetrated, but there's a clear pecking order, everyone racially profiling someone else, be it wealthy whites labelling minorities "evil Arabs", or lowly KKK tribes labelling all non-whites "Mexicans".This is all loosely sandwiched between two scenes, one in which our heroes are uncomfortable being naked/intimate with one another (one's showering, the other using the toilet) and another in which our heroes must "touch penises" whilst parachuting. Here, survival depends on a kind of intimacy, trans or interracial friendship only possible when one jettisons all macho conceits and yields to near-queer sensitivity. Once this happens we're then dropped right into the home of George W. Bush, whom we're all now apparently homosocially "queer" enough to rehabilitate and take into our arms. The film sells out in its kind depiction of Bush ("To be patriotic you don't need to love the government, you just need to love the country," Bush says, a form of "support the troops not the war" disavowal and doublespeak), but even these scenes are interesting. Bush smokes marijuana whilst pontificating about jailing drug users, an insincere act which yet again highlights a pecking order. It doesn't matter if something is right or wrong, or gay or straight, what matters is who's making the rules, who's top dog. This folds back onto an earlier scene in which a mean Guantanamo jailer is accused of being gay because he's forcing our submissive heroes to perform fellatio. In the jailer's view, it's not "gay" to be a dominator, a giver. It's only gay to be receiver, or a recipient of penetration. Likewise, Bush's relationship with marijuana and The War on Terror. Hierarchy and a sense of entitlement are all that determines how these acts are coded, though the victims, like Harold and Kumar, see these acts for what they really are, namely naked rape shrouded in much hypocrisy.The film is so determined to force its audience to question its prejudices, presuppositions, programmed expectations and stereotypes, that its racial set-ups often double back on themselves. A group of menacing black men reveal themselves to be kind and caring, a fairly easy gag. But later our heroes must themselves act racist to keep a KKK gang happy, while another sequence reveals a bunch of hill-billies to be wealthy sophisticates, before flipping things again to reveal them as keepers of stereotypically inbred mutant monsters. There is no longer a clean line between what is real and what is projected prejudice. Indeed, the film ends with scenes of homosexual mistaken identity and straight girls going into lesbian bars. The George Bush character is himself set up as being a figure of supreme evil, before the film forces us to recognise this expectation, our bullying, as yet another form of extreme prejudice. Bush becomes another browbeaten victim, another figure to be scapegoated by political and ideological factions. Such scrambling tactics are all over the film. One extended sequence features a band of bottomless women. On one hand it's sexist, on one hand it's titillating, on one hand it's completely awkward, until, like an act of equal opportunity crassness, a penis is revealed and you're forced to gag at the horror of a hairy penis. When the penis is aligned to Al Qaeda, you got all kinds of weird penis, terrorist and vaginal phobia overlaps. With these scramblings, the film feels closer to other films in the New Queer movement than it does to mainstream teen stoner flicks. It then openly mocks the Bill of Rights, Homeland Security, and evil WASP financiers, all of whom become figures representative of absolute entitlement. Bizarrely, the film also stars Neil Patrick Harris, a gay man in real life who plays a sex crazed macho man within the film. It then makes reference to Harris' work in "Starship Troopers", Paul Verhoeven's film about xenophobic, genocidal, militaristic Americans, in which Harris played a fascist agent.The third film in the series, "A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas", is paradoxically the most watchable and unwatchable "Harold and Kumar" film. It's smooth, somewhat funny, inoffensive and completely conventional, with none of the weird, grating aberrations of the second movie. Here, Harold becomes a Wall Street banker and Kumar sets aside marijuana for a career as a doctor. It's a lightweight film, content to satirise 3D movies, 3D gimmicks and organised religion."Harold and Kumar 1" - 8/10 "Harold and Kumar 2 and 3" - 7.5/10</fullReview>

On the plane, Kumar lights up his new bong, the air marshals think it's a bomb, and Harold and Kumar are arrested as terrorists and sent to Guantanamo Bay. Ordered to fellate a guard, they manage to escape, make their way to Florida, and head for Texas to find Kumar's ex-girlfriend's fiancé, the well-connected Colton, and get him to intercede with Washington on their behalf. Kumar still has a thing for Vanessa, the feds are in hot pursuit, and the legal weed of Amsterdam seems a long way away.I Have Never Seen The Original So I Can't Compare This To The Original And For Me To Compare This To Another Stoner Flick Would Just Not Work.This Is A Movie That Shocks People &amp; Makes Me Laugh But It Knows A Line. Many Things I Laughed At Including Niel Patrick Harris Getting High &amp; Seeing Himself Riding A Unicorn.

This Is Definitely An Okay Film For All Those People Who Like This Sort Of Movie But This Is My Favourite Kind Of Comedy (My Vote For The Funniest Movie Ever Made Is Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back) Yet This Also Makes A Good Version Of Those Comedies That Shock People Like "Family Guy" &amp; "South Park".I Have To Say That Everyone Did A Satisfactory Job In Their Roles &amp; Character Development Is As Good As Can Be Expected &amp; This Has Really Funny Dialogue.Overall This Is A Good Stoner Comedy But The Chances Of It Being One Of My Favourites Are Zero.</fullReview>

It tells the story of two marijuana buddies and their misadventures,almost everything they do turns into something funny. People might be wondering if this is better than it's predecessor. It's not. The jokes in this movie are not as funny, the story is more lame, hell, even Harold and Kumar are not as funny in this film. Then there is the $EXU@L references. There is more $Ex in this movie than the last. Tons more.Harold and Kumar are going to Amsterdam. While they are on the plane, Kumar sneaks a bong in and a woman's eyes trick her because she claims that they have a bomb. They are thrown into Guantanamo Bay but soon escape. They are now hunted by an homeland security agent, who doesn't wipe his A$$ properly, and have to clear their names. There is George W. Bush in the end. Pretend you didn't read that! Final thoughts: There was room for improvement but fans of the original won't be disappointed. Their in for a treat. It's better if you watch this alone because the funny things are easy to miss. Maybe if you got the original director, he would have made it seem funnier. 7/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't aware of the characters Harold and Kumar (played by John Cho and Kal Penn) but recently I read stuff in this site about their two movies and I began to have a certain interest on them. Without really looking I came across with Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay on DVD, then I asked if they had Harold and &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle but it wasn't available however I didn't mind and I got Escape from Guantanamo Bay. I saw it two days ago so almost three weeks after I saw for the very first time a film with Cheech and Chong, then I saw and loved Up in Smoke and some days later I saw but not liked at all Still Smokin (still the worst film I have seen recently). Basically as with Harold and Kumar I didn't knew much about Cheech and Chong but after seeing Up in Smoke I became a fan, now after seeing Escape from Guantanamo Bay I won't rush in order to see Go to White Castle.I'm mentioning Cheech and Chong well for obvious reasons but there are some specific things in Escape from Guantanamo that made me remember the only two movies with Cheech and Chong that I have seen. Certainly one of those things is that like in Still Smokin here the stoners will travel to Amsterdam, will be legal weed but actually Harold and Kumar will be sober most of the film, actually Kumar could not wait some hours in a plane to have legal s*** and thanks to that Harold and Kumar will be smoking in Amsterdam until the end of the movie. So sober stoners, they are not really funny (especially Harold), forget about them. We have the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, he is actually funnier than Harold and Kumar, typical stuff with stereotypes and he, and his men, has funny moments (talking to Harold's parents, who are American citizens, in fake Korean), other moments that are just lame (the stuff with the Jews and with the black man who wanted to help Harold and Kumar) and one hilarious moment that has the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security meeting his hero, meeting the man who made that he became part of Homeland Security, meeting Neil Patrick Harris. That scene on the side of NPH will make you remember a scene from Up in Smoke, actually NPH has to do the same that Man Stoner had to. Anyway, near the final scene of the movie we will have W., he is actually cooler than Harold and Kumar (certainly that's a complaint) but the scene itself I don't know, let's see: Bush loves weed, will be a really cool guy for Harold and Kumar and will end saying "f*** you" to his father. I sort of felt that the whole point of this movie was to have Harold and Kumar saying to Bush that he should legalize it otherwise why having W. as a stoner, is not that funny or that bizarrely great. So we traveled to many places, Guantanamo, Alabama, Texas, Miami, Amsterdam but this was just a not memorable trip, pretty much a basic one, yes many surreal stuff but that stuff should have been funny. Actually any scene from Pineapple Express is way funnier than this whole movie so yes that's my bottom line: forget Escape from Guantanamo and see Pineapple Express instead!</fullReview>

From showing him and his girl in a bedroom scene with a giant bag of weed, to what got them in trouble in the first place; trying to smoke weed on a plane. Kumar's way of getting out of being searched at the airport was classic. There are also bottomless parties, c ***meat sandwiches, whizzing Klan members, a cyclops child. And Doogie Houser, Neil Patrick Harris, is back as a whacked out version of himself. This time he goes through a road block all hyped up on shrooms. The idiot FBI agent after the two was gross. Just look at what he did to the Bill of Rights!FINAL VERDICT: It has some funny scenes. If you don't mind gross humor, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not exactly cut-through humor here. You'd expect something new after all these years but it's the same-same American college let's smoke weed/look there's hot chicks/we're really stupid &amp; unlucky humor for 1h42 minutes which is alright and makes for some laughs but somehow makes you feel like you've just ate an hamburger: it keeps you full for 2 hours but after that you can't help but think if you couldn't have gone for something better. John Cho (Harold) and Kal Penn (Kumar) are just your run-of-the-mill dicotomical stupid vs sensible best friends already seen on the first offering (and on so many other occasions throughout the genre in the last decade) and put in performances you'd expect from this kind of film: not exactly in the Oscar category. Rob Cordry on the other hand is as funny as he ever was and puts surprisingly the most convincing performance even if embracing a highly sarcastic portrait of a government security agent/adviser making him the funniest reason to watch the movie. All in all an okay movie if you're just looking to kill some time and pull the occasional laugh, if you're going for something new then i suggest you try elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold and Kumar are not the problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this waste of time three stars solely because Cho and Penn are such a personable pair and enjoyable to watch even in a disjointed script of recycled jokes. Low-brow humor is fun. I love good jokes about sex, excretory activities, pot-smoking, and racial stereotypes. That's what made H&amp;KGTWC so great.However, it did not seem to occur to the clowns who wrote and directed H&amp;KEFGT that you can make NEW jokes about sex, excretory activities, pot-smoking, and racial stereotypes for a sequel with the same cool characters. All they did was rehash themes from H&amp;KGTWC.I was looking forward to seeing Neil Patrick Harris, but his role was just an exaggeration on the NPH character he played in H&amp;KGTWC.I hope this is not the end of the Harold and Kumar franchise. Cho and Penn might yet be the new Cheech and Chong, but they need writers and directors who will give them material with some depth and intellect. They are too talented for this H&amp;KEFGT sort of drek, which should not have gone directly to video but directly into the dumpster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Recycled but Fresh Enough to Stay Funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold and Kumar are back in a sequel to the hilarious 2004 stoner comedy, but the newest adventure isn't quite as good as the first. The gags are hit or miss and some of the material feels recycled from the first film. The film, which literally takes place immediately after the events of the the first, finds the two on their way to Amsterdam in an effort to track down Maria, Harold's new love. Mid-flight, the two are arrested when a bong Kumar smuggled on-board is mistaken for a bomb and the hapless stoners find themselves running from Homeland Security in an attempt to clear their names. There is also a subplot about Kumar attempting to reclaim his ex-girlfriend, but it never really seems as important...I was a fan of the first Harold &amp; Kumar film and was excited to see the sequel, but I was a little disappointed in it. I'm a fan of stupid humor to an extent, but when a movie begins on a diarrhea joke you tend to know what to expect for the next 100+ minutes. A major difference between the two films was the extent to which the sequel relied on gratuitous nudity rather than funny gags to propel the movie forward. That's not to say there weren't some hilarious moments: I loved the George W. Bush scene and, of course, any part with Neil Patrick Harris. Just as in the first, the best scenes involve a drugged-out NPH on a bender. You can also tell that the writer/directors tried to throw in some social commentary on racism in a post-9/11 America but it tends to get lost in the nudity/scat gags.The movie is primarily memorable/funny due to the cast. John Cho and Kal Penn return as the titular characters and they are just as great as before with their awesome buddy chemistry. Rob Corddry was more hits than misses in his role as the extremely racist Homeland Security officer hunting the heroes down. We got a little bit of Rosenberg and Goldstein (Eddie Kaye Thomas and David Krumholtz) this time around; honestly, those two are funny enough to carry their own spin-off movie. I didn't laugh as hard this time, but Harold &amp; Kumar are still funny enough to warrant this sequel. It's got some hilarious moments, though it tends to drag on the wedding subplot (I felt it would've done better without it). It's stupid humor with a bit of a message tossed in to keep it somewhat meaningful. I imagine this movie would be even better if watched while intoxicated; and if you do watch it, make sure you do it right and check out the unrated edition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follow-up packs in as much stoner hi-jinx as possible in 100 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The highly anticipated sequel to "Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle" is finally here and it comes with the subtitle "Escape From Guantanamo Bay." It's the same old bag of tricks for this stoner comedy duo, only this time it takes a few political jabs, so for fans of the first film, "H+K2" will quickly and easily satisfy the random, gross-out humor munchies. Everyone else will just be floored by this film's audacity to be both politically incorrect and utterly stupid.The sequel picks up just where the last one left off, with Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) going to Amsterdam in pursuit of both Harold's love interest from the previous film and of course the ability to freely smoke marijuana. Smartly enough, their ethnicities combined with pot-smoking ambitions make them appear as terrorists for which they are sent to Guantanamo Bay from which they promptly escape. We are now twenty minutes into the film. That will give you a sense of how much creators Hayden Schlossberg and Jon Hurwitz pack into this film and it doesn't get cashed for another hour and twenty.For those unfamiliar with the 'franchise,' both films and especially this film is your typical stoner/college-teen comedy set up ala "Eurotrip," which gets referenced in the film appropriately enough. In other words, our main characters are off on some preposterous adventure where they meet strange characters, shenanigans and trouble at every turn while at some point taking a step back to add some unprecedented friendship sentimentality. Add plenty of drugs and plenty of nudity and you have yourself the formula. Schlossberg and Hurwitz have done nothing outside of these films and it's clear why."H+K2" fires jokes at you like machine gun bullets, knowing that if it shoots 100, at least a bunch are guaranteed to take you out. There are definitely some very funny, hysterical and dare I say clever jokes in this film, but then there are a zillion others that completely miss the mark. One juxtaposition, for example, could be a bong being mistaken for a bomb and goat poop. The characters are mostly decent. Harold and Kumar are your typical duo of one anal, cautious guy and one laid back, risk-taking guy. It's a timeless dynamic even these writers can't screw up. At least the fact that they are Korean and Indian set the film apart a tad. Smartly, they take advantage of racism to take some outlandish, though definitely present, cracks at America. While not poignant like say "Borat," this film finds its own bizarre way of making a statement with limited effectiveness.I won't bother to explain the plot in any detail, because it's garbage--even if it acknowledges it--though I will say it takes them to the ghetto, a KKK party, a whorehouse and yes, even the Bush family ranch. Nothing else needs to be said. You have to press play on this film recognizing that the plot will most likely be absurd and you just want to laugh. So on laughs, this film is pretty half and half with hit and miss. All in all, it would be wrong of me to say this film isn't a good time if you're in the mood or under the influence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is not much to say about this film, except that it was as crude as it was funny, but since my comment has to be at least 10 lines, I will say some more. So here goes.Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay as we all know is a second installment to the 2004 stoner film Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. The sequel has lots of grossed out jokes that at the same time hit their target, almost every joke in the movie was hilarious. Like most stoner films, this film contains the typical amount of hallucinations and has its fair share of trash talk, which is what most comedy fan would crave for in a stoner movie. This is a very good and enjoyable sequel that exhibited tons of chemistry between John Cho and Kal Penn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes it gets even better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold and Kumar - escape from Guantanamo Bay is even better then its former movie although it wasn't as stoned as the first it isn't bad at all, the movie gets a nice lift that shouldn't be forgotten in awhile, normally a sequel isn't good yet sometimes it just works to a tee.Storyline: 9/10 It is clear to start with that the story of the second movie has been more valued then what it was in the first movie, in the first movie the point was to have a laugh and follow the stoner's as they reach the hype of the night, in the second movie we still are to laugh but this time follow the love of Kumar and learn his story a little more through some flashbacks and what not, of course we also learn a little of Harolds love life but Kumar is the main point of the movie and what a great idea it was to do it in this way, we actually learn he is tormented by the past but not going to say more then that.Actors: N/A All in all like my former review the actors do what should be done, they are all great and I have nothing to bitch about at all, although want to state that I liked the fact at how the put Neal into the story again and even loved the way he died, what a cool way to end his path set for something that he felt god just made him walk.Soundtrack: N/A A mixture of the same a normal movie music rendition although I want to highlight the main theme as the main goody of the movie although it wasn't as good as the former soundtrack of the first movie.Special Effects: N/A The only thing I am going to tell you in this part of the review is "A unicorn?"All In All 9/10 In my opinion a lot better then the first movie, greater acting and a much greater storyline although the music wasn't as good, the last thing I want is to copy and place the quote that Kumar ends with in the movie which is a quote that was remembered in my mind a long time and even still is.I fear that I will always be / A lonely number like root three / A three is all that's good and right, / Why must my three keep out of sight / Beneath a vicious square root sign, / I wish instead I were a nine / For nine could thwart this evil trick, / with just some quick arithmetic / I know I'll never see the sun, as 1.7321 / Such is my reality, a sad irrationality / When hark! What is this I see, / Another square root of a three / Has quietly come waltzing by, / Together now we multiply / To form a number we prefer, / Rejoicing as an integer / We break free from our mortal bonds / And with a wave of magic wands / Our square root signs become unglued / And love for me has been renewed. I wonderful poem and great one love it, pick this movie up and like its former keep it and enjoy it a Saturday evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There Are Some Laughs To Be Had, But The Film Falters Too Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Harold and Kumar film, while not much of a box office hit, did develop a cult following after it hit DVD. And with good reason, it was a fresh, legitimately funny film that had plenty of memorable absurdities, some very likable characters and a lot of charm. So naturally, when the second film was announced and teased, a decent amount of people were hotly anticipating it, including me (the first teaser on the airplane was enough to bring me in). While the film does have some funny moments here and there, it simply falters more than it succeeds.The plot is on a bigger scale, with the two leads getting caught up with the American government over the occurrences in a semi-funny scene. But most of the film is, in essence, a wild goose chase as Harold and Kumar seem to run about (almost aimlessly in some parts). But thanks to the bigger scale plot, it allowed the film to experiment with some more direct jokes pertaining to larger targets which is actually one of the areas the film missteps. Part of what made the first film so funny and original was that it tackled jokes that were, well, not common (okay, some more than others). Here, we get jokes that, in many cases, have almost been done to death. Not that this is a bad thing on its own, but the film doesn't give a different or original take on it and, as a result, barely holds any humor.This also brings up one of the key issues with the film: many of the jokes simply lack comedy. I won't get into all of them, but the scene where Rob Corddry (who I'll touch upon in a bit) takes out a can of grape soda and lets it spill out in front of an (initially) stereotypical black man only comes off as annoying and not in the least bit funny. Similarly, the part where he lets a bunch of coins fall in front of Rosenberg and Goldstein is just devoid of any humor. Scenes such as these only come off as overdone, cliché and, as a result, insulting (if anything).Another problem with the film that can be derived from those jokes is that there are points where the film takes itself too seriously. This is normally a common trait in comedies, especially recent Jim Carrey films (Yes Man, Bruce Almighty, etc.) but they only detract from the said films. Again, this points back to the first film and how it avoided this very effortlessly, there were barely any truly serious scenes and even those which existed had some humor sprinkled in for good measure. Here, those scenes just make the film seem to drag since they only make you roll your eyes at how almost all of them have been done a million times and a half before and only detract from the entertainment.But probably the most glaring issue with the film for me was how the two leads seemed to have changed for the worse. In Go to White Castle, Harold became a typical but likable "victim of circumstance" and a shy guy who I think many people (including myself) can relate to. As for Kumar, he was a less usual stoner character who essentially played that "he's smart, but just too care free and lazy to do anything" that made him very likable and arguably the film's best character (save for perhaps NPH). In this film, however, the two seem to have changed for the worse. Harold has become more of an angry guy who rarely has any laughs or fun moments that just makes him annoying. As for Kumar, they REALLY messed his character up. Part of what made him so likable in the first film was that he was always upbeat, carefree and always had something absurd and funny to say. In this film, he's given a love interest which only removes a lot of what made him so lovable before.And don't even get me started on Rob Corddry, because every scene he is in just ruins the film. His jokes (which are nothing but the overdone stereotypes I mentioned earlier) are only annoying and completely devoid of comedy. About the only scene this isn't the exception of is when he's listening to "Danger Zone" towards the end. Otherwise, while watching the film for the first time, I was just praying he wouldn't show up again after the camera got away from him.This isn't to say that the film is devoid of laughs, there are some funny scenes present scattered throughout the runtime. But that's just it, these parts are only scattered. In the first film, laughs were abound almost nonstop and even when there weren't, the film was still fun. With Escape from Guantanamo Bay, the (good) laughs are only here and there, with arguably the best one being just a couple brief seconds long in the middle of semi-serious scene (hint: Y2K).While it might sound like I absolutely hated this film that isn't the case. The film isn't necessarily bad it was just disappointingly mediocre. I was hoping to get a film that was along the lines of the first but what I got was a film that resorted to the typical PG-13 comedy routine except with the vulgarity of an R-rated film. Some of the scenes might get a good kick out of you, but nothing will come close to what we got in the first film (save for the NPH scenes-seen any unicorns recently?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow what a letdown.I loved the first movie with these two lovable stoners.And I was set to laugh my booty off to this movie.But it never happened,in fact,I don't think I had one real good laugh the whole movie.In this adventure the boys set out to go to Amsterdam ,supposedly to find Harold's girlfriend, but of course it was as much about getting to the weed and porn capital of the world as it was about finding Harold's girlfriend.Of course a trip is never an easy thing with these two and Kumar just can't wait to smoke some weed so he gets out his bong on the plane, which is mistaken for a bomb ,and all heck breaks loose.This movie had a weak plot and a terrible script....no good laughs at all was to be had the whole way through this thing.I kept waiting for it to get better but it just never did.It seemed the writers had no clear concept of a plot,they just strung a bunch of unfunny feces and oral sex jokes together and hoped it made a movie.It didn't.Even Neil Partick Harris,who was superb in the first one,just appeared to be going through the motions in this one.The guy playing George Bush didn't even really look like Bush but by the time he appears you don't really care.I don't remember any boobies in this thing but honestly I watched it a few weeks ago and I'm writing this review about half loaded so there could have been some.After the first movie I was hoping this would be another good series of stoner movies,ala Cheech and Chong,but this one was so bad it's probably killed any hopes of a third one,at least that I'll bother to watch.I'd recommend re-watching the first one and skipping this one all together so you'll have a fond remembrance of these two guys.How this thing is getting a 7 out of 10 by the reviewers at this website I'll never know.I gave it a 4 and that was being generous because I like the first one so much.</fullReview>

It leans on the most crude prejudice possible and plays it out in a very funny way. It never takes itself serious and does not retort to too much "below the belt" stuff and just races on from the one point of laughter to the next.

		<fullReview>OK, it was worth a rental but if I had seen this movie in the theaters and paid $10+ for a ticket I'd have been pretty angry. While I found "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" to be hilarious, this one just didn't grab me. Maybe it's because I'm from New Jersey and I found the first one to be a riot because it poked fun and was set in my home state. But the jokes just didn't roll like in the first one.The humor was forced, the jokes were OK and they just seemed to try "too hard" in this one. Putting H&amp;K into the ridiculous situations they did was just overkill. But they did make the most of plot and maximized what was a "thin" idea to begin with.Neil Doogie Patrick Howser-Harris was again VERY funny (and his demise was priceless! I think he'd have wanted his character to be shot to death by a madam at a house of ill-repute).Rent it, you'll like it but it's not one you'll want to add to your permanent collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harold (John Cho) &amp; Kumar (Kal Penn) are leaving to Amsterdam for a week to smoke up and as well for meeting Harold's new girlfriend Maria (Paula Gracés). But when Kumar was foolishly enough to bring an smokeless bong into the plane, which all the passengers in the plane thinks it is a poison bomb. Those boys find themselves in trouble again but this time... these fools are brought to Guantanamo Bay, one of the most brutal prisons in the world. When these two find a way to escape from the prison, Harold &amp; Kumar goes back to the United States to clear their names. But Harold &amp; Kumar find themselves in bigger trouble, when an idiot undersecretary agent from National Security named Ron Fox (Rob Corddry) thinks that Harold &amp; Kumar are terrorists. Fox will do anything to stop them... dead or alive.Written and Directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg made an entertaining if plot heavy sequel to the original first movie. Which Hurwitz and Schlossberg wrote "Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle". Cho and Penn are still a joy to watch as the mismatched best friends, which they love doing one thing together is to simply smoke weed together. One of the highlights of this sequel is watching Neil Patrick Harris doing an satirical version of himself as he did in the original. There's many new supporting characters in this second film, both small or big roles. Danneel Harris has some nice moments as Kumar's sweet ex-girlfriend and a good turn from Roger Bart as Fox's over-suffering assistant.This sequel was bigger hit than the original film in theaters, since the first feature was a huge success on DVD. One of my few small complains of the second movie, i find this sequel has a bit too much of everything and it goes a little too long as well. But still, for the viewers who enjoyed the original is those are going to love this more.The single disc DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes both the original theatrical version and the unrated edition runs five minutes longer than the R-Rated Cut. But there's no special features sadly. If you are an fan of the sequel... there's two-disc special edition is also available with commentary tracks, deleted scenes, featurettes and more. While the sequel was a modest success in theaters, it certainly will be a bigger hit on DVD. If you loved the original, don't miss it. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this Tues evening, cause I thought the first was hilarious but this was a bit disappointing to me.It starts set like the next day from the first film with a gross-out scene involving toilet humour. It then progresses with an escapce9as indicated in the title) and some outrageous meetings into all sorts of people(one of them is the most important in the US).Acting: Quite decent from everyone. I didn't notice any notably weak people. I think our stoner duo have good comic delivery.Pacing: Similar to the first but about 20mins longer running time. I thought they could've been a sort of montage of what happened to so-and-so character like the first, and more jokes, as it seemed to run out of steam before the end.Cinematography: It's alright to me. Not cutting edge-looking or whatever, but decent. Some of the gross-out gags including someone rubbing their bum on paper went a bit too far for my taste.Music: The soundtrack of songs, like rap, pop etc did fit well I felt even if I didn't like some.Overall: The first had funnier moments(like the weed fantasy - which does make an appearance here, but wasn't as funny to me), and some US jokes just weren't understood by my audience(like the grape juice being poured). Liked the unicorn stuff. Good but the first is better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the first Harold &amp; Kumar movie. I love the first and put it right up there with Grandma's Boy and Leonard Part 6. But this one was not worth the wait. Nor was it really worth the price of admission I paid on the second day of its release.Instead of hanging out trying to get burgers, it goes across trying to chase Harold's woman. Due to mishaps, they go to Gitmo. That only didn't make any sense, but the music and styling didn't even make it funny. And I was left sitting there painfully until the arrival of Neil Patrick Harris. Suddenly, things get hilarious with Neil taking drugs to hide it from cops and imaging things while driving.The racial jokes were there, but way overused. The previous one used it sparingly compared to this one and the act grew a little too old. But at least it wasn't used as much when Neil Patrick Harris was around. Single handedly, he helped rescue this movie from complete disaster. That is unlike the first one where he was the icing on top of a very tasty cake.Overall, its average. The writers seemed to have taken themselves too seriously and went to wild extremes to prove their inability to capture an original. "C+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Stupid Trip....Very Funny Still!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what kind of humor you are going to get into if you have seen their first film, "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle." In fact, it starts right where "White Castle" ends. Harold and Kumar plan to go to Amsterdam to follow Maria, whom Harold met in the elevator of their apartment. Unfortunately, Kumar could not contain his stoner urges and brings marijuana on board the plane, complete with paraphernalia! Uneasy bigoted co-passengers panic when they see Kumar light up in the plane's toilet. They are arrested as terrorists from North Korea and the Middle East who have connived with each other! And so charged, they are sent to Guantanamo Bay prison.From there, the movie goes cross country poking irreverent fun at several races (blacks, Jewish, rednecks, Arabs, even the KKK) and political issues (tortures on Guantanamo prison, Homeland Security officials and "George W. Bush" himself). Very funny! Of course, the writers take the sexual and drugged out route in most of these jokes that teeter on the brink of being offensive and tasteless.These are just saved by the stupid charm of the two leads, especially John Cho who plays the nerdy accountant gone wild, Harold Lee. Kal Penn, or his character Kumar, is really an annoying character for me, but funny just the same. The girl who played Kumar's old girlfriend Vanessa was quite appealing. Neil Patrick Harris returns in a longer role as "himself".Apparently there are a lot of exposed body parts in this movie, but we here do not see them because of the liberally-applied censorship of "prurient" scenes. What can you expect from a "bottom-less" party, huh? LOL! Overall, despite the lowbrow comedy style of this movie, you simply know there is an underlying social and political commentary buried in those daring jokes. They are a guilty pleasure. You know they are so wrong, yet you can't help but laugh out loud. I liked it, despite my aversion to drug-related topics. If you wait up to the end of the end credits, a small scene there tells you that there's bound to be a Part 3 to all this. Can't wait for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie for a few laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slight spoilers ahead!I liked this movie a bit.I found that it had far too many serious incidents (KKK is nothing to joke about). I think it's funny to make fun of everyone but the whole terrorist thing was too played out. NPH was pretty funny. The scary kid in the basement was too. I also liked the back story about Kumar. It became a little mushy at the end. I liked the first movie a lot. This one is worth seeing if you really liked the first one. Expect to laugh a little bit and you won't be disappointed. I just think it could have been better. Maybe another sequel will be better with more Rosenberg and Goldstein.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have rarely in my life ever stopped watching a movie for being terrible. I've sat through many very bad movies. But I turned this movie off when they encountered the Southern inbred couple. And everything before that was no less miserable as a viewing experience.See, I read lots of other reviews for this movie and many people trashed it for containing stereotypes as humor. But that wasn't the point. The writers were trying to portray anyone who held stereotypes(especially against minorities) as a buffoon, i.e. the Homeland Security guy pursuing H &amp; K. The attempt to shatter stereotypes by having the black guy playing basketball in the street turn out to be a well spoken orthodontist was devoid of any humor, and was engineered solely to make the HS Officer look stupid, and anyone who might believe in racial stereotypes to be equally stupid. But it still wasn't funny, because it is self righteous liberal pandering. "You are only open minded if you agree with us, and only our views on stereotypes are funny." But inbred Southerners and sadistic Marines were all meant to provide laughs as stereotypes themselves. All completely acceptable to liberals and adherents to PC. I've seen mention of a KKK rally later in the movie, but I never got that far, so I have no opinion about that.Is it so surprising then that Kal Penn went to work in the Obama White House? Is it even more surprising that he may leave to do another H &amp; K movie? No, and it will be even less surprising when the 3rd movie has more of the same selective morality disguised as attempts at humor.In addition to all of that, there was really unfunny and repulsive toilet humor throughout.I've never seen the first H &amp; K and I have no desire to based on this crapfest. Liberal stoners probably loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laffing it up lamely, while the world bleeds shamely...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stupid frat-boy farce. Whadaya want from the lame pretenders to the stoner throne after Cheech and Chong? No one above the legal designation of idiot-child need bother watching.In HAROLD AND KUMAR ESCAPE FROM GUANTANAMO BAY, Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn), are mistaken for "terrorists" on a plane to Amsterdam, and are thrown into Guantanamo Bay prison facility, without any trial, legal counsel or investigation. Just the way the criminal Bush Klan like it.Plot relies on Amerikan jingoism and the actual terrorized mentality that imbues the average Amerikan redneck. Harold and Kumar are interrogated by a very frenetic, criminally unfunny Rob Corddry, exemplifying the muttonhead Bush admin's ignorance and stupefying closemindedness. Another character actually accuses him, "It's people like you who make the world think Americans are stupid." Yet the film keeps on doing just that.Harold and Kumar promptly escape GITMO and go on the lam, trying to catch up to a lame subplot with Kumar's ex-girlfriend (luscious Danneel Harris).When they run into George W. Murderer Bush at his cabin (James Adomian, who seems to revel in the role, from THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH CRAIG FERGUSON to MIND OF MENCIA), I laughed even less than I had already been not laughing.For this is no laughing matter. Even as HAROLD AND KUMAR ESCAPE FROM GUANTANAMO BAY satirizes that bastion of Amerikan hypocrisy and gutlessness, people are still being held there through the machinations of the previous Amerikan administration of lowlife maniacs who pretended they were "spreading democracy" through torture.Even as an impersonator, W. makes me bilious. To laugh at Bush as an imbecile is one thing; to understand exactly what a DANGEROUS imbecile he was and is, should give us all pause. We should not be satirizing his foolishness and venial idiocy that has caused the irrevocable subversion and ruination and loss of over 2 million lives. This is not ancient history - the lives he has adversely affected are being lived out NOW (apart from those whom he killed on the basis of his WMD lie), by people who would joyously see him dead, in a mental home, or tortured till his red mongoloid neck turned a whiter shade of jail.There are few high points amidst the morass of lowbrow: the bottomless pool party - read as "bottomless" girls, not bottomless pool; and Neil Patrick Harris (the once and forever Doogie Howser) reprising his role as the drug-absorbent, brothel-mongering Neil Patrick Harris, who hallucinates unicorns and gets his kicks butt-branding whores.And, uh... nope, can't think of any other high points. And if you think there's a pun gone wanting about Harold and Kumar being stoners, the MPAA effectively rules out that possibility as well - though 'R'-rated, we only see Harold and Kumar "high" in short montage sequences, never in the body of the movie.Story wraps with the usual "underachiever-gets-the-girl" trope.Okay, forget the crap movie. There is a fantastic irony surrounding this film and its star, unfolding in the real world even as I write: Guantanamo Bay in 2009 is slated for closure by the newly minted Obama administration. And Kal Penn, a likable guy when he's not acting the retard, puts his acting career on hold in 2009 - to join the Obama Administration, as associate director at the Office of Public Liaison! He also had to kill off his doctor character on the TV show, HOUSE, to move to Washington and be a real life government official.Kal Penn has found the perfect cure for his acting career: stop.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

This is in part because of pointlessly gratuitous stuff aimed at kids who can only hope to sneak it by Mom and Dad ("bottomless party, my ass!") and wasted opportunities (why spend so much time on building Rob Cordry's consummate jerk character and then not bother to give him a truly spectacular demise? I mean, a really juicy possibility was right there, but he just drops out of the picture.)

		<fullReview>To begin, I was surprisingly impressed with Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. I hadn't expected more than just a dumb, buddy stoner movie and when I finally saw it, I really enjoyed it. A lot! So when the sequel came out, I was admittedly looking forward to it.The movie picks up with Kumar accompanying Harold to Amsterdam. On the way, Kumar runs into his old girlfriend, now engaged, and the two get arrested when an overly paranoid passenger mistakes the two for terrorists. The two are sent to Guantanamo Bay by an overly paranoid and under qualified Homeland Security officer. I don't see any spoiler in saying they escape, after all it is in the title of the film, and have 7 days to get from Florida to Texas without being picked up in order to clear their names.I think one of the things that annoyed me the most about this movie was the over-emphasis on smoking. It's obviously going to be there as it is a buddy stoner movie, and though it has been a while and I could have forgotten, I don't seem to recall a pot scene around every corner in the first movie. In the sequel, I can't really think of any scene that didn't somehow go right back to it. It became "We're on a plane. Let's smoke," "We're in the sticks. It just got a little old for me I guess. Let's smoke," We're on the Lam. Let's smoke" But overall, the movie had some great laughs. I won't cite any in particular, but there were some hilarious moments. And of course, Neil Patrick Harris. Oh, those Hershey's Kisses...All in all, it was fun and I'd recommend seeing it if you were a fan of the first, but I think this movie could have done more than just rehashing the same jokes from the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (2008), the follow up to 2004's Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle. picks up right where the last one left off... only the actors look 4 years older. Well, I guess I can't fault them for that... but there are many other things to fault this movie for.I'd say the worst part about this movie is the comedy. There were maybe one or two things that were actually funny, the rest were just attempts at juvenile humor, which have some potential to be funny but just fall flat in this movie.The plot was decent. Neil Patrick Harris is back playing the same psychopathic version of himself that he did so well in the last one. In fact, his role here is the reason this movie got a 4/10 instead of a 2/10. Though things got really, really stupid in the last fourth of the movie, but the plot picked up a bit right at the end.I'd assume that most people will feel the same way about this movie as they did about the previous one. That means if you loved seeing them go to White Castle, you'll also love seeing them go to Gitmo.</fullReview>

Alittle more Gross out then the first, don't get me wrong I like that and laughed at all those scenes but some of them where just plane vomit inducing 2: without giving to much of the ending away, I find the ending was a little to Hollywood. Nothing as better then watching H and K eat those burgers at the end of the first, but this one was a little to predictable. And finally 3: it was just a tiny bit racist and some jokes I din't even understand, like that grape juice thing. Besides those minor inperfetions it was still a solid sequel, the actors where all good( Rob Gorddry really surprised me). The story was good and the jokes are still making me laugh today.PS The funniest moment was definitely the NPH unicorn scene.

		<fullReview>If you dug Borat, then you'll probably enjoy Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay. I haven't seen Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle, but I wanted to see this because of the hilarious trailer. While it had some really offensive, politically incorrect moments (the version I saw had several cuts), it was fun overall. Casting two minorities as leads practically allows the production immunity to poke fun at racial stereotypes.The Asian-American stoner duo Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) and Harold Lee (John Cho) are mistaken for terrorists on their way to Amsterdam. Ron Fox (Rob Corddry) is the racist government agent out to get them as the bumbling duo encounter the requisite adventures along the way. Neil Patrick Harris has a sizable part as himself, which was weird, because isn't he gay? Why is he playing himself as a sadistic stud? Written and directed by Hayden Schlossberg and Jon Hurwitz (who incidentally graduated from the Wharton at the University of Pennsylvania, where Kal Penn also teaches the course 'Asian-Americans in the Media'), H&amp;K 2 may be escapist drivel, but it does make its not-so-subtle point about our own prejudices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I definitely agree that there are worse comedy sequels out there. No doubt. And this film makes a number of great philosophical points and does have its laughs. But the timing of so many of those laughs just is not on point. With the reviews of the original, I was amazed how often I was not laughing at the jokes. I knew they were jokes. I got them. But no laugh from me, just a "god these writers and/or editors are bad" kind of painful smile coming from me. It's just not a very intelligent script or cut with the right comic timing. Should have gone to see Baby Mama instead. So I went and saw Iron Man afterwards, since Baby had already started. Wow...it may be the first action, sci-fi, comic book film that might sweep at the Oscars. Seriously. Crazy good script, cast, acting, chemistry. Blown away. But H&amp;K: EFGB? I think you have to be getting %$#@! or on the pot to laugh sufficiently to enjoy it. Oh, but the gals were gorgeous. The film makers have much better taste in women than you'd expect. So kudos on that part. Lots of cuties...and coochies. Loved the coochies. And the boobies. Probably a better return on the ladies than you'll find on the net during a 2 hour period.</fullReview>

How did this movie get a rating of "R"?? It should have gotten rated XXX from all the nudity and sex scenes. GROSS, GROSS, GROSS. I even lost my appetite at some scenes. What about all the masturbation scenes too? This could have been a really funny movie. Harold and Kumar make a good couple, but the comedy of the movie is lost in the sex. Especially the "bottomless" scene, I thought that was not allowed even in rated "R" movies. I am severely disappointed in what could have been a really descent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny in surprising ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film had its predecessor's problem of a series of obvious setups, there were several unsuspected turns that set it apart. The best of these unsuspected turns was the appearance of James Adomian as George H. Bush (Adomian is also the most experienced of Shrub's doppelgangers, having reprised that role in numerous press corps appearances and on The Late Show with Craig Ferguson). Knock a point off for the truly awful makeup work on Adomian and the cocaine-laced weed being passed around between he and the show's two stars is a comedic gem. Even supporters of the Shrub can appreciate this scene, as he is portrayed as a rather average joe (something we know he is not) who is simply being pressured by Cheney ("That guy scares the s*** out of me!") and his father.The primary reason I offered this slapstick roll an 8 is because it has to be the last (or at least the last good) film in what may have been a decent franchise; Neal Patrick Harris is dead. And he was dismissed in very unceremonious (and not very funny) fashion. They could have at least gotten a real good gag out of his demise, but they shot him in the back instead. Not a good scene, and it spells the end of the very best character gag from both of these films. I would assume that they will not be making another Harold and Kumar (after all, both of their girl problems have been solved by the end of this film), and if they do they'll likely seek out a poor replacement for Harris, like perhaps Emmanual Lewis or Fred Savage.All in all this was an enjoyable film, even with its length (at 102 minutes that's a lot of fart-and-weed jokes). Throw a few bucks on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spot-on sequel! Very funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay is the overdue sequel to one of the decade's leading cult comedies, 2004's Harold &amp; Kumar Get the Munchies AKA Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle. The film begins where the previous left off with the pair about to travel from America to Amsterdam in search of Harold's (John Cho) love interest. Once on the plane Kumar (Kal Penn) retreats to the toilet and assembles a homemade smokeless bong in the aircrafts toilet only for a passenger to witness him. His bong is mistaken for a bomb and chaos ensues. The two are arrested in flight and the plane is turned around for them to be questioned. They are then believed to be part of a North Korean/al-Qaeda plot and incarcerated to Guantanamo Bay.One problem that always arises from a sequel is it's originality as it is re-working trends, characters and conventions established in its predecessor. However, a sequel does have the power to utilise certain strengths that can aid the narrative and a fine example of this is familiarity. With Escape from Guantanamo this familiarity allows for the makers to concentrate on other characters and evolve the characters of both Harold &amp; Kumar further. This leads to Escape from Guantanamo being slightly more emotional than its predecessor, this notion is supported by the subplot of Kumar's ex-girlfriend. This subplot consists of a flashback depicting a very funny Emo-Harold and a delusional dream of Kumar and his ex getting it on with a giant bag of weed.The narrative structure of Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay is almost identical to that of its predecessor as it employs a quest-narrative, evident from its title, and like the first film it charts the two as they embark upon a series of misadventures. Along this journey they encounter many characters, one of which is Ron Fox (Rob Corddry). Ron is the chief antagonist of the picture; he is an ignorant, obtuse, irresponsible and brutish representative of the American Homeland Security. Arguably, he embodies a stereotypical and overzealous xenophobic American. Unfortunately his red-neck, ill-bred attitude is a bit of a one-trick-pony, it is played too much and becomes a bit weary towards the end of the picture. The voice of reason and logic in the film appears to be in the guise of Dr. Jack Beecher (Roger Bart), and by being a doctor the character is clearly educated thus alluding to the dim-wittedness of Ron further. Ron's ardent nature is at times too pervasive and leads to those around him being ineffective in the gag department.Despite those character shortcomings the beauty of the film is that it is laugh out loud funny and chiefly because it draws upon an array of contemporary issues. The film's crack at the war on terror is a little too timid for my liking and the decision to show Bush as a pothead is too old school. In fact the manner in which the film decides in general to lampoon America's behaviors in various political arenas is dated or, to concur with the film's release, overdue. However, the funniest political joke is perhaps the NSA officer being unable to translate Harold's parents, because he assumes they can't speak English, an apt and direct assault on America's foreign policy.Actually, if the political comedy of the film is ignored then Escape from Guantanamo is incredibly funny. Fine examples of this include the pimped up red-neck pad, the bottomless party, the cock-meat sandwich, the cyclops child, the caring prostitutes, the KKK encounter and of course the return of Neil Patrick Harris. The return of "Doogie Howser, M.D." is one of the highlights of the film but this time around his drug of choice is mushrooms ? which he takes whilst driving. His brief re-emergence also sees him brand a prostitute, flirt with hallucinations and tell Ron that his role in Starship Troopers convinced him to join the Feds; priceless. There are some jokes that will be perceived as racist, but they are all cleverly balanced out. The fact that the fanatical white American bears the brunt of the humour in the film fits in well with contemporary society - and is of course, very funny. A good example of this is the ignorant assumption that an Asian man on an airplane is a terrorist, again very funny, but if you've seen the trailer you've already seen one of the best gags.Overall, Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay wonderfully reworks the original film but on a larger scale, it is a comedy that is definitely above average as the jokes are well paced and mostly well written. It's not quite in the same class as its predecessor, but I strongly believe that upon multiple viewings it will become even funnier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rude, Crude And Lame - And Sometimes Even Truly Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit right off the top that this isn't really my kind of movie. It's a "stoner" movie with lots of nudity and sexual content and the normal type of juvenile humour, somewhat reminiscent, say, of "Porky's" or "Animal House." From the start, those I was watching it with regularly used words such as "gross" or "disgusting" to describe a number of the scenes. Having said that, let's also be fair - at times this movie is fairly funny satire (the whole "ethnic profiling" angle is pretty well done) and there are some very funny scenes as well. I thought some of the content involving Neil Patrick Harris was hilarious (although I also thought that whole thing went on far too long) and the Alabama family they stayed with was a hoot.The story - lame though it is - revolves around Harold and Kumar (John Cho and Kal Penn) being mistaken for terrorists on board a jet bound for Amsterdam and sent off to Guantanamo Bay, from where they escape and proceed to a series of adventures, pursued by an over the top Homeland Security agent played by Rob Corddry. It's a story of lost love, as Harold and Kumar both pine away for their absent girlfriends, and it all culminates in a pretty funny encounter with the President (Yes - W, played by James Adomian, who didn't really look the part but nevertheless pulled it off pretty well.) If you're going to hold this up to "Gone With The Wind" or "The Godfather" it's absolutely terrible. But if you take it for what it's worth it's OK. If you like stoner comedies, you'll probably love it. If you don't, you might be revolted by it, but you'll still find some funny moments if you stick with it. Overall, based on my personal tastes - 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it's exciting to see Harold and Kumar return to the big screen, I kind of hoped the movie would be funnier. Guaranteed, Guantanamo Bay is one of John Cho's and Kal Penn's best films yet. There's a scene with Neil Patrick Harris at a police check point and Harold and Kumar's parents being questioned by the authorities, but overall the silliness that made White Castle great (such as a guy peeing beside you in the middle of an open forest), is somehow lost after our duo escape a cockmeat sandwich.If you enjoy the first movie, by all means Guantanamo Bay is perfect for you, but I feel that the whole purpose of adding Vanessa to the storyline is to give both our buds a happy ending for everyone once they reach Amsterdam. Of course, the end of this film is the perfect tie-in for a third movie, or a direct-to-video spin-off for Nail Patrick Harris. Hopefully we will not see the last of John Cho and Kal Penn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that their first effort, "Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle" was bad, but this was funnier. It was basically the same schtick, but with a few more backstories and a hilarious scene, featuring George W Bush, played by the same guy who does him on Leno.Neal Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser) re-appeared, playing the same character, boozed up, drug addled, &amp; extra horny, looking for some rough sex in a local brothel. Rob Corddry (best known from the Jon Stewart Show) was excellent as the hard boiled but brain dead Homeland Security investigator. There was a great red-neck sketch, featuring an inbred child locked in the basement. The stars are Harold (John Cho) &amp; Kumar (Kal Penn), who have struck gold in this movie franchise. No doubt, the 3rd H&amp;K movie is in the works.The movie had a few scenes with full nudity, pot smoking throughout, and the usual gross out toilet humor. If you didn't like "Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle" you probably won't like this. But if you appreciate that brand of humor, or like anything with Will Ferrell, by all means go check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the rating, I thought: Can't be that funny. Well, it is.Sure! It's juvenile, but they know. And so should you. But rarely does one see even pooh and pee jokes go hand in hand with two of these lovely characters. Good writing, good jokes, facial expressions, the works. The editing is a little rough here and there, but I can imagine a lot of the actors couldn't finish their lines because of the fun they must have had making this.Watch for Rob Corddry, who is perfectly cast, his sidekick, and a shining Neil Patrick Harris. There's also lots of small winks to the first movie for the fans. And remember, a movie isn't over before it's over ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow I'm surprised people like this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a huge fan of the first flick and saw it several times in the theaters. I was also convinced that the movie would not suck as both of them were back. However, as I watched the movie i felt like they both sold out completely. It seemed like the movie was about other people and i didn't even want to see them. They weren't even funny int he movie, other people were and i thought that sucked. The first is ten times better and i thought the whole series was ruined. I don't know why those actors couldn't have been more in to the movie. The first one was so unique. I loved NPH in the first one and I have to admit that he was unreal in the second one too. When he is talking to the cop it's hysterical. I don't know, the movie industry has just really been sucking it up lately</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think even if you were high as a kite you couldn't find much to laugh at in this movie. Rarely heard a chuckle from the audience I was with.Gross-out shock moments are substituted for actual funny stuff. They're not the same thing, guys. "Hey look at this shocking thing! And here's another shocking thing! Not actually funny -- but it was gross, right?"I pretty much enjoyed the first H&amp;K movie -- but this was so inferior. NPH's brief cameo is enjoyable -- but that ends in a "huh?" way.Rob Corddry works hard, but doesn't have much to work with. And Kal Penn and John Cho are in their mid-30s and really don't pass for stoner kids anymore.Don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still very funny, but not as enjoyable as the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I randomly watched Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle in theatres in summer 2004 not expecting much. But I ended up actually being kind of impressed by how funny and unique it was, especially for how stereotypical and ridiculous the movie sounded (another stoner road movie?). Now we are four years later, and surprisingly for such a small film, there is a sequel. And unique is what it continues to be.Picking up mere hours after the first film, Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are traveling to Amsterdam to follow Harold's dream girl, Maria (Paula Garcés). While on the plane, Kumar attempts to get high, but ends up sending the passengers and crew into a panic when they think he has a bomb. They re-route back to the States, where Homeland Security decides they are both terrorists, and sends them to the infamous titular prison. And as the title suggests, they escape, and spend the rest of the movie averting the law and attempting to clear their names.There is not really much to the plot of the movie, but then again, there was not much to the original either. Instead of spending the movie getting into all kinds of random situations while searching for a White Castle, they spend this movie trying to stay out of the hands of Homeland Security. I was actually kind of weirded out by how political the film gets at times, but the idea of the film begs for there to be an inherent political context. And while there are a few lingering moments when the film submerges itself a bit too heavy handed into the political realm and parodies some of the most ridiculous things we have heard in the news about the government and Homeland Security, the film manages to stay very light and flaky when it comes to being serious. It does not want to be a message film (such as films like Lions for Lambs and Rendition), but merely a means of expressing some humour about ridiculous ideas we can only read about.I liked that it continued the formula of pursuing the ending goal, and sticking to it (with many interjections along the way), but I thought the entire subplot involving a love interest for Kumar, played by Danneel Harris. It makes for some intriguing character development, and obviously leads to some key plot points in the movie, but it just felt a bit too contrived and clichéd for my liking. The subplot distracts from the key goal (even though it is heavily intertwined), but it just never pulled through the way I hoped it would. It even manages to address things that only get mere mentions instead of usable screen time (including one of the biggest laugh-out-loud moments in the entire film, which lasts for mere seconds). Doing away with her, or using her to a much lesser degree, could have only made this film shorter and leaner, as opposed to its slightly lengthy final version.What did surprise me was that few jokes were repeated from the original film (minus the nods to the seemingly stronger than expected continuity), but a lot continue the trend of drug and sex jokes. Thankfully, much like the first film, the majority of them stick and are downright hilarious. Some reviewers may say they merely smiled at these jokes. But if you had any interest in the original film, chances are you may get slight convulsions at some of the things said and done here. A lot of them are not very original, but the cast makes them work wonderfully.But unfortunately, the film plays it a little too fast and easy with the stereotype and racist jokes. I laughed at many of these jokes, but there were a few too many that bordered on bad taste, and a few that were just not funny at all. I realize the original film relied on jokes like these, but it never became a crutch for the film to walk on. This film seems to need it to drag itself around in certain areas, and did not need to have nearly as many of these style jokes. The sheer number of racist jokes that were just retreads of the past thirty years of cinema were too numerous to even try and count. It never got to the point of disgusting me, but simply disheartened me at the lengths the creators were willing to stoop to for slight chuckles.Cho and Penn work magic together again in this film. They truly are an odd couple for the new century. They are not quite a profanity-laced/drug-infused version of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, but their chemistry on screen is better than most romantic comedy couplings. They have a natural rhythm together, and work off each other greatly. There is a genuine partnership at work here, and never once does it seem like either is strained or out of their element in their roles. They play their characters very straight and narrow, and even at the most ridiculous of moments, stay in character and stay funny (unlike other actors in similar comedies). Kudos to both for continuing to prove their worth as able-bodied comedic actors.The rest of the main cast is a bit of a mixed bag. Garcés is barely in the movie, and Harris is really not that much of a treasure. Eric Winter and Roger Bart do alright in limited roles, while Rob Corddry hams it up a bit too hard (and is the perpetrator of the most stereotyping unfortunately). But of course, much like the first film, Neil Patrick Harris does a scene-stealing parody portrayal of himself, and nails every laugh he comes into contact with.While it is not as surprising as the first film, this sequel is still a worthwhile piece of entertainment. It has plenty of laughs, but just do not expect anything wholly original.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Harold and Kumar. They have to be the best duo in all of movies. They always find a way to make people(at least me) laugh. They did it again here. I liked this movie just a little better than the first one because of some certain scenes.The duo are on their way to Amsterdam when Kumar is caught with a bong. The plane assumes that it's a bomb. So they get the police involved and H&amp;K are whisked to Guantamano Bay. They find away to escape and now they must avoid the cops.There are many funny scenes here. My favorite scenes involved the cyclops, George W Bush, and the "bottomless" party. Also, the National Defense guy is really stupid but in a funny way. Overall, this is a really funny movie. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge let down after White Castle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I want to talk about why I liked White Castle. It didn't try to be an emotional ride, it was simply 2 guys going from point A to point B. That's it, that simple. It focused more on the different events the 2 run into on the road to White Castle. I liked it for it. Sometimes you want a deep plot, great action sequences, round characters, and sometimes you just want to let your brain veg out and watch a low brow comedy. The later is what White Castle is.This second one tried too hard to top the first. They stuck a love story that wasn't very original. The plot, dialog, and characters felt different, like another group of writers who never saw the first wrote it. The gags and jokes were more intended to offend and shock than to make you laugh. I sat there in the theater and felt like the writers were huge Howard Stern fans and were trying to pay his style and humor homage any chance they could at the cost of a better joke. Too often a scene feels like its going to be good but then they disjoint any sense of comedic timing with some needless sex visual.Harold and Kumar is supposed to be a stoner comedy, not a sex comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recycled jokes/story returns a little stale, but still has funny moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the first film wasn't perfect, it had a engaging and even charming blend of smart/stupid/stoner comedy that still won me over in the end, even if I felt like it could've been more. Escape from Guantanamo Bay, while blessed with one of the most hilarious titles to grace a movie, takes only part of the formula that made the first one so enjoyable and turns it up a few notches, namely the crude, the lewd and the rude. But I think that throws the whole mix and reduces the impact of the picture.It's not all a wash as the film still has some solid laugh-out-loud moments in it, but since the film essentially tries to tread the same territory again for most of its running time, and there are more misses than hits, it gets old. Especially the numerous jokes recycled from the first film. The story itself, although it starts out promising, Harold and Kumar spend but a short moment in Guantanamo Bay and I feel like a lot of the potential for comedy gets wasted quickly in exchange for trying to be as over-the-top as it can be, with frontal nudity and gross-out shots. The rest of the story is pretty much the same as the first film, except instead of being on a munchie fueled quest for little burgers, they are trying to clear their name.But the same multiple-stops-along-their-path occur, meeting again with country hillbillies and Neil Patrick Harris. But, since we've seen all this before, it seems stale, even after throwing in a unicorn.I guess the problem is that it's just not that funny and there are plenty of comedic missteps. When it works, it can be quite amusing, even for a brief potent moments (a few seconds during a flashback are absolutely hilarious), but the glue that holds this pic together isn't very good and the whole thing comes apart pretty quickly. I can imagine that this might be enjoyable for some, but it's really just not together enough (and being crude for the sake of being crude doesn't help) to work in the end. Very flawed, but has a couple funny moments. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing, but little else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I would like to rave praise about Gen-X's beloved stoner duo's new film, I can't. Harold and Kumar's second adventure, while sometimes amusing, is a far step below their first trip.Right after they successfully found White Castle, Harold and Kumar follow Maria, Harold's would-be girlfriend from afar, to Amsterdam. Unfortunately, a misunderstanding causes them to wind up in Guantanamo Bay. As the title suggests, they escape, and they have to make their way to Texas to clear their names.The problem with the film is that the material isn't that funny. While the subjects for the jokes are ripe for ridicule (especially an idiotic government agent (Rob Cordoroy), in a performance that's only funny because it has an obvious element of truth in it), they aren't attacked with any vigor. The humor needs to be sharp, instead, it's rather flat.John Cho and Kal Penn are clearly comfortable with their characters, and easily slide back into them. Rob Cordory has to potential to be hilarious, but the screenplay lets him down. Bit parts are supplied by Daneel Harris, Eric Winter, and others, but no one has any standout scenes. New to the cast is Beverly D'Angelo in a small, but slightly memorable part. Christopher Meloni, Eddie Kaye Thomas and David Krumholtz return, as does of course, Neil Patrick Harris.Do I recommend it? It really doesn't matter, because fans of the first will see it regardless, if they haven't already. But unless you're a die-hard fan of the first, skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't love the first one, but I did like it better then this sequel so that says a lot right there. There were a few down right hilarious lines but they were few and far between. The chemistry between the two star can't be denied but with such an over the top storyline it's hard to not be focused on that instead of the characters. What's funnier the actors or the situations, because if it is the situations only then anyone could play the roles and it would not hurt the movie in anyway and in a good movie that should never be the case. As before, the trailer for this film killed a lot of the jokes and surprises that would have been hilarious if I hadn't heard them before like five times. Also I guess it's pretty much a standard in comedies for the plot to be predictable and just a way to get from joke to joke but wouldn't it be nice if at least once that wasn't the case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot understand how that disgustingly crude, unfunny, unimaginative, often slow, rubbish warrants a 7.2. More like 2 at best and that is only for the nudity and Neil Patrick Harris (although there was far too much of him and wore thin).This is the worst film I have had the misfortune to see in years. Anybody that compares it favourably to "You don't mess with the Zohan" needs to get a new brain because their current one is defective.Any comparisons with early Cheech and Chong films are also inappropriate. While the characters(and actors Penn and Cho) of Kumar and Harold are OK, the writing is just plain abysmal and devoid of any real humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Piece of Crap...Literally!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with this movie was 5 minutes into it, we see Kumar sitting on the toilet. We are treated to watching the guy defecate, with exaggerated farting sounds and impact sounds while he brags about the enormity of what is coming out. At this point, I shut off the DVD player. This happened previously, as I shut off the DVD player during the "White Castle" installment as the two lovely British ladies were having a diarrhea competition. So much for this sick, perverted garbage. I truly felt insulted and didn't want to lower my standards by viewing this demented and demeaning mess.By all means, avoid this poor excuse for a movie unless: (a) you are being held hostage and are forced to watch it, (b) you enjoy watching people sit on the toilet and defecate, (c) you are in a deep coma, or (d) you are an exhumed corpse tied to a chair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold &amp; Kumar should have stuck to hamburgers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit it. This movie had more than a few hilarious scenes. It isn't terrible, but the vast majority of the scenes are lazily derivative of other movies, including "Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle". When you have to rip off your own material, that's just wrong. This review contains spoilers, but be forewarned: if you saw the first movie there aren't many surprises to be had in the theater anyway.I sure hope this movie doesn't generate loud cries of racism, the way "21" did. In fact, it is a testament to the appeal of a non-traditional buddy team that the movie is as watchable as it is. With stars less likable than Kal Penn and John Cho, this movie could have been downright awful. Sure, there are a lot of racial stereotypes played for laughs, but you don't have to watch too carefully to notice that the characters applying the stereotypes are the ones being lampooned. Subtle this movie is not.Anyway, on to the plot. There isn't one. Harold &amp; Kumar get sent to Guantanamo Bay, escape in about 2 minutes, then spend the rest of the movie on the run from a psychotic government agent, in the process rehashing most of the adventures they had in the first movie or some other buddy team had in some other chase flick.Early in the movie Kumar actually comments that the guys' adventure will be like "Eurotrip" except it won't suck. I actually believed that promise because the first H&amp;K movie was so funny, but I don't think this one delivered.I can pinpoint the exact moment I knew this movie was going to disappoint: the guys had the opportunity to borrow the car of their friend, a guy so rich and successful he throws his own "bottomless" party (a scene that accounts for half of this movie's review stars). So what do they drive off in? A yellow Ford Mustang convertible. Boring! I could rent one of those for about $59 a day. It would have been much funnier to see these guys drive off in something exotic, especially given how their car eventually gets abandoned.While on the run, there is a scene with some inbred rednecks. Very derivative of the first movie and not nearly as funny. Also, some Klansmen get a bit of come-uppance; didn't some racist punks get their come-uppance in the first one? Yeah, I thought so, and it was a lot funnier. Note to fans of the Howard Stern show: Richard Christy's role is disappointingly brief; no wonder they threw him off the red carpet at the film's premiere.Yeah, NPH is back, and he's funny, but he has to work twice as hard to get his laughs. In the first movie, two things were funny: the irony of him crossing paths with H&amp;K at all, and the irony of his character's sexual appetites in contrast to his real-life preferences. That stuff just doesn't hold up as well the second time around. So they make him even more reckless and give the relentless government agent a weird fan-boy crush on him. It's hard to say whether it worked more often than it flopped. Maybe they should have found another surprise star to show up and play opposite NPH. The most disturbing part of the movie is its depiction of government officials, particularly U.S. soldiers at Guantanamo Bay. The thing is, it's not even that offensive because there appears to be an attempt at making the characters so ridiculously over-the-top that nobody could mistake their behavior for a commentary on the real thing. The soldiers are wearing camouflage but otherwise don't look or behave anything like real soldiers. A government official literally defiles the U.S. Constitution. Tasteless? For sure. Funny? Sometimes. Controversial? I doubt it. Also interesting is the portrayal of President George W. Bush. His dialogue seems to be aimed at making him more likable, but rather than getting an actor who really looked and sounded like him they used a guy wearing so much prosthetic makeup it was more distracting than watching someone act in one of those rubber Halloween masks. Maybe that's funnier after all.This time around, the focus is on Kumar's love interest instead of Harold's. Kumar has to stop his ex-girlfriend from marrying a real jerk. Her fiancé at least does a good job acting like a jerk and nearly gets the guys sent back to Guantanamo. Worse, he doesn't know anything about the square root of 3. The movie does generate some serious belly-laughs and some of its scenes are destined to become comedy classics. But, overall, it just seems too much like a rehash to earn cult status like its predecessor. With slightly more action sequences than the first movie and all the gratuitous nudity one expects from R-rated comedies of decades past, the movie isn't a total disappointment. But when you consider that the guys spend about 2 minutes in Guantanamo Bay at the start of the movie and 2 minutes in Amsterdam at the end, I'd say "Eurotrip"s legacy is safe. At least until "Harold &amp; Kumar Go to the Moon".</fullReview>

It was an unbelievable tragedy. There were hundreds of heroes during those dark days and this makes the tragedy look like a joke. Regardless of your political views on how this was handled this is NOT the way to honor the victims or the heroes.How is it that we have come to so easily accept actual tragedies as something to make light of. Are we all frogs in a slowly boiling pot of water? Or are we afraid that we will be called a heavy of some sort for speaking against something that is so offensive? What I wonder would the masses think were they to do a movie about a personal family tragedy and make a comedy out of that?

		<shortDescription>Really BAAAAAD movie -complete disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was recently in Singapore and went to a multiplex excitedly to watch this sequel. The first version was really cute film-making and it made me wonder why they are not releasing the sequel in India: guess what now I know the REASON -"Harold and Kumar escapes from Guantanamo Bay" will never see the daylight in India; it's just won't release here. Here's why.The film is profane and disgusting in inconceivable ways - there isn't one strand of decency in all those scenes which portray graphic nudity and justify drug abuse. Now I'm not all that prudish and experienced Hollywood-cinema lovers are quite used to a bit of breasts and nudity but this film is so vulgar in taste: you just can't watch it with your family. According to one of the movie dialogs, "Topless is so over-rated; bottomless is in"...no prizes for guessing what that situation would imply.THIS IS NOT A SEMI-PORN MOVIE: I didn't go there to treat myself to visuals of vagina's. Also, there was some dirty toilet humor in the beginning - really disgusting start to one of the most-awaited sequels -I don't think I appreciated it. OK, enough on the vulgarity-but the movie really sucks due to many other reasons.First, the lack of a script. Unlike the White Castle version, this script looks straight out of someone's masturbatory fantasies e.g. the scene depicting the duo's escape from Guantanmo Bay seems pretty inconceivable to me...you just don't trip over some dead bodies across an electrified fence and bingo, FREEDOM...I don't think it's quite that simple for the highest-security prison in United States of America. Besides, Harold and Kumar both were supposed to be "ordinary guys" in "ordinary situations" for which White Castle perfectly fits the bill. The sequel contains those seemingly impossible "extraordinary situations" like both guys landing in George Bush's house (the character played by G.W. Bush was unoriginal with his Bushie-style misspellings "hypocritizer" and "terrorizer" - also the President of the United States LOVES weed just like Kumar and both call each other "awesome" Wow...male bonding of some degree there?).Also, the movie is full of loose ends...e.g. the American anti-terrorism Officer who's so hell-bent on after both Harold and Kumar as if it were a "personal vendetta" -he just looked stupid to me. Now, I don't deny there cannot be racists in those high positions but they operate in very subtle ways and not so blatantly stupid as depicted by the officer -e.g. why did he empty that coke can before the Negro guy -what was that supposed to mean?....anyone with an IQ of 100 going through the files of ordinary guys like Harold and Kumar would take it easy on them; I know the "stupid American" stereotype still holds but I never encountered an American who equated Indians with Arabs and didn't knew where India is; c'mon India is just like China -everyone has heard of it. Other scenes that make you cry for help in the cinema hall (absolutely worst cinematography): 1. Why did Janey's (Kumar's ex-gf) fiancé betray Harold and Kumar by turning them over to the authorities. That was a dumb portrayal and they didn't give any explanation. Even though he might have thought of Kumar as a threat, there was no reason to be that kinda "douchebag". 2. Why would the Alabama White couple who were in an incestuous relationship deliver something that looks like a one-eyed Cyclops? Now, I'm not a huge fan of incest but this was simply too unbelievable. 3. Most of the JOKES in Guantanamo Bay weren't really that funny..unlike the real-life parody situations in White Castle, they were obnoxious and silly, and delivered the punch-line in advance. E.g. the initial reference to a "cock-meat sandwich" wasn't all that hard to predict what would happen later. 4. Why would Kumar be so dumb to act STRANGE in an aircraft? I mean he's someone who's studying for a Medical degree and doesn't have enough common sense to not play wit FIRE in a frigging aircraft? And what gave him the stupid idea to concoct a mechanism that resembles a bomb? 5. Neil Patrick Harris too overdid his part. In the original version, he seemed a sweet and nice character with obvious flaws- even though he's shown as the same ultimate whore-monger in this one, his character lacked depth. Why would a positive role like him do something like brand the breasts of one of the whores and later, get shot and killed. Damn, considering NPH is a close-buddy of Harold and Kumar showing him dead wasn't a good idea. It's a disaster scene. 6. Final scene where Kumar kisses and makes up with his ex-gf -it was so unoriginal and clichéd..one would only laugh at the stupidity. And what gave them the idea to make Kumar repeat nonsense babble on cube root of three and some junior arithmetic. Was that supposed to be romantically funny? I don't think so - the scenes were poorly planned and badly executed, that's it.7. Of course, they finally meet Maria (the Korean guy's gf) in Amsterdam and together, all four go and smoke weed...a very happy ending. Damn, wasn't it easy to predict in the first visual itself?-- The Summary of Harold and Kumar escape from G. Bay is that it was done in a hasty way and very poor project planning. The original version was a refreshing change from seasonal Hollywood crap -this one is crap of the worst order. Totally NOT RECOMMENDED. This movie really let me down in so many ways. I am disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many here, I enjoyed the first movie (although, being a bit of a prude, I could have done without the nudity in several scenes - I guess I can't be a stoner without being a sorority girl, too). The trailers for this new sequel looked hilarious, so I was pretty excited to see it.I went to see it just over two weeks after the premier. I, my date, and one woman were the _only people in the theater_, which I think says something.The first scene, as many have said, was like a punch in the face. The story lifted a little from there, and I thought that the bong/bomb confusion on the plane was clever. I was sort of disappointed that our heroes were in Guantanimo for all of ten minutes before escaping (and, by the way, Joseph, you ghastly moron, I seriously hope you don't think face-rape is 'homosexual experimentation').The duo make it to a party in Florida and discover that it's a 'bottomless' party. Now, I'm young, but I seem to recall a time when nude jokes involved having a strategically-placed fern, couch, or fig leaf. If you want to see this movie, LET ME BE CLEAR: You will be seeing about a hundred bare snatches in the space of ten minutes.Then, just when you're thinking about leaving, the screen shoves cock in your face.I didn't know they could show that in theaters, really.That was when I and the unknown woman walked out, and my date followed, equally-bewildered. That was the first time I ever walked out of a movie (I even sat through An American Haunting). I got my $16 back.From now on, if I want stoner humor, I'll rent Taxi episodes and fast-forward to Jim Ignatowski's scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aliens must have taken over the bodies and minds of Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. There can be no other explanation as to how the writers of 'Harold and Kumar Go To The White Castle' could have written such dreck, and, trust me, dreck it is. Unmitigated dreck. Not a laugh in ninety two minutes (a guess) dreck. Dreck that gives dreck a bad name dreck. How bad a movie? Let me count the ways: a sequel to a pretty funny movie that makes you wonder whether blindfolded monkeys typing on keyboards could have produced a better screenplay...the reduction of two funny characters into unpleasant unredeemable wastes of celluloid...pre-adolescent sexual humor that wouldn't be funny to Bart Simpson...a stoner movie that a stoner would think was made as a DEA warning film filled with attempts at visual and verbal jokes that only a team of GS 14s with twenty years in writing memos could produce...I could go on.The worst movie of the year. The worst sequel of the decade. The premier must have been more a wake than happy occasion with all the principals present. They had to know. And, yet they released it on to an unsuspecting group of White Castle fans.Fitzgerald wrote that there are no second acts in American lives. Hopefully there will be no third act in Hurwitz and Schlossberg's screen writing careers...they tapped out on the way to White Castle and ruined Harold and Kumar for all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Words: Bottomless Party</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no WHITE CASTLE, but this movie has its share of greasy little laughs.It's least successful when it tries to reprise the old gags - the redneck's-wilderness-shack bit is weaker than before, criminally underusing the always excellent Missi Pyle; the sex-cameo of the giant bag of weed is a disappointing, unimaginative ripoff of last time's surreal romp; and the vastly inferior use of Neil Patrick Harris is only partially redeemed by having him shotgunned to death by an angry whore.The Guantanamo Bay stuff is reasonably funny, and the Cuban truck-float is nice. The DHS heavy, however, is a mediocre performer given almost nothing to do and not doing it very well. None of the ideas are explored with anything like comic ingenuity, and most of the scenes fall flatter than their premises would seem to warrant.But then again, you've got lots and lots of naked girls, plus a blow-laced reefer party in W's rec room that pretty much saves the whole show for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the humor is raunchy, some of the humor falls flat, but all-in-all this a funny and at times hilarious movie. Kal Penn is especially impressive. There is no question that he is a gifted actor who could probably handle drama as well as he does comedy. The scene with President Bush is absolutely hilarious and generates nonstop laughter. Most surprising is the performance of Neil Patrick Harris who proves that he can do comedy. Mr. Harris is extremely funny and his scenes are among the funniest in the movie. This movie is goofy, irreverent, sometimes pedestrian, occasionally provocative, but always interesting and at times quite funny. Some aspects of the film may be considered offensive by some but remember it's a comedy so take it with a grain of salt and have yourself a good laugh.</fullReview>

They seem like real friends and are fun to watch.The originality and its tendency to go TOO far is always fresh.so it is something that i can assure will amuse many, most people in fact.but im just the odd one out i guess.one day i hope there's a movie that i don't have to FORCE myslef to laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I say? This trip was even better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember way back in 2004 getting pretty stoked for Harold and Kumar go to The White Castle (as eloquently put by the great Fred Willard) because this was something I certainly could relate to after a great night of partyin' like a rock star.However, after watching the movie with such high expectations I honestly came out a little unsatisfied. As Simon Cowell once said, "It was like ordering a burger without getting the meat". Don't get me wrong, I still liked it to a degree but it seemed to try too hard with both the comedy and social commentary leaving a lingering stench of onion breath when it was all said and done (hey, it could have been worse if you pick up what I'm laying down).Well, enough about that, because four years later, the boys are back right where they left off on a mutual quest to Amsterdam for their own reasons. Of course,the most crucial motivator of all, to smoke plenty of the finest weed in the world - legally (woot!). After a funny altercation with security at the airport (despite being diluted by being featured in the preview) the adventure fires back up as the overanxious Kumar has managed to cause a scenario that in the eyes of narrow minded yet hilariously idiotic Homeland Security Agent, Ron Fox (Rob Corddry who effectively channels a reminiscent Stanley Kowalski), is grounds for a hospitable vacation in G Bay instead- where the cock meat sandwiches are the featured everyday menu special. Yeah, it's exactly what you think it is.Now here's where I think the movie somewhat changes direction to maybe aggravate or confuse a few viewers that I feel should be established right here and now. Instead of this being a movie mostly set in prison with a dramatic escape finale, the boys actually escape rather quickly turning it into another road movie in the spirit of the original and kinda like Eurotrip except it didn't suck. In the remarkably deft hands of writer/director team Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg backing this latest production, the delicate craft of separating the various adventures from potentially dismal absurdity into genuine comedy was so successful that I confidently say this has been one of the most improved sequels I've seen in some time. Not to mention, the real magic of this film doesn't end with consecutively funny scenes either. The heart and soul of this film is contained within the incorporation of a satirical and pertinent take on society's existing misconceptions as well as inversely examining solutions with a naturally realistic look at friendships and even romance...there was a bottomless party too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing this movie was a little strange for me, because it felt like it had a lot of anger toward white people. And you know, I'm sure they have their reasons, and it's all valid, and all of that.But the really human people were mostly non-white, and the white people were mostly stereotypes -- the inbred southerners, the Klansman, the preppy jerk, the old lady on the plane who sees terrorists everywhere, the national security goon, etc.There are two good white characters, including the love interest. And the fact that the movie is genuinely funny makes up for a lot.But I saw this in Times Square on opening night, in a packed theater. Mostly black and Latino people. And everyone was laughing. I was laughing a lot too, really. But everyone was laughing at these stereotypes, and it was kind of like, "Hey, this isn't cool, guys. I'm sitting right here." But I'm sure that happens a lot in the other direction -- which is why I think of this as the shoe being on the other foot. A useful experience, I guess.I don't know. I saw the first one, and liked it a lot, so I was really eager to go to this one. I came out on opening night, and braved the crowds in midtown. But I don't think I'll go see Harold and Kumar 3, if it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay has some funny gags and a sense of humor, but it is not as good as the first movie.THis time around both stoner's take a plane to Amsterdam so they can meet up with Harold's love interest and indulge in their favorite smoke legally. Kumar however can't wait, and so he pulls out a homemade bong while on the plane. THis is then of course mistaken for a bomb, and it is off to Guantanamo Bay for our two heroes. THey of course escape after being forced to almost do something (um) not to healthy, and are soon on the run while being pursued by Homeland Security. Homeland Security is led by the racist Ron Fox (Rob Corddry) who is really only filling in as leader because the real guy in charge is on a fishing trip and cannot be bothered. While on their journey to Texas, to meet up with their friend who might be able to clear their names because he is in good with President BUsh, they come across all kinds of strange people just like in the original film. One of the scenes also includes the Ku Klux Klan.The jokes and gags are all in bad taste, as they are supposed to be. THere is a lot of potty humor, I think even more so than in the first film. THis film also really pushes the buttons on making fun of Homeland Security.The acting is good all around. John Cho and Kal Penn as our two lovable heroes have great chemistry. Neil Patrick Harris also reprises his role as the mushroom loving Jack Daniels drinking stoner we all loved from the first film. His performances, just like in the first film, is right on. HIs part seems smaller than in the first film, but that didn't bother me any.I really did enjoy the film somewhat, but some of the story starts to become repetitive, and it loses some of its steam as it finally comes to the end. THere is a cameo with President Bush which though funny in a way, just didn't quite work for me. I guess because I've heard too many jokes on behalf of the president for some years now, and hearing more of the same is just a bit boring. I given it a respectable rating of 6 out of 10. Not quite recommended, but not bad either.</fullReview>

Also, the extreme drug use kind of bothered me.I have to admit, the movie was extremely funny and I probably had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard at some points. I liked seeing Danneel Harris in the movie as I'm a huge fan of One Tree Hill. I liked her part as well.I never saw the first one, but apparently it was much less graphic. The drugs and nudity were pretty much the reason I gave this movie a 4/10. It wasn't needed. I wouldn't watch it again! And I'm definitely glad a friend of mine paid for my ticket! Not worth the money to sit through a disgusting/degrading movie, regardless of how funny it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely not as funny as the first, it took the easy route with a lot of the jokes and pretty much sunk itself trying to outdo Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle. Scenes at Guantanamo Bay are not at all funny, considering the context and also considering the fact that the jokes just weren't funny in any context. NPH was pretty much underused and his scenes seemed forced, as if they were trying too hard to outdo NPH on X. The movie was basically pot humor and pot-conspiracy theorizing, which is funnier in the first movie where there wasn't as much attempt at plot. Most of the people in the theater I was at laughed more at the Pineapple Express trailer than at the actual Harold &amp; Kumar movie. The President Bush thing seemed like a two-second bit that was dragged out for ten minutes, and most of the gags you could predict seconds before they actually happen. Also, all the racial "humor" was really, really lame and forced. Not worth the $10. I'd wait and Netflix it, if I could turn back time, that is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For reasons unexplained, I did not watch Harold and Kumar in their quest to look for White Castle on the big screen, even though movies like these are right up my alley (I need to destress from time to time, with what a friend of mine would describe movies like these as "cock shows"). However, I did catch the best bits (heh) of the original movie when I was waiting for things to happen on a film set, though technically I have still yet to watch it from start to end. With the sequel now being screened, I am so there already.Beginning directly where the first movie had left off, Harold Lee (John Cho) and Kumar Patel (Karl Penn) are now en route to Amsterdam, weed capital of the world, where they can indulge in their favourite drug and be high all the time. Secondary objective is of course Harold's quest to look for Maria (Paula Garces), and on the way they bump into Vanessa (Danneel Harris), Kumar's ex-girlfriend who introduced him to the world of marijuana. But with the idiotic duo, what you see in the trailer had to happen, and being accused as agents of North Korea and Al-Qaeda, they get sent to Guantanamo Bay where they soon bust out of.Like the first movie, we follow these two jokers from incident to incident, each playing like a stand alone comedy skit, as they try to evade capture from the Department of Homeland Security, and now with their new quest of looking up Vanessa, so that they can get her influential fiancé to get them off the hook, coupled with Kumar's own vendetta of disrupting the upcoming wedding proceedings. I was somewhat surprised that this movie had some semblance of a flimsy plot to follow, such that it's not mindless random episodes all the way (such as throwing in the KKK out of nowhere).The jokes come from you at all angles - verbal, slapstick, and sometimes just plain irreverent. And for those who are anal retentive, you'd probably foam at the source material for most of the jokes, ranging from the homophobic to the racist, executed so sublimely, you'd probably feel guilty for laughing out loud at the funny bits. And what's a movie like this without the usual gratuitous shots of body parts, female and male, with genitalia on display without a tinge of embarrassment. What more, the camera lingers, especially when filmmakers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg wanted to probably perpetuate their version of a happening bottomless party in your face. Yep, topless is overrated.But I guess what made this movie click, was that it doesn't hold back, and dared to slow things down by dipping into melodrama-romantic moments which will raise your goosebumps. Friendship between the two idiots get tested, broken (momentararily) and healed faster than you can smoke a joint, and Love, well, let's see if the square root of three will make you go "awww" (some members of the audience actually did!) All in all, Harold and Kumar rocks (Can't believe I'm actually saying that), and I guess it's time to hunt down a copy of the White Castle DVD to indulge unabashedly at their original escapade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure whether or not I expected Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay to better the first cult comedy from 2004. While H&amp;K Go to White Castle wasn't the prize taker for best pot comedy of the decade (Pineapple Express takes that title), it was about as cool, witty deranged, and crazy a post Cheech and Chong romp as one could ask for, especially considering the director did Dude Where's my Car. The trailer for the sequel basically gave away the premise right away: Harold and Kumar, on a plane going to Amsterdam, are thrown off for being suspected terrorists, with Rob Cordrey's government agent saying in true one-dimensional tone, "Al-Quaeda and North Korea working together!" The trailer was perfect on a first viewing... then wore thin by the time the film finally touched down completely. To make a blunt comparison- no pun intended (OK, a little)- it's like getting a baggie filled with some fairly good stuff, but also filled with a good many twigs and seeds.In other words, it's only about a little worth the energy to get up off the futon and get to the theater. It would probably make a better rental, with a bunch of friends wasted to hell (this last part might not exactly be a compliment to the film as much as a necessity) as opposed to a theater. The filmmakers- the first film's writers- pick up the story right where the last left off, following the love/hate friendship of Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn), who this time have a similar climactic blow to Clerks 2, and up until then are anxious nice guy and slacker horn-dog respectively who each have their own romantic flames somewhere out of reach. But at the same time the story/plot is a rehash of most of the jokes from the last film (i.e. sex dream with a huge female pot-baggie; in-bred white-trash stumble; missed opportunities with the opposite sex), and they only allow for some few chuckles and thoughts like "oh, that was funny... I guess."The one wild card that pays off incredibly well is Neal Patrick Harris. Here's a guy who submits himself to a "character" form of himself, who continues where he left off from 'White Castle' as a has-been with a penchant for hallucinogens and prostitutes. Anytime he's on screen it's a riot, particularly here where the poster many have seen of him on a unicorn saying "What would NPH do?" is given better context. There are also a good few belly laughs to be had with Cordrey's over-the-top Homeland Security agent, and a fantastic bit part from Chris Meloni (yeah, Law and Order Meloni) as a KKK chief. Yet more often than not the filmmakers rely on old-hat poop and genital jokes, and when they try and hit bigger targets (i.e. the 'attrocities' of Guantanamo Bay, George W. Bush as a pot-head, the state of terrorism in the US) they fall flat or only work on a shallow level. Their targets are better on smaller playing fields, and they just don't have the stamina to contend with the level of satire that one sees, albeit a different form, on the Daily Show and Colbert Report.So, yeah, it's OK, maybe more or less depending on your comic preferences and how much you can take of either really spot-on gags or just really, really stupid ones. Bring a bud, and see how it goes, maybe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold and Kumar Go to Cinema Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American comedy is in dire straits, and has been for quite some time. This is even more troubling when it seems that most of the unfunny sludge being pumped out of Hollywood is targeting a demographic of which I'm a part (27-year old Caucasian male). Yet I fail to see any humor in the "Judd Apatow School" of so-called "comedy" (excepting "The 40-Year Old Virgin"), which seems to toss out pop-culture references and SHOW seemingly outrageous things without attaching any sense of style or panache to it?the joke is SUPPOSED to be the pop-culture reference or the outrageous image ITSELF (boy, I could laugh all day at guys who are obsessed with smoking pot!). Have our expectations as viewers of cinema become so low that this is the type of thing that now comprises "humor" and box-office success? If "Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay" is any indication, then the answer is a staggeringly depressing YES. But if the sparse first-weekend turnout in my theater is any indication, then this may be the death knell of the outrageous, pop-culture obsessed gross-out "comedy." Now before you point out my elitism and lack of humor, I will say that I watched "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" prior to this sequel, and enjoyed it quite a bit?the movie had a flawed yet endearing imbalance between sending up racial and cultural stereotypes, misogynist behavior, and stoner humor, all while leaving us enthralled by the quest of Harold Lee (John Cho) and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn), two wildly different roommates who embark on an often-hilarious misadventure to the titular location. Granted, some of the gags and characters existed solely to push the bounds of tastelessness, but the film overall was a solid little laugh-fest.Following the law of diminishing expectations (as well as the general rule that most sequels flat-out suck), "Guantanamo" is below-average to just plain awful in every respect. Taking its cues from the formulaic crudity of Apatow and the flatly patronizing outrageousness of "Borat" (another inexplicably popular "comedy" of few laughs), Harold and Kumar's second outing indulges racist and sexist stereotypes, broadly unfunny post-9/11 "humor," and increasingly tiresome marijuana gags. The audience for this seems not to be the people who appreciated the original, but those who blazed up in the parking lot before buying their tickets (and are thus prone to laughing at anything). That would go a long way in explaining why certain scenes (including a much-appreciated?but also much less funny?appearance by Neil Patrick Harris) are repeated almost verbatim from the original."White Castle" had its share of incisive satire amid the vulgarity, using the quest for some munchies as a framing device, but "Guantanamo" feels aimless and meandering for most of its run time?the conflicts between our two main characters feel inauthentic, their encounters stale (including a run-in with the KKK and an inbred cyclops-child), and the sense of satire completely inept?nowhere is this more pronounced than in the character of Ron Fox (Rob Corddry), a Department of Homeland Security operative whose over-the-top character is one of the most vile, grotesque, and unfunny ever to appear in a motion picture; the writing and Corddry's own overblown performance is a blatant indicator of how off-the-mark John Hurwitz' and Hayden Schlossberg's direction really is.Based on "Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay," I doubt we'll be seeing a third installment in the series...but at least we'll always have "White Castle."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was possibly the funniest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold And Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay was the funniest movie I have ever seen in my whole entire life. I have never laughed nearly as hard as I did when I had seen this movie. The theatre was pretty packed for it being the midnight showing. Everyone in the theatre did not stop laughing either. They made every single part funny one way or another. Harold and Kumar have never been so funny. I loved how they mixed the drugs, sex, nudity, and jokes all together. This movie was done in very good taste. It was not to dirty and didn't have a ton of drugs. Their was a lot of drugs and drug references but it was all okay. One thing I really liked about this movie was that it took place right from the first one. I loved how they mixed in Harolds love story and and Kumars love story also. This movie started out amazing and just kept getting better and better. It never got boring in the entire movie. The story was hilarious having Kumar get mistaken for a terrorist. The whole movie they were on the run which was pretty cool. The acting was very good as well. I wish that they would have had more screen time for Maraia and Neal Patrick Harris. They didn't really get much screen time at all. Neal really made this movie so much better from the scenes he was in. He did such a great job as well. This movie really was just so amazing. It should easily win for the funniest movie of the year. I would go see this movie again and again. It is one of those kind of movie that you don't get sick of seeing. I also think that even if your not a pot head you can enjoy this movie. You don't have to be a pot head to enjoy this movie. Their was some surprisingly good messages in it. They some how made smoking weed seem like it isn't so bad in this movie. I think that adults and especially teenagers would enjoy this movie a lot. Overall this was easily one of the funniest movies ever made. It was way better than the first and that says a lot considering the first was great as well. S o just take my word for it and go see it and you will laugh your head off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The return of one movie that changed the minds of the world comedic geniuses, this movie was a great sequel in all aspect, lets start with Kal Penns character, what a great way to add to career, after Namesake and White Castle, this movie easily was amongst his best performances, hes still one of the best comedic people alive, every scene with harold was hilarious, the scene during the plane and getting on was amazing, truly enjoyed the scene with them going on, and lets get to Harolds character, he felt a lot more loose for this movie, his character was more loosely based, and he had a lot of dramatic scenes in this movie then the first one that he did. He is credible in this movie more then Kumar because finding the girl from the first one, the only thing I guess I didn't enjoy was the second half of the movie, first half was very well written but the second half could've been better, and the ending was the whole best part about the movie, I was shocked to see the way the movie ended, I was happy for the way the director added that famous person from the first movie, Forgot his name but still it was a good movie, everyone who is a harold and kumar see this one, you will not be disappointed!</fullReview>
