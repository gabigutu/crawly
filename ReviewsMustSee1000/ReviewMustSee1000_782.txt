		<shortDescription>a piece of fun ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film, the first filmed in CinemaScope, although the second to be released, remains as slick and witty as ever. While the three girls chase rich husbands they somehow end up marrying for love. Personally for me it is Lauren Bacall and William Powell that standout...their witty knowing conversations are a true delight. Mr Powell shows just why he was so highly regarded. He has a magnificent calm and dignified presence beautifully complimented by Mrs Bogart's cool chic.The film shows all the problems of early CinemaScope of course ...the lack of closeups because of optical distortions that would occur and enough light to sunbake under being necessary on the sets and a sound scheme with the stereophonic image shifting from side to side as characters moves across the screen. The film is beautifully restored on the DVD with fine colour and sound.The use of a 1:2.55 ratio means a truly WIDE screen ....which is shown off by the location shots of New York and the girls apartment which seems enormous!The opening sequence/overture of course was designed to show off both the brand new wide screen and stereo sound. It seems slightly redundant now but is still a fabulous piece of music by Alfred Newman.So turn the lights down, turn up the stereo and step back to 1953 and watch a consumate piece of entertainment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a wonderfully, delightful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had a wonderful opportunity to catch a screening of this film on a wide screen. What a treat! Unfortunately, it wasn't the best print; lots of dust and scratches on reel changes, and the colors were quite faded, but these films simply must be seen on a wide screen with an audience to be truly appreciated. Of course, almost any movie is improved by seeing it at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, and I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity.Lauren Bacall has always been one of my favorite actors, and she and Powell do work wonderfully together. Monroe is also, always a delight - I think that she was a much better actress than she is generally given credit for. However, though I've seen this movie close to a dozen times before, I was really struck at the wonderful performance that Grable turned in. She was perfect! I haven't seen much of her other work, but in HTMAM, she shows herself to be a wonderful comedic actress, playing a "dim blonde" who really isn't that dim. What a revelation and what a delight.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes old movies, but if you have a chance to catch it on a real movie screen - DO SO! You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>baked Alaska</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An over excited critic once wrote that seeing Monroe in Cinemascope was like being smothered in baked Alaska, and seeing this movie, you know exactly what he (I assume he was a he) was on about. The movie opens on the extreme verticals of New York skyscrapers and narrow city streets, then cuts to a wonderfully elongated horizontal Monroe streeeeeeeetched across the scene in an increasingly empty apartment (the girls sell their furniture to be able to pay the rent). This movie is dated and fluffy, but has several interesting elements that make it worth a look for anyone interested in movie history, any of the leads, or in passing a wet Sunday afternoon in a pleasant way. This was Grable's last performance. She knew Monroe was about to usurp her, but the two women both dealt with an uncomfortable situation in a professional way. There is a great narrative twist in the film too - Monroe plays a short sighted girl who finally meets the man to marry her when he tells her he likes her in her glasses. Unlike the usual cliched plot line, it is when Monroe keeps her glasses on that she is revealed to be beautiful. Her acting is this film is among her best, especially her vulnerable scene in the gold aeroplane, and the moment in the powder room when she looks at herself in the mirrors and explodes into five, raspberry satin dress covered Marilyn's is a visual pleasure the film and the viewer revel in (Monroe can't, not wearing her glasses at that point). This film is creamy, smooth, warm - just liked baked Alaska!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this cute story of gold-diggers on the prowl. I agree with those who said that musical prologue was way too long -- it was eight minutes before the opening credits came on! This seemed the perfect setting for Marilyn Monroe to sing "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend," but that gem was in another of her films. I don't agree with those who said Betty Grable was too old for her part. She merely *looked* old. I tried to figure out why. She was only 35 years old. She was still slim (possibly even slimmer than Lauren Bacall, who'd recently had her second child) and her face looked relatively youthful. So why did she look 45? I concluded it was the hair. That poodle cut was unflattering and added years. I also enjoyed Grable's coy reference to real-life husband Harry James and Bacall's to Bogart. All in all, a charming movie and a fun way to spend an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HILARIOUS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is great. I don't care what people say about it, you can't deny that it is very entertaining! I really don't know what goes through peoples minds when they say Betty Grable wasn't good in this movie, or was too old for the part. I can't imagine the story without her to make it what it is. I personally thought she looked the same age as her co-stars, and not a bit older.Lauren Bacall was perfect for her role, and as always, so was Marilyn Monroe as another dumb blonde character. But I hate when most people think that just because she portrayed a ditzy girl, that it means she was like that in real life too - SHE WASN'T! Marilyn Monroe was an intelligent natural dark-brown haired brunette.Anyway, HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE is really good in my opinion, and anyone that is a Monroe, Bacall or Grable fan absolutely MUST see it! I personally am a HUGE Marilyn Monroe fan, and enjoyed this movie as much as her others.The storyline was great, and it had some very funny moments. I give this movie 9.5/10, losing a half-mark only because of the extreamly prolonged and unnecessary musical feature at the beginning, which makes you lose interest and want to fast forward 5 minutes worth of inactive classical music. An overall fabulous movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monroe and Grable and Bacall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This entertaining film has the three girls (Pola, played by Marilyn Monroe in specs; Schatze, played by Lauren Bacall and looking rather mumsy; and Loco, played by Betty Grable with those fabulous legs) setting up shop in an apartment, ready to reel in wealthy husbands.The boys in question include David Wayne, Rory Calhoun, Cameron Mitchell, William Powell, and Alex D'Arcy. Trying to figure out the scheming girls is hard for them, especially when the girls are going all out to hide their real personalities! This glitzy fluff is enlivened by real-life in-jokes - Betty Grable doesn't recognise a Harry James record (she was married to him at the time), and Lauren Bacall says she's mad about 'that old man in The African Queen'(real-life husband Bogart of course). Bacall comes out best of the girls although Monroe is always worth watching and Grable was effective decoration even towards the end of her career, as she was here (having been on screen for over twenty years at this point - her first appearance was in her teens in 'Hold 'Em Jail', I think).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trapping a Bankroll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to Marry a Millionaire is one of the brightest and wittiest comedies of the fifties and certainly quite an eyeful when you've got three leads of the caliber of Lauren Bacall, Marilyn Monroe, and Betty Grable.These three lovely girls, following the cue from Lauren Bacall, chip in and get a long term lease on a swank apartment where the owner has had to leave the country because of income tax problems. The post World War II years saw a lot of that happening. The idea is to set up a mantrap, put up a good front in the hopes of attracting men with wealth. And all three come up with men of all varieties.Betty unfortunately takes up with the already married, but not working at it too hard Fred Clark. His plans for a romantic getaway with her are spoiled by her coming down with an adult case of the measles and Grable catching sight of Forest Ranger Rory Calhoun. You will love the way the scheming Fred Clark gets nailed.Marilyn meets up with David Wayne, the guy whose apartment the women have taken over. In Marilyn fashion she gets on the wrong plane with Wayne, thinking it was Atlantic City instead of Kansas City.And Bacall the most determined of all to marry a millionaire. She has her choice between elderly sophisticated William Powell and earnest young Cameron Mitchell.The irony of this film is that all three women set out to trap a bankroll, yet all three fall for people themselves. No telling what fate has in store for you.How to Marry a Millionaire is the next to last film of William Powell and his first after leaving his long term contract at MGM. He's the picture of elegance and sophistication. Listening to every line from his mouth is a joy.Nunnally Johnson's screenplay and Jean Negulesco's direction make How to Marry a Millionaire one of the best films of the Fifties. Catch those lines referring to the celebrity husbands of Bacall and Grable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gold Diggers of 1953</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first movie filmed in Cinemascope, or at least, one of the first ones to use the new technique. Jean Negulesco, the director, gives it a great reading of the play in which the film is based. Nunnally Johnson, is given credit as an adapter, but also acted as the producer.The film was innocent fun by 1953 standards. We are presented with three girls that would be room mates in a gorgeous New York apartment. The only problem is none of them have any money. What to do? Try to attract a man with enough money to keep them in a style they were not accustomed to live! The trio of young women are beautiful. We have the brainy Schatze in charge of the household. Then there are the myopic Pola, and the flighty Loco. It's clear that the only one with a head on her shoulders si Schatze, who knows how to move in the cafe society of the New York of those years. Unfortunately, the women's choice in men is awful. Two of them end up with guys that are just making a living, and in a surprise at the last moment, the last girl gets a real millionaire when she only thought he was a working class stiff!The film, although light, it's still fun to watch. Lauren Bacall is the one that fares better in the film, not only does she get the prize package, but she gives an intelligent account of her elegant and sophisticated Schatze. Betty Grable doesn't have much to do, and a bespectacled Marilyn Monroe, does a lot with her character.William Powell makes a great appearance as the older man in Schatze's life. He still was showing his charm as the Texas man with enough sense to resign being married to a much younger woman. David Wayne, Cameron Mitchell, Rory Calhoun, Fred Clark, are the men in the lives of the would be gold diggers.This is a film to be seen as a curiosity film made in the new technology of Cinemascope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bette Grable, Marilyn Monroe and Lauren Bacall make quite a team in this 1953 fun film. Bacall is the leader of the girl pack whose quest is to get 3 rich guys. They take an expensive apartment along the way.Bacall has by far the best lines in the film. She comes off with her constant wisecracks and they are hilarious at best.Monroe is perfect as her usual dumb blond. Grable is literally Loco in this flick as well.The film reunites David Wayne and Rory Calhoun as two of the suitors. Both had appeared together a year earlier in the Jane Froman musical-drama biography of "With A Song in My Heart," with Susan Hayward.The ending is quite a pleasant surprise. Resigned to marrying a relative pauper, Bacall and the others are literally floored when a millionaire reveals himself instead.A fun film showing that money isn't necessarily everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts off with an orchestra playing on and on and on so long at least 10 minutes that I thought something was wrong and I started to fast forward the thing....then when the credits finally rolled I thought I had missed a key part of the beginning plot..I wondered how Bacall came to rent an expensively furnished penthouse apartment? as a sublet?? Turns out there is no detailed explanation. She rents an apartment calls Monroe who has another friend and the 3 get on with their business of finding millionaire husbands. There is no background to their friendship etc... it just happens. In 1953 when this film was made, Monroe is 26 Bacall is 29 and Grable 39. (Assuming you believe the Hollywood statistics.) Like another reviewer stated Bacall has this curiously old persona (he used the word "ageless"...one could have believed her older than Grable in fact I found myself studying her face finding it hard to believe she was under 30. She also monopolizes every scene in a bitchy way that no one could possibly find sympathetic or appealing. I guess this was to show she was the brains of the operation. One thing I noted Bacall didn't need to insure her rather hefty legs for 1 million (like Grable supposedly did.)Monroe has some innocent charm and Grable is sort of the Betty White from Golden Girls...with Bacall being the Maude.I may have smiled at a couple of Bacall's cynical lines but she is too harsh in the movie. Monroe was sort of funny in the Magoo role but most of this movie is not funny at all and you begin to tire of it towards the end wondering how long you are going to have to endure it.It also seems chopped up, the male characters become mixed up....what was the fashion show all about? If you are in to period female costume extravagance this movie will work for you. Maybe it had to do with the new color cinema-scope they were using....thinking clothing in all its colors was a great way to show off its features??? Here is an oddity that truly had to be for the wide cinemascope features...all the doors in the apartment are double wide and opened from a nob in the middle (trivia).Don't really recommend it. The characters are not likable at all. The plot is idiotic and full of holes. Humor mostly missing.Forget all romance and character development which this thing pretends to have.Brainless... The sets are almost entirely glossy set ups that prefer to look artistic rather than real.AVOID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All three stars are showcased in this CinemaScope extravaganza...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fox released this one right after THE ROBE did smash box-office when it opened at New York's Roxy theater. Likewise, HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE featured an opening orchestral number under Alfred Newman's baton before the credits began--and then the wide screen became the source for watching BETTY GRABLE, LAUREN BACALL and MARILYN MONROE put their own personal stamp of sex appeal on the CinemaScope screen.This one is probably best enjoyed in the widescreen version rather than the pan and scan shown on some TV stations. It's a witty delight from start to finish, with Monroe doing a delightful impersonation of a near-sighted blonde ashamed to wear glasses and always walking into walls; Grable as a snappy charmer who gets hooked into a trip to Maine thinking she's going to a convention; and Bacall as the know-it-all sophisticate with the sharp tongue who's good at bossing others around.While Bacall is great in the role, it's really an alienating part and she can't always disguise the fact that her character--in real life--would be considered an annoying bitch. True, she has some of the best lines, but the sarcasm stings a little too much at times and her treatment of doormen and furniture movers is very condescending.So, it's up to Grable and Monroe to keep things light and breezy, and that they do. Also on hand for some sophisticated charm is WILLIAM POWELL in one of his last screen roles, RORY CALHOUN as a forest ranger who attracts Betty's eye, and CAMERON MITCHELL as a man who turns out to be someone Bacall should have treated with more respect.It's fun all the way, easy to take and easy on the eyes whenever the three stars cavort around the screen in assorted fashion ensembles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to have a wonderful Saturday night at home, get this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Schatze (Lauren Bacall) was briefly married to a gas station employee. But, fresh from her divorce, she is determined to do things differently the next time. No more nickle and dime husbands for her, she is going to marry a millionaire. Concocting an unusual scheme, she sublets a Manhattan apartment that belonged to a businessman who had to flee the country. As it is doubtful he will ever return, she begins selling the expensive piano and furnishings to afford the rent. Then, she convinces two other women to join her in a plot to find money-dripping mates. Pola (Marilyn Monroe) is a near-sighted beauty who rarely wears her spectacles because men don't make passes on women with glasses, as the saying goes. Very often, she doesn't have a clue about what her date looks like. Loco (Betty Grable), herself a blonde beauty, wants to marry well but is easily distracted by a handsome face, even if the gentleman is as poor as a churchmouse. In short order, Schatze is romanced by a great-looking, tie-less, seemingly poverty-stricken wisecracker, Tom (Cameron Mitchell) and Loco, intending to spend a weekend with a rich old coot, meets an attractive forest ranger in the woods of Maine. Meanwhile, Pola is supposed to hook up with someone in Atlantic City but boards a plane to Kansas City by mistake, where she meets a handsome, four-eyed, two-bit businessman. Will the gold digging schemes of these three ladies go out the window? Here is a film my three sisters and I adored when we were teenagers in the late fifties-early sixties. Made in 1953, it is a wonderful romantic comedy and looks sensational to boot. Bacall, Grable, and especially Monroe are total delights as the women who would be glad to make matches with millionaires, if only true love was not around to rear its head. The rest of the cast, including Mitchell, is quite nice, too. Naturally, the costumes are gorgeous and the settings among the uppercrust are first class as well. As for the script and direction, they are both snappy, memorable and fun. If you have a hankering for romantic comedy, do see one of the groundbreaking romcoms of all time by renting this film (or buying it for 50 cents, which is what I did!). Any viewer who does so will turn a dull evening at home into an experience worth a million bucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been going through a bit of a classic film phase lately.This movie glorifies women from the 50's as well as New York all round. I really liked it, didn't find it that funny, but very entertaining. 'Some like it Hot' Made me laugh out Loud more then once. This movie made me laugh once, right at the end, the part when you hear the sound of all the girls falling over.I liked the pacing, with three protagonists, it was well done. I liked the way Marilyn wasn't the female lead. I liked the ultimate messages it sent (if only from the way I perceive it as a classic film).My oh my, Marylins voice in this drove me crazy.Good watch, and worth buying.7/10(reviewed after first viewing)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''How to Marry a Millionaire'' is a funny movie with a nice story. We have three mainly beautiful and famous actresses of the 50's: Betty Grable(the pin-up girl),Marilyn Monroe and Lauren Bacall. I guess this was one of the first movies I watched with Marilyn Monroe, and the first with Lauren Bacall. (Talking about her, I was surprised how much Kathleen Turner remembers her looks to Lauren!)The plot is: Three women set up a plan to bring rich bachelors to them: they rent a big,beautiful and expensive apartment in an expensive neighbor, the best place to find millionaires, as Schatze Page says. Schatze is the ''Head'' of the plan, and Loco and Pola are her other two friends; they want three millionaires to marry and have a great life. As long as time is passing, they meet many guys, but they start to fall for the ones who are not financially secure. The big dilemma in this movie is: are they going to choose money or love?aka "Como Agarrar um Milionário" - Brazil</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe play three blonde bombshells who set out to set themselves up with millionaires, only to find, predictably, that true love isn't something that can be bought.The film goes down easy, mostly because of the talents of its three leading ladies. But its primary reason -- or two reasons -- for existence are as a showcase for a non-stop parade of fashionable gowns (designed by Charles LeMaire and Travilla) and the at the time new cinematic technique of Cinemascope, which uses such a wide aspect ration that every single interior -- a living room, a diner, a country cottage -- looks as big as an airline hangar. I don't think a single actor in the film is shot at anything closer than a medium closeup so that director Jean Negulesco can have expanses of frame left on either side which he chooses to fill with vast arrays of tacky 1950s decor.The film does prove that Marilyn Monroe looks adorable in glasses.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three strong leading ladies in good comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Three young, single and beautiful girls with no more than a dollar between them rent a luxurious penthouse in New York with the single goal to find rich husbands for them all. But to find single and rich men is easier said than done, and the girls find that not all men is what they see. And those emotions that keep popping up is just annoying? Comments: A rather funny comedy with three famous and strong leading ladies. The idea for the story is great and works well, even now more than 50 years later. It is a comedy first and foremost but also contains a not so subtle element about that money can't buy happiness or love. It got a lot of jokes but the best one is the running joke about Monroe's character Pola, who is blind as a bat and refuses to wear her glasses because she is afraid they will scare away a potential suitor. This leads to Pola following complete strangers instead of her date, or walking into walls.It is not hilarious, but is entertaining enough to watch. Another reason to watch it is the three leading ladies, each and one of them famous in their own right, but managing to act well together.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loco Dempsey, Pola Debevoise and Schatze Page, each one a pretty model, their goal in life?, to marry millionaires. They set themselves up in a top apartment and set about wooing any potential suitors, trouble is is that it's hard to tell the rich from the normal, and love may just have a say after all.Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe and Lauren Bacall play our three dubiously motivated ladies, each one putting a delightful stamp on each respective character. Filmed in CinemaScope, New York {and the girls Manhattan apartment}is beautifully realised and with the restored DVDs available, the colour positively gleams on the screen. The story itself is a fun one, tho at its core it's of course greedy and selfish, but this is a romantic comedy that plays out with delightful ease, and thankfully doesn't contain pointless filler scenes to purely showcase the actresses on show.Monroe has never looked as pretty as she does here, some of her other films are obviously more famous, but she radiates sexiness and with her character being vision impaired, she gets to show the wonderful comedic talent that she definitely had. Bacall clearly is the best actor on show, so it's no surprise that she gets the best written part, at times bitter, intelligent and determined, her Schatze Page character is the glue binding the picture {and the girls} together. Betty Grable is solid without really impacting a great deal, with the boys {notably Rory Calhoun} offering entertaining support. How To Marry A Millionaire is simply a delightful movie that never over tries your patience, it's a fun ride with a little something for everyone, and it cheerily pays you off at the end. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may wonder "Why does Marilyn Monroe,Betty Grable &amp; Lauren Bacall keep spreading across a lounge in so many scenes?" the answer is not vain- pleasure-seeking body language but CINEMASCOPE lens requirements.I watched this film on a old released Video Tape &amp; delighted that it was a full-screen fixed camera issue &amp; not a letterbox reduction release.I delighted in NOT seeing the person speaking &amp; only the stilted recipient's reactions. You have to observe all the action as there are no camera angles or close ups.This was too 'startling' to a cinemascope theatre audience. What other film can boast a full orchestra opening with every member of that orchestra in full view of the cinema audience:-like in a live concert. The first Cinemascope film was 'The Robe' followed by 'How To Marry A Millionaire'. As the other reviewers has said;A 'feel-good' film with nostalgic 'old-time'high society values.

		<shortDescription>Classic 50's Hollywood Glamour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"How To Marry A Millionaire" is a typical 20th Century Fox comedy blockbuster of the 1950's. This movie is the very definition of a big, brassy and over-the-top Hollywood of days gone by, and it's all the more fabulous for it. The three leading ladies are wonderful - each providing something different from the other and all of them truly accomplished and talented comedy actresses.Marilyn Monroe, for my money, steals the show hands down. She is absolutely adorable in the film and she looks at her most beautiful, too. Many other beautiful women have drifted in and out of film over the years, but in "How To Marry A Millionaire" it should be obvious to anyone that Monroe is the most beautiful of them all, period. She is also puts in the kind of perfected comedy performance nobody else can. Betty Grable is wonderful, and just as hilarious and beautiful. Lauren Bacall leads the way and is pretty much flawless in her portrayal of the money-hunting ladies ring leader.The cinematography is pure 1950's Hollywood and it looks pretty stunning, it has to be said. This was one of the first movies to use 20th Century Fox's Cinemascope format, which was basically a 1950's version of today's Widescreen technique. This causes the only real problem for me, which is a lack of close-up's. This is something nearly all other Cinemascope pictures fall victim to. The only other possible complaint about the movie is that it's quite slow moving, but then so are nearly all other films from this time so it's perhaps not a very fair criticism.So, all things considered, this is a very entertaining movie and a must see for fans of Monroe, Grable or Bacall. The script, although dated in places, holds up pretty well and even provides a rather poignant take on Sexual Politics in places. The movie was fully restored a couple years back, and this restoration (Completed with a full Widescreen Frame to best emulate the film's original Cinemascope format) is the only way to watch the film. "How To Marry A Millionaire" is a great movie from the 1950's that defines it's era and even manages to remain appealing in some ways today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bacall steals the movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this film may be in the Marilyn Monroe collection I have to say her performance was not all that great. It was alright, but just decent. She is a stunning beauty with a nice figure, but is a rather bad actress.Betty Grable I don't know very well. She did okay too, but seemed a little boring to me. I guess it was just her character Loco. She has beauty too and is an okay actress.Lauren Bacall steals this show literally. She is the one who truly defines grace and glamour. Her character is witty and sly. Bacall's beauty is great too. I love her voice and how in the end she is the lucky girl!The movie is about three roomates who go hunting for millionaire husbands. Will they suceed or not? If you are a fan of Lauren Bacall I suggest you see this one. She looks great in the fashion show!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some caveats to help people figure out whether they want to watch what many consider a great classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a confection of a movie, although those who dislike the era or dislike classic movies generally won't take to it.Admittedly, the basic premise -- 3 good-looking women set themselves up to land at least one rich spouse -- is pretty nauseating. But the performances are chiseled to perfection (and so over the top), and the era captured so evocatively that the movie is a joy to watch.If you can suspend your social conscience and your dislike of the restrictive roles that paralyzed everyone (especially women) during that era, then settle onto the couch with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy the sets, the clothes, the music, the oddly drawn characters and the sedated/flattened 1950s version of screwball humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw "How To Marry a Millionaire" it was about three o'clock in the morning and I was very depressed about something going on in my personal life. But only a few minutes into the movie (after the LONG overture) I was laughing and completely losing myself in this HILARIOUS comedy, starring the delicious Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable and Lauren BaCall. Marilyn and her two talented co-stars play single girls trying to work it and nab some wealthy husbands. The leader of the group (BaCall) rents an upscale apartment in a posh area of New York City, she invites her good friends (Monroe and Grable) to move in on the plan. I don't want to spoil it, but after some trials and moments of truth they all come to realize that its not how much money a man has, its his character that counts. Comedy thats witty and another wonderful Marilyn flick. I loved it! My score: 8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful as history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romantic comedy starring Lauren Bacall as a model who bluffs her way into a sublease of a swanky Manhattan apartment rooming with two model friends with each scheming to marry a millionaire. This is an entertaining but superficial chick-flick meditating whether a gal should marry for love or money, or if you can maybe get both. Along with The Robe this was the premiere event for CinemaScope, and it also provided a breathless introduction to stereophonic sound.As a romantic comedy it is imperfect, and it is ironically hampered by the very things that made it important in its original release. The grand images intended for magnificent CinemaScope will only appear smaller than normal on your small-screen television with horizontal black bars, or will be absurdly distorted to fit the aspect ratio of your monitor. And the stereo means nothing to us now, so the film's frequent side-trips into sound and scenery gimmicks are only a distraction to us now.But as a historical peek at its time this film really delivers. You get the tacky materialism and newly-found hedonism of the beginning of post-war prosperity in the early 1950's, as well as a nervous examination of the changing social mores around the role of women. Plus you get a wonderful record of what New York City looked like circa 1953, and a gee-whiz tribute to the new phenomenon of commercial air travel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three models set out to land some "rich millionaires" in "How to Marry a Millionaire," a cinemascope extravaganza starring Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable, and Marilyn Monroe. To show off the new, wide screen system and stereo sound, there is an overture and finale which today seem unnecessary.Bacall rents the fabulous apartment of a man (David Wayne) who has left the country because of tax evasion, and Pola (Monroe) and Loco (Grable) move in with her. As Bacall explains it, just one of them has to land a millionaire. Meanwhile, they pool their money and sell Wayne's furniture. Bacall lands a million named Brookman (Cameron Mitchell) but she thinks he's a gas pump jockey and constantly rejects him, going after the older William Powell instead. Grable takes off with a wealthy married man whom she thinks is taking her to an Elks convention - well, he did say he was going to his lodge, didn't he? Both get the measles and on her prolonged stay, she flips out for forest ranger Rory Calhoun - and who wouldn't? Monroe meets an obvious phony with an eye patch, but while not wearing her glasses, she gets on the wrong plane to meet him and instead meets David Wayne, who has been sneaking in and out of their apartment trying to find a canceled check he gave his tax man. He talks her into putting on her glasses with the line, "I have to warn you - I already think you're quite a strudel." The three women look incredible and are beautifully dressed throughout - Marilyn in that red gown being a particular knockout. Grable had 10 years on the other women which somehow always manages to come up - the most generous of performers, she was extremely friendly to Monroe and, in fact, to everyone. While on tour with a musical, Belle Star, the producers pulled out in Scotland, leaving the company stranded - Grable paid their salaries and got them all home. She is excellent in this film, very funny as a woman whose comprehension of what people say is on another planet, and possesses the sweet, warm quality that made her Queen of 20th Century Fox for many years. This was a new kind of film for Bacall, who up until this time had worked with her husband in some major film noir. She proves herself up to the task of both comedy and color. Monroe is hilarious as a nearly blind woman who refuses to let a man see her in glasses, and she is gorgeous throughout. William Powell, his "Thin Man" days over, is as wonderful as ever as a gentile widower.This is a very entertaining film, filled with in jokes - Grable insisting the trumpet player on the radio is Harry James, Bacall insisting to Powell that she loves older men, particularly that guy in the African Queen. The film makes its points well: that what you think you want may not be what's in your heart, that young men have years to work hard and make something of themselves, and that you can't tell a book by its gas jockey cover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE is a sparkling 1953 comedy about three single gals who rent an elegant Manahttan penthouse apartment as a lair in order to snare rich husbands (and they have given themselves a one-year time limit in which do it). Lauren Bacall is smart and stylish as Schatze Page, the brains of the trio who organizes the whole scheme and finds herself torn between an older rich guy (William Powell, in his usually classy turn) and another guy (Cameron Mitchell) who she thinks is a "gas pump jockey." Marilyn Monroe shines as Pola Debovoise, flighty but vain beauty who won't let any man know that she wears glasses and therefore bumps into furniture a lot. Betty Grable plays Loco Demsey, a dim-witted model who has a knack for meeting men at the grocery store. David Wayne is amusing as Monroe's near-sighted boyfriend and Rory Calhoun has definite hunk appeal as the eventual object of Grable's affections. But the real fun of the film is watching these three female superstars on screen together. Monroe was often quoted as saying she stole her acting techniques from Grable and if you watch the two of them acting together, you can see that it's true. They don't make 'em like this anymore and with Grable and Monroe both gone, this is a classic to be cherished and enjoyed during several repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about 3 girls with stupid names. Schatze (Lauren Bacall), Pola (Marilyn Monroe) and Loco (Betty Grable) rent a New York apartment with the aim of attracting millionaire husbands. The cast is fine in this film with Bacall taking on the role of "leader" of the girls. She is the brains and has the great idea of selling the furniture in the flat to keep the cash coming in. Monroe is funny in her role as a short-sighted bimbo who keeps walking into things and she manages to carry it off in a way that's funny and not irritating. Grable is slightly brash and manages to be focused on snagging a rich guy but constantly getting disappointed. She has a funny moment where she can't recognize a Harry James tune on the radio - Harry James was her real-life husband. Bacall has a moment like this where she mentions that she is crazy about the guy in "The African Queen" - her real-life husband Humphrey Bogart. William Powell is good in his role as "JD Hanley" - sophisticated and world-weary and he allows us to understand that he can always survive a disappointment. I have to say that I didn't care much for Tom Brookman who plays "Cameron" and is a potential suitor for Lauren Bacall. He somehow doesn't quite fit. He seems more of a rebellious John Garfield type that just does his own thing in a not particularly very nice manner.Unfortunately, the film wasn't as entertaining as I had expected. After a dreary start - we have to listen to an orchestra playing the whole of a repetitive tune for at least 5 minutes, we then cut to a montage of New York locations. The film doesn't actually start until after the first 10 minutes! Once it gets going, the film is watchable, Monroe providing the best moments but somewhere along the way, it loses steam. It is actually a relief to reach the end of the film. Still, it's OK entertainment with William Powell and Marilyn Monroe making things watchable. Check out the peculiar fashions of the day in the totally pointless fashion show sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Marilyn Monroe's More Forgettable Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films about the activities of "gold diggers", young women scheming to marry a wealthy man, were a popular form of comedy in the early years of the cinema; in the 1930s there were several films which featured "gold digger" in the title. The genre remained popular in the forties and fifties; indeed, Marilyn Monroe made two films of this type in the same year, of which this was the second. The other was "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", although the title "How to Marry a Millionaire" could equally well have applied to either film. (Monroe's co-star in "Gentlemen?.", Jane Russell, followed it up with "The French Line" in which she plays a girl who has the opposite problem; she has plenty of money but can't find a man.) "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" teamed Monroe with another of the big-name sex symbols of the period. "How to Marry a Millionaire" goes one better and teams her with two other big-name actresses, Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable. (Grable was certainly regarded as a big name in 1953, even if today she is less remembered for her films than for the fact that her legs were once insured for a million dollars).In "Gentlemen?." Marilyn played the exotically named Lorelei while Russell's character was more prosaically named Dorothy. In this film it is Monroe who has the nearest thing to a normal Christian name (Pola), whereas her companions are the curiously named Schatze (presumably derived from "Schatz", the German for "treasure") and the equally curious Loco. (From the Spanish for "insane". Either that or her father was a keen train-spotter).The three stars play models sharing a New York flat. All of them have ambitions to marry a wealthy man. There are three separate plot lines. Schatze is dating the wealthy, cultivated widower J.D. Hanley, but he is concerned that he is too old for her. (He is 55, she 25). Loco has agreed to go with a businessman to his "lodge" (believing he is referring to an Elks Club meeting) but it turns out that he is married, that the building in question is actually a hunting lodge in Maine and that his intentions towards her are far from honourable. Pola is interested in a dubious oil tycoon but is saved from him when she accidentally gets on the wrong plane at the airport. (Her bad eyesight, and her reluctance to wear glasses, are running jokes throughout the film).Today the "gold digger" genre seems outdated, even offensive. Feminists will take offence at the suggestion that every woman's ideal in life should be marriage to a wealthy man. Masculists (if such a word exists) might take offence at the idea that a man's worth, either as a husband or in any other capacity, can be measured by the size of his bank balance. There have been modern romantic comedies such as "Pretty Woman" or "Maid in Manhattan" on the theme of "poor girl marries rich man" (and some such as "Notting Hill" on the theme of "poor boy marries rich woman"), but the heroines (or heroes) of such films are not normally as coldly calculating as Schatze or Lorelei. Even in 1953 mercenary attitudes of this sort were not to everyone's taste- including, it would seem, the taste of the scriptwriters. All three girls undergo a change of heart by the end of the film.Despite my reservations about films of this type, I still found that "Gentleman Prefer Blondes" remains enjoyable more than fifty years after it was made. It may lack any great depth, but the script is often witty, the musical numbers are good and there is good chemistry between Russell and Monroe. "How to Marry a Millionaire" is not, however, really in the same class. Marilyn, admittedly, is charming, as she normally was, but her acting skills are not tested in the same way as they were in the earlier film. Neither Grable nor Bacall makes much of an impression. I cannot agree with the reviewer who felt that Bacall was too old for her role (at 29 she was only slightly older than the character she was playing), but I felt that remark might better have been directed at Grable. A twenty-something gold digger might be amusing; a woman in her late thirties playing the same game is likely to seem either sinister or pathetic. The film also lacks the musical numbers which were one of the better features of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes".The script and the storyline might have seemed daring and sophisticated in the early fifties, a time when the Production Code meant that film censors were a lot more censorious than they are today. There were, however, limits to daring and sophistication. Marilyn is forced to say "Men are seldom attentive to girls who wear glasses" because the censor objected to the phrase "make passes". There are a few in-jokes; a line about "diamonds are a girl's best friend" is a clear reference to "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", and Schatze, referring to older men marrying younger women, says "look at old fella what's his name in "The African Queen". (I.e. Bacall's real-life husband Humphrey Bogart). Much of the material, however, seems dated and stale today. "How to Marry a Millionaire" may have seemed witty in 1953; today it is one of Monroe's more forgettable vehicles. 5/10</fullReview>

I also did special work for Betty outside of 20th Century Foxes eyes &amp; ears. In February 1953, Buddy Rich, the great drummer joined the band and one evening, we had a small party for Buddy at the Hollywood Paladium where the band was working. Betty Grable &amp; Marie Rich got to be friends and Betty invited Buddy &amp; Marie to the studio where she was working on the movie, How to Marry a Millionaire. Harry &amp; I picked up Buddy &amp; Marie at the Beverly Hills Hotel and went to the studio. At the studio, we were all in Bacall's dressing room having coffee &amp; danish and waiting for the queen, Miss Monroe to arrive. She had a habit of being late quiet a bit and keeping a lot of people waiting for her. Bacall, who is known for her salty language, gave her quite a verbal tongue lashing, but it just rolled off her back. When Betty passed away with cancer, I flew from my home in Fort Lauderdale, Fl. to Vegas for the funeral, then again for Harry's funeral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Citizen Kane" of fluff . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HTMAM is thoroughly grounded in Lauren Bacall's and William Powell's performances: utterly believable, utterly difficult to bring off with the genuine warmth and on screen chemistry they shared. You knew they weren't "right" for each other (in terms of their characters), and your heart breaks a little when Powell says as much.Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable each play dumb-blonde variations -- just as MM was about to usurp BG's "queen of the lot" title at Fox (this was Grable's second-to-last film).Who wins? Grable.Monroe is fine, of course. She always was. And always spectacular looking.Just never believable. (Except in "Don't Bother to Knock," in which she convincingly plays a psychopathic babysitter, and two other "dumb-blonde" showgirl films, "The Prince and the Showgirl" and "Some Like it Hot.") Did ANYBODY on screen ever talk like Monroe? Was ANYBODY ever that dense? No.Not that the actress herself was. She was actually quite smart and deeply vulnerable, and had an acute understanding of her "marketability" as a "body" and chose, quite consciously and early, to go with that.Until, later, she decided to attend the Actors' Studio and "refine" her skills -- by which time, it was too late. In "Bus Stop" and "The Misfits," she's simply incapable of her roles' demands, and self-consciously embarrassing in the attempt to stretch her shallow "sex-goddess" "female clown" persona.In HTMAM, as in "Seven Year Itch," and "Niagara," she's a caricature of a woman of that era: her phony baby-doll voice undercuts her excellent comedic timing and her not-very-polished physical comedy skills.Betty Grable, on the other hand, as "Loco" in HTMAM, is consistently, believably, attractively "dumb." As an actress, Grable doesn't make one false move. Nothing phony about her speech patterns, nothing forced about her physical presence. Just a realistic good-time gal out to try and snag a rich husband in spite of herself. Grable's "real." Monroe is "phony." Monroe always was.But it's Bacall who walks off with the picture.She could, and still can, as she approaches 80, play ANYTHING. Drama to comedy.She had more technique and understanding of film acting than Grable and Monroe put together.Her scenes with William Powell, another consummate film actor, are rich with comedy, feeling, tension, conflict and drama all at once.Bacall and Powell are, essentially, the two most believable characters (and actors) in HTMAM.They're the emotional glue who hold this delightful piece of fluff together.Bacall's casual glance at a reclining nude male statue at 15:30 is worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no question that there are some silly and implausible moments in "How to Marry a Millionaire", but there's also little question that it is good fun and very enjoyable to watch. Most of the cast give good performances, and they and their characters fit together well. The situations and predicaments in which they find themselves are often farfetched, but are usually creative and amusing in themselves.Lauren Bacall, Marilyn Monroe, and Betty Grable might seem like an unusual combination, but they really fit together nicely and make an entertaining trio. By not taking themselves or their characters too seriously, their performances make everything else work. Their three characters are also given enough idiosyncrasies to make each of them interesting, while not stretching things too far. Aside from William Powell's character, the male cast members generally have easier roles, but they also perform well. Powell has a little more to do than the others, and of course he handles his role with his usual aplomb and charisma.The combination is no artistic masterpiece, but it was not meant to be. It's very enjoyable, and in its way it was also put together well enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to Marry a Millionaire (1953)A movie with a billionaire's reputation. It has some megastars to say the least (and from three different worlds--Bacall from the Bogart/crime/noir realm, Monroe from all that she already represented by the early 1950s, and Rogers from the age of classic musicals). It is very the first widescreen color flick in contemporary terms (not including Napoleon). And it has the arch qualities of a screwball comedy--improbable matchups and improbable circumstances. But for me it just wasn't funny. The writing is pretty lame (not clever, not funny, just pushing silly buttons), and the acting is quite painful (though it might be purposely not an "actor's" film, but just a vehicle). The filming, with all the possibilities of the new wide format, is pretty but surprisingly stiff and dull. Maybe it's even because of the format, though there are some other stunning widescreen films from that first year or two of the genre. I've tried to like this movie twice--I like the actors and the idea, and I love old comedies. And there are some lines that work, yes there are, it's not a complete washout. Even the overall idea works pretty well, the way Palm Beach Story might have suggested in a more pioneering and hilarious way. But it seems to ride on the laurels of its stars and on the idea of being grandiose with a sexist wink. Very sexist. No thanks, not for 2010. Call it personal taste, but go into it forewarned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, a warning. 'How to Marry a Millionaire' comes prefaced by an apparently random five minute orchestral performance of 'Street Scene', a Gershwin-lite piece treated with the full pomp and ceremony of, well, Gershwin. Sitting through it takes some patience. If you have the DVD, rest assured, you can skip forward. You won't miss anything.The film itself is one of the perpetual disappointments of 50's Hollywood, a movie so bolstered by major star-power, opulent mise-en-scene and perfect high-concept that failure seems inconceivable. The title alone is perfect. Generation after generation, however, are forced to ask themselves - how is this so limp? The script is an albatross about the production's neck, a dead, smelling thing that chokes everything and everyone before they can really spark to life. There are no comic situations, just isolated moments that play for laughs. Whenever an actual comedy scene threatens to develop, the movie quickly moves on to other, less interesting things. A case in point - the scene where the three leading ladies each bring a date to the same fancy restaurant. One of them, short-sighted, refuses to wear her spectacles out of vanity. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood farce set-up, surely, complete with mistaken identity, angry wife, and probably a pie in the face for somebody? Well, no. Instead, we cut between the three dates as the ladies react 'comically' to things their partners say. Hit the punchline, and cut to the next limp joke. If in doubt, have Marilyn walk into a wall. Where's Billy Wilder when you need him?The three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic Hollywood screen goddess. This was one of Marilyn Monroe's breakout films, and the camera just eats her up, even though the script gives her nothing to do. She's so luminescent she almost seems newly hatched. Lauren Bacall, on the other hand, had been a major star for nearly a full decade, and she knows how to dominate the screen even when in frame with Monroe. She gets the only thing passing for a real role, and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snap - given the right material, she could have brought this thing to life. She's a curiously ageless actress - when she lies about her age in the film and claims to be forty, it isn't instantly ridiculous - and far less girlish than her co-stars, giving her a convincing authority. Betty Grable was far from ageless, and had a good eight years on her co-stars, putting her near the end of her Hollywood career. There's an air of desperation about her at times, stranded on screen with nothing but a toothpaste smile and a few scraps of comic timing, unable to play her real age but fooling no-one as a contemporary of this new, sharper generation of actresses, relying on the same old schtick that had served her throughout her career (for Marilyn-doubters, seeing the two juxtaposed in this movie helps to throw Monroe's subtlety and - yes - intelligence into sharp relief). She's also lumbered with the dead wood in terms of male co-stars (although all of the men - even the great William Powell - are guilty of lazy performances); she's unable to strike any comic sparks off them. Better to have given her role to the under-utilised Monroe, who could be funny all by herself, and left Grable with the repetitive Mr. Magoo routine.That the movie is as enjoyable as it is can be put down to the luscious Hollywood production, the sort that renders even the twee likes of 'By the Light of the Silvery Moon' watchable. But somewhere, buried beneath the flabby jokes and professionalism, lies the rough outline of a sharp, cynical comedy about the business of marriage that Bacall could have made sing - and new generations of movie viewers will sit down with 'How to Marry a Millionaire' in expectation of that movie, ready to be disappointed all over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These gold diggers on the prowl are very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The usually smart, clever and calm Lauren Bacall plays quite a different character in "How to Marry a Millionaire." She is very tongue-in-cheek funny as the know-it-all gold digger. But she has it all wrong. And that's one of the very funny undertones of the plot for this comedy romance. Bacall is Schatze Page, one of a threesome of females who are on the prowl in New York to snag wealthy husbands. That may seem a strange theme to modern day audiences, but it was something of a reality of American culture in the mid-20th century. Probably few women actually made such pursuits, but it was something that the culture talked about back then. I remember hearing women joke about moving to New York to find a rich husband. So, that made for a funny and entertaining movie. Bacall didn't have top billing for this film, either. That went to Marilyn Monroe, followed by Betty Grable. Monroe plays Pola Debevoise and Grable plays Loco Dempsey. One may see the humor in those names, as well. Both of them play ditzy blonds, but Grable out-ditzies Monroe. Her character is by far the funniest. One expected Monroe to play such roles ? it was her film persona and, somewhat, her real life persona. But, for Grable, this was an excellent portrayal. Of course, there are men in the story and the lives of these women. All of the cast perform well. William Powell has a nice supporting role that is very unusual. His is the only one that isn't comedy. But the part fits beautifully in the plot, and I can think of no one better to have the role of J.D. Hanley. Powell was 61 years old when this film came out. He made only one more film, "Mr. Roberts" in 1955, before retiring. Powell is one of the classy great performers who never won an Oscar, although he was nominated three times. And, unlike many stars, he retired while his star still shown bright for quality films. He lived another 29 years until age 91 in 1984. The humorous situations in this film are punctuated with occasional witty lines. Some catch one by surprise and lead to bursts of laughter. Here's my favorite. Loco and Pola have been gone for days and Schatze is worried about being stuck with the monthly rent for their expensive Fifth Avenue flat. She is lamenting her problem with Tom Brookman, played by Cameron Mitchell. Tom says, "Haven't they even written to you?" Schatze replies, "How can they? They're illiterate."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIREOK guys... I watched this with my 12 year old daughter... and once the film finished, she asked me if she could write the review for a change. I think she has done a great job with it too... This is her opinion. Sammy... take it away!"It wasn't a bad movie, I did enjoy it.The story is about three models, Loco (Betty Grable), Pola (Marilyn Monroe) and Schatze (Lauren Bacall), who want to marry a millionaire. They rent an apartment in New York and sell all the furniture to get money. They spend a lot of time with rich men, but none of them are really their type. They persuade themselves that they are and end up falling in love with them anyway. But when Loco finds a man to bring her shopping home, he falls in love with Schatze. Knowing she is a model, he asks to see them in a private show. If Schatze knew he was a millionaire, he would look like a completely different person to her.I have never seen a storyline like this before, so I think is was original and creative. I can't say I didn't laugh when Marilyn walked into the wall, as she was playing a girl blind as a bat. She had glasses, but never wore them as she thought they made her look unattractive. Her mind was changed by one special man's opinion.One thing I didn't understand, is the guy with the eye-patch. He always had this patch over his left eye, but when he was examining a plane schedule, he lifted his eye-patch to get a better look. Surely, if you wear an eye-patch, it's cover up a missing eye, or something like that. But if he needs to take it of to read a schedule, why wear it at all? I don't get it...I do love my retro movies, which most people wouldn't expect from a twelve year-old girl, but it's true. This is a very old movie (to me, anyway) and this always means terrible effects, but why would you add the backgrounds as an effect, when they were just walking around a real set with the same background. They looked so fake it was unbelievable. Why not just film them in the set instead of recreating it with graphics? They confuse me.Overall, I think this movie is slightly amusing and generally enjoyable. I'm going to give this movie a 6 out of 10. I don't know why, it's just my gut instinct."Why marry a poor when you can find a rich man just as easy?"Good work honey. I agree with Sammy mostly... I expected the effects to be terrible... the film was made in 1953. I also had never seen a Marilyn Monroe film, and she did a great job in this. She was very funny as a blind lady. She did make me laugh quite a lot throughout. The acting was good apart from Betty Grable. I thought she let the film down. She could have done better. The story was OK, but I thought it could have had a bit more happen, although I found it amusing how she rented out an apartment and sold the landlord furniture. You couldn't get away with that these days.I agree with Sammy and will give it 6 out of 10.For more reviews, please check out my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking at the DVD case, you'd assume that Marilyn Monroe was THE lead in this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate the merchandising people at the major studios. Often, to boost sales they misrepresent movies to attract audiences. One of the worst examples is 20th Century-Fox's marketing of videotapes and DVDs of films in which Marilyn Monroe appeared. While HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE isn't the worst case, by looking at the box art you'd assume that she was the lead in this film. In reality, there were three leads--Monroe, Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall. It was truly an ensemble film. Now as I said, this was not the worst example. In many of her earliest films Monroe was only a bit player--yet she is prominently featured on the cover art! Take a look at the art on the IMDb pages for THE ASPHALT JUNGLE, LOVE HAPPY or MONKEY BUSINESS--you'll see what I mean even though she was a supporting or bit actress in these films.In HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE, it's actually good that you have the ensemble cast. After all, how can you make it a story about three money-hungry roommates if Monroe plays all three parts!! Plus, at the time the film was made, Betty Grable received top billing as she was the more established and prestigious star at the time. A few short years later, Miss Grable's career would be over and Monroe would shoot to super-stardom.The story is a remake, though I haven't seen any of the previous versions. Three ladies decide to live together in a swank Manhattan apartment as they try to hook themselves wealthy husbands.Grable's love interest is Fred Clark--a rich man with the disposition of a sour pickle. He is already married and really isn't interested in marriage--just making Grable his mistress. Her character is the ditsy one--naive and dumb and she fails to grasp how nasty Clark is.Bacall is the most-pursued in the film--with an apparently poor guy (Cameron Mitchell) Grable met in a deli pursuing her as well as nice-guy William Powell. She is the supposedly smart one of the three but has a hard time reading men--even though the scheme is hers.As for Monroe, she is sort of like a middle ground between her other two roommates. She's not as ditsy nor as bright as the other two. Despite her amazing looks, she isn't quite as ardently pursued as you'd expect in the film! Heck, I'd expect ALL the men in the film to chase after her! And, as for finding a millionaire, this shouldn't be a problem! One of her love interests in the film is the unlikely David Wayne and their scenes together are marvelous.Despite all the girls' plans, things don't turn out in the end like any of them envisioned. They all get men who they really had no intention in getting...yet like a Hollywood film, everything works out wonderfully at the end. Along the way, the film is chock full of nice little vignettes and performances all due to good acting and a very agreeable script. I particularly liked the nice role played by William Powell--his graceful presence did a lot to add class to the film, though there were several other nice performances as well. Plus, everything just looked and sounded so nice--with the film being shot in CinemaScope and with lovely music throughout. It was obvious that 20th Century-Fox pulled out all the stops for this production. I'd give this one an 8 and it's well worth seeing.By the way, read through the IMDb trivia for this film and you'll find one of the dumbest forced changes to a film of the era. The powers that be at the censor board would not allow Miss Monroe to say the old saying "men don't make passes at girls who wear glasses"--as it was apparently too racy or something else that is beyond me!! Huh?!?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: Three models hatch a plot to catch themselves millionaire husbands and just about succeed. Drive-in Rating: Circle the block! I just adore this movie that introduced me to Lauren Bacall, Marilyn Monroe, and Betty Grable. It's a study in determination and gives me some faith that even beautiful women can have trouble finding Mr. Right and often fall for the "gas pump jockey." Bacall is the true lead but Monroe and Grable are such dazzling comedienne, a girl can forgive their scene stealing and sex symbol status. For the modern movie viewer, it's a great place to find four greats (added in there, the dashing William Powell), and I find it more entertaining than other Bacall or Monroe movies I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good lead casting makes this lightweight romantic comedy worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE 1953* * 1/2 This is one of three popular movies of 1953 that launched Marilyn Monroe as a movie star. The other two films were: "Niagra" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes". 1953 proved to be a very good year for Marilyn Monroe, establishing her as a very likable and popular Hollywood movie star of the 1950's.Three gold digging women, portrayed by (Bacall, Grable and Monroe) move in together, sharing a large, upscale New York City apartment and agree on a plan to attract and marry men who are millionaires. It's a very simple story setup, with a few laughs along the way. For Bacall, she must have considered this a very lightweight role, done just for fun.Here in "How to Marry a Millionaire", Marilyn, as myopic (Pola), joins established stars Betty Grable as Loco and Lauren Bacall as Schatze. I liked the running gag of (Pola's) nearsighted character, avoiding wearing her glasses. Marilyn was myopic in real life. There used to be an old expression: "men don't make passes at girls who wear glasses". Well, Marilyn Monroe was definitely an exception to this expression! Here she shares screen time with two famous Hollywood icons and holds her own quite well. The star power of Bacall and Grable helped bolster Marilyn's public image. In "Gentleman Prefer Blonds", the well matched pairing of Jane Russell with Marilyn, also bolstered Marilyn's image with the public. In Niagra, Marilyn played a dark character: a troubled woman out for revenge, which showed Marilyn had an interesting dual nature to her personality. "Niagra" helped get Marilyn noticed in an unusual dark role, while "Gentleman Prefer Blondes" and "How to Marry a Milionaire" showcased her natural charm, humor and likability.The highlights of the film are the art direction and lead acting casting. This film would be of more interest to serious, rather than casual Marilyn Monroe fans. Marilyn always came across as soft, gentle and charming, in all her comedy-musical films. This film provides a small glimpse at some of her unique charms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Classic But the Cast Makes it Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to Marry a Millionaire (1953)*** (out of 4) This Fox production is short on story but big on laughs and entertainment. Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe play poor girls living in New York City who join what's basically a club that's main goal is to get each of them married to rich men. The three women set out the find the richest out there but soon realize that they're all falling in love with men without money. With such an attractive cast you'll probably be expecting a classic but this falls well short of that but it's still very much worth seeing thanks in large part to the chemistry of the three ladies. I think director Negulesco really doesn't get enough laughs as he should as there are many times where it seems like laughs are the last thing he's trying to get. This was one of the first films to be released in the 2.35:1 ratio and it's clear that this new format is getting a lot of attention from those behind the scenes. Throughout the film I couldn't help but think they were simply trying to get as much as they could in the frame and really weren't worried about much else. You'll notice throughout the movie that there's very little in terms of editing or building up any jokes as everything pretty much plays out with the camera in place. I will give the director credit that he does a nice job getting all three ladies perfectly placed inside that frame to show them off very well. The lack of a real story really doesn't hurt things too much as Bacall, Grable and Monroe are so entertaining that you'll have fun just watching them act together. Bacall, of course, plays the tough girl and she gets some great lines about how she's always preferred older men. Later in the film she starts naming some of the older men she loves and refers to "that one guy in THE African QUEEN," which of course was her husband in real life. Monroe, of course, plays the idiot but she's charming in the part. Grable doesn't get as much to do but she's still fun. William Powell, Cameron Mitchell, Rory Calhoun and David Wayne are just some of the men who come into their lives. HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE is light entertainment to say the least so no one should be expecting any sort of masterpiece. Fans of the cast should be entertained though.</fullReview>

And, did you hear the rent on that penthouse apartment back then? Can you imagine what it is now? Just a delightful movie, wonderful cast and very, very funny. I think the plot is just great---three girls rent a penthouse apartment to meet millionaires, after all, they say, where is the best place to meet millionaires, in a joint like this, or a walk up on 8th Avenue.....? Just a lot of fun, and although made nearly 60 years ago, very, very timely, or as Marilyn's character says, "naturally." See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant but not really memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing particularly bad about this movie, but there's nothing terribly memorable about it either, save Marilyn Monroe's performance and some nice dialogue. The plot is simple: three models (Monroe, Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable), lead by the ambitious Bacall, want to marry rich. Of course, things go awry on the way and in true Old Hollywood fashion, true love prevails in the end. There is an overture to this film by Alfred Newman that just goes on way too long and seems to have no use for the film. I liked Monroe, she's as delightful as ever as the girl who bumps into furniture instead of wearing glasses. I felt Bacall was going through the motions at a lot of points (though she has a really funny line about how she likes older men), as was William Powell as one of the older suitors, and Betty Grable didn't do much interesting. Overall the film is decent, light entertainment but nothing too flash</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Marry a Millionaire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title sounded appealing, the three female leads are called three of the legends, and I knew I had to see this film if it had Marilyn in it. Basically three New York models, Schatze Page (Lauren Bacall), Pola Debevoise (Marilyn Monroe) and Loco Dempsey (Betty Grable) have set up an exclusive apartment with a plan. Besides giving away their many pieces of furniture and ornaments for cash, they are tired of cheap men and intend to use their skills to trap and marry three millionaires. But as they find what they think are their perfect targets, they are both struggling to tell the rich from the hucksters, and they wonder is the money really worth it (no real feelings towards the men). One by one, they eventually start falling for their true love interests, who all look like Normal Joes, and all eventually will become their husbands. In the end, Pola has married a nice guy from a plane who has the same eye sight trouble she does, Loco has married someone that really cares about her, and Schatze eventually walks out of her intended millionaire marriage to be with the almost stalking nice guy, but in the end, a bit anticipated but still great, all three "Normal Joes" share a secret of being millionaires. Also starring David Wayne as Freddie Denmark, Rory Calhoun as Eben, Cameron Mitchell as Tom Brookman, Alexander D'Arcy as J. Stewart Merrill, Fred Clark as Waldo Brewster and William Powell as J.D. Hanley. The best jokes for me are Monroe taking off her glasses and bumping into people, and obviously her regular naivety routine. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Marilyn Monroe number 39 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Lauren Bacall was number 20, and Monroe number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, she was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols (she could have been number 1), and she was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons.

		<fullReview>Yes, this is a the "grand-daddy" of the Fox confections of the 50's, enhanced by CinemaScope and stereo sound yet. A yummy creation that takes advantage of its three female stars and sets. Marilyn, as usaul, is a delight. She excels in these roles. Even though she probably didn't like to play them, no one could do it better. This and Loreli Lee in GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES are her trademarks. What a wonderful legacy. Lauran Bacall and Betty Grable each have their moments as well, with Bacall a bit to saracatic and not nearly as lovable as Monroe or Grable. The three work well together and one wishes they shared more scenes. The story unfolds leisurerly but still would have been better if more scenes were added or less deleted from the final cut. The men are good and work well with the ladies. What a nice piece of fluff and what a pity movies like these are not made today. If this were re-made it would be full of nudity, vulgar dialog and a gay character somewhere along the line. And who could possibly replace these three icons? Cameron Diaz, Kirstin Dunst, Brittany Spears, Brittany Murphy etc...Ugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am absolutely in love with Marilyn Monroe and I am on a mission to see most of her movies, if not all. How to Marry a Millionaire is probably one of her most famous, but it seems to typecast her. I recently saw Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, and it reminded me somewhat of her role in that film. But still How to Marry a Millionaire is a cute and snappy romantic comedy that I think a lot of people could get into.Basically, these three young and beautiful gold diggers are looking for one thing and one thing only: a millionaire. Their mission? To marry him. But when they meet some interesting and very very very rich men, they find out that this may not be what they want and end up instead of being a gold digger, having a heart of gold when they truly discover what love is all about.How to Marry a Millionaire is a very cute romantic comedy and just places Marilyn on a high pedestal in my opinion. She is absolutely adorable and so charming, you could never dislike her or her character. She and the other two ladies bring such a spice to this fun movie that reminds you of Sex and the City.9/10</fullReview>

Of course, they STILL can't afford the rent, so one of the running gags here is how they DO pay the rent. The girls are all looking for men with some money, and watch the adventures as they go on a dating spree to find them. Bacall, Monroe, and Grable all try different tactics to find the perfect man, and when they each catch one, they have some decisions to make. David Wayne (Ellery Queen, House Calls) plays the owner of the apartment that the girls are renting, and un-wittingly becomes part of the excitement. William Powell (Nick Charles, Thin Man) has smallish part, playing a dashing, older gent. Fun, color remake of the original "The Greeks had a Word for Them" from 1932. The three lead characters even had some of the same names in the 1932 version.</fullReview>

Monroe had the biggest build up on the movie, all publicity was aimed at her. she was in awe of Grable,s position at fox (although weaker than couple of years before, her box office pull was still something to behold, she was still listed as Fox's top moneymaker) thats why Betty Grable ruled supreme.

There's a 1953 fashion show, and a mirror sequence devised to show off Cinemascope, since this was the first picture filmed, but released after the more prestigious "The Robe" (1953). Grable is miscast, being 15 years too old for the role, and not a particularly good actress. Monroe looks terrific, and shows great comedic timing, while Bacall is chic, sophisticated and wise.

		<shortDescription>Marilyn is pretty good, as are the jokes about Bogie and Bacall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, three women, played by three huge stars, Lauren Bacall, Marilyn Monroe, and Betty Grable, move in together with the plan to each land a millionaire. They each get involved with millionaires, but men of more humble means (and at least one man pretending to be) end up winning them over in the end. It's kind of lackluster, but it's moderately entertaining. It probably should have been funnier. The only real humor comes from Monroe, who needs glasses but is afraid no man will find her attractive when she's wearing them. She stumbles around bumping into walls and mistaking people's identities. There are also a lot of great in-jokes about Bacall's marriage to Humphrey Bogart. In the film, the millionaire whom she dates is played by the great actor William Powell, who was in his early sixties when the film was made. When he tells Bacall that he's too old for her, she tells him how she adores older men. "You know that old fella from The African Queen. I love that guy!" Betty Grable is pretty forgettable, but, then again, I never found her particularly talented or attractive. She's pretty average on both fronts, as far as I'm concerned. The film is also interesting as an early example of the use of widescreen (supposedly it was the first film in that format). It was developed in 1953 so that cinemas would have an extra draw, as television was destroying the industry. I watched a cropped version, unfortunately, but I think I did a decent job reconstructing how shots were originally composed. The opening and closing scenes are the most interesting. For no other reason than to demonstrate the new format, the screen encompasses an entire orchestra. The word "Cinemascope" appears enormously both at the beginning and at end. 7/10.</fullReview>

Still, it's a charmingly frothy affair, enjoyable and even somewhat clever at times, though utterly forgettable in the end. No singing here, sadly, though we do open with a bemusing six minute orchestral overture, long enough to leave you worrying Netflix has uploaded the wrong film by accident. There's a similarly long interlude of fashion modelling mid-film, leaving the distinct impression of director Jean Legulesco either offering surrogate culture for those who wouldn't be exposed to the symphony or haute couture otherwise, or stalling to pad out the slight hour and a half runtime. For the most part, proceedings otherwise are breezy but thoroughly standard hijinx of mistaken identity and dramatic irony, inevitably tsk-tsk-ing at both the patriarchal boorishness of traditional courtship and the leading ladies' materialism in favour of true love, but with only the gentlest, most congenial of critiques. Lauren Bacall, amiably out of place, out-acts the rest of the cast by head and shoulders, but still gamely commits to the silliness, albeit imbuing her husband-hunter with steely resolve and a noir jargon-spouting mouth that would make Bogey blink. Marilyn Monroe cements her Marilyn Monroe archetype here, but impresses more with her short-sighted slapstick than her usual demure cooing. Betty Grable's addition may come across as a carbon copy of Monroe's, but Grable's sharp tongue and charm steal many of the film's best punchlines, even when awash in a subplot in a strangely Arctic, mountainous Maine. Finally, the legendarily charismatic William Powell makes a welcome appearance as probably the only wholly decent rich bachelor in Hollywood history, while Cameron Mitchell exudes excellent rustic charm as the secret millionaire constantly dismissed due to his blue-collar mannerisms. How to Marry a Millionaire is a delightful comedic aperitif, and full of treats aplenty thanks to Legulesco's winning cast. Still, it's hard not to recommend the film's 1953 musical doppelgänger by comparison - sharper, snappier, more glamorous, and with tunes, to boot. Alas - fun as it is, the film's tagline may as well have been 'How to Compete Against Howard Hawks'. -7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"How to Marry a Millionaire" - the Essence of the 1950's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three of America's most famous and talented sex icons of Hollywood's Golden Age join forces to deliver a classic romantic comedy that'll leave your sides split. It's truly remarkable to witness these ladies pave the way for many actresses to come.Composer Alfred Newman directed and conducted the score of this film, featuring the 20th Century Fox Orchestra. Newman brings 1950's New York City to life with the fast-paced number entitled "New York". The staccato of the brass instruments and a colorfully playful orchestra were met with a sparkling piano chiming in throughout the tune. This exquisite arrangement shows the two sides of the Big Apple Americans have come to know and love: the hectic streets swarming with pedestrians and yellow taxi cabs, and the twinkling lights of the city's beautiful skyline after the sun sets.In addition to the dazzling score, the acting, particularly that of Marilyn Monroe, really plays a significant role in the establishment of "How to Marry a Millionaire" as a genuine Hollywood classic. Throughout the 20th century, the stereotype of the "dumb blonde" became a big part of American contemporary culture thanks to roles held by Marilyn Monroe, such as Pola Debevoise. Betty Grable also portrays a "dumb blonde" character, but her performance, although comical, was sub- par standing along side Miss Monroe's.The main reason I love and appreciate this film is because it's a snapshot of American pop culture of the 1950's. But in its very unique time-capsule quality lies a huge issue I have with "How to Marry a Millionaire". Blatant classism and sexism is heavily shown throughout the movie. Despite having three women as the leading roles, the plot features a recurring theme of women needing the financial support of a man to make it in America. Not only is this theme sexist, it portrays people, in this case men, of lower-income households are deemed unfit and undeserving of a beautiful wife. Yes, one could argue that sexism and classism add to the accurate representation of the 1950's, but they give the film somewhat of a shelf life. After a while, more and more people might find these parts of the story negatively outweighing its accomplishments.That being said, this film is an overall success and goes down as a true Hollywood classic in my books. It's one thing to see old photographs of Golden Age actresses like Marilyn Monroe, but actually seeing what gave her the reputation of a legendary performer and American sex icon is a remarkably magical experience unique to a film like "How to Marry a Millionaire".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me this film has soured quite a lot over the years, as I re-encounter the sexist messages that abounded during my formative years. The film presents a lot to enjoy, but the bitter kernel is that it fundamentally endorses attitudes it pretends to send up.Three girls follow a mission to find wealthy husbands, as no other object in life is worth considering. What they are interested in is wealth, clothes and jewellery. It appears that their only way of making money is as part-time models, and this is so inadequate in terms of paying rent and buying food that they sell off furniture that doesn't belong to them to make ends meet. They are bright and witty girls who these days could follow a range of different careers, but here they are never shown doing anything you could respect. They are just decorative parasites.The message to women is that your role in life is to be good looking and well-dressed, pretend to be better off than you are, and then you will trap a husband. The only amendment the story provides is that it might not turn out that your man is wealthy. With that small amendment, the life plan is unchanged.Young women do search for life partners, but hopefully these days a partner is just a partner and not a substitute for a career.I'd like to see a remake of this film where one girl is a lawyer, one a doctor and one a banker ? and none of them planning to retire on marriage! Other than that, this is a good looking film in a 50s sort of way (even with the disadvantage of a small screen) and the personalities of the girls are lively and engaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes I'll watch a film like this and wonder if it would or could be made today. I saw this one on Turner Classics as one of the essentials, with host Robert Osborne and guest Drew Barrymore lending their comments on the picture. It was almost comical listening to Barrymore try to walk a fine line between enjoying the story and being careful not to antagonize her feminist side over the theme of gold digging women on the prowl to snag a rich husband. I wonder if she caught any grief over that one from Cameron Diaz.Like so many of these early to mid Fifties flicks, I find myself on the fence regarding their appeal. For me the story was so-so, largely predictable, and even though billed as a comedy, I didn't find myself in on the joke for the most part. Marilyn Monroe's eyesight gimmick was tiresome and didn't come across very believably, and Lauren Bacall, only a decade since debuting in "To Have and Have Not", seemed to be older than her real age of twenty nine. Betty Grable was obviously ready to pass the baton to her co-star Monroe as filmdom's next glamor queen. I don't know, maybe it's just me but I didn't detect the camaraderie among this trio and that took something out of it for this viewer.There was one good line though for this Bogart fan. I got the biggest kick out of Bacall's comment about the African Queen guy. Grable got one in on Harry James too, so that was all cleverly done. Over all I'm satisfied I got to catch this one since it's one of the early Fifties standards that everyone should catch, but now that I've done it I'll be happy to move on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mrs Schatze Page (Lauren Bacall) is a snooty high class divorcée who gets a beautiful flat. She proposes to use the apartment to hunt for millionaires. Pola Debevoise (Marilyn Monroe) is a girl who rather run into walls than wear her glasses. Loco Dempsey (Betty Grable) can get men to buy her lots of things. The problem is that it's harder to find truly rich men who are good men. Tom Brookman is actually a rich guy who likes Schatze but she assumes that he's a poor slob. She's dating JD who thinks he's too old for her. Loco is dating a married man. Pola is dating a sketchy guy with an eye patch.Monroe is actually very funny bumping into things. That gag of her refusing to wear her glasses is quite funny and has real legs. She's probably the funniest of the three. There are a couple of cute references. Bacall references Bogie and Monroe gets diamonds. Bacall is the snooty girl and that works fine for her. Monroe and Grable are basically playing the same dumb blonde character. However Grable is outclassed by Monroe. Nobody can play that character as well as Monroe. Monroe is funny. Bacall is pretty good. She's got a fun line. Grable is a bore. Basically it's a somewhat fun comedy.</fullReview>

This movie is one of my favorites. It's full of memorable lines which my wife and I use all the time. The cast is first rate. None better than Lauren Bacall when she was at her most beautiful. Also Monroe and Grable also in the prime of their careers. Monroe perhaps more than Grable but she holds her own. Fred Clark, Rory Calhoun, and William Powell round out this stellar cast. Showcasing N.Y.C. when it was considered the coolest place on Earth makes the location one of the stars of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half sparkles as the three girls ready their snares, hoping to land a millionaire husband for each. So what, if they have to strip the furnishings from their ritzy apartment in order to pay the rent. After all, can't invite a wealthy guy to the YWCA. Of course, it helps that each of the three, Monroe, Grable, and Bacall, is a glamorous knockout. Now if only Monroe could see without her glasses, she might stop comically bumping into things. By and large this first half has exactly the right humorous touch.The second part is more routine as each girl hooks up with a man who may or may not be a millionaire. The touch becomes a little heavier but without becoming too heavy. In my little book, Monroe steals the film with her minor antics and wispy voice. I suspect it's here that she got stereotyped as the ditzy 50's blonde. However that may be, she clearly proves her talent for light comedy. Bacall also does nicely as the brainy, tough talking leader of the three; at the same time, Grable has the least showy of the three parts. The men, logically, are secondary, even the estimable, but ageing William Powell.Anyway, the movie generally sparkles, both visually, in grand Technicolor, and script-wise, with a number of amusing set-ups. I suspect the lengthy symphonic prologue was to compensate for ticket-buyers expecting a musical. One thing for sure, the wardrobe department gets a good workout. The girls get to model just about all the high fashions of the day. All in all, I'm glad to have finally caught up with this legendary movie, even if it did take 60-years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening prologue is an orchestra performance that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. I began to wonder if I was watching the wrong movie. I've read they did this because it was the first movie shot in Cinemascope and they wanted to highlight the new stereophonic sound system. Seems to me it was unnecessary but times were different then I guess. Anyway, the plot is about three women on the hunt for husbands. Naturally, they would prefer rich husbands. Lauren Bacall plays the leader of the three -- she's the smart, sophisticated one. Betty Grable plays the ditzy, na?ve one. A role Marilyn Monroe probably would have played just a few years later due to typecasting. Here Marilyn plays a sort of middleground between Bacall and Grable's characters. Not too bright and not too dumb. She wears glasses but frequently takes them off because she thinks men don't like girls who wear glasses. There are several amusing gags that come as a result of her poor eyesight. All three ladies are beautiful, of course. They are also very funny and immensely appealing. The men in the film are pretty good, too. Even the ones playing jerks, like the great Fred Clark. Cameron Mitchell, David Wayne, and Rory Calhoun play the three primary love interests and are all likable. William Powell, in his second-to-last film, is as classy as they come. The themes are a little dated but it's all light and fluffy so nothing to get indignant about, for those of you who might. It's a fun, enjoyable romantic comedy. Fans of the three leads will love it most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How To Marry A Millionaire (1953): The first five minutes of the film shows us an orchestra, playing some lovely music from a Howard Hawks film, and then it simply disappears. And at the end of the film, it ends with the orchestra playing some music. Now let me ask you this, is this whole scene supposed to do anything with the plot, no. Is it long, meaningless and pointless, and just simply looks good? Yes.That's basically the problem of the whole film, it has so many scenes that doesn't have to do anything with the film, that could've just been edited. Take another example from the scene with the fashionable clothing, the first four clothes are okay, because we see the three main characters modeling, and the actual main character scowling at the man who came to see them because she saw him before, thinking that he's a pimp. We could've easily ended the scene there. But then it went on to show us the rest of the 12 clothes that weren't shown. It goes on for more than 2 minutes and it is quite restless. These are the kind of scenes that fills the film, long, pointless, just scenes that are not interesting, but are nice to look at.But let's take another look and ask this question, is it funny? Yes, it is quite funny. The film is quite modern with its humor. Although there is that feeling of 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' from the whole story, but the characters aren't like that and definitely not the humor. This might be one of those films, right next to Wilder's movies, as the films that gave inspiration for modern humor. Take the scenes with Marilyn humor with the poor eye sights (Probably the first time Monroe actually tried to be funny). Take the scene with the hot dog dream from Loco. Take another scene with the main character Schatze as she keeps saying no to the pimp every time he calls her, and yet she always go out with him, and in the end, falls in love with him. These are quite funny moments, and the film is full of it.The performances are quite strong to, although this film as commercialized with the image of Marilyn Monroe with the beautiful image of her is a tight red dress, the film is quite frankly Lauren Bacall's film, who played the main character Schatze (Who turned out to be the lucky one from the three girls). There is a boldness to her expression, such determination. With Monroe and Grable, who played the other two girls, while nice performances, they only felt like your average pretty blonde character. They didn't have any personality (Except Monroe, who is always an exception). Bacall however, had such presence that brings focus to her character. For the first time, there was a performance that shined far more than Monroe's performance in a film that had Monroe in it, and that performance was done by Lauren Bacall.The film is quite fun to watch and it's entertaining. But it is still annoying in the aspect of it being a bit of a filler at times. But other elements come by it, and it stands as a decent film3/4</fullReview>

But the film's premise is lame. And the execution is worse. It's a romantic comedy, but I found little to laugh at and romantic it isn't either. The plot point about an extremely nearsighted bimbo is about the only clever element of the story. Marilyn is by far the funniest character and the only one who isn't quite detestable.Overall dialogue is flat, and so too is the delivery. The script structure is disconcerting. The plot keeps jumping back and forth among the three ladies. There are scenes that should play one after another but instead they are intercut with other scenes that run up to 20 minutes. It's as if the writer couldn't quite blend the ensemble roles. The result is a plot that seems choppy.Not that one really cares about any of the characters. They are one-dimensional, unbelievable and the whole screenplay feels like the writer was pulling at straws. Everybody only ever has a single motivation. And it's the same one for everybody; money. When the inevitable "progress" is made and the women find "true" love nobody really seems to believe in it or feel it, neither the director, nor the screenwriter, nor the actors. What makes the whole thing so detestable is that you don't get to see any other parts of the character's lives. You assume that those women also have other things on their mind. But since you don't even get a glimpse of that they might as well just be exactly what they appear to be. They are all about the money and we are supposed to find it funny. 'Sex and the City' this is not. The SatC ladies want men to have good sex with, they want men to love and overall they simply crave for a satisfying relationship. Money only comes after all those things. And there is another big difference. They work and they want to work. If you thought that to the women of SatC men are nothing more than cattle than you better not watch this one.Lauren Bacall seems too old for the role and Betty Grable (the third chick in the row) was just a bit too stupid. There actually is a piece of dialogue that goes on for a whole minute, about how she thought a lodge is something else. The audience gets it after 5 seconds, but the writer apparently couldn't think of anything else that was worth telling.(at least half the credits for this review go to Lechuguilla, who inspired and contributed to it - added to IMDb with his permission)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to Marry a Millionaire is an average Fifties comedy revolving around three big movie stars. The lazy plot has been CinemaScoped up, and at times it drags painfully. Jean Negulesco was a craftsman, not a director with vision. Had the script been handed to Howard Hawks or Billy Wilder, it could have been turned into sarcastic societal commentary, comparable with Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, the Hawks/Monroe collaboration of the same year. As it stands, it's shallow, even dull.Ultimately, this is a Lauren Bacall movie. She handles her scenes with cool ease, being sassy and straightforward. And Monroe could do no wrong back then. Her comedic timing is impeccable.There's some raunchy fun there, especially when Bacall and Monroe get together. Upstaged by the two, in her lengthy scenes Betty Grable proves that she's all surface and no genuine talent.The story about women whose idea of a career is to hunt rich men is yesterday's news. But for fans of Bacall and, up to an extent, Monroe, it's a treat.</fullReview>

Two funny jokes and three gold-diggers do not make a good followup to Gentlemen Prefer Blondes which was abundant with entertainment, great songs, and had a good script with memorable, funny lines. Not so here. Whoever thought the best use of Bacall was portraying a shrewish, castrating bitch (You're supposed to like her) has some bizarre ideas about entertainment. She's about as enjoyable as spending 2 hours with rule-flogging Dr. Laura.While Gentlemen Prefer Blondes offered a knowing satire of the gender war with something for every member of the audience to enjoy; this is a big misfire. There is no wink at the audience. Men are idiots to be taken to the cleaners, whether they're villainous (Waldo Brewster), virtuous (Freddie Denmark, Eben, JD Hanley ) or victimized (Brookman). They're just 2-dimensional cash sources here. You're not supposed to mind, although there's zero comedy to it, and little art to their gals wheedling; the movie depicts a world where men seem to enjoy bold, rude, calculating interrogations about their finances.Grable barely registers. Monroe is wasted. Successful jokes are few and far between. These chicks are boorish.</fullReview>

Viewers must endure a fashion show, a plot point that amplifies how the film's director was smitten by those trashy glad rags.And then there is that orchestra. In what is arguably the worst film opening in cinema history, the first part of the film has an orchestra playing some dreary-sounding tune. At first, I thought I was watching the introduction to coming attractions. But no, it's actually part of the film. And the orchestra plays on, and on, and on. It has nothing, absolutely nothing, whatever to do with the story. What were they thinking?I enjoyed Marilyn Monroe, with her breathy voice, as she bimbos her way through the plot. But the film would have been far better if they had dumped the other two ensemble roles, dumped that orchestra, enhanced the comedy dialogue, and downplayed those gaudy, cheesy costumes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whew! A cast full of the finest talent and yet this movie is so tedious it is hard to slog through! The vacuous premise of the film is partly to blame - the idea of three women seeking men solely for their money is deeply offensive to say the least although this is a sin society tends to allow them. This idea, however, could have worked in a comedy - and this purportedly was a comedy. But it was such a snoozer it did not come across as funny in any way shape or form. It just came away as a B or C movie about worthless and shallow women. Strange that Robert Osborne, the esteemed movie expert and historian, liked this film and felt Lauren Bacall stole the film. She wore a perennial scowl (one that made her look ugly, if you can imagine that!) and was the most unlikeable of all the characters - constantly telling the man she eventually settles down with, "I never want to see you again!" That, I guess, was meant to be funny, but it only came across as cold. William Powell, with a minor role, is his endearing self but is handicapped by an unimaginative script that relegates him to an almost irrelevant character. What a waste of talent! Marilyn Monroe arguably is the only one who still manages to shine on some level, putting on a comic performance that displays her comedic talents at their best...yet even that effort falls short because the movie sucks the oxygen out of every scene it's so dull. Nothing is believable so when these unsympathetic characters manage to marry by movie's end, you could care less. There's certainly no reason to celebrate. These marriages seem motivated only by shallow desires and intentions. Therefore one almost cringes at the end, out of embarrassment for the great actors whose presence was wasted in this poor excuse for a film. Really, in retrospect, it appears to have been more a vehicle to show off three hot babes and sell tickets on their sex appeal than anything else. And so if you're a huge Marilyn fan - and possibly even a Betty Grable fan - you might enjoy this, for her attractiveness and sparks of true acting talent. Grable still looks good in her late '30s and so big fans of hers might also want to see this film on that one level - the level of curiosity and fandom, not of the true movie connoisseur. Oh - and David Wayne fans will like his comic vignettes. He also manages to survive the film unscathed, like Marilyn. The only laugh in this film, by the way, is actually pretty funny. (It's a throwaway line by Bacall about her real-life husband Humphrey Bogart (who fortunately wasn't in this train wreck of a film), which I won't spoil here.)</fullReview>

The film stars Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall, as three gold diggers along with William Powell, David Wayne, Rory Calhoun, Cameron Mitchell, Alex D'Arcy, and Fred Clark.It directed by Jean Negulesco and produced and written by Nunnally Johnson.This comedy is built around a trio of friends who come up with a plan to find and marry rich men. They rent a lavish penthouse and use it as their launching pad to lure men with money in the bank. But each eventually finds that love is more important that material possessions, though it takes a while.It was a hugely popular hit was the first comedy to be shot in CinemaScope and the second film ever to use this format after The Robe.Although it is not a classic in the sense that watching it today,that one may feel that the humor is flat and outdated.But nevertheless,it helps with the presence in the screen with the three female stars and the flaws gets by with their talent and performances in this film.Also,this comedy captures the mindset of an era in which women's identities were based on the men they married.Overall,it was an enjoyable and entertaining escapist film.</fullReview>

Naive moocher Betty Grable (as Loco Dempsey), visually impaired Marilyn Monroe (as Pola Debevoise), and sensible model Lauren Bacall (as Schatze Page) date both eligible and ineligible men, including suave senior William Powell (as J.D. Hanley). This all-too familiar plot works well in CinemaScope and Technicolor. Key to the success is the teaming of the World War II pin-up girl, sultry Bogart co-star, and platinum blonde bombshell. These three fill the new wide-screen format perfectly, without clashing. Their "advice" about being in the right place is certainly correct. Monroe, Grable and Bacall had other assets, too.******* How to Marry a Millionaire (11/4/53) Jean Negulesco ~ Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall, William Powell</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvellous Bacall &amp; Marilyn Offset By Episodic Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lauren Bacall gives a performance for the ages and Marilyn gives a signature turn, but Betty Grable is 20 years to old for Loco's character, and episodic script never really cashes in on marvellous premise. Cameron Mitchell and William Powell are terrific in supporting roles. Pleasant but not the classic it is sometimes purported to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable fluff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This shamelessly insubstantial piece of fluff can be fairly enjoyable once you get past the initial disappointment. Marilyn puts in a great comic turn here, however the film is no match for "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" and "The Seven Year Itch". The comedy comes off as rather dated from today's viewpoint, but luckily the ending isn't as cheesy as one might expect. The opening musical number with the symphony orchestra is a definite minus - it's pointless and seems to go on forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment cinemascope picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for the first 'filmed' CinemaScope title, being a fan of the format, I was hoping for a quality story to unravel on the 2.55:1 screen. Unfortuantely, I was disappointed, I think I've seen these types of films done many times before, it lacked a sparkling story, didn't hook me in.The acting is excellent, even Monroe performs well. Bacall is quite good.The director uses the entire 2.55:1 frame quite well for the first time, it's totally unwatchable in pan and scan.The music is very nice, the film opens with a lengthy musical number to herald the CinemaScope format.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totally lackluster comedy, so plush you can practically feel the fabric--but so inane you may go a little batty waiting for something to happen. Three gals prowl for rich husbands...and that's it. Marilyn Monroe gets some laughs as a near-sighted sex bomb, but Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable end up just standing around, posing. Jean Negulesco, a director who never had a strong sense of narrative to begin with, allows the whole picture to coast on its glossy sheen. Nunnally Johnson is credited with the screenplay, the source material originating with a play by Zoe Akins and later filmed in 1932 as "The Greeks Had a Word For Them", in 1938 as "Three Blind Mice", reworked in 1941 as "Moon Over Miami" (also starring Betty Grable), and in 1946 as "Three Little Girls in Blue". Alfred Newman's opening concert sequence was originally intended to showcase stereophonic sound, and is today mainly a nuisance. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't good so much for the script and lines as it is for the three stars, Marilyn, Lauren, and Betty. They are so gorgeous (particularly in the modeling scene) that the plot is forgotten. And who cares! This is an entertaining, fun movie with EXCELLENT costumes and scenery. See it if you're a fan of Monroe, Bacall, Grable, big cities or great snow-covered countryside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment! I remember looking at this cast, seeing Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall as the three leading ladies and thinking, "Wow, this ought to be great." Well, the "wow" turned to "yawn" and "groan" too many times to recommend this overblown mess. The humor was lame and Bacall, who I loved in the '40s films, was just plain annoying with the snotty character she effectively played. She had the most lines in here, too.Monroe, as always, was fun to watch and the message in here is good: one shouldn't marry for money, but, otherwise the film was a bust, pun somewhat intended. Grable was disappointing, too. Looks-wise and attitude-wise, only Monroe was appealing. In short: the film is a bummer; don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best-Laid Plans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was only the second movie that Fox produced in their new format Cinemascope and it's ironic that they elected to push new technology via one of the oldest stories that ever came down the pike. Nineteen fifty-three was also still a time when audiences could be relied upon to have personal details of the stars at their fingertips and it may be one of the last movies to feature in-jokes in which two of the three stars, Grable and Bacall, make references to their real-life husbands - respectively Harry James and Humprey Bogart - secure in the knowledge that the audience will 'get' it. Apart from that it's a pleasant enough trifle and interesting to chronicle the changeover from one 'Queen Of The Lot' (Grable) to another (Monroe) echoing a similar passing of the baton when Grable succeeded Alice Faye. As a bonus we get an overture in which the studio orchestra play Alfred Newman's iconic 'Street Scene' at length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The costumes were spectacular but little else is in this lackluster effort. Monroe and especially Bacall have been in some very good films but I felt this film was entirely pointless. The themes have been visited so many times before and here they are not presented in a refreshing way. I was so bored I kept checking how much more time was left in each chapter. Still on the glamour and charm of Monroe and Bacall alone, this film merits a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't hate this movie only because it is the most sexist and disgusting movie I have ever seen, the acting is horrific. Well, it is that over-acted 1950's silly crap and I don't care for it. Another thing, it is not a comedy. I did not laugh once. It is just about three silly women looking for wealthy men, married or not, young or super old. It is embarrassing. Would be like calling a movie Lil' Black Sambo and it being about blacks; it is in poor taste and boring. I can't believe ANYONE would give this over a 2 stars. It is amazing to me. I guess it is okay to make fun of women and give it a 10 stars, but if there was a movie about blacks called, "How to get off welfare," it would be banned. But, hey, this is just a gold-digging movie that shines a very ugly light on women and again is the most sexist movie I have seen, and again, not funny. Lauren Bacall is the only actress with a modicum of decent acting with a crappy script. The men in the movie are ridiculous too. Should this movie be banned? Nah, but, it should show people how close in time we were to pure sexism and it has not improved 100 percent. We are still unequal.</fullReview>
