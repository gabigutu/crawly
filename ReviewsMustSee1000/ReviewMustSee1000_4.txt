		<shortDescription>Way underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlito's Way is an extrememely underated Al Pacino movie. This film is probubly the best crime story ive seen, next to Goodfellas(1990), Pacino gives another superb performance as well as the rest of the cast. The story in Carlito's Way is extremely compelling and can be very sad at times. Unlike Pacino's similar film Scarface(1983), Carlito's Way is not just a blood bath without much of a story. I dont know why this film fizzled at the box office and failed to recieve any academy award nominations because it sure deserved to. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pacino and DePalma team up once again and the result is once again triumphant. "Carlito's Way" is an emotional and captivating story, depicting the life of former trug kingpin Carlito Brigante (Pacino). Brigante's intention is to go straight, clean up his act, and make money managing a sleazy nightclub. David Koepp's screenplay has the depth it needs in examining the intense struggle an ex-druglord must endure when trying to escape his violent past. Stephen Burum's nearly flawless camerawork and DePalma's flamboyant and operatic direction are a visual splendor that complements the emotional story. This film is a highly underrated work of art that needs to be appreciated. Great supporting performances from Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller should not go unmentioned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right well I can say this is one of my favourite gangster films ever, and I truly regard it almost as highly as good fellas or the godfather.This is simply because of the way the story catches you. Pacino delivers an excellent performance (do you really expect any less from him?) as the main guy Carlito who just wants out of the whole gangster game. By his side is the almost unrecognisable Sean Penn. An afro wearing cocaine addict who just seems determined to lure Carlito back into the kind of world he is trying to leave.This film is easy to enjoy with a great story and a great cast. And if you look carefully enough you can see a young Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from lord of the rings in case you don't know) as a crippled low life. Made me chuckle.Anyways, i give this movie 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, one of the greatest actors of our time teams up with one of the greatest directors. Ther combination must surely be as good as, if not better than, Scorsese and De Niro. First the excellent Scarface, and then Carlito's Way, a film that blew me away when I first saw it.Pacino's portrayal of ex-gangland boss and drug dealer Carlito Brigante is powerful, moving and at times very funny. Combined with great performances from Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller, this film is a roller-coaster ride of "will he, won't he" tension and heavy , though not gratuitous, violence.So swept away do we get in Carlito's struggle that we actually forget that he's dying at the beginning of the film, and are praying that he'll make it by the end. This is a masterstroke from De Palma and a salute to the powerful and mesmeric acting of one Alfredo Pacino.A modern classic - this film has everything you could want. Love, loyalty, betrayal, sadness, comedy, and most importantly of all - balls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito's Way (1993), is a brilliant cinematic work. Pacino's performance as Carlito Berganzi displays the duplicity and subsequent torment between his reformed spirit, and the endless seduction of the street, embodied more specifically as his reputation,legacy,those who know him, of him, and those whom he allows in his innermost circle. Sean Penn is phenomenal as the lawyer representing Carlito, his metamorphosis into character is testament to his depth of talent. Penelope Ann Miller, as the long-suffering love of Carlito's life is dramatically and visually enchanting. The casting is perfect. The supporting cast superb, perfectly augmenting the film. The script is alive with literary devices, the story line(s), characters, dialogue, themes, sub-texts,etc., make this an almost endlessly watchable film. Of this genre, Its all there, action, suspense, violence, confrontations, chases, prerequisite street and wise guy character profiling with the right dialogue to make it work. Directed, executed and rendered a cinema great. Carlito's Way is atypical of the gangster genre, although it adheres to certain basics. It is also a love story, not boy meets girl, ad nauseum, but real, destined soul mates, wrenched apart and thrown back together five years later by some abberation of fate. As one experiences spiritual,moral disintegration, the other the anti-thesis. Carlito's Way is a mix of genre's veiled with diligent artistic discretion. I even see certain thematic similarities to Casablanca. Watching Carlito's Way I had the feeling that De Palma wanted to resurrect and redeem poor old Tony Montana, Scarface (1983). Perhaps it was self-redemption, or a means to a great film with a second view or maybe the fun of bringing back that great ensemble of talent, based on a similar theme. A sequel of sorts, not to diminish either film in anyway. Released exactly ten years after Scarface, the comparisons are more than obvious. Ten years later, De Palma and Pacino. Oliver Stone missing, but another great script. In Carlito's Way, Pacino again plays a Hispanic drug lord. Now Puerto Rican in New York City, before Cuban in Miami. Now drug lord repentant, whereas in Scarface, drug lord vehemently unrepentant and devoid of remorse, from beginning to surrealistic end. Instead of classic gangster genre prerequisites employed in Scarface, such as, coming from the bottom, rising in status, trust and favour in the eyes of the mob boss, eventually killing him, and gaining his empire his woman(Michelle Pfeiffer). Love? Its not in the equation- Carlito only wants to unite with his TRUE LOVE. To redeem himself in her eyes, after causing her the heartbreak of losing him forever.(Which it would have been, if not for the quirk of intervention by Carlito's coke addicted, sociopathic lawyer). Carlito seeks solely to prove to his love that he is truly changed, honest, sincere, and even has a plan whereupon they can live happily ever after. Carlito and his girl are likeable. Upon viewing this film one is compelled to empathy, wanting them to escape insurmountable odds (the almost onmniprescent serpent-like "street"), finding and deserving of happiness as long as they may live. However, it is though The Angel of Death has been hidden somewhere in every frame of De Palma's film, casting a shadow, waiting patiently to put his hand upon...Even the ancillary characters from Scarface are brought back in legions for Carlito's Way. Carlito's Way is Scarface with "feelings". Which is another similarity in the two films, "feelings" is the Achille's Heel of both Carlito Berganzi and Tony Montana. I also believe both films were vastly underrated and overlooked by the mainstream media, but upon populist vote, they are both widely esteemed as "classic". I'd give Carlito's Way (1993) nine out of ten. If I saw a ten, it would be a life changing event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More human than "Scarface."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scarface" was a great operatic film rooted in Greek tragedy, primarily the downfall of its protagonist related to his own hubris and pride. Its over-the-top theatrics and scenery-chewing acting complemented the absurdist tone of the film; some carping critics complained it was "too violent," but it was silly violence...and it worked."Carlito's Way" is considered by many to be a companion piece of sorts to "Scarface" - but in its own ways it is vastly different. As "GoodFellas" differed a great deal from "Casino" in its narrative methods, "Carlito's Way" isn't as broad and theatrical as "Scarface." Of course, it's still a DePalma film, and that means we get some beautiful set pieces - but for the most part DePalma avoids his excessive visuals and instead opts for a balanced mixture of both storyline and directorial flair. It is not a sequel to "Scarface" - it is an expansion, and it seems entirely apt that its narrative is more mature, considering that Carlito Brigante (the main character) is wiser than Tony Montana from "Scarface." Carlito is a Puerto Rican ex-con who gets out of a thirty-year jail sentence based on a technicality after serving a mere five years of sentence. Faced with a new life and fresh horizons, he decides to heed the lessons he learned in jail and embark on a new and honest lifestyle."Scarface" was Greek tragedy insofar as Tony Montana was doomed to a downfall based on his own egotism and stubbornness. Like Oedipus in Sophocles' classic story, Montana was too bull-headed to take the advice of his wife and friends and was entirely responsible for his own emotional (and, in "Scarface's" case, physical) demise."Carlito's Way" is the flip side of the coin. It's still Greek tragedy, but it offers a new perspective. This time, the protagonist tries to change his fate, but his life is doomed to its inevitable conclusion. Carlito tries to change his ways, but - to paraphrase a character from another film - there is only one guarantee...Carlito Brigante will never see heaven. That's the fundamental truth of this movie, and DePalma's less showy camera-work, and the more mature characterizations by the actors, and the believable script, ensure that "Carlito's Way" is an entirely human experience - far more so than "Scarface." (Which is still a great film based on its own goals.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie..vastly underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie..and I can see why it is underrated...possibly due to obvious comparisons to Scarface (Brian De Palma, Martin Bregman, Al Pacino team), which was much more brutal in its approach.Al Pacino as Carlito, awesome as he is, is still much softer compared to the sledgehammer Tony Montana. And then there is some romance mixed in with the story of a gangster trying to reform himself.I didn't like the romantic scenes myself...thought they interrupted the flow of the story...hence I gave it a 9 instead of a 10! There is also some clichéd dialogue. I happen to be a big Pacino fan and so I am being a little bit (though not entirely) biased and am sidelining all these things. If you excuse these small potatoes, this one is a great flick from start to finish, very entertaining, with some fantastic performances from the supporting cast, e.g. Sean Penn. Special mention, also, of Viggo Mortensen who comes in for a short role, but plays the part wonderfully.As for Al Pacino in lead role, he makes sure he steals the show, as usual. Brilliant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about such a movie? Simply brilliant. I make a point of watching this movie each year and every time I watch it I simply fall in love with it even more. The direction is brilliant as is Pacino's superb on-time acting. Al deserves an Oscar for this flick. As human beings, we love story telling. It's in out nature, and this story is excellent. As mentioned before in a previous review, Carlito's way is Scarface with feeling. Simply involving. I would dare say it does leave you on the edge of your chair with great anticipation, probably due to Pacino's on screen presence and experienced acting mannerisms. Penn, once again is brilliant and shines through as the high-classed, cocaine addicted Kleinfeld. If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favour. Rent it out, dim the lights, snuggle up tight with your loved one and enjoy one of the greatest movies of all time. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant gangster movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the two greatest works of a true master - Brian de Palma. Just like it's "brother", Scarface, the movie gives us an insight of a criminal world, with all it's cruelty, deceit, lies and fatal decisions which can change ones life forever. As we observe the last days of a retired gangster Carlito Brigante, it's hard not to admire skills of the director, as a quite usual story of a good guy trying to quit "the business" turns into an epic and a cult movie right in front of our eyes. The movie also contains some important messages, and one of the most important is: "Never give up your friends, no matter what..." The movie has excellent cast (Pacino is great as usual, and Sean Penn does an amazing job as a repulsive corrupted lawyer) directing and soundtrack. 10/10, a true crime classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carlito's Way -- The Master of its Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino, Sean Penn, and Penelope Ann Miller create an artistic and romantic twist to the gangster genre in Carlito's way, story of a convicted gangster by the name of Carlito Brigante, known to his ex-lover as Charlie, who manages to get his way out of jail thanks to crooked drug-addicted lawyer David Kleinfield. After his release, he's convinced himself that he's never going back to his life of crime, but before he knows it, he's inevitably being pulled back thanks to his corrupt friends and family.While Scareface centered around the action and grittiness of the gangster life more then anything else, Carlito's Way tends to lean to the romantic side, giving the film an artsy twist. For example, in one scene there is a close up shot of a revolver, the chamber slowly moving to an empty slot. There is another famous scene with Carlito inside of a dark bathroom, his back against a wall with a pistol in hand. The way the camera is placed, the way Carlito is standing, and the way the lighting reflects off of the wall and his leather jacket are all taken in to account by De Palma. To make a long story short, Carlito's Way is very beautiful, and this is all thanks to De Palma. He directs the movie very well, you can tell that he put some true dedication in to this film.Needless to say, the acting is incredible, no matter what you might be hearing. Al Pacino is as always great, and Penelope Ann Miller is as well. But most of the time you'll find yourself deeper inside Sean Penn's character then Pacino's or anyone else's. He's steals nearly every scene he's in, if not then he steals all of them. He's almost too convincing.The scores are very, very strong and add on to the artistic feel to the movie. Not only do they add on to that, but it adds to the tension, the romance, and the tears as well.To sum it all up, Carlito's Way is the best gangster film ever made. I love it more and more every time I think about it.*****/*****Riveting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had to pick the movies that made Pacino my favorite actor, it would be this underrated classic. He is both a man's man and a lady's man. He show humor and bravado. He plays a character who can be your best friend, or your worst enemy. Pacino is in top form here, working with good actors, a fine script, and a well told story. His best scenes are with Penelope Ann Miller and Sean Penn (who also shines). He gets your attention from his opening speech, where he's making a statement to the court that sounds like an Academy Awards speech. Very entertaining and humorous. It get even better from there, as he goes through a whole range of emotions, portraying a very interesting character, and making him even more interesting. I loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting, direction and writing all spot on for a top gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inevitably, Carlito's Way will always be compared to Scarface. Same director, same star, same genre; it is difficult to watch this film without thinking of Scarface. This is very unfortunate for Carlito's Way as it is second rate compared to Scarface but it is a very good film and many people have failed to see this.Where Scarface was about a South American battling his way to the top of the crime world, Carlito's Way is about a South American gangster trying to leave his past behind him. The story is very good and believable, the problems for Carlito (Al Pacino) are very typical for someone in his position and the relationships are all very convincing. The fact that Edwin Torres based his characters on real people and that events in the film are inspired by real life, really help Carlito's Way to be a credible film. The fact that it is Carlito's lawyer, Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), who got him out of prison and then becomes a loose cannon who provides Carlito with too many problems is a great illustration of respect and excess going to someone's head.The performances in this film are extremely strong. Al Pacino is one of the best actors ever to be witnessed and is on outstanding form here. The beard, shades and long coat are a very good look for him and definitely provide him with one of his most fashionable roles to date. What is most convincing in this performance is his charm towards Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) as the audience, along with Gail, fall for him instantly, despite knowing his past. His scenes with Sean Penn are also amongst the films strong points because it always good to see Pacino act angry. The dialogue between these two is exceptional and really highlights how strongly Carlito's Way is written. Sean Penn does not let Pacino outclass him and gives one of his strongest performances. As an arrogant coke head, Penn portrays a character who is really repulsive and dislikeable and incites a great sense of hatred from the audience. Penelope Ann Miller does well to give the film feeling and bring it down to earth. It is pleasurable to watch her inner conflicts regarding Carlito as she pulls off the emotional scenes very professionally and is very effective at drawing out an emotional response from the audience. Luis Guzman and John Leguizamo are the two most memorable characters from the supporting cast, they both fit specific niches very well and both give great performances. It was nice to see Adrian Pasdar in the film, shame he wasn't in it for longer as the writers could have made something more out of his character.My only negative criticism of the film is that it could have done with a touch more action. Gangster films are at their most exciting when there is a high drama shootout but Carlio's Way only has two major action scenes. Luckily, the content is good enough to make up for this. The two shootouts are very good scenes, especially the last one as the tension build up is so intense.Stylish, realistic and stimulating, Carlito's Way would be a classic gangster film, had it not been overshadowed and over compared to Scarface. All the ingredients are right to serve up a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Temptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I've dropped myself into straightforward character pieces in order to explore that form and reap its values. But you are sort of restricted visually when your first requirement is to tell a fairly straightforward story. So I'd like to go back and develop pure visual storytelling. Because to me, it's one of the most exciting aspects of making movies and almost a lost art at this point." - Brian De PalmaThere's a scene in Brian De Palma's "Carlito's Way" in which Al Pacino stands outside his lover's door, watching as she slowly undresses. Pacino pants like a dog in heat, salivating over the beauty of her naked body. Unable to contain himself he breaks the door down and lunges for his woman, their lips locking as he embraces her soft flesh. De Palma's camera then giddily circles the couple, "You Are So Beautiful" blazing on the soundtrack. The moment of passion escalates, the camera circling faster and faster, their feverish kisses becoming more wet, more sloppy, until she looks into Pacino's eyes and says: "Where's my cheesecake?"It is with moments like these that director Brian De Palma acknowledges that "Carlito's Way" is one giant slice of cheese. This is art for art's sake, a purely formal exercise in which De Palma indulges his fetish for sexy aesthetics. He pushes every motion and emotion to operatic proportions, ringing every ounce of drama from what is really a fairly generic plot. With its impeccable compositions, precise camera work, glacial tracking shots, baroque tone, sublime action sequences and flamboyant acting, this is a film in love with its own form. But for a film so preoccupied with surfaces, it's remarkable how much emotion De Palma wrings out of his cast. De Palma has a fondness for bad actors, often deliberately casting them as props or undermining their performances. Indeed, his leading men (Michael J Fox, Josh Hartnett, John Travolta etc) are often clueless actors who themselves play clueless characters, and his leading women (Melanie Griffith, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Romjin, Nancy Allen etc) are often models or vacuous pretty faces who likewise play airheads, hookers or prostitutes. This is a guy preoccupied with surface beauty, even as his films are explicitly preoccupied with the dirty veneer behind such surfaces ("Redacted", for example, is about the lie behind beautifully composed photographs). And even when De Palma does cast genuine talent (Pacino, Penn, Lithgow) he has them play larger than life characters, their raging opera performances designed to match his shamelessly grandiose vision.In "Carlito's Way" De Palma has Al Pacino play Carlito Brigante, an ageing gangster who has recently been released from jail. Carlito is determined to go straight, staying out of trouble until he can amass enough money to retire to some paradisaical tropic island. It's a generic plot, but Pacino and De Palma mesh so perfectly that the film eventually transcends its B movie premise and becomes, at times, something a bit more sublime. Odd for a gangster movie, "Way" aligns itself firmly with the world of noir. Gangster movies typically follow a fairly obvious narrative progression. We get rise, the good times, and the fall, the bad times. "Carlito's Way" is odd in that it treats the fall as a forgone conclusion, its dying protagonist narrating his death dream like Fred MacMurray in "Double Indemnity". This is a conspiratorial world, Carlito pulled around like a puppet on a string by some unseen, cosmic noir God. Indeed, upon being released from jail, every action Carlito does, every choice he makes, is righteous and admirable. And yet noir fatalism thwarts him at every turn, his choices unable to halt an almost predetermined finale. And so the "Way" of the film's title refers both to Carlito's spiritual path, his newfound desire to be good and do right, but also something more inexorable; the "way", the fixed route. Rehabilitated or not, Carlito's tragedy is that there was never any chance of escape.And so while in "Scarface" Pacino's manic performance gelled perfectly with De Palma's cocaine inspired direction, in "Carlito's Way" his forlorn eyes mesh flawlessly with De Palma's melancholic visuals. At 53 years of age, Pacino's face has never looked this beautifully tragic. Framed by a jet black beard, Pacino walks about like Jesus on a good hair day, suffering for sins he can not atone. Already dead, he spends the film always dressed in black, navigating his death dream like a fallen angel. Watch too how Pacino spends the film alternating between a stance of fast-talking macho posturing and one of melancholic regret. He wears the face of a corpse, of defeat and acceptance, his flashes of confidence a hip old mask which doesn't know if its going or staying.And yet in death Carlito does receive a spiritual redemption of sorts. He may not have escaped his past, but he does help his lover, a stripper who dreams of being a ballerina, escape hers. And so when De Palma chooses to end the film with another airing of "You Are So Beautiful", we know that the song has a dual function. We celebrates Carlito's newfound spiritual beauty, but also the aesthetic beauty of De Palma's filmic world.8.5/10 - Stylish. De Palma's one of the few directors able to convey a sense of true three dimensional space. His crane shots are gorgeous, and the film is composed of numerous long takes, elegant whip pans, and zooms so precise that we switch from long shots to close ups almost imperceptibly. Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different kind of gangster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people don't highlight 'Carlito's Way' among Al Pacino's gangster movies, but in my opinion it's an instant classic. It's not as hyped as 'The Godfather' or 'Scarface', but it's an extremely honest and captivating film, that wins you over exactly because it doesn't seem to have been created to make it into film history.All the characters are very well defined, so there are no ambiguous or contradicting behaviors. Al Pacino is extremely charismatic, convincing the viewer that as well as he can play an Italian or a cuban, he can play a puerto-rican. And his complete change from one character to another is what makes this movie so special among the other great gangster movies.Carlito Brigante is a more mature gangster, reformed from his years spent in jail. Differently from Tony Montana, Carlito doesn't feel, or needs to feel isolated. He reaches out to the people around him. He wants to trust, and mainly, love. Gail, his love interest, is put on a pedestal, as the person with whom he wants to escape to 'paradise', and the entire film revolves around the expectations and the hope that the viewer feels for this romance that along with Carlito's way out of the crime world would lead them both to the dream life. If Michael Corleone's essence was in honor and Tony Montana's in money, Carlito Brigante's is in this sensitivity, that make's you forget about his ethnicity or his background, which isn't so in 'Scarface'. His body language and his looks as a Latin-American also change amazingly compared to Tony Montana.The supporting actors were also amazing, mainly Sean Penn, that really embraced his character, Kleinfeld, a stressed-out, corrupt lawyer, who betrays everyone around him. John Leguizamo is also great as 'Benny from the Bronx'.Overall the film is very well paced, as it begins with a bit of action, when Carlito returns to his neighbourhood, goes on revolving around him getting his life back on track and making plans with Gail, and ends with the thrilling and greatly edited scenes of the Grand Central Station chase. Finally, when he's shot, you're left wondering if there was any way out to begin with, and if there's really a possibility of 'paradise', even for a reformed gangster like himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino's best film performance post-1990!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CARLITO'S WAY (1993) is the real best Al Pacino performance after 1990. Love him in his Oscar-winning role in SCENT OF A WOMAN (1992); it's not as overrated as people say and he is infectiously good in that. But in CARLITO'S WAY, Mr. Pacino plays the more difficult role of Carlito Brigante, who deserves as much respect as Michael Corleone or Tony Montana! I've got to preface the rest of my review by saying that I've seen this film a bunch of times, starting with right after it first came out in the early 90s and have loved it ever since. It is one of those films that has EVERYTHING in it that will appeal to anyone. You like Action? CHECK...Romance? CHECK...Drama? CHECK...Thrills? CHECK...Humor? CHECK...This is one of the rare films that has it all!The legendary Pacino seemed to specialize in playing ambitious, crafty, respected gangsters and Carlito is no exception in those general aspects; but in this film, Carlito is in large parts different from both Corleone or Montana; whereas both Corleone and Montana were very powerful men that controlled empire throughout the bulk of their films, Carlito WAS a powerful gangster who lost his empire and did jail time; also, Corleone and Montana were inherently suspicious and possessive men to the point of being paranoid, and dare I say it, inherently evil; whereas Carlito was justifiably suspicious, but also ironically forgiving and accepting of other people's shortcomings and at his core, a GOOD man! The other 2 men chose to live a certain way and either never tried to redeem himself (Corleone) or never had a chance (Montana), but Carlito has lived the hard, gangster lifestyle, paid for his sins, and now wants redemption and to start anew. From the moment the film starts in 1975 with his courtroom speech (the only pure comic moment in the film) "thanking" the judge for releasing him early from his 30-year prison sentence (he only served 5 years) to the very end, the viewer HAS to root for Carlito Brigante! Carlito, upon release, wants to start a whole knew life and become legitimate. No more drug-dealing, no more killings. He wants to play it straight. Carlito's lawyer that gets him off is Dave Kleinfeld (played by the great Sean Penn in a superb performance), a shady man who is hooked on drugs and has his own troubles as he has stolen money from one of his other imprisoned gangster clients, who finds out about it and blackmails Kleinfeld into helping break him out of prison. This is definitely one of my favorite Sean Penn performances and ironically in a supporting role. He's effortless as this scuzzy, posing, pathetic, out-of-his-league lawyer and in a way, his tale is as tragic as Carlito's.The film's first ironic moment occurs when Carlito's young cousin gets him into a scrape with some low-level drug dealers in a crappy gin-joint/pool hall, where Carlito must use his old school cunning and instincts to survive. His cousin had $30,000 to make the deal for the drugs, but the dealers were going to kill him and keep the drugs and money for themselves. Carlito can't save his inexperienced cousin, but outsmarts the dealers and gets away with the money. He uses that money to buy into a partnership with disco-owner Sasso. At this point, he sees a dancer one night that reminds him of his old girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller in a sexy, sweet performance). He seeks out Gail one night after her dance class and they go to a diner to talk about their past and possible future. Honestly, I think that "beauty" is an overrated word and there are even actresses that are (supposedly) beautiful in real life that don't do it for me on screen, but Miller as Gail totally does it for me! Gail is a REAL woman, who, like Carlito has goals, ambitions, desires and they complement each other perfectly. Gail is sexy in a very natural way.Things look good for Carlito, but feeling he must help Dave out of his scrape, he goes along with him the night of the prison escape on a boat with the gangster's son and Dave kills the son against Carlito's wishes. Carlito cleans his hands of Dave. But there is another up and coming gangster Benny Blanco (John Leguiziamo in a wonderful performance) that has an unhealthy admiration for Carlito and won't leave him alone. So Carlito finds himself surrounded by all these shady types that he can't shake. He decides to run away with Gail, who is pregnant.Directed by the great Brian DePalma, CARLITO'S WAY is a very authentic period piece as he captures the essence of the 1970s without the film bogging itself down in that time period. The focus is on the characters and the story, but has an epic feel with a lot of long-view tracking shots, an operatic score, and Pacino's brilliant narration of his characters thoughts and emotions. The cinematography is amongst the best I've ever seen in a modern film. All these elements perfectly complement the bombastic personality, yet contemplative nature of Carlito Brigante. I don't know if I've ever seen a film where virtually all non-human elements of the film reminded TOTALLY of it's main character! Another thing...this film is almost 2 and 1/2 hours long and is NEVER boring! That's an incredible feat in and of itself.Great supporting work is also provided by Luis Guzman (as Carlito's right hand man Pachanga), James Rebhorn (as the D.A. out to nail Kleinfeld), Paul Mazursky (as the judge who freed Carlito), and my favorite one played by Viggo Mortensen (as the wheelchair-bound Lalin, an old associate of Carlito's).But in the end, this film is ALL Mr. Pacino's, who effortlessly essays the title character and gets some of the most quotable dialogue in the gangster genre of film. A top 10 film of the 1990s!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most unfairly underrated film in movie history. It's a perfect film, and much better than any other De Palma film (I am a big fan of De Palma but this film is just perfect). Ex-drug dealer Carlito Brigante, recently released from prison, tries to live a decent live while dealing with the ever present temptations of going back to it's old one (mostly from his friends, who aren't very happy with the idea of Carlito becoming a decent citizen). He is always accompanied by his best friend and lawyer David Kleinfeld, who is a coke addicted and increasingly paranoid lawyer with dubious connections in the mob world. As you can see, with friends like these it would be a hard job for Carlito to abandon his old life. However he finds strength and inspiration to continue his efforts of cleaning his act by reuniting with his old love (from before he went to jail) Gail. This story is a perfect thriller whose structure and development feels a lot like a Greek tragedy reinterpreted as a film noir. There are few action sequences, but the dialog is so perfect that you just want to know more and more about the characters. The few action sequences are beautifully filmed, and i assure you: you will not be disappointed, they will keep you on the edge of your seat. The performances are great, Pacino gives a great Humphrey Bogart-like performance as the ex-con always tormented by his past (the narration is also great, it clearly shows us how Carlito is feeling, and how i think an ex-con would think trying to clean his act with temptations in every corner). Sean Penn gives an academy award worthy performance by giving a believable approach to Carlito's increasingly drug addicted, paranoid and even homicidal lawyer. The beautiful Penelope Ann Miller gives us a wonderful performance as Carlito's only positive influence and inspiration in his life (I think this performance should have established her as strong leading lady, but as i said, this movie doesn't have even half of the recognition it deserves). All in all, Is a great movie, and personally, one of my all time favorites (if not favorite). Great Performances, Perfect Film.</fullReview>

The ending is good, when all seems, that to the protagonist &#x443;&#x434;&#x430;&#x43b;&#x43e;&#x441;&#x431;, and we are waited with the USUAL "good" ending, but there is no also this moment very sentimental.

		<shortDescription>DePalma's moment of grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The long, slow-paced, black and white introduction with the death of Carlito, a small time gangster who cannot help but fail(Pacino, in the part of an actor's lifetime)is a pure moment of grace. One cannot help but to shiver for him at the end during the long and riveting runaway sequence in the underground, one that I managed to see quite a lot of times, and every time a part of me still believes that it's going to be all right, he'll get out of a life of betrayal, small crooks and cons, but he ends up getting killed, as the introduction scene shows it. De Palma's direction is once again inspired, especially when Carlito looks at his love interest under the rain, hiding from a it under a garbage can, watching her dance or during the action sequences. It's probably DePalma's film with the most obvious references to Hitchcock or Welles. (the snooker scene is just brilliant). An incredible movie about redemption, about the cost of happiness, and about failure, with a spectacular casting (a special mention to Sean Penn)and an incredible script. Probably one of the best film of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gangster in New York gets thirty years in prison. But his lawyer manages to have that reduced to five years. He is truly trying to remain clean and to make some rather honest money in a club, though he gets the necessary investment from a bad deal that had cost the life of a few people. He was only an asset to a younger dealer, a recommendation, a referee if you want, aired and exhibited by the younger one. But that younger one was dealing with young gangsters and of course they tricked him into dying, losing his money and getting nothing, except that Carlito puts things right, to his own and sole benefit. But he has to deal with a vast Italian family in his club and outside. The main twist in the plot is that the lawyer who rescued him out of prison had been dealing with these gangsters, and this family in particular, even trapping one in prison after appropriating the million dollars this particular gangster had made in his business. But a lawyer will always be an amateur gangster and he drags Carlito into the last act of his own drama. That will cost their lives to the lawyer, Carlito and half a dozen members of the family in the brilliant setting of Grand Central Station. At the very moment when he could have walked out of this life of outcast crime, he is reminded that the leash that is attached around his neck will never disappear. This film has some depth somewhere about the great ease with which honest people can become dishonest, and at times with the idea that they are not dishonest since the people they steal or rob are thieves themselves. The code of the street is all powerful and definitely stronger than any law imaginable. The film is brilliant too as an action film, even, this time with suspense and great actors, Al Pacino being doubled up by Sean Penn. Brilliant rendering of the dilemma of a drug lord turned old and would-be honest.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best crime dramas of the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian De Palma and Martin Bregman, the guys who were responsible for the gangster classic "Scarface" had scored another classic with "Carlito's Way". Based on a novel by Edwin Torres, the screenplay adaptation, who incredibly was about to be turned down by Bregman, is one of the best crime movies of the 90's or perhaps of all time.I was always curious about this movie and waited over 10 years to see it. I finally decided to just buy the DVD, and let me tell you it was the best twelve bucks i've ever spent in my life. I was not disappointed one bit.Al Pacino gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Carlito Brigante, a Puerto Rican hustler from the 70's who has just served five years in prison and has vowed to live a clean life and stay away from crime, but finds it very difficult to stay out of the streets and out of trouble once he gets back to the old neighborhood and meets up with his old acquaintances, and little by little finds himself going back to the same life that put him behind bars in the first place. Sean Penn gives another Oscar-worthy performance as Brigante's lawyer and friend David Kleinfeld, who is very much involved in Brigante's world of crime in his own way and is way crazier and reckless than he looks. Penelope Ann Miller is great and very sexy as Pacino's love interest Gail. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent as well: Luis Guzman, as Carlito's right hand man Pachanga, the then-unknown Viggo Mortensen, in a short appearance as Carlito's acquaintance, Lalin, and of course one of the most memorable characters, John Leguizamo as a drug-dealer with high ambitions, "Benny Blanco from The Bronx". This movie is filled with great dialogue and even greater performances and is one of those movies that usually critics pound but that audiences love for generations. The movie's soundtrack is great as well, the disco hits and the salsa music perfectly fit the mood of every scene and truly take you back to that time. This is by far one of Pacino's best movies in his career and he should've definitely at least been nominated for an Oscar. Definitely worth to be in your collection if you're a fan of crime dramas or gangster flicks. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito Brigante is an ex-drug-lord who has just been released from prison, and has vowed to go legitimate. However, when he revisits his old neighborhood, all of his past memories come back to haunt him in a flash, starting with a shootout in the back of a barber shop. Director Brian De Palma ('Scarface') teams up with Al Pacino ('The Godfather' films) once again to film this movie, and it works. Unlike Scarface, Carlito's Way had much more of a smooth flow that tells a story without too much violence in it, and what Carlito was trying to do to get away from his past. Every minute of the film is gold. The performances are the key in this movie, and every performer is great with their role. To me, the one that stood out the most was Sean Penn's ('21 Grams') character because it showed just how his character could change in a matter of time. He was the most convincing character in the movie. This film also gave John Leguizamo ('Ice Age 1 &amp; 2') better recognition as an actor. Overall, this is a classic film of the crime genre, and should not be overlooked. -- (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If you can't see the angles no more, you're in trouble"- One of the best of 1993, a sublimely self-conscious crime picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes conventions apart (not essential, but always there, like mildew in a shower) of the studio system of movies, as well as in the industry year in and year out, is that they set up the basic track lines for the viewer, to which then he or she can see if the re-treaded storyline will be more impressive than the last movie to take a convention to use. Brian De Palma makes one of his best (and under-rated) films by letting the viewer be as self-aware of the on-coming chiches and pit-falls of the drama the story intones, just by the narration. The aged, contemplative voice of Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) that chimes in more often than not, is as essential to the way the story unfolds as Henry Hill's was to GoodFellas- this guys been on the inside, he knows the ropes, he knows the stakes, he knows the nature of the beast that goes with the people he associates with, and now that he's out of prison, he doesn't want it anymore. Un-like a lesser film, we start to believe his intentions and reasonings.Carlito's just been released, thanks in part to his counselor David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), five years gone in a thirty year sentence, and when he returns to the street many look at him as if he's changed hearing that he's retired. Carlito just wants to get some money together, open a car dealership of sorts with a friend in the Bahamas, and works in a nightclub right smack dab in the heart of the coked up late 70's. As Carlito's tale unfolds, so does Kleinfeld's, as an inmate who's a client of his makes a demand that he can't turn down, which in turn brings a perpetually reluctant Carlito along with him. Another wise decision on De Palma's part was the casting: Pacino's screen presence is sometimes enough to be intimidating, but his performance as Carlito is the part of the heart of the movie (the other part is with Penelope Ann Miller as his estranged girlfriend), compelling, tough, and intelligent from years of dope dealing and soaking up the gang-land atmosphere around him. Personally, I would put this over Tony Montana any day, if only because the accent rings truer as do his emotions. Then there's Sean Penn as Kleinfeld, a scheming, vain little man who starts off seemingly as legitimate as a lawyer of criminals, but as we soon learn, he has slipped into a world that he has no place to belong in. When I first saw little sections of this movie on TV, previous to recently watching it all the way through, I really didn't know who it was playing Kleinfeld, with his balding, curly hair and nervy, cranked voice appearing like it was Sean Penn, only as Woody Allen if he were ever an attorney. However, when the viewer looks into his eyes, both terrified and ravenous, one can understand the pathway to excess that most conventional crime movies take for granted. Including supporting work by Penelope Ann Miller and John Leguizamo as the convincing critter Benny from the Bronx, and magnificent set-pieces that confirm De Palma's worth as a director of thrillers as well as dramas, this is an example of Hollywood movie-making that is waiting to be discovered over and over again, as proof of the value that can come in re-fashioning a genre piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cocaine-addict lawyer? Now where have I seen that before?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I see Carlito's Way, I always have to think that it's what The Godfather III could have been if only they'd tried harder. With Charlie Brigante trying to go straight it almost mirrors Michael Corleone's attempt to make the 'family business' legitimate. The big difference is that in Carlito's Way we aren't seeing a vain attempt to cash in on the success of a popular film series, which really is all The Godfather III ever was.Al Pacino was on fine form in the title role, but is probably outshone by Sean Penn as the coke-addict lawyer, David Kleinfeld, who was almost certainly the inspiration for Ken Rosenberg in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, which of course is directly connected by the involvement of Luis Guzman in both titles - as Pachanga in Carlito's Way and as the voice of Ricardo Diaz in GTA: Vice City.Also it's good to see Viggo Mortensen in a role so vastly different to those he played in Lord of the Rings, Hidalgo or even GI Jane. As an actor who usually plays such strong characters, it is a refreshing change (if you can regard it as such) to see him in a wheelchair with a colostomy bag.All round well acted, beautiful setting, and some laugh-out-loud moments to boot. What more could you want from a gangster film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliantly told crime/character relations drama with plenty of principals going for it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Carlito's Way' is another fantastic example of a film chronicling the rise 'and rise' and fall of a petty gangster. This time there's a bit of a twist in the initial narrative as the gangster anti-hero is attempting to 're-rise' the hierarchy, albeit briefly for cash purposes, upon being released form prison.I really and genuinely liked Carlito's Way. I thought it was funny, well paced, contained likable/dislikeable characters to whom you could really get stuck into as a viewer and just generally held its own for two hours. What I really liked about the film was the use of mise-en-scene; particularly the use of setting and lighting. It seemed that different shades and tones were used for different scenes and moods. The colour red was used to distinguish danger and warnings where as other, lighter colours acted as relief. Examples can be when the colour red was used in the club scenes. Confrontation is always a possibility with eventual party-pooper 'Benny from the Bronx' when the club is the setting and this continuous threat acted nicely with the lighting, just as the red lighting in the strip club when Carlito sees his love interest working there, it has a sort of 'shock factor' to it as he feels confrontation with his own emotions and probably a little bit of a heart broken feeling, also.Whenever this red light crops up in the film, Carlito is facing danger and/or conflict with himself or others and it is threatening his American dream of moving to the Caribbean. Thus, the lighting signals where and when he'll have is conflicts along his journey to a retirement of some sort.The feel the film has to it is also very realistic. When Carlito is involved in an early shoot out in a bar, he is taking cover in the toilets and is genuinely concerned about the dangers that lie in the bar area waiting for him and although he doesn't realise he's already done the business, he treats the situation like it's critical; issuing threats, buying time and trying to think up a plan of escape even though there's no need.Al Pacino really pushes home his character in this film. We see the two sides of Carlito at numerous, well paced times and it's a real treat. The reformed, kind hearted Carlito is blended in very well with the once violent, ruthless, professional Carlito that ultimately got him into prison in the first place. This reminds us that there are two sides to him and alters our opinion on him throughout. The violent distractions that frustratingly pop up for Carlito act as a mental subplot in the film and they really add to the character and to the experience of the film.This is well directed, well thought out and well acted. The action scenes, shootouts, dialogue driven scenes and love interest scenes are all blended in very well and make for a superb, gritty action-crime drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see other comments in this section that go along the same lines and they are very close to what I feel about Carlito's Way. I remember the first time I watched Carlito's Way, aged 18, as one of the most cathartic experiences in my life. At the end, I was choking with emotion, my eyes were welling with tears and my trembling hands instinctively rose in the air and clapped, as I shouted "Bravo!", even if the rest of the auditorium were already grabbing their coats as if they had just watched any old movie. The infinite beauty of this romantic tragedy had left me gobsmacked and I just wanted to stay there and sit through the whole thing again, straight away. For weeks afterwards I became obsessed with the world of Carlito Brigante, with Al Pacino, with Brian De Palma (I also saw Scarface in that period, and it instantly became another of my all-time favourites). I had already loved movies before, but Carlito's Way cemented my love for cinema forever and made it into a passion. And ever after I saw Carlito's Way, I have been going to the cinema as often as I can, driven by the hope that another film will come along that can make me feel the same "high" as that unforgettable day. A handful have achieved it (Shawshank, Seven, 12 Monkeys, Cidade de Deus...), but Carlito will always stay in my mind as the film that discovered me the overwhelming power of what a roll of 35 mm celluloid tape can do to the human soul.</fullReview>

Immediately, I was drawn into the film. By the time the credits rolled by, I knew I had just witnessed the greatest film I had ever seen.What makes "Carlito's Way" such a great film is the fact that even though you know what is going to happen at the end, the movie makes you want to know how this character, Carlito Brigante, ends up where he does. And what a ride it is.Al Pacino is simply astonishing as Carlito Brigante, a reformed criminal who wants nothing more than to leave his old life behind and start anew. Sean Penn proves once again that he is one of the most effective actors working today in a role that not only sees him keeping pace with Pacino, but should have netted him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. John Leguizamo and Viggo Mortensen also deliver solid performances."Carlito's Way" is filled with scene after incredible scene, and line after incredible line; all of which lead up to one of the greatest finales in motion picture history. If you haven't seen it yet, run out and rent it immediately. This is the film that turned me into a movie lover. Sure, I have seen better films since then (not many, mind you), but "Carlito's Way" will forever remain my all time favourite.</fullReview>

Also, with a surprisingly good role from Sean Penn made this movie even better. We also see a young Luis Guzman.When I first saw this, I didn't know what to expect. I knew it was directed by the same director of Scarface and the front cover almost looks the same as Scarface. So, I rented it and was amazed at how good it was.

Brian De Palma is also in fine form here as he directs this movie seemingly without effort and with his usual unique (these days) style. The film is a seen as a sequel of sorts to Scarface, but saying that does Carlito's Way an injustice. Carlito's Way stands apart and on it's own very well. The world in this film is fascinating to behold, a bit of mob, a character wanting to reform, a love story and an action story. Also Pacino has a lot of nice sayings in this film. If Scarface is a 10 then Carlito's Way should be a 9. This film has been too underrated for far too long, it's time justice was done which is why I gave it the deserving 9 stars.

The director really cast this movie well with the unheard of at the time Viggo Mortensen only playing a bit part but doing it so well. The way Carlito narrates over the movie is magic and works really well.

The ending is very sad and "satisfying" at once. It's one of the best endings I have ever seen!Pacino gives a great performance as Carlito Brigante who wants to start a new life and try to get his big love back after he has served 5 years in prison and had a life full of crime, drugs and murder. He wants to open a car-rental business and needs money to start it. But he can't get out of the vicious circle of his old friends! The real star of the movie is Sean Penn, who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Brigantes perfidious lawyer David Kleinfeld. I must say all of the actors gave a great performance, especially Penelope Ann Miller as Gail! The cinematography is very well done. Especially the scene when he is in the bathroom, after his cousin gets killed and he shoots the 3 guys at the pool-table (which also is the DVD-cover)! Then, of course the magnificent ending/opening shot and another good example is the chase in the station! Overall I think this movie should get more attention because it is a masterpiece which shows Pacino in one of his strongest roles and DePalma at his best!! If you haven't seen it so far, then quickly buy/watch it...Highly recommended!!</fullReview>

What makes this film excellent is that all the pieces of the puzzle come together beautifully, great intense acting from Pacino, excellent directing and an excellent screenplay. To me, this was another 'Scarface'(different level of gangster), with one exception, that being the intensity of the character. We see Carlito now has plans for his life and is a thought out person in contrast to the crazy, uncontrollable and unsustainable Tony Montana he portrayed in Scarface. It's suspense all the way, and Sean Penn serves as a finishing touch as his faithful 'save your own ass' kind of guy. At just over 2hrs in length, this film kept me wanting more. The ending, is of course tragic and well defined but yet makes you feel so sorry for Carlito, after coming so close to reaching his ultimate dream of paradise, he was found short by the one thing he respected, that was friendship. Any Pacino fan out there, this is a MUST for their collection, along with 'Scarface' and 'Scent of a woman'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great crime/gangster film from DePalma, better than Scarface!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film was perfect in all ways. De palma is not my favorite, but he did a great job of combining drama and love into this gangster story. Pacino plays Carlito Brigante, a Puerto-Rican ex con who tries to stay away from the things that put him in jail, the drugs and violence of mafia life. Pacino is great in this role, loved his cool and suave aged acting, he really played this role well. Sean Penn was also good to see as his lawyer, David Kleinfeld. This film is great, one of the best of the early 90s, great atmosphere by de palma, nice script by David Koepp (jurassic park), and nice acting by pacino as well as supporting performances by Sean Penn, John Leguizamo and Luis Guzman, who were all great. Penelope Ann Miller was not bad, although not too powerful performance by her. The film is one of my favorites, a must-see for any pacino fan, or fan of the mafia genre. 10/10 #26 on my list of all-time favorite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much to say about this movie but there's a lot to see. Surely the best Pacino and De Palma movie. They managed to do a movie that is better than their "Scarface" (1983). "Carlito's Way" is the kind of film you watch more than a thousand times. Each time I see it, I like it more. Just take a chance and join this journey to the world of Carlito.</fullReview>

So much suspense in this movie you can't touch that remote. Great plot, acting, with an awesome plot twist at the end.

		<fullReview>Brian DePalma is such an experienced director, you'd think that he's the best in the business. Instead, a landslide majority of his films have been exercises in waste production. This one, however, projects DePalma in the way he SHOULD have been with his years of experience; it is fast, brilliant, excellently acted (the ONLY reason Pacino wasn't nominated for an Oscar in my opinion was the fact that he had won it the previous year...and what's with the Academy not nominating this for best picture? Ok, there was Schindler's List, but still...) and for once DePalma deserved an Oscar nomination for best direction. Pretty much a perfect movie.</fullReview>

The quality and drama of this movie surpasses that of even "Scarface", which was also directed by De Palma and starred Pacino. Penn's performance and totally unrecognizable appearance are mind blowing, and Pacino's sympathetic hitman, turned night club investor trying to go straight is one the actor's greatest achievements. In the field of mob/gangster films, this one is a true classic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito's way is an excellent film, definitely a masterwork of both Al Pacino and director Brian De Palma. I just saw this film for the first time last month when a friend of mine recommended it to me, Coincidentally the Special Edition had been released and it was only $16.88 at Wal Mart so I figured what the heck? I watched it and WOW! This film is probably one of the most under rated movies I've ever had the knowledge of. I've watched it at least 5 times since October 28th and it hasn't gotten even the least bit old or too familiar. Easily superior to Pacino and De Palma's earlier rendezvous "Scarface" in terms of wit, cast, and overall performance. The character of Carlito is like a more humanly motivated version of Tony Montanna, and a good guy somewhat compared to the vicious Montanna. Pacino has also gotten more comfortable with his role of a Puerto Rican character since Scarface also, this time his accent's way more convincing and one of the film's high points. Sean Penn also gives the performance of a career playing Carlito's two faced, coke head lawyer.This movie is a masterpiece, one of the top ten films I believe everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest redemption movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Palma, De Palma, De Palma. Although Brian is a brilliant director little lapses in foresight often stop 10 star movies gaining top marks. The first time I saw this movie I missed the first 10 minutes but caught on quickly, I was familiar with Gangster redemption tales and this seemed to fit in with those. The movie really captured me with the snooker 'trick shot' scene and for the rest of the film I was hooked. By the time I had reached the ending I had grown to care for Carlito Brigante immensely and was extremely tense in the getaway scene. Every close call i was rubbing sweat off my palms. I truly wanted this character to escape his inevitable(?) doom. At last I thought he had made it and was literally jumping for the air when the killer shock comes...Carlito is killed by a two-bit punk I had forgotten about 'Benny Blanco from the Bronx'. The shock hit me hard and I was deeply moved by Pacino's monologue. The credits rolled and I had been exhilarated and moved by this story ad would straight-away have given it 10 stars.However, last night I saw the movie was on and set a reminder, I saw the movie from the start...big mistake. The opening credits are a montage of shots from the end sequence, totally taking the shock away from the ending, moving the surprise from Carlito dying, to who killed him which makes the impact of the last scene seriously dampened. If you know from the start he does not make it you have lessened your enjoyment considerably.Never-the-less this movie is still must see despite De Palmas idiotic mistake of the opening credits his style remains and several shots are breathtaking. Pacino is at his usual best, one look with those eyes out-acts any Tom Hanks or Tom Cruise performance. Just cut the opening credits if you make a directors cut Brian...pleeeeeaaaassseee!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a suprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian De Palma isn't usually known for directing ganster movies with the exception of The Untouchables and Scarface. But when he does he hits the nail right on the head. Al Pacino has again blow my mind in this, the unofficial sequal to Scarface, as Carlito. A latin mobster who, from the help of his lawyer/best friend ( Sean Penn as trashy as usual) gets him out of jail on probation. For fear of going back to jail Carlito decides to buy a nigh club and turn his life around. He then meets up with an ex lover and a touching love story blossoms from this alright brilliant film. But trouble arises as Penn decides to help out a convict with a jail break and inlists in Carlito's help. Carlito then struggles with his conscience to help him decide to whether he should help his friend and risk jail again or let his friend down. What follows is one of the greatest, most touching endingds ever put on film. You become so attached to the Carlito character that by the end of the movie you will be feeling his ever emotion and the climax is sure to drop a few jaws and maybe even spread a few tears. This is just proof that Pacino is one of Americas greatest actors of our time and he will probably stay that way for years to come. Whether you are a fan of ganster movies, a fan of De Palma or a fan of Pacino you will not be let down by this movie that touches the brink of movie perfection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was thoroughly impressed with Carlito's Way. So far it is my favourite Brian De Palma film alongside Carrie and The Untouchables. De Palma's direction itself is terrific, while some of the set pieces such as the pool fight, the 15-minute subway chase and the shenanigans on the train-station escalator are among the best in any De Palma film.The cinematography is excellent, the lighting is used in an interesting way and the scenery and locations are striking. In short, the film looks good. The soundtrack drives the film very well too, the script is smart and funny and the story is ceaselessly compelling. The pace is spot on, and the acting is very good. Al Pacino gives a suitably restrained performance which was a refreshing change from his excessive performance in Scarface, while the supporting cast have plenty of time to enjoy themselves.In conclusion, a fine film. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito's way is Scarface's older brother...it's a movie with a similar theme and with the same director and lead actor. I believe Carlito's way to be as good as or even superior to Scarface. Pacino's performance is one of the best of his career but it's Sean Penn who proves with this he's worthy of his recently received Oscar. Carlito's way is deeper than Scarface, there isn't as much action but fans of the genre will still be satisfied. There's one scene in particular I consider to be one of the most memorable scenes in recent cinematic history. I'm of course not going to spoil it for the rest of you, but you'll immediately know what I mean when watching the movie.This is a must-see for every self-respecting crime movie-lover out there.

		<fullReview>At first, I really don't like gangster movies. However, after seeing "The Godfather" and recognized Al Pacino's performance, I tried to watch this. Then after, I realized that Al is a very good and versatile actor. Having a terrific plot and great story are the elements of this film. The characters involved are very good! I can honestly say that this is highly recommended like "Scarface".Al Pacino's character (Carlito Brigante) has sprung from prison on a legal technicality by his cocaine-addled attorney, former drug kingpin Carlito Brigante stuns the local underworld when he vows to go straight. Taking a job managing a glitzy, low-life nightclub, he tracks down his onetime girlfriend and rekindles their romance, promising he's changed for good. But Carlito's dream of going legitimate is undermined at every turn by murderous former cronies and even deadlier young thugs out to make a name for themselves. Ultimately, however, his most dangerous enemy is himself. Despite good intentions, Carlito's misguided loyalties and an outmoded code of "honor" will plunge him into a savage life-or-death battle against the relentless forces that refuse to let him go. So, what are you waiting for? Rent or buy a copy of this movie. You'll surely love it. I gave this a 10 rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino and Penn deliver a knockout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a scene midway through the film that really exemplifies why I think it is so good almost purely because of the acting. Penn, in the shape of a sleazy, lowlife lawyer wants to persuade Pacino, Carlito (a reformed gangster) to help in a jailbreak. The dialogue is not that great. The direction is good, albeit not noteworthy. Yet, what really makes it so good is the chemistry, the talent of Penn and Pacino together - they make their characters just that much more memorable, that scene just that bit more inviting and engaging and the film instead of being an above average gangster flick into something quite brilliant.The story is quite simple really. Carlito, a former Puerta Rican bad-ass wants to make good and start up a legitimate franchise renting cars. He remains trapped by his criminal instincts, his whole social circle is entrenched in immorality. The world seems different now, Carlito is now older, he needs to find a way out of the New York underworld before it kills him. He rekindles an old romance in the hope of starting a new, normal life.The characters in this film are unforgettable, although not always armed with the best dialogue De Palma gives Penn, Pacino and the rest of the cast enough opportunity to shine. By no one does no one element in this film deliver. Kleinfeld, is not just another lawyer, thanks to Penn he is now a vulnerable, moody cocaine addict. Carlito, is not just a merciless criminal, he is also a sensitive, varied character. De Palma manages to create individuals and individual moments that really cannot be easily erased from memory. The set design, and set pieces are were De Palma really comes into his own. There are many brilliant scenes in the disco, in nightclubs, in New York Central Station that belong to De Palma's best work.De Palma avoids the more showy and gauche tendencies of his direction to give us a truly great character study. There are so many scenes that really stay with you for awhile thereafter and the ending, though maybe not unexpected will definitely have you thinking and asking - why doesn't De Palma produce something this good ever again?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of both Al Pacino and Brian De Palma, and to have them both reunite after Scarface was an excellent move. I watched this movie only yesterday and i was amazed. The screenplay was amazing in this movie, as it gives the movie a tone of darkness throughout the film without being full of in-your-face violence. The directing by Brian De Palma was outstanding, and the chase sequence in the train station had my complete attention all the way. The acting by Al Pacino was as good as always, and Sean Penn gave an excellent performance as the coke-headed lawyer-turned-wiseguy. It was also interesting to see Viggo Mortensen as the crippled Lalin.Another interesting thing about this movie is that along with re-uniting director and actor from Scarface, it also features some of the actors from Scarface in minor cameo appearances, such as Hector from Scarface appears as Rolando, who is the man smoking a cigar at the beginning of the movie, who doesn't believe that Carlito retired.A must see movie for fans of Pacino or De Palma 10/10</fullReview>

The best scene had to be when Carlito goes back to his old street for the first time at an unrecognizable club with his cousin and realizes that he actually does not want to be involved with the drug dealing business ever again.

		<shortDescription>A gritty, worthy entertainment with two great performances, and an incredibly good ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ten years after "Scarface," a movie I didn't think was successful beyond Pacino's nearly perfect performance, De Palma made this film, returning to the gangster genre after one more outing, the more classical (and vastly overrated) "The Untouchables." This film is like that other Pacino film only superficially. It bears a closer resemblance to "Boogie Nights" or even "GoodFellas," though it has the epic quality of neither. Though the film is nearly two and-a-half hours, we don't feel as if we've been subjected to a long slog. The only slow moments in the film come in the more tender moments between Pacino and the girl.At the time, ten years ago, Pacino was still relevant, going on smoky tirades. Here, we see him enunciating his words like a cross between a Puerto Rican from Noo Yawk and a Southern Baptist minister preaching the gospel. He throws his voice around like a ventriloquist; he doesn't yell like he's known for now -- there are no blowup courtroom scenes here. (Actually, I'm lying. There is one at the very beginning, but it's fun, so don't worry.) And his voice-over narration never rises above a husky whisper. Most reviews I've seen have praised Pacino's work here, and they're right to. It's the opposite of something like "Scent of a Woman," a film I enjoyed, with a performance from Pacino that was terrific. Here, he's quieter, more soulful. (The beard was a big plus, somehow it makes him more huggable.)Carlito (Pacino) has just been sprung from jail by his lawyer, Kleinfeld (Penn), and after he picks up $25,000 during a tense drug exchange, he decides to go into a club business with Saso, who's got gambling debts, until he can get $75,000 and get out of the life for good. Penn, in wiry glasses and a Jewfro, with his down-turned nose plays Kleinfeld as a coke-sniffing tough-guy wannabe. We watch as Kleinfeld drifts from the lawful to the criminal; or more aptly, we see more and more of his character come to surface. One of Kleinfeld's clients at Riker's prison barge insists that Kleinfeld, who he believes ripped him off of a million bucks, bust him out of jail or be killed. Carlito stands by Kleinfeld throughout the film, even when he gets dumped on by the police, his girl, and even Kleinfeld himself for doing so.The supporting players are roundly interesting and well-played. In the first moments we meet a young up-and-comer Benny Blaco, and John Leguizamo plays him flamboyantly. Luis Guzmán plays one of Carlito's workers at the club. As Lalin, Viggo Mortensen makes a quick appearance -- probably helped along by Penn -- as a now-crippled, former suave heartbreaker turned into a sniveling embarrassment.But really, all the innovation here comes from Penn. Look at how slowly, how slyly his character evolves. It's really a wonder to get such growth in a film performance.The film is admittedly flawed. For instance, something simple like Carlito's ex-lover not instantly recognizing his very recognizable voice is unlikely. The entire secondary story with Carlito's ex-lover Gail could have been handled better, or another way. That's not to say she's completely useless: she provides the ending with a little oomph.The film is vicious, ruthless, and the emotions run high. There's a strange honesty throughout the film, too, mainly through the dialogue, that's sort of indescribable. Also, there's always a sense of humor here, like when "You Are So Beautiful" plays while Carlito reaches out for Gail through a chained door. (It's either humor or a really, really bad grab at sentiment.) When the song is played again over the closing credits, that time around there's an entire history attached to it, and it's played for sad irony.Ultimately, it's not a profound work, but it's a worthy entertainment. It's predictable, through to De Palma's credit he admits that even he knows this at the beginning of the film, with black and white images, a dreamy camera, and a sentimental score. In the film, De Palma's camera moves around, showing us what we're interested in taking a peek at, and it plays a pivotal role in building up the tension for an incredibly well-crafted climax at Grand Central Station, complete with an amazing, gliding, nearly floating tracking shot. The finale, the last twenty minutes or so, is some kind of masterpiece and definitely leaves you with a good aftertaste.***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a massive Scarface buff, I was excited when I finally rented this out. A gangster film staring Pacino and directed by De Palma was a sure thing, no?Indeed it was! As others have mentioned it is Scarface with "feelings" - feelings so strong that I will hapilly admit to welling up at the end. The action is still there in part, but Carlito's Way is a much more grounded and reflective film than Scarface - there are no 70 men gun fights, and Brigante manages to restrict himself to far fewer than the 500000000 odd F words that are spouted from Montanas lips.Although, nothing will ever top Scarface for me, this was deffinetly a worthwhile project and it goes down as one of my faverout films. One of Pacinos best.9.9/10. Nah'm sayin'?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of THE Greatest Gangster Movies of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since making his name for his role as Sonny in 1975's Dog Day Afternoon, Al Pacino has grown into of one the pre-eminent actors of his or any time. The Godfather trilogy, Scent of a Woman and Heat punctuate a golden filmography for the charismatic Puerto Rican, but it is in one of his lesser-known films, Carlito's Way, that Pacino gives one of his most impressive performances.Brian De Palma, who directed Pacino in Scarface, chooses to begin his film at the end, which allows him to use the eponymous Carlito himself as narrator. In the opening sequences we see Carlito released from jail on a technicality 5 years into a 25-year sentence for narcotics smuggling. He is intent on going straight, but a corrupt lawyer and his old drugs cronies among other elements stand in the way of his dream, an `escape to paradise.'Loyalty is the most profound theme the film explores, as Carlito's anachronistic code of honour and the resuming of his relationship with Miller, after a 5-year hiatus, dominate the picture.Carlito's Way is a film that will largely appeal to a male audience, as it explores a man's adjustment to a changed world, and his one-mindedness in attempting to escape that cruel world. That world, late-1970s New York, is well created in the picture, with an early disco soundtrack doing much to craft that setting. There is terrific range in De Palma's movie: the set-pieces are highly memorable, the script, adapted from two Edwin Torres novels very sharp, and Miller is adequate as the necessary love interest. Pacino is as charismatic as he ever has been, delivering his lines with characteristic flair.Carlito's personal narration, which gives the viewers insight into his hopes, fears, mistakes and dreams, ensures that Carlito's Way will have universal appeal. Excellent.***** (5 Stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome example of how a gangster film should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlito's Way is one of those films that just touches you after watching it. Not a typical gangster film. Pacino stamps his mark on this film in a role that can't help but be compared to his classic role as Michael Corleone, in both the first Godfather, and the final one. He plays Carlito Brigante, an old streetlord trying to go legitimate (sound familiar?). The basic storyline does no justice to this film though, for it is what lies beneath that really captures the imagination. The story develops into a complex, yet followable tale. The subplots intervene at perfect times. The overiding desire to become straight really is evident in Carlito's character. I still haven't caught my breath after this one. The end is unthinkable. It had the tell tale signs of being a very predictable finale, until the final twist.Pacino oozes street instinct right from the very first scene of trouble. This film was made for him, although his voice is rather annoying at the start of the film, until it becomes more familiar. If ever he came close to bettering Michael Corleone, it is this role.</fullReview>

I haven't ever seen a genuine gangster morican and I don't know if they even exist, but if they do, I think Al Pacino should be made an honorary member of their familytree. When the line :"You think your big time? You're gonna die big time! Are you ready? Here come the PAIN!" fly from Carlito's mouth, I felt shivers in my back.

		<fullReview>This film is an all-timer. It is among the best I could recommend, worth owning, rather than just renting, if you have a personal film library, this belongs in it. Al Pacino gives a tremendous performance, and is challenged by an equally strong Sean Penn. Penelope Ann Miller is cast perfectly as the woman Pacino loves, and would change his life for. A film about honor and loyalty, that wonderfully illustrates the cost of both. If you like suspense, this is for you, heartpounding and engrossing to the last detail. Boiled down to its essence, this is a story about a small time gangster, trying to break away from his past, and start a new life, but it is so much more. Four stars out of a possible four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the classic crime epics, a genre I personally can't get sick of. Brian de Palma does his best to stick to what he's good at and I won't say he's rehashing his previous work, but there are elements that keep returning. Dark night clubs, sordid back alleys, bad neighbourhoods, stereotypical gangsters and movie violence, we've dealt with it before. The obligatory central idea this time is that crime doesn't pay, as expressed through the tone of the narration, there's an undying sadness to it. Carlito Brigante tries to steer clear but it's simply no use, and though there are some moments when things are actually looking fairly good, you never really feel at ease. You're not supposed to. Al Pacino is a great actor, but it's Sean Penn who's really giving a once in a lifetime performance. His character doesn't fit into a category, he's just some really bad person. Sadly this film still has too much of a "more if the same" feel to it, it doesn't bring much new to the table. Of course it's still great, de Palma knows what he's doing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito's Way is basically the second installment of Scarface. For the most part, this movie is the follow up. Instead of the drug lord being killed, he decides to go legit. While on the road to going legit, Carlito(Pacino), find out that its harder than he thought to escape the person he was and the life he had previously led. After several run-ins with the law, drug gangs, and the mafia, Carlito is running out of time to achieve his final dream. This movie shows you Carlito's trials and tribulations on that road. A film VERY much like Scarface in almost every aspect, but more refined with less violence and vulgar language. Even for the most hardcore "gangsta" fans, you will enjoy the acting, dialog, and screen shots in this film. One of my all time favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching and moving gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlito's Way is a quite beautifully crafted piece of cinema. Through superb acting Al Pacino builds the character of Carlito Brigante in a way that the audience simply cannot help but become involved in his plight. Carlito is an ageing, former hood in New York, just released from prison with help from his illigitimate lawyer friend, Dave Kleinfeld. He is torn between his shady past and his longing to lead a normal life with his true love, Gail. Brigante takes us on a dangerously exhilerating ride as he juggles his past and present; loyalty and distrust; friends and enemies; and life and death. Sean Penn is excellent as Kleinfeld, De Palma's cinematography is superb and Pacino is as always, breathtakingly good. Anyone who watches this film should be touched by story and moved by Pacino's performance. It develops emotions in a similar way to films like American History X, Donnie Brasco, and The Hurricane. Great Film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film can be called "poetry"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is really unfair telling the story of the film, because it sounds so banal and familiar, that many viewers (including many critics) just skipped it. Otherwise I cant explain why this really magnificent film was most underrated.When I first saw this movie, I just knew that I want to see it again, immediately. I Saw it 3 Times in the theatre (a week interval between each other)and each time I was more and more convinced that this was the best film ever (I still think so 10 years after).What made me love this film so much is that it is much much better than its ingredients, which are praise for themselves. The story line is much complex, interesting and surprising than it sounds in the beginning. We know at the beginning how it ends, but the "story telling" is so delicious and thrilling that knowing the end just adds to our involvement with the protagonist. The acting of all the cast (Pacino, penn and Ann Miller, Guzman, Leugziamo and mortensen) is like Carlito says "Top drawer". The music scores and the seventies era illustrated in this film made me very nostalgic and allegic. The real hero of this film is De Palma. He seems to make this masterpiece effortlessly, combining great action and horror scenes (which he masters without a competition) with surprisingly tender and touching love scenes. It seems like he winks at us, as to say "If I wanted to, I could have bit Coppola or Scorsese in their playground without sweat"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest collaboration between Pacino and De Palma.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that should you bring it up in a conversation, a lot of people will not have seen. They may have heard of it, but you may get someone who doesn't even know that it exists. If you find it on television, it will be buried away at a graveyard slot and this is a shame as Carlito's Way is without doubt one of the finest crime films to grace the screen is undoubtedly the best collaboration between Al Pacino and Brian De Palma. I really like Scarface, it is a hugely enjoyable film, but if Scarface is more similar to a a bottle of beer, then Carlito's Way is more like a bottle of fine wine. It has a more graceful taste that less excessive taste goes down more easily. There is none of the excessiveness that punctuated Scarface. The production design is not as over the top, the violence is toned down a notch and the performance from Al Pacino is more restrained, bringing to mind his finest performances from the 1970's such as The Godfather Part I and II, Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico. Here he delivers a performance that undoubtedly deserved Oscar consideration, while De Palma proves there is more to him than just a stylish sensibility. Yes, there are many of his trademark directorial touches such as the prolonged suspense, the main action sequence taking place in a train station and frequent long takes where the camera continually moves and never stops. Truth is the story here is what makes this film so compelling, despite the foundations that it rests on being cliches from every other crime film that you will have ever seen.The character of Carlito is released from prison and is determined to go straight. We all know that this will never happen. He wants to set up a new life in the Bahamas operating a car rental agency. This will never happen. He wants to start this new life with the woman he loves. This too, we know, will never happen. What makes this film so brilliant is that De Palma decides not to treat the audience like idiots. The first image of the film is of Carlito being gunned down, lying on death's door in a train station. Immediately we know that this character is never going to escape and despite this De Palma still manages to squeeze every inch of suspense in the final moments. This makes the film one of the most moving that I have ever seen. We really grow to like this character to the point that we hope that he doesn't die in the final reel, but alas this is no fairy tale and no matter how hard he tries and how much we want him to, Carlito is doomed.Al Pacino's performance here is, and I cannot stress this enough, fantastic. He never shouts, never goes into blistering shouting mode, he delivers a performance of amazing restraint that one quickly realizes why he is always at the top of lists that deem him to be the finest actor working today. The supporting cast here also put in some great work. Sean Penn quite possibly puts in a career best performance as Carlito's lawyer, the character who is the real villain of the piece, while Penelope Anne Miller is luminous as Gail, the love of Carlito's life. The chemistry between both Miller and Pacino is superb and one really gains a sense of why they are willing to run away from it all at the end of the film.Behind the camera De Palma proves what a versatile and fantastic filmmaker he is. Forever doomed to be known as a director of Hitchcock tributes, he shows us what he is really like behind the camera, proving to his detractors that he can make material on his own merit. Unlike previous films he has made, you will be hard pressed to find homages to Hitchcock and Eisenstein films here. This is undoubtedly his finest picture and one that should have earned him a nomination for best director at the 1993 Academy Awards. Likewise Pacino and Miller. Amazingly Penn did get a much deserved award for his performance, amazing because for once the Academy did something right.On top of all this we have a fantastic music score from Patrick Doyle and one of the most moving death scenes in recent memory, if you have yet to see Carlito's Way, please do. It is quite simply a masterpiece.</fullReview>

The rest of the movie is just brilliant. Personally, I even prefer it to that other, better known, Brain De Palma/Al Pacino collaboration.

This is another brilliant movie made by one of the best directors of all time, Brian DePalma. I'm a big fan of his and that and Pacino lured me to this unforgettable movie.This is about a former gangster who has been released from prison after five years. He vows to stay clean and he reunites with his former girlfriend, Gail. However thanks to snotty, corrupted lawyer, that may not happen after all.The acting is fantastic. Pacino of course makes every film of his watchable. Sean Penn did a great job but I just hated his character.Overall, this is a classic gangster film. I think that more people should see this.

		<shortDescription>Flawed but underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The understandable temptation is to compare "Carlito's Way" with "Scarface"--Al Pacino as a Hispanic lead character embroiled gangster wars--but the two films are nothing alike in their approach. "Scarface" takes a definitive "shoot-em-up" line, while "Carlito's Way" is far more character-driven. And it is an excellent film, drawing us into the underworld as a closed system with its own set of rules and a society truly apart from "good old-fashioned mainstream American justice," so that we can sympathize with these characters despite their criminality.Some may find the romance scenes distracting. Graphic, certainly, but the addition of Penelope Ann Miller plays Gail extremely well opposite Pacino, and furthermore is a valuable addition to the cast for the way she fits into the theme. As a female character who walks the line between the beacon of moral light that is traditionally a woman in such a story and playing--in a woman's way--with the ambiguities of quick cash versus personal integrity, she helps Carlito to take a step back and think about the global implications of his struggle and his choices.Sean Penn's character was perhaps a bit more difficult for me to swallow: while the filmmakers went out of their way to foreshadow potential trouble, they failed to show much to indicate a deeply compromised internal character until almost right before the climax.As for the scene at Grand Central Terminal, what can I say? Cliché, perhaps, but extremely well-executed. The idea of having to catch the train and running up against that narrow wall of time and death when everything in your world is at stake is a nightmare I have dreamt many times over and easily kept me on the edge of the seat. (Incidently, I don't think I've ever made the train/plane before waking up, but neither can I recall actually missing it.)All-in-all, good for a quick evening alone with some whiskey in a big city besides New York to make you think about going back to New York... almost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito Brigante (Pacino)is a Puerto Rican ex convict who got out of jail before the expected time because of his skillful but eccentric Jewish lawyer David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). With the firm conviction of staying out of trouble to avoid prison again, Carlito faces many enemies who want him back in the joint: other drug dealers, the district attorney Norwalk, and even his lawyer. He also bought a disco to collect $70.000 and leave to the "paradise" island of Bahamas with his beloved woman Gail. Based on a novel by Puerto Rican author Edwin Torres, the movie brings back to life the Spanish Bronx in the 70s brilliantly, with all its mafia, corruption, and action. Many of its characters are impressively complicated, like Charlie, Kleinfeld, Lalin Díaz (Viggo Mortensen), and dangerous capo Benny Blanco from the Bronx (John Leguizamo). A spectacle and a great work of art is waiting to be seen in "Carlito's Way".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino Plays A Different Type of Gangster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino has starred as a prominent gangster in several masterpieces: "Godfather" I, II, and III, as well as "Scarface", have shown his undisputed talent. In all four of them, Pacino played the mean and ruthless mobster, who dominates the street: Either as a skillful and much-feared "capo di capi" in the "Godfather" series, or as a talented, yet self-destructive, mobster who rises to the top (and then collapses) in "Scarface"."Carlito's Way" would seem to be a replica of the above successful formula, at first sight: Al Pacino is Carlito Brigante, a mobster who has just got out of jail with the help of his friend and lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Penn). However, this is where the similarities end. Whereas in all the above films Pacino is portrayed as a determined and unreformed criminal to the very end, Carlito is a very different type of guy: In fact, as soon as he is out, he has taken the brave decision to change path. He wants to give up his criminal ways, and become an honest citizen. To this end, he runs a bar, trying to collect some money so as to set up a car-rental business. However, although he has the wholehearted support of his girlfriend Gail (Miller) to this project, it is difficult to escape his past. Even his friend and lawyer, Kleinfeld, proves to be an obstacle to his road towards salvation.Brian De Palma has directed a great film, in which he portrays brilliantly the character of a man who agonizes to make a clean start, but encounters everywhere forces which push him back to his dark roots. Al Pacino is (again) great, while both Penelope Ann Miller and Sean Penn are very good as the two competing and opposite influences for Carlito."Carlito's Way" is less a crime film, and more a drama one, according to my opinion. The story is beautiful, and although the beginning of the film seems to give some hints, we do not know until the very end whether this man of good intentions managed to escape from his ghosts or not. Watch and find for yourselves! 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not being a film I would have went out of my way to see, I watched it on satellite way back in 1994. I don't know what made me sit down and watch, but it changed my film views forever. Now Carlito's Way is definitely one of my all time favourites. Being and underdog film I wasn't expecting much, but what I got was an excellent piece of writing, acting and directing melded together to form a modern masterpiece. Pacino and Penn were robbed of at least an Oscar nomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A CLASSIC AND ONE OF THE BEST...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...among the gangster movies.  You could compare it with a legends such as Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino. It may not be such a huge movie, but it got something else. A vivid love story. On one side a tough gangster and on the other side a fragile, yet a strong beauty. The question is: Could he make it...all the way to the happy end?Or a better question: Is it possible to make a gangster movie with a happy end? The biggest credit in this movie goes to Al Pacino, who was after Scarface, once more brilliant. I can't imagine anyone else who could do his role. And beside him, there was talented and beautiful Penelope Ann Miller, who was also the perfect pick. All in all, there isn't any bad acting in this movie...especially the Italian and Mexican gangsters were convincing. Carlito's Way remains one of my top 10 choices. Why? Great acting, (before mentioned) love story, tense action, great scenography (70's style), strong characters, good music, and something undescribable. Something, that made me watch this movie about 7 times, since it was released. And I never got bored.A strong 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, what a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this film it totally took my breath away. What an absolute classic that doesn't get the attention that it deserves. Pacino and Penn are both superb(as always), the script is fantastic, and De Palma's direction is as usual excelent (there are so many scenes that are so well filmed e.g when Penn is walking down and waiting outside the elevator to go to the garage, the first walkthrough scene of the nightclub, the scene on the boat etc.). Penelope Anne Miller puts in a surprisingly good performance as Carlito's lover who has always being displeased about his ways.What makes this film different from other gangster films(however this film is not strictly a gangster film) is that we actually feel sympathy for the characters, that they are not shown to be thorough 'bad guys'. We see Pacino trying his best to change his old ways).The final 20 minutes of the film will totally suspend you in absolute awe from an excitng chase on foot throgh to a devastating climax with great performances and direction all round.If you enjoyed Scarface, Goodfellas or Casino then this film is definately for you.***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito (Pacino), a legend on the block, tries in vain to go straight and escape with his girlfriend to the West Indies. But treachery and fate make sure his story can only have one end - a fact director De Palma plays well, keeping our attention for almost two-and-a-half hours, although we know Carlito won't be seeing any golden beaches. Showing panache not evident for a while, De Palma is rewarded with a top-notch performance from his star, who dominates the picture despite good support from Penn in particular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** "Carlito's Way" is a work of incredible filmmaking. It is not without its flaws... as has been stated, Penelope Ann Miller's acting skills are not the best in the world, and a few lines seemed a bit out of place to me, such as right at the end in the voice-over when Carlito says "Gail's gonna make a good mom." That didn't seem to fit the situation too well and sounded a bit corny to me, but no screenplay is perfect (American Beauty comes durned close, but that's another story).The sheer realism depicted in this film is enough to recommend it. Sean Penn gives the most brilliant performance of his career, in my opinion, and Pacino makes the Carlito character come to sparkling life (although he should have worked a bit more on the spanish accent -- he slips a few times and doesn't quite sound like a native, especially in the few lines where he actually speaks spanish).But these are minor quibbles. "Carlito's Way" gets better every time I see it, and that's enough to put the movie in my top ten list of favorites (I've seen hundreds and hundreds of films). "Casino" is excellent but too depressing to watch very often, "Goodfellas" is also excellent but is not repeatedly viewable like "Carlito's Way." Scenes like the one where Carlito is standing in the rain with a garbage can lid watching Gail dance, and the entire sequence towards the beginning when his cousin gets killed in a drug deal gone wrong, are just unforgettable. This movie is full of such unforgettable screen-burning scenes and brilliant lines. It's truly a feast for the eyes, ears and mind.If you haven't seen "Carlito's Way" yet and you appreciate the "neo-gangster" genre, you're missing out big time. If possible, see it on a big-screen TV, in the DVD format. The final scene where the "Paradise" poster comes alive and then fades to purple is just so moving, the colour needs to fill a whole room and reflect off all the windows and walls. The perfect closure to a true work of art.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is definitely under-rated. In a world that appreciates the likes of Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco and Scarface its difficult to see how this film manages to miss out on a place in crime film history.Carlito's Way plays upon the emotions of the viewer. It draws even the most harsh hearted watcher into hoping that Carlito - a character played brilliantly by Al Pacino - will succeed in his struggle against a society where the code of the streets that he grew up with has changed beyond all recognition.

		<shortDescription>Pacino At His Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the amazing Godfather series, Pacino has had a great career with films like Donnie Brasco, Heat and Scarface. But for me, this is, and always will be his greatest film. His performance is outstanding. I haven't yet seen Scarface but it comes highly recommended, and after this hit, I'm positive its very good. Sean Penn is also excellent, as is every other member of the cast including one of my favourite actors, John Leguizamo. His character, Benny, adds a little bit more to the works. The story is intriguing too. Hard ass gangster, Carlito tries to give up life on the street but his so called best friend and lawyer, keeps pulling him back down. His relationship with his ex girlfriend is nice and steady, and you get a real sense of their love for one another. Watch Carlito's Way because it is one of the greatest gangster films in movie history. Rating=5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito Brigante (Oscar-Winner:Al Pacino) is a former drug kingpin, who just got released from prison... thanks to his loyal powered attorney (Oscar-Winner:Sean Penn). Now Carlito is trying to live a life without crime and he's trying re-connect with his former girlfriend (Penelope Ann Miller) once again. But Carlito finds himself back to the old days of New York Underworld and he is also misguided by his former friends including his lawyer.Directed by Brian De Palma (Blow Out, Carrie, Mission to Mars) made an entertaining if trashy drama with an electrifying performance by Pacino. This movie has strong supporting performances by Penn, Miller, Luis Guzman, Viggo Mortensen, James Rehborn and John Leguizamo. De Palma truly makes this picture if it was made in the 1970's. De Palma certainly made this drama stylish, suspenseful and sometimes it's very funny.The Two Disc Ultimate Edition is from the "Gangsters:The Ultimate Film Collection". Disc One has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1). Disc Two has Deleted Scenes, an featurette with the filmmakers, an vintage featurette with the cast &amp; crew and more. "Carlito's Way" wasn't much of a success with film critics and especially at the box office but it went on to be an cult favorite on video. This feature is One of De Palma's best and his most entertaining movies. Don't miss it. Written by David Koepp (Bad Influence, Mission:Impossible, Secret Window). Panavision.

		<shortDescription>An Epic of a different sort...Pacino blows you away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlito's Way is sure to go down as one of Pacino's great accomplishments and another great accomplishment but gritty crime director Brian De Palma. The thing that surprised me about Carlito's Way was it's heart. Amidst it's action and drama, and gory scenes and foul language was some real emotion...a love story...a man determined to turn his life around but doesn't quite get to escape it all because of one wrong choice. Brilliantly cast, and brilliantly directed Carlito's Way is like an epic journey of this man's life. We are shown what he used to be through the eyes of those around him while we are shown the way he wants to be right now after being released from prison on a technicality. In essence De Palma shows us two completely different sides of the same man in the same picture...that's brilliance.What can you say about Al Pacino?? Does he truly ever do wrong?? Not in this film. His portrayal as the wanna-be changed Puerto Rican Drug Runner Carlito Brigante is brilliant...an iconic film character. He's a complete anti-hero by definition because he's the furthest thing from a hero but you truly want him to succeed in escaping his past and living life out with his girl. Pacino is such a versatile actor and this role gives him the range to show us every emotion possible. He is perfect for the role. Sean Penn (not one of my favorite actors) does a very good job in a barely recognizable role as Carlito's slimy, underworld attorney David Kleinfeld who Carlito feels great loyalty to as one of his only friends and for helping him get released from prison. Penn truly is slimy as Kleinfeld and you are in the position that everyone else in the film is in...you don't understand Carlito's loyalty to him that ultimately leads to his downfall. Penelope Ann Miller is the love of Brigante's life that he returns to and convinces her to leave with him and escape the life of crime. Miller and Pacino do have great chemistry together and even their sex scene is quite steamy and well filmed. Miller's role comes across as a little whiny and needy but perhaps that is the character. John Leguizamo plays a small but very vital role in the film as a local hood that runs drugs the same as Carlito did and idolizes Carlito until he gets the cold shoulder. Leguizamo is appropriately sleazy and bad and great for this role.Certainly shot with a gritty and nasty appearance of New York's underside. Shot from key locations including Grand Central Station the film is riveting and easily one of the great films of the nineties if not severely under appreciated. The film was based on a series of books and De Palma could have easily made it feel like we were missing a history of this man but you never feel that way. Instead you feel like you get to know him through the other people, and dealers and old friends and compare it to the new Carlito, desperate to escape. This is an absolute must see for fans of Pacino, De Palma or Crime drama in general. It's an absolute classic!! 8.5/10</fullReview>

There were many action filled scenes through out the film, however, the most exciting one was running through the subway cars and the shooting up of Grand Central Terminal on the escalators. Sean Penn(David Kleinfeld),"Up at the Villa,",2000, got what he deserved for being such a two timing friend of Carlito.

Excellent acting from Sean Penn, Luis Guzman, and Al Pacino, as always. Good directing from Brian De Palma, but not his best. Pacino plays his role superbly, but does nothing in this movie that we haven't seen him do before, except maybe speak with a Puerto Rican accent, not unlike Scarface's Cuban. Sean Penn did an excellent job with his role, considering he played a very unusual part, which proves that he is a very talented actor and can play all kinds of parts. Luis Guzman was a treat as well. Four stars out of five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are Legitimate Comparisons to Director Brian De Palma and Al Pacino Teaming Up in Scarface (1988). But the Tone of this one is Quite Different. It is a More Subtle and Personal De Palma at Work here and the Same is True of Pacino.The Movie has some Outstanding Directorial Flourishes. The Pool Room Scene and the Climax Stand Out and are Vintage De Palma. Sean Penn is a Repulsive and Despicable Contrast to Carlito and makes the Reformed and Retired Drug Dealer that more Sympathetic as do the Romantic Elements with Penelope Ann Miller as an Emotional Anchor. The Film Creates the Gaudy Setting of the Disco Era in the Minority Community with Music and Fashion Authenticity. Although the Scene at the Lawyer's Mansion has a Feel of De Palma in Overdrive and comes close to Parody while the rest of the Film does not.Overall this is Top Tier De Palma and Mid Tier Pacino and it all Works Splendidly. It is a Violent and Gritty Neo-Noir with its Splashes of Brilliance at Times Mesmerizing. The Director and its Stars have All done Better but this is a Fine Film. The Camera Work is also worth Mentioning and Adds some Surreal Sensibility to the Straight Forward Drama/Action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent And Stylish Gangster Classic. Brian De Palma,Al Pacino And Sean Penn At Their Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlito's Way is an Excellent and stylish Gangster classic that is filled with great direction,amazing acting,a wonderful script and a fantastic score and soundtrack. All of those combinations make Carlito's Way one of the greatest Gangster Films ever made and is Brian De Palma,Al Pacino and Sean Penn at their best.Based on the novels Carlito's Way and After Hours by Edwin Torres and set in New York City in 1975,Carlito's Way tells the story Carlito Brigante,(Al Pacino)a former drug dealer who after five years in prison has been released. While out of prison,Carlito wants to go straight and get out of the business and rekindle a relationship with his former girlfriend Gale(Penelope Ann Miller). But Carlito's efforts to go straight are interrupted when corrupt lawyer and friend Dave Kleinfeld(Sean Penn)as well as other associates and enemies who are trying bring Carlito back into his criminal lifestyle. Will Carlito keep trying to go straight and start a new life or go back to his old criminal life?Released in 1993,Carlito's Way did decent business at the Box Office but surprising received a lukewarm to mixed reception by film critics some of the criticisms was that Carlito's Way was too similar to the other Brian De Palma-Al Pacino Gangster classic Scarface. But overtime Carlito's Way gained a Cult Following thanks to Home Video and many television showings and is now seen as a one of the best Gangster films of all time and the praise is well deserved. Carlito's Way is Gangster classic that is amazing from beginning to end because while the storyline of Carlito's Way has been done before(i.e ex-convict trying to go straight)director Brian De Palma and Al Pacino bring something unique and creative to the film giving viewers a movie that is stylish and powerful,dark and tragic,romantic and beautiful as well as intense and thrilling. CW is a Film that is also rooted in the style and tradition of Film Noir with the gangsters,criminals and thugs are vicious and follow the rules and codes of the streets and the tone of the movie is gritty and dark. CW is also a Film Noir with the narration of the main character Carlito because with the narration we as the viewer are pulled into Carlito's mind and thoughts which are done almost like quiet whispers that are haunting and talks about the past and the present. While Carlito's Way is a Gangster film,De Palma has time to put in a few exciting and thrilling Action and Suspense sequences. De Palma knows how to film Action,suspense and thrills and De Palma is at the top of his game with CW because with each Action scene there is a great build up and a satisfying payoff and with Action scene there is attention to detail as well as amazing timing. The most memorable and explosive Action scene is the train station chase sequence which is directed like an Alfred Hitchcock scene and will also remind viewers of De Palma's classic train station scene in The Untouchables and if you loved the train station scene in The Untouchables you will the train station scene in this film. The character Carlito Brigante is great character because he is complex and has great depth and you will relate to him in wanting to go straight despite all of the things going on around him and we as the viewers are rooting for him to succeed and start a new life. While wanting to go straight Carlito still follows the rules of the streets but Carlito also follows his own rules and as you watch Carlito's Way you will see Carlito make great attempts to stay out of his old criminal life and while some of his friends and associates are trying make him go back to his old ways which makes Carlito sympathetic and tragic. The screenplay by David Koepp is fantastic and memorable,with Koepp giving the characters dialog that is gritty and tough matching the tone of the film. The ending of Carlito's Way is amazing.powerful and sad but it adds to the greatness and tragic feel of the movie. A powerful ending.The whole cast is great. Al Pacino is excellent and at his best as Carlito,with Pacino bringing grittiness,depth and intensity to the role. Sean Penn is brilliant as Kleinfeld,Carlito's friend and lawyer with. Penelope Ann Miller is terrific and beautiful as Gale,Carlito's girlfriend and love interest. John Leguizamo is fantastic as Benny Blanco,a hood from the Bronx. Ingrid Rogers is wonderful and sexy as Steffie,a club girl. Luis Guzman is outstanding as Pachanga,an old associate of Carlito's. Viggo Mortensen is great as Lalin,an old friend of Carlito's.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera bringing his usual visual style and tone to the film with zooms,close-ups with tracking and over head shots. Great direction,De Palma.The score by Patrick Doyle is amazing,powerful,tragic and intense matching every important scene in the movie. Terrific score,Doyle. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by The Bee Gees(You Should Be Dancing),The O'Jays(I Love Music,Back Stabbers),KC &amp; The Sunshine Band(Shake Shake Shake)Shake Your Booty,That's The Way(I Like It),LaBelle(Lady Marmalade),Joe Cocker(You Are So Beautiful),The Hues Corporation(Rock The Boat),Cheryl Lynn(Got To Be Real),Santana(Oye Como Va),Ed Terry(Disco Inferno,Rock Your Baby), and more. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Brian De Palma,Al Pacino,Sean Penn or films in general,I highly suggest you see Carlito's Way.an excellent and stylish Gangster classic that is Brian De Palma,Al Pacino and Sean Penn at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carlito the Pragmatic Gangster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DePalma's film is a masterpiece on many levels. For one, it is historically accurate to the letter. Carlito, a former smack peddler, is released from prison after a few years. When released, the drug business has changed. Cocaine, rather than heroine, is the drug of choice for most New Yorkers. It is more expensive and much more widely used than heroine. Before Cocaine, drug dealers were guys who operated on the fringes of society and catered to artists and musicians. In addition, Heroine was relatively cheap compared to Coke. This was the world Carlito was used to in the 50's and 60's. Yet he was somehow able to make a name for himself in this parched landscape through toughness, street smarts and pragmatism.Now released from prison, he finds out that the dope business changed while he was on the inside. Cocaine is easily available and in high demand. Drug users are now part of mainstream society. They include young professionals, politicians and athletes. As a result, drug dealers are not only able to make more money, they also become celebrities in their own right. This was so true about New York in the 1970's. Guys like Nikki Barnes made the cover of magazines because of Coke. It was ridiculous. Another important issue to point out is the escalating violence that results as well. Because Coke is more expensive, dealers are able to buy more guns from the windfall profits. DePalma does an excellent job incorporating this into a generation gap issue between Carlito and the newer criminals. Carlito is a killer and a thug. But he killed for survival. Perhaps his mothers death when he was young gave him more respect for human life or his generation as a whole valued life more than the new generation of gangsters. Carlito was born in a time when many people did not survive childhood. Some women still died during childbirth. World Wars also took the lives of many men. Since the new generation didn't experience death like he did, they value human life less. More guns in circulation feeds the beast of indifference. Pachanga said it best: "They shotgun you just to see you fly up in the air".Overall, a great movie with a tragic ending. The movie incorporates many themes about living a life of crime, changing social attitudes and capitalism. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Carlito Brigante</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlito's Way is a crime drama based on the novels Carlito's Way and After Hours by Judge Edwin Torres. The film adaptation was written by David Koepp. It stars Al Pacino and Sean Penn,together with Penelope Ann Miller, Luis Guzmán, John Leguizamo, and Viggo Mortensen in supporting roles. The story follows the life of Carlito Brigante after he is released from prison and vows to go straight and retire from criminal activities. However, unable to escape his past, he ends up being dragged into actions that got him imprisoned in the first place.The movie is narrated by Carlito himself, who explains his hopes, his strategies, and especially his mistakes. Brian De Palma directed the film.Carlito, a fabled heroin dealer, is released from prison after serving 5 years of a 30-year sentence. Tired and middle-aged, he wants out of the business as he has lost the juice for it?for the risks, the killing. It's the mid-'70s, the era of cocaine, fast sex, and disco glitz, and he takes a job running a dance club partially owned by his oldest and most trusted comrade, the coke-addled mob lawyer David Kleinfeld. Carlito's plan is to make some quick cash and move out of the country. But he is dragged down by his roots?by his hair-trigger survivor's instincts, honed while he was still a switchblade-wielding street kid, and by his loyalty to Kleinfeld, who tricks Carlito into helping him execute a mob hit.This film is one of the truly underrated films in the Brian De Palma and/or Al Pacino filmographies. It may have been unjustly derided and dismissed upon its theatrical debut during its year of release, but the it has received a cult following for many years now.The acting is great as the viewers are tickled by Sean Penn's weasely performance, Al Pacino's electric lead, or that crazy-cool chase through the NYC train station. Aside from its excellent performances,it has memorable moments, and some serious action and violent scenes. Overall,Carlito's Way is a smoother piece of filmmaking than Scarface, the only other picture De Palma has made with Pacino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tied With Scarface for Best Gangster Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a nice take on the Hispanic gangster community without Brian de Palma turning it into a Scarface reunion. Al did a great job in not making Carlito resemble Tony Montana at all. I read in an interview that it was actually Al who suggested that Carlito have a beard as to not make the movie seem like a Scarface sequel. I liked how there were some scenes where Al casually used Spanish slang that you would only know if you were Puerto Rican or heavily studied Puerto Rican slang (eg. mi pana (buddy) being tossed about during many of the scenes with other Spanish speakers). It was nice how a movie that was set in New York was actually filmed on location, and the last scene was a highlight on that. 10/10, will be buying this soon to add to my collection of favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Pacino does it "Carlito's Way" in this 1993 film, also starring Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller, John Leguizamo, with Adrian Pasdar and Viggo Mortensen in small roles. Directed by Brian de Palma, as others point out, it is inevitable to compare it to Scarface. However, each film deserves to stand on its own.Pacino here plays Carlito Brigante, an ex-drug lord who, when he gets out of prison, decides to go straight. The story is told in flashback. He needs $75,000 to buy into a car rental business with a friend of his in Florida. To get the money, he agrees to manage a sleazy nightclub. Well, going straight turns out to be not that easy. He has a cocaine-addicted lawyer (Sean Penn) with his own problems -- problems that affect Charlie (Carlito) negatively. Not to mention the fact that the people around him assume that he wants back in, when he doesn't. And he has to convince the girl he left behind (Miller) that he's changed and get her back into his life. It's all a big struggle.Truly excellent film with the usual de Palma violence, but the story is well told and the characters are fleshed out and interesting. Pacino is fantastic as a conflicted man who wants to help his friends but is determined to go straight. Sean Penn matches him in an excellent performance - these truly are two of our greatest actors. Penelope Ann Miller does a great job. Her character is in love with Charlie -- in fact, they're soulmates, but she can't bear to be around him if he hasn't gotten out of the life.A great script, fine direction, wonderful performances, a great soundtrack, great cinematography, a must see. Carlito's Way is suspenseful in spots, less violent than Scarface, and it's not as action-filled as Scarface because it also deals with a love story. Very compelling filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito's way is in my opinion among the 5 best gangster-movies ever made.Everything in this movie is perfect,the story is perfect,the direction of Brian De Palma is perfect and the acting is more than perfect.Actually Carlito's Way is one of the best movies ever made and surprisingly one of the most underrated ,taking into consideration the fact that this movie was not even nominated for a single damn Oscar!This movie has great amounts of suspense and of course a breathtaking rhythm.Al Pacino's as well as Sean Penn's acting is as i outlined above perfect,literally perfect.Al Pacino in the role of the Puerto Rican ex-drug lord and convict who just want to stay away from the drugs and the whole mafia thing,and Sean Penn in the role of the wanna be tough,lawyer respectively.To cut the long story short,Brian De Palma's Carlito's Way is one of the greatest movies of all time and maybe the greatest gangster-movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An array of great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bearded Al Pacino plays Carlito Brigante a briefly reformed gangster who finds himself pulled back into the criminal underworld.Based on Edwin Torres novels, David Koepp screenplay is well constructed and packed with terrific dialogue. No stranger to gangster flicks Brian De Palma holds the director rains and creates some great tension, notably the pool game scene and the boat segment with David Kleinfeld played by a dedicated and not quite recognisable Sean Penn. Penn's performance was justly nominated for a Golden Globe. Pacino puts on a convincing show and you really feel for the character and Carlito's struggles with his unsavoury past life and his attempt to rekindle a relationship with Gail (Penelope Ann Miller). John Leguizamo is excellent in his brief role as a fly new up and coming criminal Benny Blanco 'from the Bronx' and is a fitting contrast to Pacino's aged experienced gangster. There is an array of great performances from the supporting cast that includes a wheelchair bound Viggo Mortensen, club owner Jorge Porcel who play Saso 'used to be Ron' and right-hand man Luis Guzmán.While made in 1993 it's set in 1975, the 70's feel and some lingo is captured perfectly, the locations, the sound, the music, the clothes are all painstakingly recreated. There's drugs, shoot out's, double crossing and corruption. The story of Carlito and Al Pacino performance are simply captivating. Carlito's Way is one of the best gangster flicks made to date, it's certainly a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Most thing I like about Carlito's way is the weird mix between drama and subtle funny scene. I just can't help my self smiling looking at the guy who run after Carlito in the last scene at Grand Central, he acted like was into Hot shot or a Leslie Nielsen movie, and how about the Big fat guy who didn't even got the chance to shoot right not "one time" to Carlito right in front of him...And I must not forget the clock at grand central signing 11.17 and the 25 minutes passed without the 11.30 train have been left yet.I loved Al Pacino acting, simple and deep. Calm like and old and mature man and mean just in the right scene. Nothing over the top and mostly natural.Sean Penn did a great job, but still... a little more irony in his role have would give the character a spin up.Good job for Penelope as well in the role of the Al Pacino so long lover, caring and loving.About the Director of photography I agree with the idea of the big screen shot but some close up were a little "too much", better If they would have been left out in my opinion.Music... right for the genre, but sometimes it just didn't fit in, I guess something more could have be done on it as well, for instance, nothing comparing with the "taxi driver" soundtrack.So for a movie that pre load the Pulp Fiction break out, GOOD JOB! 8/10 is fare enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito's Way (1993, Dir. Brian De Palma) Finally released from prison, Carlito Brigante (Pacino) has vowed that he will not go back to the life he once had. His move to a new life isn't easy, as Carlito must resist every taunt and every opportunity back into his old lifestyle. He meets up with his old love, Gail (Ann Miller) who shows him the person he can be in a happy life, but his good friend and lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Penn) is having problems of his own and would love the help he could gain from the legend known as Carlito.Superb crime thriller which places Pacino further as one of the masters of this genre. The supporting cast, with a wonderful turn by Sean Penn, and the well written script keeps you hooked into the very end, with the want for more.There I am, sitting in jail, wondering where you are, what you're doing, who you're with. ?

		<fullReview>Being a big fan of Pacino and having been a reasonably big fan of DePalma's work i had high expectations for this one.It met them and maybe went that bit further with them as well , a nice surprise!. First off the story. Well it's brilliant ,simple idea/ideas that make up one fantastic movie. The role Pacino was given in this works for him well as did his portrayal of "Tony Montana" in Scarface.It has some decent narration which accompanies the storyline throughout the film and your gripped from the very start it throws you in at the deep end and that's what makes it the movie it is.It's good fun to watch and Penn's performance as Carlito's lawyer is truly amazing., He plays the part like no one else could have and is an interesting watch throughout the development of the story. One of the many highlights of the movie!.It really is a unique film it's not gonna be like a lot of other movies you've seen which gives it that fresh feel it's something new and different to the usual hum drum that is Hollywood movies.Of course as with any movie there are things that could have made it better although not that many of them come to head at this moment. Which only further proves the brilliance of this movie.One for fans of DePalma , Pacino or Penn and anyone who wants a break from the usual rubbish that gets passed off as "films" these days.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is priceless. Possibly because Pacino had an Oscar under his belt before it's release. It contains passionate acting,brilliant writing,and a "Scarface" tongue in cheek from director Brian DePalma...There are 4 people involved with "Scarface" that are involved with THIS film;maybe more. I was totally stunned by my Wife's comment in the theatre after the film when we saw it on it's release week while she was crying and reading the credits at the same time: "Who did Sean Penn play?"That's how good this film is.

		<fullReview>Having seen this movie so long after having heard many people go on about it, I would summarise that it's fair to say it definitely lived up to it's expectations. Al Pacino excels in his portrayal of the gangster-go-clean fella who can't break free because of his old companions and old life holding on to him, slowly trying to drag him back into a life of crime, risk and danger. Having personally experienced life on the streets, this film tells it as it is... straight up, and shows just how in the end no matter what you do, how much you make... it all comes back on you. This is an excellent film with great acting performances, which powerfully displays a message into your mind and leaves you thinking at the end. A must see for all.</fullReview>

(Why, oh WHY does she have to be a blonde?!?) Anyway, the irrepressible Pacino gets involved with the wrong people anyhow which ultimately causes him NOT to 'get his way'. "Benny from the Bronx" (Leguizamo) is one of those people. Sean Penn with a 'fro &amp; glasses is just too much! What a lawyer!

		<shortDescription>Very Well-Made, Yet Somewhat Formulaic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like there is a point in many directors' careers when they feel the need to try and recreate a former glory they once had. This attempt usually results in a not-so-glorious film. Scorsese did it when he tried to practically remake "GoodFellas" with "Casino", Coppola did it when he made "The Godfather Part III", and De Palma did it when he made "Carlito's Way"."Carlito's Way" is the story of Carlito Brigante (Pacino), a street gangster who is acquitted of a thirty-year sentence after just five years thanks to his weaselly lawyer (Penn). He then tries to make a legitimate life for himself by running a nightclub, but ties to his old friends sucks him unwillingly back into the criminal underworld.The film is incredibly well made. De Palma has become a masterful director by 1993, and he showcases his full talent in "Carlito's Way". Every shot is thought-out and followed-through excellently, resulting in a film with perfect direction that maintains an extremely coherent visual feel throughout its 140+ minute running time.So why only a B+? Well, the fact is that "Carlito's Way" is just not very original. There are multitudes of gangster films out there, and sometimes it's just hard for one to stand out. Also, as I stated earlier, De Palma is repeating himself. An ethnic gangster...a nightclub...Al Pacino...a life of sex, drugs, and violence...any of this ring a bell? Any of this sound suspiciously similar to Scarface (1983)? But all that aside, "Carlito's Way" is still a well made, thoroughly enjoyable crime film, and really, anything Al Pacino is involved in most likely warrants at least a viewing or two.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece...DePalma &amp; Pacino are solid...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great reunion picture brings back director Brian DePalma &amp; actor Al Pacino for the second time, following their epic gangster film "Scarface". While Scarface is more raw, stylish, and edgy, it seems to be trapped in it's own era of dated production. Carlito's Way comes across as a much more refreshing and polished effort. Though not a sequel to the first film, Carlito's Way puts together a good story all its own. The story-plot is similar to "King of NY", as a big name gangster returns to the streets after lengthy incarceration, balancing the police on one side and the underworld on the other. But that is where the similarity ends. Pacino plays Carlito Brigante, a "reformed" Puerto Rican hood just released from prison in 1975. He gets a second chance at life but soon becomes tangled in a tragic web spun by his previous reputation and one fatal decision. The movie has plenty of familiar faces; Sean Penn, Luis Guzman, Penelope A. Miller, John Leguizamo... This is one of those movies I instantly fell in love with after watching it for the first time back in '93. Carlito's Way is a solid film worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

Its a nice tale narrated in a beautiful manner.Pacino ( though he looks better without a beard) has once again played it to the galleries. The dialouges are good, the direction is perfect and the climax grips you. I guess Carlito;s way has all the ingredients to make a good flick. But i wonder why this movie does not make much of a mention like other Pacino flicks. Maybe, it was never marketed well.aaah!! Sean Penn looks different with his fuzzy hair and glasses. A truly gifted actor, but pales when Pacino is around. But i wonder how many more gangster flicks is Al Pacino going to do before he calls it a day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best gangster movie of 1935</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD****Whoever said they don't make them like they used to obviously never saw Brian de Palma's loving and totally non-ironic homage to the great Warner Brothers bullet ballets of yore. Al Pacino's Carlito - a good bad guy who wants to go straight but isn't allowed to ("Just when I'm trying to get out, they drag me back in!", as he said in Godfather III) - would have been a natural for the young James Cagney, much of whose exhilarating on-screen vitality Pacino shares. De Palma as usual devotes most of his attention and talent to the action set-pieces (especially the joltingly violent pool-room shoot-out and the tour-de-force chase sequence through Grand Central Station), not saving much for the sometimes very lazily handled bits that go in between, but gangster aficionados won't care about that.Tell you how good a movie this is: when Carlito Brigante got whacked in the final scene, the girl sitting next to me in the cinema gasped "Oh, no!" and nearly started crying. Not the most sophisticated reaction in the world, but a more telling guide to a film's powers of emotional engagement than 100 blase reviews in the New Yorker. If you're too smart to enjoy Carlito's Way, you're too smart.</fullReview>

After reading the comments people either like this film or say it is average, I personally think this film is brilliant, films made these days are so disapointing the majority of the time, but I can't describe how good this film. The story line was great and it was so tense in the last 20 minutes I was really into it and it's been a long time for me to care so much about the central character in a film. It all fell together so well. I just can't say enough good things about this film. Ofcourse there are flaws in the film slowdown in places but compared to a lot of films made to day I am willing to ignore this as at the heart of it all that matters is that it is entertaining, and this film certainly is.

		<fullReview>***Spoiler Territory***Al Pacino's gangster tour-de-force is solid, powerful, and poignant. "Calrlito's Way is perhaps "Scarface" with a heart, possibly Brian De Palma's unwitting masterpiece about the travails of a Puerto Rican ex-con, Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino), his dreams, and unsuccessful bid to stay straight.Replete with an abundance of "low-lifes," "Carlito's Way" drives dutifully towards arguably the best of tragic endings. Ethereal and emotionally moving, Pacino's voice-over narrative is mesmerizing and sad, resolved and accepting of his fate.Supporting players bubble nicely to the surface in this stew of villains--a virtual cauldron of profligate perdition--with Sean Penn creating the best of sleaze with his portrayal of dirt-bag and coward, Kleinfeld, attorney at law; while Luis Guzman's, Pachunga, melds nicely as the ethnic and upwardly-mobile betrayer.  Oh, yes, and Penelope Ann Miller shines too, especially in the last scene, her tears vainly flowing, as the sadness descends, and a surreal and deathly pall interminably envelops the masterpiece of the anti-hero, played so eloquently by Al Pacino: Carlito Brigante.</fullReview>

A basic summary of the movie is Al Pacino, Carlito gets out of prison after five years and is so delighted. That's why he vows to never sell drugs or anything else ever again. If you haven't seen the movie, you have got to see it. I suggest watching Scarface (1983), then watching Carlito's Way (1993).

This film is one of DePalma's best efforts, on par with Scarface. You really see classic DePalma in the last act, (his very Hitchcockian influenced direction) and I'm sure there's a director's cut of this film out there that would be even more entertaining to watch.

		<shortDescription>Tragic portrait of a gangster's life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sign of a truly great film is one that allows the audience to share in the life (however rocky) of its protagonist, no matter what kind of a character he is. CARLITO'S WAY is one such film.Al Pacino is Carlito "Charlie" Brigante, a former Cuban-American cocaine dealer who has paid his debt to society and now wants to start his life over. Things are complicated, however, after Charlie inherits a lavish nightclub. Soon he finds himself challenged by his Cuban rivals, as well as by some murderous Mafia mobsters. His attempt at going straight is finally thwarted when his lawyer (Sean Penn) gets him involved in settling a few scores.Penelope Ann Miller costars as Charlie's devoted Anglo girlfriend, and John Leguizamo has a memorable villain's role. But the real star is Pacino, who holds the audience's interest until the very end. Despite being violent, amoral, and occasionally treacherous, Charlie is actually quite sympathetic as the hero. The movie follows his entire wild lifestyle as he juggles his public image, his waning friendship with his lawyer, and the love of his girlfriend.All that aside, the best part of the movie comes at the very end. Charlie, a marked man, is hunted through a subway station by several Italian-Americans who will kill him on sight. What results is a well-executed, suspenseful action sequence that actually involves relatively little bloodshed and is just as riveting as any street fight or shoot-out.CARLITO'S WAY contains the requisite gangster violence and a bit of sensuality, but aside from that it is a stylish, touching crime drama that should appeal to almost anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Carlito's Way" we have as the centerpiece two of our generation's finest actors, Al Pacino and Sean Penn, and they hold down a solid story with first-rate direction and a strong supporting cast. This piece should take its place among "The Godfather," "Goodfellas" and "Donnie Brasco" as among the best crime movies of the past 30 years.De Palma brings us brute realism and a story that keeps us interested the whole 2 1/2 hours, with a strong, white-knuckle finale. And Penn, in his role as Pacino's sleazy lawyer/friend, is superb. A nice touch is the narration by Pacino, which is not overdone and adds another window to his character.My main complaint is the excessive foul language and gratuitous raunch.

		<fullReview>Based on novels by Edwin Torres, this heartfelt gangster flick makes for a fine sequel to Scarface - or at the very least a very welcome revisiting for Al Pacino and director Brian de Palma.David Koepp's script paints a picture of a mean New York, full of thuggish opportunists and snivelling cowards (Viggo Mortensen's slimy Lalin is a must-see for all Lord of the Rings fans wishing to see that actor's range). And at the centre of it all is Pacino's Puerto Rican Carlito: relocated, reinvigorated; reborn and going straight... or so he hopes.There's something undeniably tragic about Carlito's plight. It provides a lovely narrative goal; while lawyer and best friend David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) wilfully digs his way into a violent criminal world, Carlito wants out - and he wants to bring his stripper girlfriend Gail (a miscast Penelope Ann Miller) with him. Oliver Stone's wickedly cynical script for Scarface described a conceited monster; it's easier to warm to this redeemed version: still artful and egotistic, and yet blessed - or, as it happens, cursed - with a shrouded sense of morality.The representation of the relationship between Carlito and Gail is mawkish, but it's worth remembering that this is a portrait of broad strokes. De Palma has never been a stranger to melodrama - in fact, he fairly relishes it. Here he draws a memorable performance from Sean Penn, while his framing and movement are as dynamic and assured as ever. The pace is pulsating; Pacino's anti-hero is effortlessly sharp and angry; Patrick Doyle's music is aptly melodramatic; and the final burst for freedom - an expertly-staged, fifteen minute foot chase sequence - is pure cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there a bad Al Pacino performance? Maybe, but I don't recall seeing one. This was another great and gritty film with Pacino in the lead directed by Brian De Palma.The film also had superb performances by Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld: "f*ck you and your self-righteous code of the goddamn streets. Did it pull you out of a 30 year stint in only 5 years? No, it didn't, I did. Did it get you acquitted 4 f*cking times? No, it didn't, I did, so f*ck you, f*ck the streets, your whole goddamn world is this big, and there's only one rule, you save your own ass." And Penelope Ann Miller as Gail: Carlito: Hey lady, I know you. Gail: Buzz off. Carlito: Yeah, I know you, you used to go out with that good-looking guy, what was his name again? Oh yeah, Carlito Brigante. Gail: Charlie.As a bonus, we also get John Leguizamo, Luis Guzmán, and Ingrid Rogers getting f*cked in the bathroom in her first film.WOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far More Substance Than Scarface AND Good Fellas BOTH!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an underrated yet truly great film! The Brian De Palma-Martin Bregman-Al Pacino association sparks obvious comparisons to 1983's Scarface, their first collaboration - however 1993's CARLITO'S WAY is the richer film in so many important ways. It has so much subtext, emotion, delves far deeper into the mind and even the soul of its main character with the result that Carlito Brigante becomes someone you root for and care about - which was not necessarily true about Tony Montana, despite his gory end in "Scarface"...The name "Brigante" makes one who speaks French immediately think of "brigand" - a bandit from the gutter right there. The irony here is that it is the name of the reformed criminal and very much worthy human being that we wind up 100% behind in his hopeless quest for a brand new life... a future... and el paraiso.The romantic scenes were an oasis of bliss amidst the grisly world and tangled web that was weaving itself around Carlito as the movie unfolded (thanks to Carlito's crooked counselor but also, quite ironically too, thanks to Carlito's own willingness to reform and "be good"...) Verily, the romance with Gail (what a luminous -what else- performance by Penelope Ann Miller) is what humanizes this film. Whereas Scarface was soulless almost, cold and all about the underworld, this film has a soul and this romance is it. She is the angel who can lead the way to the dream of El Paraiso for Carlito - the sharpest contrast there could be; he dresses in black and she is blonde, with a porcelain complexion and ethereal almost! The problem is that she is not the only ethereal presence in the film, and the other one is a ghastly one that haunts him and will never go away until it destroys him. That ghost finds an eerie embodiment in "Benny Blanco" (another -of many reasons- to hate John Leguizamo; this role right here!) and Carlito will pay the price for sparing someone that could come back to haunt and hurt him... This unfortunate bit is my lone gripe against this masterpiece; but a happy ending would have cheapened this ode to the human frailty, probably...For, indeed, Carlito's Way has a message - and that message is that, no matter what we do, we cannot escape what we are - "our way"- and we are destined to follow the course of that until the end. No matter what our intentions are.The supporting cast is phenomenal here, Penelope Ann Miller and Sean Penn especially. Special mentions go to Luis Guzman and even one Viggo Mortensen, who is far from his Aragorn form here - which only proves that he has some range... He is no Pacino, but then again few are... or ever will be.Think of it: Al Pacino has played it all; here, he is the fallen one seeking redemption. And achieving it, though not in the happy ending formulaic way. This same splendid thespian has played the same type of role before - and none were quite alike! Each role has his unique feel and proper substance. Pacino even played the fallen angel who will never seek redemption and he was MORE than believable in that role as well! Truly, he is one of the GREAT ONES. And Penelope Ann Miller holds her own opposite this great thespian. Unlike what many have said, she was NOT miscast here. AT ALL. She hits every note she has to hit, in a truly luminous performance. I would say that she has the same attributes too; every role she undertakes, she gives it a new twist, even if only through some small, almost imperceptible nuances and nothing else, making it all, in the end, new and fresh. One has only to compare all of her previous roles - Gail is unique. And beautiful - not just to Carlito either. That old Joe Cocker song never found a better subject to "give it life" than this character right here.This film does leave us with a sad ending though - a lyrical one but one we were hoping not to see. Gail's fears and words come true in the end - and it is bitter irony to realize that we could have had the "happy ending" here only if Carlito had kept his "way" like it used to be - ruthless all the while through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of Mr. Pachino's best work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The recent viewing of this movie for the first time since it was released in the mid 90s confirmed my long held beliefs: this is some of Mr. Pachino's best work on film. But not only does he shine as Carlito, great performances from Penelope Ann Miller (his love interest) and Sean Penn (Carlito's lawyer) are masterfully directed by Brian De Palma in a credible tale of attempted redemption.In this gritty crime/gangster tale, Carlito is released from incarceration on a technicality, and thus begins his attempts to stay clean and legitimate after squandering a lifetime that had culminated with his 30 year sentence. His goal is simple: secure enough money to buy his way into a legitimate business venture. But achieving this is another story altogether. The journey we witness is walking a fine line in the old neighborhood, where he must compete with his reputation among both his peers and the up and coming thugs who have hustled their way into prominence since his conviction some five or so years earlier.Carlito proves to be a complex character with a solid understanding of both right and wrong, as well as very strong ambitions. These two traits are quite often opposed with one another, and it is in this conflict that De Palma brings out the best of Pachino. Somewhere along the way Carlito has won you to his cause, and despite the character flaws and set backs, you want to see him achieve his dream. But as the story unfolds, the stakes and risks are greater and his success seems less likely.What I especially enjoyed in this movie was the narration Pachino had of Carlito in many crucial or pivotal parts of the script. Unlike many of his more well known and recognized roles, where Pachino had long brooding scenes, it was left to our imagination to often times wonder what the character was thinking. In Carlito's Way we are offered a glimpse into that thought process, and it is quite rewarding indeed.Highly recommended. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent gangster film from the Scarface people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the excessive indulgences of Scarface, it was with an air of scepticism that some people awaited this reunion of director Brian De Palma and star Al Pacino. Were we in for another overlong wallow in extreme violence and foul language? Or was this to be a more accomplished offering? As it turns out, Carlito's Way is far superior to Scarface - a Grade-A gangster flick with pace, violence, humour and even some genuinely moving moments of loss and tragedy. Pacino plays the main character Carlito Brigante, a former gangster freshly released from jail. He proudly tells the judge that he is a reformed man, determined to see out the rest of his life as a law-abiding citizen. No-one believes him, of course, but astonishingly Carlito is telling the truth: he really is finished with the life of crime. However, the fates conspire to drag him back into the lifestyle he hoped to leave behind. His nephew gets him involved in a bar-room shootout; his lawyer solicits his help in springing a Mob boss from jail; a prosecution attorney is constantly trying to pin various little discrepancies onto him; a young new-hood-on-the-block wants to challenge Carlito's tough guy mantle; and so on. In the end, despite his best efforts, Carlito is pretty soon up to his neck in crime and killing. The film is a wonderful piece of story-telling, with characters who really make sense and who go through believable and fascinating changes and experiences. Carlito grows into an admirable and honest guy, and his later involvement with the "wrong" people is all the more powerful because of this. There are plenty of De Palma's trademark set-pieces, including a hilarious opening courtroom scene, the terrific bar-room sequence in which Carlito does a pool trick-shot to divert the bad guys, and an absolutely hair-raising chase sequence at New York's Grand Central Station which may very well be the most exciting ten minutes of film ever shot. Oh yes, and did I mention Sean Penn's extraordinary performance as a lawyer-gone-bad? On the whole, Carlito's Way is a triumph.... one of the best films of the '90s.</fullReview>

Back outside, he tries to get clean and have a fresh start at life, but soon his old friends and problems start cramming in around him... as his troubles pile up, Carlito walks towards an inevitable climax where he will have to deal with all his problems definitely to have a chance at peace with a woman he loves and carries his child...Carlito's Way is basically a journey of self-realisation: Carlito tries hard to chance his ways, but that might be harder than he thinks, as he lives by an old code of street honour that drags him unwillingly to problems...With some very fine performances from top actors of today, Carlito's Way is an outstanding movie with brains, heart and passion...One 10 out 10...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's too bad Carlito's Way is so underrated. Everybody seems to prefer Scarface but I found Carlito much better. Everything in this movie was perfect: The acting was excellent, the screenplay was great, and the direction was wonderful(The pursuit in the subway or the gunfight in the bar should be studied in all cinema schools). This film is so breath taking that I could watch it over and over in spite of its running time. I do think this is as good as classic mob movies like Goodfellas, The Godfather, Casino, or Hawks'Scarface. This is also a very moving flick. Each time I see the ending I cry, because it's so beautiful. Carlito's Way represents the sunset of the mob, like Unforgiven was the sunset of the West. Obviously, one of the best films of the 90s, if not the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino's Way (DVD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al is my favorite actor. (Almost) all his movies are among the best moments of cinema and "Carlito's Way" is among the lead. There, he has the support of an amazing director, Brian De Palma, thus their union is quite explosive, all the more they tell the impossible fate of a crime boss who repents.Watching his last moments are quite gripping, because you know that whatever his best efforts, his purest intention, he can't escape what it's waiting. Sure, it's a fantastic example of courage and bravery, but it's also the total opposite, the harshest reality, the saddest discouragement because you know that whatever you do, it won't be enough! For such a great character, it needed the best actor and Al gives it all: I never seen him so charismatic: silent and explosive, big heart and cold hate.. and what about his look: superb beard and fantastic wardrobe! A moment: his expression when he rejoices Gail! His face is really touched by the power of love! And don't forget De Palma! A great director is before all, an "eye" and De Palma doesn't need glasses! His camera is alive. You can feel her pulse and really share his vision.I can't compare it with "Scarface" having not yet watch it, but "Carlito" is really close to "Godfather III", the later having only a better score! So, for those who search for an illustration for "sticking with his principles", "never give up", or more generally who looks after a story about a great man or an unforgettable tragedy, stop and take a look at "Carlito's Way"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Say Hello To My Little Underrated Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pay no attention to the fact that Brian DePalma has made 37 movies and most of them are turds like Mission to Mars, or Bonfire of the Vanities. Brian DePalma's place at the table of great directors has been reserved ever since he made Carlito's Way.If you want to see a hell of a movie, see it. I used to think that Brian's only saving grace was Scarface, but Carlito's Way is even better. And I think even more of Pacino now. Want to see Luis Guzman in something early? You got him. Penelope Ann Miller? You got her. A bunch of serious hardass Italians that make The Sopranos look like a team from the Laugh-a-Lympics? You're covered. Sean Penn, as good as ever? Checkaroonie.It's a movie about Carlito Brigante, a con released from prison on a technicality, who tries as hard as he can to go straight. His friends aren't straight, his old neighborhood isn't straight, and surely his reputation is anything but straight. He tries really hard, and this is a tense movie, but it's also a beautiful movie. Pacino doesn't overdo this, and the score, the writing, and the supporting performances are top notch.So there's my recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly done crime flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is often seen as the follow up to Brian De Palma's Scarface, and while the films share a logical line of progression and the same director and star, they're not related really. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Scarface. That film has it's moments and a great powerful turn by Al Pacino; but it's also very messy, overlong and relies on it's good elements a bit too much. Carlito's Way suffers from some of the same problems that Scarface did; but on the whole, this is a much more assured, far better made and just generally superior crime flick. As mentioned, Al Pacino takes the lead role and is on fine form as the recently released criminal Carlito Brigante with the desire to go straight. Unlike most criminals, Carlito has realised that a life of crime is only going to lead him to an early grave, and has therefore decided to get out before it gets that far. However, things aren't so simple and when his lawyer friend David Kleinfeld who got him out of jail needs Carlito's help to get a client of his out of the can, it isn't long before Carlito realises that walking away is more difficult than it appears.I've never subscribed to the idea that Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors ever. He's good, but he chooses roles that are too similar far too often. This film sees him in another familiar place, but this time he brings more to the table than usual. The way that he bleakly reminisces is brilliant and this brooding performance is definitely one of his best. Al Pacino is the star of this film, but wrestling him for every scene they share is Sean Penn, who's on fine form! Penn gives life to the sleazy lawyer brilliantly, and it's impossible to watch this film and not absolutely hate his guts. The acting isn't what makes Carlito's Way what it is, however; it's the plot and style that do that. De Palma is well known for 'borrowing' from other directors, and a lot of this film feels like it could have been taken from an old crime movie. De Palma was at the height of his confidence with this film, and that is always evident. The plot is brilliantly thought-out, and it isn't too far away from truly great character pieces, the likes of William Shakespeare. The ironic ending being of particular note. Pacino's voice over gives the film it's final edge; it's haunting, the way that Carlito reflects upon his life of crime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Pacino plays Carlito Brigante, an ex-con who gets released from jail in 1970's New York City. He hopes to live an honest life, but his past unfortunately won't allow it. When he resists, things then get very ugly for everyone (to say the least).Pacino and Sean Penn (as his cocaine-addicted lawyer) are in their usual top-notch form, and Penelope Ann Miller adds an interesting spin as Carlito's legitimately living girlfriend trying to help him lead a straight life. While "Carlito's Way" may contain many of the things that one anticipates in a movie about criminal life, it always fulfills our expectations of what an A-list movie should be. Definitely one of Brian DePalma's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a simple story of a criminal who can't go straight, a man who can't change who he is, because of his past. Film also has a great performances by the whole cast. By Pacino that never lets us down in any of his performances. We have Sean Penn in a great part as Kleinfeld as he falls down the path of corruption that we hardly recognize him with big bald frizzy hair. Also some performances by Luis Guzman, John Lequizamo &amp; Viggo Mortensen in some their first parts. Guzman now get lots of the best supporting parts their are. Leguizamo is a great comedian &amp; serious actor with a career already. And Mortensen, that is one the best actors around.Directed by Brian de Palma ("Carrie"), this is one of the most realistic, and historic accurate pictures of life in New York City's urban jungle during the late 1970's/early 1980's. Brian De Palma had just come off a lukewarm reception for yet another Hitchcock homage, "Raising Cain" and was in need of a hit to appease the studios. And so, a re-teaming with Al Pacino in an effort to recreate the magic of "Scarface" made commercial sense. "Carlito's Way" was much more sombre in tone than the cinematic shotgun blast that is Scarface. It is a tragedy about how a criminal tries to go straight but is ultimately doomed from the get-go. Penelope Ann Miller ("Adventures in Babysitting" is great as Brigante's love interest, and Luis Guzman always is a scene-stealer playing Pacino's right-hand man. "Carlito's Way" is a fantastic film that is sad in a sense, but states a sad truth. More-so, this is just fantastic entertainment pulled off by a superb performance from Pacino, and a great director Brian de Palma.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

In Carlito's Way, Palma shows just how well he and Pacino work together. It's a story of a former crime boss that really only just wants the simple life, but in short gets caught up in his lawyer's business and gets shot by John Leguizamo. Poor guy. No but seriously, Pacino acts his ass off in this movie, at first viewing this was my first look at Al Pacino, so It really set the bar for me to what this cinema legend was capable of.

		<shortDescription>The flip side of "Scarface", and perhaps Brian De Palma's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ten years after "Scarface", Brian De Palma and Al Pacino reteamed for another gangster tale; this time the title character that Pacino plays is older, wiser and more mature, and so is the director himself. De Palma remains a master of visual storytelling, creating moments of pure cinema (the climactic foot chase in Grand Central Station is a classic sequence), as the camera smoothly glides, swoops and tracks the characters. But this time, and this is often not the case in De Palma's films, the style is completely at the service of the story, which is an ironic tale of second chances, dreams, betrayal, and fate. Has there ever been a more emotional De Palma movie? To quote Pauline Kael's review for his "Blow Out", "it's as if he finally understood what technique is for". Al Pacino is rock-solid in this role, but he gets almost overshadowed by Sean Penn's brilliant, chameleonic turn. It's a great film. ***1/2 out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A second gangster classic from De Palma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian de Palma scores once again with another gangster epic. Despite having a number of flaws, CARLITO'S WAY is still a very good film, chronicling as it does so the life of Al Pacino's gangster as he is released from prison and determined to go straight. But we've all heard that before... Okay, so this film is behind SCARFACE, which was one of the best gangster films ever, but for the '90s it's very good and stands up on its own amongst all the junk filling the shelves these days. De Palma adds in all his trademark homages to Hitchcock (especially in the last twenty minutes) and stylistic touches which make this film interesting and sometimes exciting to watch.Where it falls apart somewhat is in the dialogue scenes, especially in the added romance between Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller. The film's running time does feel excessive (2 hours 19 minutes) and a lot of these scenes are dragged out. Miller is miscast as Pacino's love interest, because she just isn't a very convincing actress. Thankfully these stodgy moments only account for a quarter of the film. For the rest of the time we're back in familiar territory. The cast is populated by seedy villains (John Leguizamo is a standout as a creep), and it's Sean Penn who really excels in an unrecognisable role as Pacino's crooked lawyer, a cokehead to boot. Penn is very good here, a real character you love to hate.Obviously, though, it's Pacino who stands head and shoulders above the rest of the cast, and he doesn't disappoint either. He portrays a character who is out of touch with the modern world, a romantic who is sometimes crooked, sometimes violent, but infinitely likable. The violent content to the film has been toned down a lot since SCARFACE, but there are still a couple of bloody moments to behold from de Palma's gory, glory days including a wince-inducing shot to the face. Where this film really excels is in the final twenty minutes, a lengthy chase scene. This sequence is taught, tense and totally thrilling, and easily the best part of the entire film.Okay, so there are numerous flaws; the voice-over seems unnecessary and intrusive, as if De Palma had watched GOODFELLAS one too many times, the whodunit aspect of the ending is easily guessable, and the running time is far too long and needs judicious trimming. But despite these factors, CARLITO'S WAY is still a cut above the rest, and prime viewing for gangster fans.</fullReview>

We really feel for the newly released Carlito (Pacino) evading a much six time longer sentence, owing it too much to scuzzy lawyer Kleinman (Penn), unsurpassable in this, bringing so much depth to a character, who just engrosses us from day one. It's a riveting performance with the fuzzy wuzzy, kind of Leo Sayer hair do. Pacino again brings another masterpiece of a performance, his way, like Carlito, who before his stint in prison, was the Puerto Rico bad arse drug lord. But here, he truly wants to go straight, trying to dodge the surrounding corrupt forces, trying to suck him back in, and won't foil his plan to make enough money, to take off with his reunited sweetheart Gail (Penelope Ann Miller, really sexy in this, and like Penn and Pacino, has a meaty character to work with. Carlito also has a real arch enemy lawyer, riding his tail, so wanting him back inside, where like one scene in it's starting, where Carlito theatrically, addresses the court, that makes a smarmy, with his victory, it's so much fun again where these two rivals, are back in the same room. The first dying scene, may'be we could of done without, as it would of been much more intriguingly suspenseful, especially nearing it's closing in a wonderfully orchestrated shootout scene, to see if Carlito was gonna beat em', but like we know in many other examples, that's rising a flimsy chance and desperate hope. Carlito's choices, about doing things his way, made sense to. The other shootout scene, much earlier, unconsciously for me, drew homage to the other but bloodier betrayal shootout + chainsaw slicing scene in the early part of Scarface. That's what it really felt like to me, in this reuniting of Pacino and De Palma reuniting pic, with a great beaty Cuban tune, accompanied. The script is really good, I must say, too, and Viggo Mortennsen's performance of a pathetic wheelchair bound ex con, Puerto Rican, who's wired up you could say, must claim mention. Also John Leguizamo as a new wannabe gangster, Benny Blanco, moving up, but not favored by Carlito, who reminds him of what he used to be, gives some of his best work, while truly creating a memorable bad mafia dude. C.W. is so enjoyable, it passes quite fast through it's 144 minute duration, but it's a film that must be seen, on all accounts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated Al Pacino movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not to say this movie has a low rating, but it usually gets over shadowed by awesome Al Pacino performances in more popular movie like Scarface and The Godfather, in my opinion, this movie should up in ranks with the best of his performances.I love this movie, because it has a great vibe, it has a different pace to it. Also, i really like Sean Penn, he had a supporting role in the movie too, and the combination of him and Al Pacino seemed fitting for this movie. It may be underrated, because it gets compared to Scarface a lot, Scarface is very different, since the story of Carlito's way is like an upside down plot of Scarface, in Scarface Tony Montana wants to be the greatest drug dealer in the world, here Carlito wants to completely cut himself out of the business and live a normal, happy life with his beloved woman. But as they say - you are married to the game. Once you are in, you are never getting out.Has some of the classic gangster/ crime movie gags, maybe with less violence, shows you that nobody can be trusted once it comes to business, money over everything etc. Nonetheless, if you like Al Pacino, this is a must watch, not saying it is his best performance ever, but it is decent enough!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of Al Pacino.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlito after spending several years in jail finally gets out and decides to never get involved with the mafia again. And it's not only because of legal reasons, but moral too. He wants to start over, become a better person. That proves not to be so easy, as he already starts to fail on the first day...Holy. S'hit. This movie is a f'ucking masterpiece. Rarely have I before seen such a heartbreakingly honest and involving movie or gotten so infatuated with a character that I got completely lost into the movie so much that it felt like real life. The dialogue is a fantastic mix of philosophy, heart and even a little tint of humor. Al Pacino and Sean Penn are both so incredible in their roles that it's hard to decide who's the better of them. The music is tremendous. And of course, how can I do this review without mentioning Brian De Palma's directing? There are lots of creative camera angles and the action (when it happens) is more intense than I've seen in any other movie. Gorgeous is what it is.Carlito is an ex-gangster who just wants to do the right thing at the same time as he finds it hard to fight against his gangster instincts and can snap anytime. Kleinfeld is a lawyer who used to live the perfect life but quickly screws it up more and more. And... he's nuts. He's out of his mind! Which means it's a perfect role for Penn, doesn't it?The love story between Carlito and Gail is beautiful and doesn't feel the least bit unnatural. The scenes between the two are very humane and among the more romantic parts of the movie. The chemistry is astonishing! Al Pacino and Penelope Anne Miller make for a wonderful screen couple.What really breaks this apart from all the other gangster flicks is its story. Where else do you find one where the main character doesn't want to be a gangster and enjoy the high life, but actually get out of the hellhole that it is? Carlito is unusually enough not somebody you think is cool but know is an asshole. He's somebody who regret his evil ways and wants to be a good person once and for all, THAT makes him cool.I was horrified and cried when it got to the ending! Oh man, this is such a feel-bad movie it's not even funny.If you love Scarface and Brian De Palma, you've GOT to see this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian De Palma's Carlito's Way is like a 90's version of his 80's cult classic Scarface (1983). Both star Al Pacino as the lead character who is a gangster from an ethnic minority group. Unlike Tony Montana, however, Carlito Brigante is tired of his life of crime and wants a way out. He is a former drug dealing gangster who tries to escape his past after being released early from jail on a technicality. He re-starts a relationship with a stripper who tries to keep him on the straight and narrow, while at the same time his sleazy lawyer slowly drags him back into crime. The action revolves around the Puerto Rican criminal underground in 70's New York.The film benefits from De Palma's stylised and technically accomplished direction, with some bravura set-pieces including a well-staged shoot-out in a pool hall and a pursuit scene in Grand Central Station which includes a highly impressive long single-take mobile camera shot. The film also benefits from fine acting from its two leads. Al Pacino gives a very measured performance as Carlito, a character with a lot more to him than gangster bravado, while Sean Penn may be even better as Dave Kleinfeld the sleazy lawyer; Penn also has to be given special mention for donning a truly eye-poppingly repulsive wig throughout ? now that is what I call suffering for your art! The disco era period detail is well delivered and adds another welcome aspect. If I had to criticise it would be to say that it is probably a bit overlong and could surely have told this story in a slightly more concise manner. But on the whole, this is an impressive bit of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is great. I'd like to compare it to "Donnie Brasco". Both are about gangs, both are Pacino-centric. Makes you think - which one is better? right off the bat you might say "Donnie" takes it. It has much more character study and interesting relationships, with the excellent Johnny Depp there, and the few comedic moments are gold. "Carlito's Way" doesn't have all that, it keeps things more simple, BUT, the simplicity does give the plot a more solid edge with more "sting" to it, also due to the better, if not ingenious, action scenes; Carlito's not just a (ex)gang leader, he's an assassin. Oh well, I can't really decide here - both are good. I will say tough, that I personally find both are way better than the popular "Heat". Sorry De Niro !Lastly, I must add, the more I see of Pacino, the more he becomes one of my favorite actors. Many are talented and can "steal the show", but Pacino doesn't just steal it', he practically MAKES the movie what it is. He's not just in the movie. He IS the movie. Now who can you say that about? Every movie with him in the center, is a strong movie. Even when he isn't screaming ! (;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They pull Al Pacino back in again in this film as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tragedy of Al Pacino's character Carlo Brigante is that after his shortened stretch in the joint he realizes there is a life out there beyond his gangster world and the mean streets of East Harlem. But Pacino only finds that out way too late. And like that other iconic Pacino character Michael Corleone he gets sucked right back in. In retrospect Pacino should have had a ticket for Florida waiting for him the New York minute he got out of prison.This would be a film totally dominated by Al Pacino had it not also been for the incredible performance of Sean Penn. If in fact Penn took the role only for the bread he certainly gave the movie-going public its money's worth when they paid to see Carlito's Way. I'm surprised that he was not given Oscar consideration.When a lot of money comes to Pacino and I won't reveal how, he buys into a nightclub with the intention of earning just enough money to set himself up in business in Florida. But in his way Pacino is a man of honor. He does owe his lawyer Penn big time. Penn in fact found a loop hole as good lawyers do and got Pacino sprung from a long rap. So when Penn asks for a favor, Pacino has to oblige.Penn is fascinated by the life the criminals he defends lead. The easy access to money and power and women have turned him into a pleasure maddened hedonist. Some other criminals he's been the attorney for Penn has not behaved honorably to put it mildly. He asks Pacino to help him cover up that fact though Pacino does not realize it at first. It's part of the undoing of both of them. The other part is the dismissive way he treats an up and coming gangster John Leguizamo. Think of Gregory Peck and how he treats Skip Homeier. in The Gunfighter.Penelope Ann Miller is a young dancer who is fascinated by Carlo Brigante and is drawn to him. For the audience she embodies us and our fascination. For Pacino she represents the good life he aspires to.In character development Carlo Brigante most resembles another of Pacino's iconic parts, that of Tony Montana. But classic film fans will recognize a strong resemblance to one of Humphrey Bogart's gangster roles in The Big Shot. If it were not for what Sean Penn gives us in Carlito's Way this would be strictly a personal Pacino work. Their scenes together in Carlito's Way are unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mood feels off, but a well put together film otherwise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Al Pacino played a certain other Southern gentleman in the movie Scarface, I believed he was from Cuba. In this movie he is supposed to be a Puerto Rican gangster, but frankly, what I see is an older white man who's trying to walk cool and he only looks whiter because of the black clothing and dark glasses he is wearing.The believability of characters suffers overall due to their actions and the mood that this movie picks. Al Pacino's character for example is charming to the max and never does anything evil or at least undeserved...for someone who is supposedly a hardened criminal. His love interest, and by extension their relationship, is not very believable. Not because they do not have chemistry, they do, but the story is such that she should hate him or at the very least have a very complicated attitude but instead it plays out like a fairytale.At one point in this movie during a heartfelt moment I started hearing high pitched touches on a piano, the kind of music you would hear in a romantic comedy.This light mood is strange because at times there is some pretty violent stuff happening.One of the best things about this movie, though it takes a while to pay off, is Sean Penn as the shady lawyer. This guy has some range. Seeing him as this nervous slithering pair of round glasses with curly hair is amazing, considering the other roles he has played.The storyline is largely transparent. A criminal is trying to retire and that does not want to work. It's another gangster movie.But it is an entertaining gangster movie. It flows well. It has a style it is sticking with. It is well shot. It is like a shiny 80s blues or jazz record. It is a bright gangster movie if there is such a thing and it grows on you towards the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Pacino is always good at gangster movies. This is one of his good movies. Romantic, emotional and subject full. A gangster trying to get out of his dark world, but find no ways. Overall an interesting movie. Specially the most interesting part of the movie is the last 20 minutes. Suspense about the unknown ending. All performed the best. I think this movie is underrated. It is some how classic, may be that is the reason. Sean Penn's character was also very interesting, a lawyer who becomes a gangster. But Al Pacino says "Not taught at school and No beginning at late." John Leguizamo also performed well. Penelope Ann Miller was very beautiful. Overall Nice Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1975 NYC. Puerto Rican Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) is released after 5 years in prison when the evidence against him is thrown out. He claims to be reborn and dreams of buying into a car rental business for $75k in the Bahamas. Dave Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) is his lawyer. Dave wants to buy a club and have Carlito run it. His cousin Guajiro drags him to a drug deal but it all goes wrong. Guajiro is killed and Carlito escapes with the money which he uses to buy into the club. He is still in love with his ex Gail (Penelope Ann Miller). Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo) is a young gangster who feels slighted by Carlito. Meanwhile Dave is in trouble after stealing his client's $1 million payoff money.Director Brian De Palma reunites with Al Pacino in a gangster story. The problem is that it feels very familiar but it doesn't really measure up to past glory. It also seems like De Palma is retreating after a couple of missteps. On its own, this is a good solid gangster movie but it's not the best of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard to admit that it is SEAN PENN himself because I have seen Gangster Squad first and then this movie. And the way Sean's character turned from being innocent to a bad guy with no faithful or loyal feelings for others is, how to say, hard to do but shown that it is possible. And something to learn is the way Al Pacino's character reacts in stressful situations,notice his eyes never gives away anything even in tense situations. Also the heroine's act is very good. There have been some similarities with Scarface, but as the movie is based on a Porto Rican we can't really blame. (There are few recurring characters from Scarface movie) Watch it. You will not be bored. Instead you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How this movie was never nominated, and more specifically why Pacino was not nominated for an absolutely BRILLIANT performance in this movie is beyond comprehension. Carlito's Way is a DePalma/Pacimo Masterpiece! There is not a flaw in this gangster driven film. It is it all. It shows how even a hardened criminal has a human quality and is capable of loving his girlfriend and remaining loyal to the "code of the streets". I am actually not a huge fan of Sean Penn and he was even hesitant to do this film. With that said, I thought it was a perfect casting. He played the 'nervous jew lawyer' brilliantly. I liked that they had a couple of holdovers (from Scarface) in the film to 'keep it real' yet introducing new quality blood to it such as: Penelope Ann Miller and Viggo Mortensen. If you have not seen this film, shame on you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Familiar, but Still Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlito's Way is basically the thematic and stylistic sequel to Scarface. Not only does the film have a very similar aesthetic look to Scarface, the film basically tells the inverse story of that film, what if he tried to change? Scarface was about a man who thought he had it all and overestimated his own intelligence and luck which ultimately led to his downfall whereas Carlito's Way is about a man KNOWING that he can't survive in the violent world of crime and trying to escape it.Al Pacino plays a Puerto Rican ex-con named Carlito Brigade who gets out of prison after serving five years of a thirty-year sentence due to technicalities with the help of his lawyer, David Kleinfeld(played by Sean Penn) in 1975 New York Spanish Harlem. Carlito tries his best to stay away from his past life of dealing drugs so he works at a nightclub to make enough money to retire in the Caribbean. But sooner or later, Carlito is dragged back into a life of crime, murder, and betrayal.Carlito's Way is certainly not a bad film. It has some good performances, the direction is great, the cinematography is often beautiful to look at, and the film is entertaining from start to finish. But what makes the film good but not great is its familiarity. Not only does the film feel exactly like Scarface, the story just feels very familiar. It's the classic story of a criminal trying to redeem himself but the film never puts any interesting spins on the concept. It basically just boils down to him not wanting to be part of crime anymore, then he's forced to do a job for someone, then he's forced to use violence and break the law again. The film's story is never as engrossing as I wished it to be, because it just feels so familiar.But even though the story is a bit familiar, this is an undeniably well- made movie. For one thing, the direction is highly energetic. As usual, De Palma directs the film with a stylized feel that makes the film have a very larger-than-life, cinematic feel. It's as if De Palma KNOWS that it's just a movie and doesn't really care about realism and while a lot of people like to complain things that are "unrealistic" these days, I think De Palma's direction actually works in the film's favor. The emotions of every scene are always brought to the forefront with a somewhat melodramatic score by Patrick Doyle and some showy camera-work. Some may say this makes the film lack subtlety, but I think it makes the film much more entertaining than had if he went for a "realistic" approach.De Palma's direction really shines during the final chase sequence. The camera-work is incredibly fluid with an excellent use of long takes following Carlito around as he's being chased in the train station and the whole scene is flawlessly edited and incredibly suspenseful. Doyle's score adds to the tension as well. This scene alone, makes the whole film worth seeing at the cinemas.The cinematography by Stephen H. Burum does an excellent job conveying both the gritty, crime-ridden environment of Spanish Harlem and the high-end style nightclub where Carlito works. The scenes at the night look JUST like Scarface, with a disco, neon, purplish look to the whole thing. While this isn't a particularly challenging role for Pacino, he once again, does a good job and is a complete bada$$ the whole film. Penelope Ann Miller is OKAY in the role of Gail, Carlito's love interest, but I feel this role could've been given to a bajillion other actresses at the time. But for me, the biggest scene stealer is Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld. Penn is just great to watch as this coked-up, sleazy lawyer. He easily has the most energy out of everyone in the cast and is the most interesting character of the film. John Leguizamo is fun as a young, up-and-coming gangster not unlike Carlito in his early years.If there's any gripes I have with the film, outside of the fact that it feels too familiar, it'd be Carlito's downfall. While it's well-written for the most part, I feel his first act of violence in the film where he shoots up some drug dealers in a set-up deal his cousin brought him to, comes too soon in the film. Carlito just shoots them off and there's that, no repercussions whatsoever. Now there is something I like to this, which is how quick the violence escalates in the film. It keeps the pacing nice and brisk but at the same time, I feel his downfall would've had more impact if it was a straight-forward downward spiral. Instead of starting out peaceful, then violent for a bit, then back to peaceful a bit, and then back to violence.Overall, while Carlito's Way's story may feel a bit familiar, De Palma's direction, the performances, the cinematography, and the overall entertainment value still make for a decent film. As long as you don't expect the brilliance of Scarface, you'll enjoy it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Carlito's Way" is a superb film, lets start from this fact. It's not a "Scarface", it's totally different film, but i think one could not exist without another. When i think about "Carlito's Way" i think of it as a sequel to "Scarface", and ye i know it isn't, but lets just think for a minute, if Tony Montana would sent to jail, and he would be released after 5 years, i guess we would see it like it is in "Carlito's Way". I love this film. The tone of it. Everything, It's a sad story, and A.Pacino gives one of his strongest performances in not overacting, but for one you can feel, and root for, you truly believe that Carlito is on his way to a better life, and now he is a good person, who tries to escape the world that surrounds him. Everyone in this film gives a superb performances: Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller and Viggo Mortensen in his small but very memorable performance. This is a truly sad film, and every time i see this picture, i kinda start rooting for Carlito to succeed, and yet step by step, scene by scene, his fate is sealed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty, authentic and moving crime thriller that surpasses Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlitos Way (1993) marked the second cinematic collaboration of director Brian de Palma and Al Pacino, the first being Scarface (1983). As a result the films often draw many comparisons, especially since they are both stories concerning the rise and fall of two charismatic immigrant criminals, both trying desperately to live out their own contrasting visions of the American Dream. While Scarface is now quite rightly considered one of the finest gangster films of the 1980's, in '83 this was not the case. It was critically slammed on release, and its a testament to its ambitious approach to illustrating the drug trade, and Pacino's iconic, unforgettable, almost career-defining performance as Tony Montana, that it has earned such a massive cult following since. Carlito's Way, by comparison, is completely overlooked, and something of a forgotten gem. Pacino's character, Carlito Brigante, is infinitely more likable than the explosive, irrational and ultimately paranoid &amp; treacherous Montana. Its clear from one of the opening scenes in a courtroom, where Brigante is acquitted somewhat miraculously of all charges laid against him. He takes the opportunity to deliver a speech to the court, about how he is a reformed character and a changed man. Deep down he genuinely wants nothing more than to keep his head down, destroy his association with organised crime, and earn enough money in a straight job so he can move to the Caribbean. His lawyer and close friend played by Sean Penn, laughs at this suggestion. His character, by contrast, is a spineless coke-fuelled snake, who respects no-one and betrays Carlito's trust several times in the film. He continues to get on the wrong side of characters you should never cross, and Carlito repeatedly bails him out.Brigante is clearly very streetwise, with Pacino narrating much of the film in first person, and giving a fascinating insight into the mind of an ex-con, whose determined to go straight, despite the continued pressure from those around him, many of whom consider him something of a legend. There is not one scene in this film where the audience can consider him anything less than an genuine, honest, loyal and decent guy. Ironically, its Brigante's own morals and desire never to kill again that seal his fate. Later in the film, street justice is served ice cold, and his demise is as tragic as it is inevitable. Brian De Palmas unique cinematic style serves this film particularly well, with countless memorable tracking shots, the highlight of which has to be the railway station chase scene at the end. One of the most gripping, tense and suspenseful moments of any film I've ever seen.Carlitos Way is a long film, at almost 3 hours, but it passes by in a blur. No scene is too long or too unnecessary, they all serve to paint a vivid and convincing picture of the world these characters inhabit. In Brigante, Pacino portrays a character with dreams and ambitions, that to many seemed far fetched or even absurd, and that despite his honesty and loyalty, he is betrayed by almost everyone close to him, though ultimately he was still a good guy, who only wanted what was best for himself, his girlfriend and his unborn child. He wanted desperately to escape from the violent, cruel world in which he grew up, but it was a part of him, and he couldn't outrun his own past. In the final scene I was on the edge of my seat, praying Brigante would make it to the train, knowing deep in the back of my mind, that it wouldn't happen. In Scarface, the conclusion felt justified: Montana had betrayed people, he killed his best friend in cold blood, warped the innocent mind of his younger sister, and gets gunned down in his own mansion by a hit-squad, while 'high on his own supply.' Brigante, on the other hand, just didn't deserve it. It is simply the most moving ending to any film I have ever seen. I literally burst into tears. This is what makes the conclusion to this movie so devastating and powerful; it defies Hollywood convention. In spite of his past, and the errors of his ways, in the end the good guy dies. When he was so, so close to breaking free...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Direction Compliments Nicely to the Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under the careful direction of Brian De Palma written by David Koepp based on two novel by Edwin Torres, "Carlito's Way" tells the story of Puerto Rican criminal Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) who after being released from jail for five years from a thirty year sentence thank mainly to his committed lawyer friend Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) is now focusing on trying to live off that horrid past by going straight. Feeling grateful towards Kleinfeld for getting him off early, Kleinfeld tells him to open up a nightclub that runs properly in which Carlito gladly obliges. Carlito thinks this will pave his way toward his goal to run a car selling business in a warmer climate.Unfortunately, Carlito discovers that Kleinfeld is nothing more than an untrustworthy shyster. Carlito has to put up with an excited and enthusiastic urchin named Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo), who think he's some punk kid who toughness is just an act to blend in. Carlito seeks towards his old sweetheart Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) who has ambitions to become a ballet dancer, but is struggling to make ends meet as she lowers herself to stripping. There are a myriad of memorable scenes where Gail tries to persuade Carlito to get away from the people he's dealing with fearing that it could put him into serious trouble or at the very worst, death.I may have mentioned that Kleinfeld was a corrupt little weasel, but that was an understatement. He's also a coke-addict and a conniving thief, who finds himself in a precarious situation and depends on Carlito as a way to try to get him out. Feeling like he's going to regret this sooner or later, decides to help him out on account the Kleinfeld released him from jail earlier than expected. next thing you know the Italian mafia is on the hunt after Carlito and Kleinfeld. Carlito does everything to escape from their clutches and to prevent Gail from getting involved. From the opening scenes, this crime drama of a film has a tragedy subtly implanted in the script which adds more bravado to what the story is intended to be.Viggo Mortensen is in a small supporting role as Lalin, a once powerful leader of a Hispanic mob, is now reduced to cutting deals with the cops and is now confined to a wheelchair. Feeling like there's no point in living as he begs Carlito to kill him, Carlito, out of pity and reluctance decides to finish him off.The poetic and power themes of the story is quite sublime. It's not a mindless violent gangster movie, in fact, the violence is few and far between. Instead it focuses on how humans degrade themselves and how life on the streets has an impact towards individuals who simply just want to live in peace and harmony. There's one great tender scene where Carlito tells Gail about a moment when he was 13, he had a fight he wanted no part of, but had to defend himself because he had to in order to survive. It tells you what you must do to ensure you throw back what life throws at you.The performers were pretty much impressive as a whole. The strange thing was that the movie is centered around Latino characters, with the exceptions of Leguizamo and Luis Guzman, the rest of the performers were not of Latino extraction. Pacino, who's Italian has a funny scene where the Italian mafia actually mistook Carlito for being Italian because of his physical complexion. Penn looks greatly transformed as a Jewish lawyer complete with the curly frizzy hair. Mortensen, is not very convincing playing Hispanic. Makes you wonder, with a plethora of Latino performers, why didn't De Palma search widely for more Latino performers to play these characters? It would have been more realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Intense and Dramatic Film from Pacino and De Palma,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlitos Way is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast that deliver very dramatic performances.The movie is another great from director Brian De Palma and from Al Pacino,while it certainly isn't the best work if either of them,it still is a really great movie that is dramatic and intense.The character development of Carlito is extremely well written and also Sean Penn's character Kleinfeld,who starts off seeming like a very innocent character,but he changes a lot over the course of the movie.Carlitos Way is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good crime film.A criminal is determined to go straight but finds himself drawn back into the world he sought to escape.Best Performance: Al Pacino Worst Performance: Luis Guzman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Carlito's Way" My modest film review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another of Brian De Palma failures that have left him with little chance to reverse, falling totally in the collapse after "Mission To Mars", and this Pacino movie has emerged as a cult film. It's actually not so true this last statement: "Carlito's Way" is not so much a cult classic, simply because it is always overshadowed by her capricious sister "Scarface", but also due to the same reasoning is not completely forgotten because shares a similar geneticIf one compares, "Carlitos Way" is slightly better than "Scarface", but also has the usual De Palma serious problems (and we do not talk about Hitchcock imitations). But though this 1993 film is based on a book, has a striking eye to correct the errors of the film 1983. Al Pacino is much more controlled (however here also tends to overflow, to relax) and while sometimes falls into inertia, on the other hand is brilliant in the dramatic moments. Also, the relationship with Penelope Ann Miller is much more heartfelt, unlike the insipid and quasi-misogynist Tony Montana / Elvira connection. There is a sense of sophistication over Carlito Brigante, and even the soundtrack is much more current than the over-stylization of Giorgio Moroder, same with the aesthetic that is much less colorfulBut it is true that the argument does not click where it belongs. This is the story of a man who is redeemed, and could be taken two ways: become an existential crime drama ? la Woody Allen (highly unlikely), or be a Western transferred to mafia traditions. Instead deviates to casual reflections in the vein of "The Godfather 3" ("Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in"), and then continue as a bastion of "Scarface" in style and repeating many of its sins: again the flashy aesthetics in the disco, again the unimpressive criminals, again the ridiculous nicknames for the gangsters (here: "Saso"; "Pachanga"; "Lalin"), again the relentlessly repetition of the word "fuck" (the most punished is Sean Penn, who often repeated), again the mediocre actors. While "Carlito's Way" corrects some problems of the 1983 movie, in turn there are some pretty bad scenes: the pool scene is artificial, with Pacino went really placing the ball to give right on the target, with Pacino running so clumsy to the bathroom. It is certainly an achievement of direction and style, but it is less shocking than the chainsaw scene of "Scarface", plus it follows the same pattern: the pool scene, like the chainsaw, are disconnected from the film, with the sole purpose of generating a "Wow! " scene; plus we again find mafia scams who want to kill their main stockistsAnd like "Scarface 1983", the film is long, full of easily editable sequences: for example the appearance of Viggo Mortensen seems a desperate cameo for the actor to appear in the movie. The OFF voice of Pacino is good, although it is packed with some Pop psychology about urban life rather than a true reflection of his redemption. But despite the errors, the script and De Palma are responsible for a great moments. Pacino's relationship with Penelope Ann Miller is felt, even with some nonsense (Pacino goes to a home roof, with a trash can lid on his head to cover from the rain, watching his beloved) and the fact that De Palma costs to move to another instance (which makes the romance consume unnecessary minutes). For its part, the script adds sophistication to Carlito Brigante: this is a smart guy who knows the actions of the mob. Pacino performance in the drama is excellent: in the pool scene for example, Pacino's face in the first moments warns us that something is wrong here; and other scenes we can also discover more of his interpretation (when Penn appoints the boat in front of Miller). About style, De Palma sometimes tuned to "The Untouchables" and is generally pretty good, but suffers from excessive expressionism: Not all camera movements and angle distortions are subtle. However, in his honor point out the sequence of persecution in the terminal, which is even more tense than the defaulter tribute "Battleship Potemkin" in "The Untouchables"(Warning: Spoilers in this paragraph) And while the film is fairly good (even the non-gangster Carlito Brigante nature of his redemption can justify some numbers: eg supposedly prestigious and millionaires mobsters using only a few thugs, ahem), the film decides to commit a suicide in almost end. Just a bad end, and there are three main reasonsThis review continues on my personal Tumblr (Reviews and The City tumblr), which has no commercial purpose now</fullReview>

It's hard to do it well, but the creators made it very well.I could say without any overstatement, that it's in the top 10 all-time best gangster movies, I cannot see any problem with the movie.It has a lot of memorable scenes, it has some jokes, it's end very exciting, and heartbreaking, and it's not boring, for a minute, either.Furthermore, it's very strong in performances (Al Pacino, Sean Penn), directing (Brian De Palma), and screen writing (David Koepp), i think that it's the key of success.Who has seen this movie, that'll never forget it, simply brilliant. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CARLITO'S WAYI thought this was really good.The movie is about an ex con who gets released from prison and is determined to go straight. He is not interested in crime anymore. The problem is, he has got such a big reputation, that all the gangsters and criminals find him for advice, deals and help... some even want to kill him.The film stars Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller, John Leguizamo, Ingrid Rogers &amp; Luis Guzman.Everyone did a great job. Al is an amazing actor. He is over the top in some of his movies and there are scenes in this film where he is over the top too, but his performances always brings intensity. He is such an intense person and he can be a very scary person. But i think he is great! Sean Penn plays his lawyer... and at the beginning of the movie I felt he was a geek. Big curly hair, geeky glasses and he looks like he doesn't belong in the company of these gangsters... but as the film goes on he changes. The pressures of life gets to him and he can't handle it. His character has a hard time and i felt sorry for him towards the end of the film.I loved the action sequences. The gun fights and make-up were great. There was one scene where a guy gets shot in the face, it was so well shot. The way it was filmed made it look so real.It was a good crime drama/thriller... and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Al Pacino knows how to play a great gangster... and you can't help but feel sorry for him in this film because all he wants it to get out, but no matter what he does he just gets dragged back in.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino works his magic yet again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just love Brian De Palma films. They're just so good to watch and have the right mix of good dialogues and an appealing storyline to get the viewer hooked. Scarface and The Untouchables would serve as worthy examples to this fact, and now that I've watched it, I guess Carlito's Way does too. The film is an adaptation of Edwin Torres' novel "After Hours" which follows the story of ex-con/gangster/drug peddler Carlito Brigante (played by Al Pacino), who tries to shun away from a life of crime after being released from prison. Brigante had in actuality been serving a thirty-to-life sentence, which had gotten reduced to five years, owing to the influence his lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) had with the jury. Once out on the streets, Carlito pledges to live life the right way and reluctantly agrees to co-own a nightclub so that he can save just enough money to leave New York and start a car rental business. But inevitably, he's lured into crime once again, and how he fights the odds forms the rest of the plot.One thing that struck me as I watched the film was that everything was very direct. There is not really much for the audience to interpret. Each character is sketched out quite well at the beginning itself, and one kind of knows what he/she would tend to do under the given circumstances. For example, Sean Penn's character, David Kleinfeld is exposed as a corrupt lawyer, and subsequent events throughout the film show him as one, with all his shady dealings and money laundering activities coming back to haunt him. I liked this about the movie, because one is not left wondering what a particular scene means, or what that character was trying to say. Its all said and done. There. Take it or leave it. Of course, this kind of storytelling will not work in all situations, but here, it feels just right. Then there's that aura of the gangster about Carlito. In the beginning, he accompanies his cousin to a drug dealer's hangout for a transaction. As the scene develops, one can feel Carlito sensing that there's something amiss about the place. The tension is brilliantly captured by De Palma here and you can just feel Pacino getting into the skin of the gangster he's portraying. He knows exactly what's going to happen, he's prepared for it, and when it does happen, he knows what to do. This gut instinct comes to the fore in the latter half of the film as well and is part of the reason why this films works for me.There are a lot of scenes and characters which contribute to making the film what it is, such as John Leguizamo as "Benny Blanco" the young upstart who tries to get chummy with Carlito but fails, Gail, Carlito's former lover, with whom he rekindles his relationship and Luiz Guzman as "Pachanga", Carlito's right hand man. But to me, this one is Pacino all the way. He carries the film on his shoulders and commands respect in almost every frame. You can see that he's always in control and this again points to the direct nature of the storyline. The De Palma-Pacino-gangster plot combine gives rise to obvious comparisons with Scarface. But the two are so different. While Tony Montana is just a drug dealer, Carlito Brigante is much more than that. He's a larger than life personality with a heart, remorse, and a conscience. He believes he has a shot at redemption. Montana has none of this. He's arrogant, ruthless and has absolutely no feelings of guilt or regret. The differing nature of their characters make the two films widely different, thus making a comparison would just be a wasteful exercise. The climax sequence, shot at a railway station does bring back scenes reminiscent of The Untouchables, though the events that unfold in the two films are entirely different.Carlito's Way might have its share of flaws which may not put it in the league of gangster flicks such as Goodfellas or The Godfather movies, but it is still a classic, and a highly underrated one at that. De Palma himself is a hugely underrated director (It is a surprise to me how he hasn't won an Oscar yet), and this film just underlines his capability. This one's a must watch for all fans of mob films, but I think that at its very basic level, it's just a story about a man with a heart.</fullReview>

The characters were very well written and performed beautifully, especially from the less know (at the time) Vigo Mortensen and John Leguizamo.While this can be considered a "gangster movie", the love story of Carlito and Gale serve as the perfect motivation for the title character to escape the street life. This is much different than The Godfather.Overall, I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional film that may well be De Palma's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino stars as Carlito Brigante an ex drug trafficker getting out of prison and trying to settle in a new environment. Carlito is trying very hard to stay 'clean' but as often being said: 'You want to run away from your past but the past will not let you go'.Carlito is wiser now but he still carries with him a code of honor that unfortunately has long become dated. He does not recognize the new changes in the crime underworld of New York and fails to understand the new rules of the game. His new relationships with his old friend and lawyer David Kleinfeld (played by Sean Penn) and at a second level with former 'buddies' Saso (Jorge Porcel) and Lalin (Viggo Mortensen) show us that Carlito is not ahead of his game anymore. Carlito begins to understand this and tries hard to stay loyal to the only thing that connects him with his past self: the old love interest (Penelope Ann Miller) who has not forgotten him after all those years but at the same time does not appear to trust him anymore.I need not say more about this exceptional film that may well be De Palma's masterpiece. Al Pacino gives one of his best performances on screen. A 9.5/10 from me.ps. The shootout at the train station is extremely tense and despite being a remarkable technical achievement I do not think it adds that much to the movie. The strengths of the movie lie elsewhere.</fullReview>

Its was made the really great team of the director Brian De Palma and the best actors of our times Al Pacino and Sean Penn. In this movie there is very touching song "You are so Beautiful" by Joe Cocker and it's probably one of the best romantic song that I have ever heard. I first heard its in "Carlito's Way" and I listen its until today. Brian De Palma made a lot of great films, I'm delighted with "Scarface", "The Untouchables" and "Casualties of War" but "Carlito's Way" is that film that I will take with myself on a desert island because it's perfect example of flawless directing, excellent acting and really timeless movie. Every time when I re-watch this masterpiece I hope that final will be another, but... . I hate Benny Blanco from the Bronx!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Classic, Up there with the best of the gangster genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Better than Scarface. Rivaled only, in its genre, by the likes of Goodfellas and The Godfather.Carlito's Way runs counter to the orthodox in terms of classic 'gangster' movies. The focus is not on rising from the gutters and gaining reputation and status, as we may expect, but rather on redemption. Pacino plays Carlito Berganzi, a Puerto-Rican ex-con who is trying to avoid the seduction of the streets whilst raising enough money to get away from New York. De Palma's classic shows a love story with Carlito reuniting with his true love (Penelope Ann Miller) after 5 years, and subsequently aiming to redeem himself in her eyes. The lure of the streets is evident throughout, as well as Carlito 's pride and loyalties to his coke-addicted lawyer (Sean Penn). The movie contains frequent edge-of-the-seat action scenes and phenomenal pieces of acting throughout. It allows us to empathise with Carlito and believe that he is genuine in his reformed spirit. The casting is perfect and allows for a movie reminiscent of Scarface, with an added romance not dissimilar to Casablanca. A must see for anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked this one a lot better than Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a cinematic walk on the wild side of crime and drugs, Carlito's Way is both entertaining and challenging. The presence of Pacino make comparisons to Scarface inevitable, and Carlito's Way could actually be a kind of sequel, assuming Pacino got nabbed at the end of Scarface, got out after five years thanks to a technicality and decided to go straight. His hood friends and sleaze bag lawyer, however, make sure he gets sucked back into a life of not just crime but criminal intrigue, complete with double-crossing and murder. Scarface had a certain macho appeal to everything, but I always liked this one better. It's a more hard-boiled crime thriller, and less superficially pretty in its production design and cinematography. The criminal scheming has a greater complexity to it, and the mobster characters seem more desperate and closer to the edge. Scarface was played out in the big money high stakes world of the cocaine trade, but here the possibility of death by double cross seems to hang on the heels of everybody much more. Sean Penn's lawyer character, like any good movie villain, seems capable of anything, and drives the action by weaving schemes around one character and then another and having them double cross each other. This makes for an interestingly plotted movie as we follow one scheme after another, each trickier and more desperate than the last, some succeeding, others falling apart. The question is not whether it will all come down at the end, but rather who will manage to dodge the fallout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tragedy of Carlito Brigante ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1993 was a very interesting year for gangster films, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, the veteran (always rivaled) actors who define the genre like the Cagney and Robinson of their generation, starred in two films that are, in my opinion, pivotal in the evolution of the gangster genre, respectively "A Bronx Tale" and "Carlito's Way". These two films are less similar in their method than the overall approach which tends to depict the gangster lifestyle with the same seductive/destructive dimension than other classics, transcended by a psychological dimension. Whether it's between crime and family or crime and honesty, the main characters suffer from an intolerable contradiction, their souls are like trees whose branches try to reach the sky of a honest and decent life, while the roots are already poisoned by the devil.Al Pacino never collaborated with Scorsese but there's something very Scorsesian in Carlito's character, a man of principles, lured into his own demons while trying to defeat them. Carlito is surrounded by many characters who all sin by naivety or treachery, on the top of them, his lawyer, the crooked Kleinsfeld, Sean Penn in a performance that should have earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Role. The only oasis of purity in this ugly setting is Gail (Penelop Ann Miller) the woman he loved before and still love after jail. Things have changed for worse since he was released but Gail would remain pure to be the guiding light of Carlito's heart in his soul's darkness. But the weight of Carlito's past apparently prevents him from taking off for a brighter horizon. Brian De Palma, on the road again with Al Pacino, signs another gangster classic, working like a sort of revisionist version of "Scarface", less flashy and flamboyant, but with a depth so hypnotic it might have cost him the same iconic success of its glorious predecessor.Carlito is a Puerto-Rican criminal who spent five years in jail and through the help of the barely recognizable Sean Penn, got his ass out of jail before the end of sentence. The speech Carlito gives in the beginning has a sort of showiness which I always thought not to belong to such a serious character, but the more I think of it, the more I realize that this is the realistic enthusiastic reaction of a man who feels like being born again, having a new chance. This 'new chance' is the defining element of Carlito aka Charlie, a strong desire to go forward and turn the back on an obscure past. This is "Carlito's Way": look forward and never turn your back, the tragedy of his character is that the same mindset that would prevent him from committing a mistake will ultimately sign his own death warrant.Now, I wonder if I should mention that the review contains 'spoilers', is it spoiling the film to say that Carlito dies at the end? the film clearly opens with the scene where he's shot by an unknown face. Who did it? Why? These questions don't matter since it leaves no doubt about Carlito's fate (he got enough bullets not to make us expect a happy twist ending) The gravity of the opening credits contrasts with the joyful courtroom scene and Charlie's celebration of his victory over Law with Kleinsfeld, but it creates something powerful that a few movies managed to achieved: the tragedy. Carlito's story is a tragedy because the inevitability of his death is already painted in bloody letters implying that all his actions will ultimately be swept off by the wind of futility. If he's dead, it's because he didn't see it coming, and from someone who decided not to look behind, this is one of the likeliest things to happen."Dead-End" this is the French title of "Carlito's Way", and the word itself conveys the inevitability of Carlito's death, even his clothing, his dark hair and beard, and his leather jacket are the mark of a deadly presence watching him. Evolving in the 70's disco era, with all its flashiness and abundance of sex, drugs and violence, Carlito hardly gets incognito; a serious handicap for someone who just wants to finds his place. Carlito wants to make enough money to work for a friend in the Bahamas. Like in "Scarface" a criminal massacre plays a pivotal role as he finds enough money to invest from a drug deal incident which he's the only survivor, in both cases, we see the reality which Montana wanted to plunge in and Carlito wanted to leave. Carlito's way is a journey between two worlds trying to trap him, Law and Crime, with many obstacles, treacheries, and betrayals. But we end up realizing that Carlito's most dangerous enemy is Carlito.His torment can be compared to a sort of cat-and-mouse chase between two sides of his soul, culminating with the real cat-and-mouse chase sequence, which remains one of Brian De Palma's greatest contributions on the field of cinematic thrills. Now, should the movie have started with Carlito's death? I say 'yes' because otherwise, we would never stop complain about some of his unwise decisions, despite the way he justified them. The film is not about the tragedy but the reasons of this tragedy, reasons that make Carlito one of Al Pacino's most appealing characters. And if we have the feeling of being ahead of him all the time, feeling an imminent danger coming in that direction, we forget that the danger will always come from behind, and the irony is that he couldn't see it, because he was too busy walking, and sometimes running forward, but like in some of our most disturbing nightmares, he was also going backwards to finally meet his demise.This is the tragic aspect of "Carlito's Way" ? with the light of hope incarnated by Gail's pure figure and something of Carlito growing inside her ? well maybe the "Dead-End" title is misleading after all ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth A Watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novels Carlito's Way and After Hours, by Judge Edwin Torres, 'Carlito's Way', directed by master storyteller Brian De Palma and starring Acting Giant Al Pacino, is an under-rated film. This 1993 Crime-Drama, offers some really gripping &amp; well-written moments, that truly hold your attention. Even the Direction is perfect, and the Performances are first-class. If there something missing here, it's clearly it's popularity. Al Pacino stars Carlito Brigante, A Puerto-Rican ex-con, just released from prison, who, pledges to stay away from drugs and violence despite the pressure around him, and lead on to a better life outside of NYC. It's his journey. Carlito Brigante is an interesting person to lead 'Carlito's Way'. His journey comes in-tact with strong violence, usage of drugs &amp; blunt honesty. And cinematically, you try to understand Carlito, in this never-ending journey he has taken. It's a character, who despite a choosing a side, will again have to go the way, he just had left. It's a complicated, yet sympathetic character. David Koepp's Adapted Screenplay is mostly arresting &amp; gripping. However, the culmination comes across as half-baked. It leaves you in mixed emotions and even the impact is missing. Brian De Palma's Direction is perfect. He handles the story of this one-person, with utmost patience &amp; understanding. Cinematography is neat. Editing &amp; Art Design, are satisfactory. Performance-Wise: Pacino gives Carlito Brigante, a soul, with his match-less performance here. Sean Penn is terrific. He stands out. Penelope Ann Miller is impressive. John Leguizamo does well. Jorge Porcel &amp; James Rebhorn lend good support. On the whole, An Under-Rated Crime-Drama, That Deserves A Watch.</fullReview>

An absolute classic. A towering performance by Al Pacino. After this film he should be retired from acting to end a glorious carrier with The Masterpiece. Every great gangster movie has an obvious human drama. Carlito's Way has it.A beautiful love story, not finalized with an happy end, but this is what you expect from a brilliant script. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. De Palma took another risk by choosing Al Pacino, who was then going through a lean patch in his career, to play Carlito's part but what to say at the end...Wow...You did it Brian!

		<fullReview>I remember seeing parts of this film back in the nineties, but I think this is the first time I've seen it all the way through. This is a very decent gangster movie; I was impressed with both the performances of the main cast and the production. But more of that later, here's a short summary first (summary haters please wait in the car with Pachanga; we got some business to attend to?) Carlito Brigante has just got out of jail on a technicality. He was supposed to go down for thirty years, but thanks to the hard work of his lawyer, David Kleinfeld, he gets out in five. He vows that he will not return to his life of crime and intends to go straight from now on. This, as we discover, proves a little harder than Carlito at first thinks. Things have changed a lot on the streets in the five years he's been inside, but there are still some of his old associates about. Carlito has a plan, a plan that depends on him getting his hands on $75,000. The trouble is there are not very many legitimate ways to get your hands on that kind of cash. David Kleinfeld sets him up with a job, running a night club that he has a stake in and, at first, things seem to be running OK. He re-kindles the relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Gail, a dancer, and she is keen for him to go straight also. But then he is slowly dragged back into the world he is trying to escape by David and the colourful company he has dealings with. I will leave my summary there; don't want to give too much away.Although I found it a little long, I did enjoy this film. For the most part it is engaging and it is sometimes slightly unpredictable. Great cinematography and I thought the use of music was also very well done. Great performances from Al Pacino as Carlito 'Charlie' Brigante, Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld and Penelope Ann Miller as Gail. Honourable mentions must also go to, John Leguizamo as Benny Blanco, Ingrid Rogers as Steffie, Luis Guzmán as Pachanga and Viggo Mortensen as Lalin.As I've already said, I felt this film was a little too long. I also felt that a little too much was made of the love story between Carlito and Gail. I think that Pacino maybe isn't as convincing on screen as a romantic lead. But having said that, the love story does have its place at the send of the day. Quite an enjoyable film over all with some great performances? Recommended.My score: 7.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carlito's way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian De palma has both style and substance in his films. Undertones of scarface are buried under the surface in carlito's way. But to state that both are similar is idiotic. Tony was a rag to riches story while carlito stands on the complete opposite of the pole. Carlito a big timer, a figure who is known and after serving five years in prison, he wants to leave his past behind and to locate himself in a new location, away from all the crime. That the plot and being 145 minutes long, it good to enough to keep you hooked from start to finish.Al pacino does his typical gangster role but seeing that he delivers every time (past couple of years he been of his game )i have no problem seeing him act out the role. A huge amount of credit goes to him. While his past is kept secret, you know carlito has done so pretty bad things in his life, you know he used to be cold blooded killer not so long ago. but despite all this, you can't help but like him.I had mix feeling on the soundtrack. The club scenes, very familiar with Scarface, jointed well the songs but my worst gripe with it was during the Love scene. For a gangster film, i thought it was too corny.Another problem was with the final act. Nothing wrong with the cat and mouse scene, that was brilliant but it the fact that we all knew what was coming which ruined somewhat of the suspense for me. Plus, not to mention the predictable ending, in which, it was easy to know who was going to do it.Apart from that, this is a overall strong gangster film with fantastic acting. No doubt Al pacino made this role his own and with other strong actors such as Sean Penn staring, there not very much that could of gone wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful stylish gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlito's way is a master class for budding writers and directors of how to do an understated beautiful gangster film. For me the opening sequence sums it up; Carlito has just been shot and rather than high action and colossal amounts of blood we are given black and white, quiet and serenity. It feels like the camera never stops moving twisting and turning from Carlito's POV to the bystanders, this effect mimics the sick feeling of passing in and out of consciences incredibly well and at times is hard to watch. The nineteen-forte esquire Humphrey Bogart style voice over is the icing on the cake, it's not self-indulgent or corny, and it doesn't give away the rest of the film but wets the appetite for what is to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carlito's Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New York, 1975: A Puerto Rican criminal Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) is released from prison due to a technicality and announces his plans of going straight and leaving his old gangster life behind. Easier said than done: in his job of managing a night club there are plenty of old friends and enemies trying to pull him back into the shady side of life, and especially Carlito's long-time lawyer and friend David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) proves out to be dangerously unpredictable in the maze of temptations known as the nightlife of 1970s New York. Luckily Carlito's girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) is there to support him, even if she's unhappy about the hazards in his life.Director De Palma does a good job at portraying Carlito's world. The colourful lighting in the nightclubs, the long takes, tracking shots and Dutch angles are skilfully used and only occasionally become distracting from the story. Especially the final chase scenes in the subway and train station are also excitingly presented, even though the main focus of the film is not on action.The actors are generally good, especially the bearded Pacino in the lead role, but Sean Penn is convincing as the weasely lawyer Kleinfeld as well. The presence of Pacino also leads thoughts to the 1983 De Palma classic Scarface, as both deal with Hispanic figures in the American underworld and are quite lengthy and unhurried, even if the later film ultimately contents itself with a less epic style and Carlito Brigante is a much calmer character than Tony Montana. In short, Carlito's Way succeeds fairly well in bringing life to its characters and the technical direction is enjoyable to follow, so every crime film fan ought to give it a go ? De Palma fans won't be disappointed either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino rocks in this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the start this film looked promising and it sure was all the way through to the end. It is predictable that whatever Al Pacino stars in is going to be a masterpiece of some sort. Carlito's Way is another one of his masterpiece and what's even better is that Sean Penn costars and Brian De Palma directs this film as well. The beginning makes no sense at all but right from that moment as Al's character voice overs it just gives you a good masterpiece sort of feeling. Everyone should be grateful and privileged that they are seeing one of the best movies ever made. The dialog is fine and the story is interesting while some of the action scenes are smart and cool. Al Pacino is the best actor in this whole film because without him this film would be junk and should be avoided at all costs but thankfully Brian De Palma casted him. Sean Penn was good as well but his appearance looked hideous and made him look like a complete retarded lawyer. To put a long story short: Sean Penn could not give a better performance than Al Pacino. The real credit goes to the director, Brian De Palma. for creating this and without him all would be lost and watching this movie would be a waste of time. F*ck the Golden Globes for not giving Carlito's Way an award because this film is as good as Scarface and Good Fellas. The music is this film is pretty explosive and it really captures you at the end fight scene.Carlito, a Puerto-Rican drug boss, is out prison after serving five years all thanks to his lawyer friend David Klienfeld. He vows to stop his past from landing him in jail again but trouble starts following him and young druggies want to make a name for themselves. He becomes embroiled in something dangerous even for him and when things go bad he has to run away from some enemies. His old girlfriend gets back with him and together they have to make it out alive. A trail of deception always follows him. Cops and killers will be after him and he has to outwit them all and save himself.This film is not like how Scarface was, all blood and guts with no story, but this film is unique because it offers a great potential story with minimum amount of gore. You have to watch out for the fight sequences because they will blow you away and I mean really blow you away. This film does have flaws and one of them is the bad acting from Viggo Mortensen and he sucked bad because he didn't look like a gangster at all. Guess he was still a rookie back then. The other big flaw is Al Pacino's Puerto Rican accent which fails him completely to where he was born: America or Puerto Rico. Overall, this film doesn't disappoint but many people will be disappointed because this film tells the end before the beginning and they are right that it ruins the point of the film. Everyone should have a good time even though if it is a little bit slow or boring but wait until the end. Please! If you liked this film, I also recommend Good Fellas, Scarface, Casino, American Gangster, and Death Sentence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets the job done making mostly good decisions, and a few bad ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as Pacino movies go, this one is definitely above average. Adapted from the novels by Edwin Torres, Carlito's Way, may seem long to some, but it is a linear story that is bold and assertive, yet equally slick when it wants to be. So what exactly is the problem? How about the fact that the opening credits are over a montage with spoils the climax big time. I feel a little insulted. I guess in the end, it doesn't do severe damage. The climax is only moderately climactic, in part because it is spoiled....anyway.The curtain rises on a courtroom in session. Former New York drug king Carlito Brigante has gotten off the hook, thanks to a good lawyer. He is planning to go strait, raise a few thousand dollars, and start a car rental business, after getting back with his old gal (now a club dancer). One night however, his lawyer asks him to do a bloody favour, (actually he begs him). Carlito very unwilling to do so helps his friend, but things go south and suddenly Carlito is in danger again, from the cops. When they give him a chance to make good, does he take it or risk almost certain death by following his plan for the sake of his future with his girl.All in all, Carlito's Way does its job. It amounts to a entertaining New York crime tale: nicely shot, well acted and worth a look for the best of both Brian de Palma and Al Pacino</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very solid entry into the gangster genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very solid entry into the gangster section of your local video store, but not quite the greatness of Goodfellas or Godfather, nor quite the unabashed fun of De Palma's Scarface. The storyline is a little different than others, with Carlito (Pacino) legitimately attempting to go straight after a brief prison stint, but continually being dragged back into the business.The solid plot is supported by an excellent cast. Pacino is perfectly in his element, perhaps a version of Tony Montana who's had time to wise up. Sean Penn steals the show as his slimy lawyer/friend Kleinfeld. If you've played GTA Vice City, you know the character quite well. Penelope Ann Miller is very seductive as Carlito's long lost love. Also memorable is John Leguizamo's up-and-coming hothead. Viggo Mortensen takes the cake as a one-scene wonder, a wheelchair bound ex-gangster. Iin his short screen time gives by far the best performance of the movie.The end sequence is very harrowing, despite being one of those movies that shows the beginning first. Carlito gives periodical voiceovers, which are supposedly full of wisdom but just become tiresome after a while. They are perfectly reasonable introducing certain characters, but sometimes less is more.Carlito's Way isn't the best film of its genre, but it is plenty serviceable and very enjoyable. If you've seen all the big ones, this is a good choice to put next in the pecking order.</fullReview>

This has to be one of the best Pacino movies ever and feels a lot more personal and more of a character study then De Palma and Pacino's earlier Scarface. We basically follow Carlito Brigante trying to go legit after leaving jail. His lawyer Kleinfeld (Penn) draws him to disaster after they kill a gangster. Benny Blanco, a punk Carlito dislikes eventually kills Carlito. He hooks up with old flame Gail and we later find her in a strip club, (cue nude scene)! Anyway, this movie is yet another good way to spend a couple of hours 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito's Way isn't without a lot of flaws. It is too long, and the ending does not hang together because there's no way that the cops would not have shut down Grand Central. If Carlito was willing to kill in the opening scenes of the movie why wouldn't he have taken care of Benny in the club? These mistakes are in the minor category. Pacino is really good in this, he holds something back, letting you look inside him rather than screaming in your face, as in Scarface and Heat. Penn is beautifully slimy, the atmosphere reeks of 70's New York City, in fact the city seems to be a character in the movie. Penelope Ann Miller is heartbreakingly sad in a thankless role. I find myself watching the movie more than once in spite of its flaws.If you are looking a cool movie with good performances, this is a good choice.</fullReview>

Set in 1975 Carlito Brigante(Al Pacino)is a former drug baron(Of course he is, he is Tony Montana, Scarface) trying to go straight after a long spell in jail, but his crooked lawyer(Sean Penn) has other plans for him. As inevitable as Greek tragedy, but Pacino and Penn are bpth spellbinding. Carlito guides us through the film as narrator of what is going on as though we are reading his diary. And let us not forget that there is a beautiful love story in here too. This film has a great script and a great pace to it, but im not too fond of the chase towards the end of the film.</fullReview>

However things always do not turn out as wish. His cocaine-addicted lawyer David who helped him out of prison embezzled a big sum of money that belonged to an in-jail gangster chief. To solve the problem, tricky David made good use of Carlito. But that landed both of them in a dangerous situation.Although Carlito did his best, he failed. It was ironic that his mercy made his tragedy. The final chasing scene was really breathtaking. I enjoyed it very much.Comparing with his other roles, the role was easy for Al Pacino. Of cause his performance was still impeccable. Sean Penn was also impressive.An absorbing gangster movie. 8/10</fullReview>

There's only one problem: the end of the story is revealed in the opening credits.Having already seen it, I watched this movie with friends (who hadnt seen it), but fast-forwarded through the opening credit sequence and started from the courtroom scene. The ending had so much more impact. Not sure why De Palma did that, maybe he felt there wasn't enough of a hook in the opening, maybe he thought it created more closure...who knows? No matter, its a far greater film if you start it from the courtroom. Try it!</fullReview>

However, the ties he has with his past are too strong, and he keeps getting drawn back into the world and lifestyle that he is trying to leave behind. Brian De Palma does a great job of directing this film and the acting is very good. (Especially Pacino and Sean Penn)This is one of the best gangster movies of the 90s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brian De Palma and Al Pacino are back after Scarface. Carlito Brigante (Pacino) is an ex-druglord who comes out of jail and wants to stay legitimate, what turns out to be tougher than expected. His attorney, played by Sean Penn, is a cocaine-addict who brings a lot of trouble with him.I really ejoyed this movie. It has a touching end and you'll be thinking about this movie for hours after you've seen it. Very good!Rating: 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito's Way is without a doubt one of the great gangster films out there. Pacino,as always,is terrific,but the scene stealer is Sean Penn. Arguably his greatest performance,he manages to steal almost every scene from Pacino. Great story,great acting,one of the best...see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely this film is one of Al Pacino's finest. And probably Sean Penn's best performance aside from Dead Man Walking. After defeating the system which put him in jail, Carlito(Al) proclaims that he will not lead a life of crime. Yet his lawyer played by Sean Penn has not made the same vow. He leads Carlito back into the world he wished to leave. De Palma works a masterpiece as he has many times before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, an outrageously great gangster film with Al Pacino, as usual, turning in still another phenomenal performance as a Puerto Rican gangster who wants to grow straight, but is eventually pulled into a situation which causes tragedy for him. He is equally matched by Sean Penn as a cocaine addicted lawyer who draws him in and Penelope Ann Miller, the girl he loved but tragically could not have.It's basically a well-crafted story of environment having its hold on people and trapping them once they have committed crimes.The music at the club that Pacino owns is absolutely fabulous with an array of popular songs for the period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic, but still a decent enough film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Released five years into a thirty year sentence on a technicality, former heroin dealer Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) vows to go straight. Returning home to the Puerto Rican community he used to rule, he discovers new faces have sprung up and new agendas are on the way in. He buys a new nightclub and makes a new living as the '70s disco faze kicks in...but the man behind his early release could be the man about to drag him back down.Opening in an elegant film noir style, punctuated only by a colourful advert promising an escape to 'el paradiso', Carlito's Way tries to keep this up through-out with it's use of Pacino's slow, lingering voice overs guiding us along the story, often against the back drop of rain swept New York side streets. Released ten years after the same actor/director collaboration behind Scarface, the film doesn't quite capture the same impact of that film, but it's still a well made and crafted crime drama/thriller that leaves a decent impression. Indeed, Pacino's intensity and style that made Scarface so memorable is back here, Brigante almost coming off as an older, more mature Tony Montana.If Pacino's the driving force, then the supporting cast are starting the engine. Most of them are out to get Pacino's character, including Sean Penn's sleazy, double crossing, coke head lawyer, not to mention John Leguizamo's up and coming new gangster on the scene, as well as minor players Ingrid Rogers and Luis Guzman, plus in practically a before he was famous moment, Viggo Mortensen as another old friend with ulterior motives.Carlito's Way doesn't quite leave the impression of being a classic, with perhaps not enough depth and substance to justify the considerable running time, but it's still an admirable piece of film making from two men who know what they're doing. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carlito's Way (1993):undeniably a well made film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlito's Way came after Scent of a Woman, Glengarry Glen Ross, Frankie and Johnny and The Godfather, Part III,and it was Pacino's last movie before Heat.In "Carlito ?",the bearded Pacino gives a powerhouse performance as a thug who does not find his place in the milieu he finds after he is released from the prison;he decides to change some rules,and to play a little softer,and this will soon prove to be disastrous;as played by Pacino,the dealer Carlito is a likable character,in that trend of Pacino humanized gangsters that at some turn in their grim existence try to be a little more humane ;De Palma chose well Pacino,not only for his thug looks and streetwise aptitudes ,but also for his acting skills ,so Pacino makes full use of his testosterone fueled voice and explosive insults ,yet the role is quite restrained within the Pacino range, and without the insobriety of his famous mobster aqua-tints .Pacino's career is an alternation of very dissimilar movies.Carlito is another underworld role,after Johnny (from Frankie and Johnny), Michael Corleone, Big Boy Caprice, Tony Montana, Sonny Wortzik, and the primeval Bobby,in a string of roles that parallels De Niro's gallery. Carlito Brigante was followed by Lefty Ruggiero.Like Brando,like Newman, Clift and Gabin,and like most of the fascinating actors, Pacino had the mischance of working mostly with second-rate directors;anyway,Pacino was fortunate enough to meet,now and then,some cult directors like De Palma (Scarface and Carlito's Way) or Michael Mann (Heat and The Insider).As conception, "Carlito ?" is a melodramatic and beautiful thriller,a tale of love, baseness, loyalty and death in the suburb.The chase sequence is remarkably thrilling and well scored.Like Newman,like Brando,like Clift,Dean, Lemmon,Mastroianni, Gabin,Rourke and Marais, Pacino belongs to the class of the actors that it is a pleasure to simply watch in a movie,in any movie;it is obvious that these astonishing presences are not simply nature's gift ,but rather are the fruit of the artistic intelligence of these actors. By the way,Pacino admires Brando and Newman,and Rourke likes Brando,Newman and Pacino;another notable admirer of Newman is Willis. Unlike some of the aforementioned men, Pacino was always of an endearing ingenuity and directness in declaring his respect and affection for the actors' art. He never mocked acting, though the tradition of scorning and despising the acting profession is very respectable (Bogart, Gabin, Brando, Rourke, etc.). In "Carlito ?",Pacino's role is dense,robust and well conceived,it has gusto and the touches of exquisite exuberance .As usually,Pacino is himself better than the scripts he is offered;he creates depth where it would only be sociology and cheap melodrama .A script has to be very wrong (see People I Know),to be able to defeat even Pacino.After Carlito's Way (1993), De Palma broke off till the Mission: Impossible (1996), and Pacino, as I already mentioned,till the '95 Heat.I knew the suave Mrs. Penelope Ann Miller from Other People's Money (1991),Norman Jewison's quaint comedy;she also had roles in "Miami Vice",Miles from Home (1988),The Freshman (1990)(the wonderful Marlon Brando spoof),also in Awakenings (1990),Kindergarten Cop (1990),Chaplin (1992),Along Came a Spider (2001):a career that began by promising much (like those of Elizabeth McGovern and Lara Flynn Boyle).Slowly,Mrs. Penelope Ann Miller disappeared from the notable movies.Sean Penn manages to do a great role as the decomposing, viscous and disintegrating lawyer.David Kleinfeld is one of his few film roles in the first half of the '90s.Carlito's Way (1993)is a landmark in Pacino's movie career,and undeniably a good film,as a realistic foray into the offenders' territory.But the real stake of "Carlito's ..." surpasses this theme, passing into a character depiction.I will begin by declaring that the streetwise thrillers about the underworld are not my preference: guttersnipes, swindlers, crooks, evildoers, ragamuffins, fustian rascals, peculator, cads, rags, the society's lees, ruffians and miscreants.Carlito is a man who chooses to play different,against the rules of his social environment.How far can he go?The conclusion of this film may seem quite predictable:one cannot break the conventions of his world,the game's rules,his human range is decided beforehand by his social world that precedes him,and one's attempt to ignore this,to play slightly different,is quickly punished.Carlito tries to resume his life with a new set of rules;still,he can not reconcile these with the world that he finds outside the prison,because, unlike him,that world did not change.Hence, Carlito's conflict with his entourage,and his failure,as he strives to pave his way towards a quiet life with some lesser evils.In other words, Carlito chooses a compromise, a partial change,a convenient improvement:he is not transformed enough to be a honest man,but he is not willing to be as rough as his milieu demands it,either. Carlito's way is a compromise,a partial improvement.He is strong,tough,yes,but not powerful enough to change a game on his own.It can be noticed that De Palma does not illustrate a moral example ,and he does not speak about marvels and a conversion,with his Puerto-Rican streetwise character.Carlito is not William 'Rocky' Sullivan from Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),nor Frank T. Wells from F.T.W. (1994),John Sedley from Johnny Handsome (1989),etc.. Carlito tries,indeed,to be somewhat better,slightly better,but the moral nature of his improvement ,of his change,remains largely unknown. He has certain values (such as loyalty),and also he has aged.The discord with his hellish milieu will crush him,as he was not able to find his way out of that labyrinthine underworld.The knockout chase sequence,as I already mentioned before,with Brigante being pursued by the furious Italian mobsters,in the underground and airport ,is worthy of a deserving thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Pacino/DePalma combination works yet again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, this movie has always been a kind of SCARFACE 2. I like to think that if Tony Montana were incarcerated and got off, this would be his movie. It has some good acting, some good directing, and as always with DePalma, lavish visuals and interesting camera usage. I found this movie to be profoundly detached from other movies of the general genre. Even though its a pretty common story, the execution through which this movie was made was fresh and interesting. The city, the drama, the violence, all captured well on both the written page and the screen. I found that everybody fit their roles with the exception of Penelope Ann-Miller. She didn't overact so much as lack the needed prescence for the character. She wasn't holding the screen with Pacino, and damn it, as the female love interest, she better. But things like that are minor contrivances to the great movie that is Carlitos Way. The action was well orchestrated, and the character interplay consistent. I felt that the best cast character of ANYONE in the movie, the role that was inseparable from the actor who portrayed it, was Sean Penn's Klienfeld. Beautifully acted, the whole time, you just want to punch the seedy little bastard in the face. The fact that i don't like Sean Penn too much as an actor says my liking for the role. So yeah, i felt it was a 9. But only because Penelope Ann Millers performance brought the movie down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fantastic movie. This is seriously the only movie I know that you can take a snapshot of any part in the film and it would classify as a gorgeous picture. The cinematography is just so beautiful it's so easy to get lost in the scene. Plus the acting is glorious with Pacino giving one of his top 3 performances (including "Scent of a Woman" and "Scarface"). I rarely like Sean Penn but this was one of the few roles that even I have to admit he did a great job on. I'm sorry but Ángel Salazar is a pimp and anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about. I'm just kidding but that little guy is just so awesome, he was in "Scarface" too and all the girls think he's adorable. If I was a director I'd throw him in so many more movies like he deserves. Also props to Luis Guzman as Pachanga, he is seriously one of the ugliest actors out there and to make it big looking like that I have to give my hats off to him as he is a fabulous actor and deserves all of it. You get so attached to Carlito because he's such a lovable guy even with his shady past that the end is very hard to accept. Overall a gem of a movie!Final Grounding :Movies : I wish I could see this in theaters!DVD Purchase : Already did, but I wish I had waited for the Special Edition.Rental : See this if you haven't yet.</fullReview>

His loyalty to his friends in an age where friendships are cheap and willingness to shed his murky past are admirable and the audience simply falls for this character. The events at the end have such a huge impact at the end of this movie as a result. The score is again brilliant even when compared to Untouchables and Scarface and the action has your heart pounding as it did in Jaws and Terminators 1 and 2.It's a shame that this movie is not as well known as it shouldfive stars</fullReview>

I'm sure most people wouldn't care and they would still enjoy the movie. I find it funny that exactly ten years after "Scarface" Brian DePalma and Al Pacino team up again to tell the story of a Puerto Rican ex-con who tries to clean up his act, but unfortunately his friends, and ties with the streets take him back to the gangster life he's trying to avoid. Al Pacino's performance as Carlito Brigante is easily the highlight of the film. Sean Penn's performance as David Kleinfeld was amazing too. Highly recommended. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Credible big-budget De Palma with Penn in full form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian De Palma lends his masterful directorial hand to a story about a recently released convicted drug dealer. He insists that he's going straight, but, then, he says something not quite as memorable as "just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in." Al Pacino playing a Puerto Rican-American is a stretch, physically and vocally. The latter of which becomes all too pronounced whenever his voice pops in the annoying narration. But, this is familiar territory for Pacino, except without the family. He's on the other side of the Italian mob and nobody has his back. His closest ally is cocaine addicted Jewish lawyer cum gangster-wannabe, played by Sean Penn. If you want to know why people bandy about how Penn is `the greatest actor of his generation' and don't understand why, then perhaps his performance in this film will convince you. Any other actor would like a fool in the hair and make-up he sells to the audience rather effortlessly. The guy is a chameleon. Viggo Mortensen appears briefly in a cameo and leaves quiet an impression. At times, particularly towards the end, the material gets trite and cartoonish. Yet, there are scenes that are so well choreographed and teem with tension, that you have to take your hat off to the director. He's a living legend. 7/10.</fullReview>

And like always his acting performance is great. Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller are not comparable with Alpacino but they are good. Carlito`s Way is not great as Scarface or The Godfather but it`s better than Casino and Donnie Brasco. The atmosphere of this movie is really the style of Brian De Palma, like he did in Scarface and Raising Cain he has created a paranoid atmosphere, no one can do that better than Brian De Palma (Quentin Tarantino comes close).

		<shortDescription>Enthralling film from De Palma, with just a touch of the 'seen it before's...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Carlito's Way"; De Palma has crafted the second gangster opus of his career, after '83's (?) "Scarface" remake. Both films introduce us to the minutaie of the life of an immigrant criminal, and the dealings he has with others. The difference is, in "Carlito's Way", said 'gangster' is determined to go straight... As I said at the start of this review; both films are great and deserve to be seen. Which is better? I will always prefer "Scarface", because it was made before Pacino REALLY got typecast into playing mobster-types; and the fact is, watching somebody go into a downward spiral makes for better entertainment than watching them try and keep to the straight and narrow does. In truth though, it's not really the comparisons to its 'cousin' that hurt "Carlito's Way", more its similarities to every gangster film made before or since. Perhaps it's unfair to criticise a movie for having had such a big influence, but despite the best efforts of the cast, what I was watching never felt fresh. It was even - dare I say it? - slightly predictable. The best part of the movie for me were the scenes between Pacino and Leguizamo; the latter playing the scuzzball pretender to Carlito's throne. It was good to see Penn back onscreen again too, but I felt that his role was perhaps hyped up more than it deserved. The film takes its darn sweet time to get to the crux of the story, and in a way that's good, because we get to know the characters intimately. However, it also means that the thrust of the movie is somewhat lacking, meaning that it doesn't quite have the intensity of a "Donnie Brasco" or a "Godfather" All this criticism may give the impression that I don't like the film. Not true. The problems I've pointed out just serve to highlight how I feel the film could've been made better than it already is. Even unchanged, it's still miles better than 90% of the stuff you'll see at the cinema today.  What you should really take away from my review is this thought: If "Carlito's Way" were the first gangster film you had seen, you'd be hailing it as a masterpiece. It very nearly IS just that, but I felt that it didn't possess the 'hook' to make it legendary. This is sort of 'Scarface in reverse' then, so if you loved De Palma's earlier effort and feel you want some more of the same, then you're onto a winner. I love both, but "Scarface" has the edge. Whichever way you look at it, De Palma has now managed to make TWO great gangster films in his career, and some directors can't even manage to make one. A great film, especially if you get the tape where it's back-to-back with "Sea of Love", like I did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's quite a decent movie. Al Pacino is Carlito Brigante, a Puerto Rican New Yorker. Sean Penn is Kleinfeld, the lawyer who gets him out of the slams after only five years on a thirty-year sentence. Penelope Ann Miller is Gail, the old girl friend Carlito takes up with again after his return to the city.Pacino used to be a big drug dealer and, having learned some things about life, is now ready to retire, with the intention of taking his cut of some money from the club he partly owns and flying off to the Bahamas or someplace with Miller, there to open a car dealership. He wants out of a city in which everyone now seems more corrupt than before he went upstate, a city in which "honor" has become an almost meaningless word, useful only in coercing help from someone else, merely an instrument."You owe me," says Penn. And Pacino, honor bound, must do favor after favor for the weaselly, duplicitous, coke-snorting lawyer including, finally, involvement in the murder of a Mafia member and his son. Penn does the killings. Pacino didn't even know about Penn's plans, but the mob holds him equally responsible.And while he is running his club and figuring out the details of his escape to the Bahamas, Pacino is forced to enact the role of a man so unyielding and unforgiving that he must brush off brash youngsters who would like nothing more than to take his place in the city's underworld.It's a complicated world that Pacino inhabits. He needs to juggle too many goals. At the end, he is betrayed by his best friend and brought down, just as he is about to board the train for Florida. I once heard a lecture in anthropology on Hispanic fatalism and thought at the time it was just another cooked-up thematic generalization. But subsequent experience has made me wonder. This film, including Pacino's narrative voice over, could have been written and directed by that anthropologist, . (Or by my fatalistic barber, Luisito, for that matter.) The acting is fine all around, with not a sour note. The direction is equally competent. No show-off directorial adventitions. Everything looks just about right, from Carlito's wardrobe (black leather coat) to the interior of his night club with its neon distractions. Penelope Ann Miller, in a dramatic role, is to die for, or at least to dance with. When this movie was made, Pacino could still run like hell, just as he did in "Serpico." Actually, the direction is fine, aimed at an adult audience. There is a shoot out at the end, almost obligatory by now, but it's preceded by a super-tense game of hide-and-seek in Grand Central Station, with four mob guys darting around and looking for Pacino, who is doing his best to get to Miller and the train. A less mature execution would have involved dozens of guys with Uzis and thousands of bullets and exploding glass windows and naked women taking showers and cars blowing up in fireballs and Niagras of blood and berserk speeding trains and endangered baby carriages and little old lady by-standers and murdered clowns -- and it all would have been carried out in slow motion. The director has done such things before. Not here. The fact that the story can generate so much suspense and excitement with a minimum of gore is a tribute to the people who put this together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A proper story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The particular thing I like about this movie is that it sets the scene so well I Am hard pushed to think of a period movie especially one set in the 1970s that has recreated the particular era so well . Not only that but this is not just a mindless gangster movie with your general lashings of glamorised violence it is a terrific story of a guy who has dug deep found some morals and wants to set right the things of the past and leave all that criminality behind.De palmas direction is at his usual fast paced action style to my mind he is such an underrated director, and even though Al Pacinos performance is great I get the feeling that this is Sean Penns film he plays what can only be described as a piece of well you know what I'm driving at . To sum up great story brilliant setting and to compliment this the soundtrack is so good and mixed into the background perfectly .This is a truly underrated film I personally cannot understand why it is not at least in the top 250 it should reside somewhere there</fullReview>

The mobster then comes up with a plan to escape from prison and whom does he get to help him? His two loyal sons? NO! The crooked untrustworthy lawyer who had already screwed him. What, no one else had a boat? Makes no sense to me. This preposterous plot point starts the chain of events that leads to the ending.Aside from this "Carlito's Way" is a great film, one of the most intense I remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This is a story of a natural talent, who is punished for being who he is and is enticed to play a game he doesn't want to. That's dePalma.DePalma's films divide into those he directs `for hire' and those that spring from his own mind. This is a `for hire' project.It still has dePalma's energetic eye: in the framing shots at the beginning and end; in some exhilarating floating sequences at the club; and at the chase up and down the escalators toward the end. This latter would be developed in `Snake Eyes,' a `pure' dePalma project. When we are in the opportunistic eye, this is magic.The problem is in the acting. No, I'm not saying the acting is bad. But when studio bosses assemble these things, often they don't understand the chemistry involved among the various beings certain actors carry with them.Pacino is a sledgehammer. He's not clever, just loud. Among actors, he is a gangster so it is apt that he plays them. But Sean Penn is a Brando-type being: he projects several personalities at once: always including at least one shadow of the character and himself as actor. It is a whole different way of constructing a story. The story might have been able to accommodate both styles: actually some good films do exploit these differences, but always to the advantage of the clever actor. `Untouchables' had a writer that knew how to negotiate these risks.DePalma was constrained, and couldn't synthesize the parts. So he parses the film into three bits: his own art of perception; Penn's creation of projection, and Pacino's noise. By turns, he allows each one some attention as if we were at a three-ring circus. The result is incoherent.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "so-called" sequel to Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like "Casino" has been considered the "so-called" sequel to "Goodfellas", in my opinion, "Carlito's Way" is basically the "so-called" sequel to "Scarface." The reasons for that explanation is because of the stars and similar story lines of each movie. With "Goodfellas" and "Casino", both movies starred Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and were directed by Martin Scorsese. When it comes to both "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way", both movies star Al Pacino and were directed by Brian De Palma. And even actors that played minor roles in one movie appear in some capacity in their counterparts. Also in the past, there were weekends were I would watch both sets of movies together but on separate days from each other. But of course, there are differences between "Tony Montana" and "Carlito Brigante." "Tony Montana" was basically a Cuban refugee hoodlum who along with other Cuban refugees, arrives in Miami, Florida during the "Mariel Boat Lift" in 1980 and within a few years becomes the top drug lord in Miami and uses cocaine as a source of power. But that particular drug also contributes to his downfall in the end. With "Carlito Brigante", he's a Nuyorican(Puerto Rican New Yorker) ex drug lord who returns to the streets of New York City in 1975 after serving 5 years of a 30 year prison sentence. Now planning to live a legitimate crime free life, he also tries to rekindle his relationship with Gail(Penelope Ann Miller) that he had before his imprisonment. But there are two causes to Carlito's downfall. The first is his lawyer, David Kleinfeld(Sean Penn)who not only has a very bad cocaine addiction but is corrupt and is also a retaliatory target of incarcerated Italian mob boss, Tony "Tony T" Taglialucci(Frank Minucci), another one of his clients. Carlito's second downfall is "Benny Blanco" who is a young, inexperienced punk who is trying to rise up in the drug trade by trying to surpass Carlito and is played by actor/comedian John Leguizamo, respectively. But in the end, is it Carlito himself that contributes to his downfall just for having a loyal trust in Kleinfeld and Pachanga(Luis Guzman), an old friend from his past. "Carlito's Way" was released in 1993 for which it was 10 years apart from "Scarface"(which was released in 1983). And another difference between each movie is the musical score. With "Scarface", the score was conducted by Giorgio Moroder and was synthesizer based. With "Carlito's Way", the score was conducted by Patrick Doyle and was more symphonic/orchestra based. But the soundtrack also consisted of songs from 1970's Disco groups such as KC and the Sunshine Band, The O Jays, The Hues Corporation, The Bee Gees, LaBelle, etc. that fit the time period of the movie(1975). And the soundtrack also consisted of songs from Latin music artists such as Celia Cruz, Hector Lavoe, Willie Colon, and Santana as well. And besides the other aforementioned actors, the other actors that comprised the cast such as James Rebhorn, Viggo Mortensen, Adrian Pasdar, Joseph Siravo, Richard Foronjy, John Ortiz, Ingrid Rogers and the late Argentinian comedic actor, Jorge Porcel(in his only American acting appearance) also put in good performances in this movie. And besides Al Pacino, other "Scarface" alumni such as Al Israel(Hector), Angel Salazar(Chi Chi), Cesar Cordova(Cuban cook), and Mike Moran(Nick the Pig)also make brief cameos in "Carlito's Way." Just like he perfected the Cuban accent for "Tony Montana" in "Scarface", Pacino perfects the Nuyorican accent for "Carlito Brigante" in "Carlito's Way", even if he is an Italian-American actor. Although "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power" was, in my opinion, a good prequel starring Jay Hernandez as a young "Carlito" in his early years, it will never compare to the original film from 1993. "Carlito's Way", in my opinion, is another great gangster film that should be included in the ranks with "The Godfather" trilogy, "Once Upon a Time in America", "Goodfellas", "Casino", "A Bronx Tale", and of course, "Scarface"(both versions from 1932 and 1983/Al Pacino respectively). Also, look out for a director's trademark that director Brian De Palma left in both movies that involves a gun that includes a silencer and an arm in a sling. Of course, both "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way" have to be watched together side by side to find that director's trademark along with its symbolism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing crime drama with romantic element that gets better as it progresses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Al Pacino's greats, not sure if it's one of his best but it's still a good street movie. The story is about a man Carlito 'Charlie' Brigante(Al Pacino) who comes out of prison to start a new life but like other movies like this the past always come to haunt the man that tries to escape it. Al Pacino plays a character that is difficult to get use to with the street slang and the accent he uses. But after a while I got used to it, he plays a guy that goes by the code of the street and loyalty means everything to him to the point he will go to difficult length because of his loyalty and his street code ethics. So yeah even criminals have codes and ethics they go by and this man is a guy that goes by it no matter what. I wasn't quite sure I should like his character or not in the beginning but he becomes likable as the movie progresses, I mean he isn't the nicest guy and goes balls to the wall when he needs to, but he is likable because of his ethic and loyalty. This movie starts off a bit slow and might take a while for some to get there attention but it really does as it progresses and as the characters develop some more. The romantic element also works in this and has some good twist that is well developed. The acting is really good and for the most part believable, even the side characters are fun to watch because of there mannerism and they way they speak while also being believable. Anyone that likes gangster movies with a bit of romantic element will probably enjoy this.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was nice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino starred in a number of gangster films so we sometimes think "Aha, a gangster!" when we see his face in the screen. But this film isn't about an ordinary gangster. As the film goes by Carlito comes closer and closer to the criminal world, so in the end this world kills him. His idea was that sometimes men change, but in fact they always suffer from it. It means that if you are in the criminal world you have either to kill or they will kill you - just like in an animal world. Carlito's way has a tragic end, because he tried to free from this cruel world. That's what I understood. Sean Penn is a true master of disguise. You can hardly recognize him. And of cause the girl was amazing. Gangsters always choose beautiful women so do casting directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino rocks in this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the start this film looked promising and it sure was all the way through to the end. It is predictable that whatever Al Pacino stars in is going to be a masterpiece of some sort. Carlito's Way is another one of his masterpiece and what's even better is that Sean Penn costars and Brian De Palma directs this film as well. The beginning makes no sense at all but right from that moment as Al's character voice overs it just gives you a good masterpiece sort of feeling. Everyone should be grateful and privileged that they are seeing one of the best movies ever made. The dialog is fine and the story is interesting while some of the action scenes are smart and cool. Al Pacino is the best actor in this whole film because without him this film would be junk and should be avoided at all costs but thankfully Brian De Palma casted him. Sean Penn was good as well but his appearance looked hideous and made him look like a complete retarded lawyer. To put a long story short: Sean Penn could not give a better performance than Al Pacino. The real credit goes to the director, Brian De Palma. for creating this and without him all would be lost and watching this movie would be a waste of time. F*ck the Golden Globes for not giving Carlito's Way an award because this film is as good as Scarface and Good Fellas. The music is this film is pretty explosive and it really captures you at the end fight scene.Carlito, a Puerto-Rican drug boss, is out prison after serving five years all thanks to his lawyer friend David Klienfeld. He vows to stop his past from landing him in jail again but trouble starts following him and young druggies want to make a name for themselves. He becomes embroiled in something dangerous even for him and when things go bad he has to run away from some enemies. His old girlfriend gets back with him and together they have to make it out alive. A trail of deception always follows him. Cops and killers will be after him and he has to outwit them all and save himself.This film is not like how Scarface was, all blood and guts with no story, but this film is unique because it offers a great potential story with minimum amount of gore. You have to watch out for the fight sequences because they will blow you away and I mean really blow you away. This film does have flaws and one of them is the bad acting from Viggo Mortensen and he sucked bad because he didn't look like a gangster at all. Guess he was still a rookie back then. The other big flaw is Al Pacino's Puerto Rican accent which fails him completely to where he was born: America or Puerto Rico. Overall, this film doesn't disappoint but many people will be disappointed because this film tells the end before the beginning and they are right that it ruins the point of the film. Everyone should have a good time even though if it is a little bit slow or boring but wait until the end. Please! If you liked this film, I also recommend Good Fellas, Scarface, Casino, American Gangster, and Death Sentence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's the Way (I Like It) with Penelope, Penn, Pacino, &amp; De Palma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sprung from prison on a legal technicality by his cocaine-addled attorney (Sean Penn), former drug kingpin Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) stuns the local underworld by vowing to go straight. Dedicated to making a change, he reunites with his former girlfriend (Penelope Ann Miller) and rekindles their romance. But his dream of a legitimate life is undermined at every turn by ruthless former associates and even deadlier young thugs like Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo), who are out to make a name for themselves," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis."Despite good intentions, Carlito's misguided loyalties and outmoded code of 'honor' plunge him into a savage life-or-death battle against the relentless forces that refuse to let him go in this powerful crime saga." Well-produced, and directed in style by Brian De Palma, "Carlito's Way" doesn't quite reach the heights of Mr. Pacino and De Palma's predecessors; but, it's a damn good attempt. The film is nicely set in disco-fied 1975 New York. It's nice to see Michael Hadge out of the Blue Whale tavern. Carlito's "Mo-Rican" narration does not impress (accents don't match); and, there isn't much innovative or suspenseful going on.Mr. Penn (as David "Dave" Kleinfeld) is very impressive; his sleazy coke-sniffing shyster, with the Art Garfunkel-styled hair, should have been considered for a "Best Supporting Actor" Oscar. There are several other memorable characters, like John Leguizamo, who introduces himself with alliteration, as "Benny Blanco from the Bronx." Appearing topless, Ms. Miller (as Gail) is definitely arousing (it's okay, she plays a stripper). De Palma's ending climax is very exciting; and, you can play it for you mom, next time she asks, "What is this, Grand Central Station?" ******* Carlito's Way (11/10/93) Brian De Palma ~ Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller, John Leguizamo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Gangsters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One year after "Scent of a Woman", Al Pacino did a good job and brought Carlito Brigante to real life for us."Carlito's Way" is a film, that you may watch with your friends. You'll probably like watching this cool old gangster's every move, even his masculine face, covered with beard. I especially like the scenes, when Carlito Brigante and his pretty woman shout at each other -- blame his fate. The film contains some crazy chasing, mad shooting scenes, and sometimes passionate and touching love scenes. However, it's obvious that Carlito Brigante, as a changed man, can't get out of mess whatever he tries. He doesn't want any trouble, but somehow trouble finds him. -- Well, you must see the whole film, to understand what I mean.To summon up, I have to claim that, what we have here is a really good film, that I can watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst haircuts ever seen on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film gives more ammo to critics of lawyers, that's for sure. Sean Penn plays a lawyer so crooked, lawyers may actually be offended at their depiction. Lawyers may actually be ashamed, if that's possible. I remember this film coming out and didn't remember how well regarded it was. But I really enjoyed it. Plot is not too revolutionary...just the story of a local drug pusher named Carlito (Pacino) recently released from jail and trying to keep to the straight and narrow. However, some don't wish to leave Carlito free and safe on the sidelines, including a lawyer named David Kleinfeld (Penn). Kleinfeld has Carlito in his debt and it is through his convoluted entanglements that Carlito is pulled back into the fringes of crime. Pacino's accent conjures up memories of his turn in "Scarface" as a Cuban hood, and it does sound vaguely pimp-ish. Nevertheless, as acting goes, Pacino is solid without edging into self-parody and Penn adds another notch to his belt of roles he can play. The perm notwithstanding, he is superb in the film, and, while I'm not sure if he received an Oscar nomination for this role, I think he may well have deserved one. He plays an insecure, homicidal, drugged-up lawyer. Penn manages to capture the real danger that this man, as insecure as he is (and who wouldn't be, really, with that perm?), poses to those with whom he clashes?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pacino plays Carlito Brigante, a Puerto Rican drug dealer who has just finished his time in jail. Carlito shocks the criminal community when he claims that he's quitting the life. His former girlfriend, whom he re-romances, couldn't be happier with Carlito's decision. But as good as his intentions are, Carlito is being attacked at every angle by former associates and young punks. He receives further complications when his cocaine addicted lawyer and friend gets caught up in a life or death situation with a made man who wants to escape prison. An exceptional gangster flick that doesn't rely on shocking violence to please the audience. Not surprising in the least, Al Pacino is in fine form and delivers us a character whom we deeply care about as the movie progresses. There are hardly any flaws in the cast, actually. Along with the great acting, we are given shocks, twists and turns that will leave you dizzy. The only minor flaw is that this great saga stretches on a bit too long.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among Pacino's better movies-Penn is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Carlito's way, it took me probably an hour to realize that Kleinfeld was Sean Penn. It's a rare actor who can put none of himself into a character, but Kleinfeld rings astoundingly true to life and contains no piece of Penn.Others have talked about the Grand Central scene, and I will comment on it some. So many chase scenes revolve around people and cars moving so quickly and randomly as to try and confuse the audience, with more bullets expended in one minute than during the entire series run of "The A-Team". This is too smart to be one of those scenes. The scene is based on brief moments of hiding and changing direction, followed by a 4 on 1 fight that drags out for close to a minute with probably less than 50 bullets expended in total.Also excellent is the leadup to the Grand Central Scene, where Carlito muses and frets about whether he has covered all his bases in the short period of time he has to get to the train, then you watch as one by one he uses his gangster experience to defuse them all, except the one he wasn't looking for, which killed him. Also makes a statement when Blanco, one of the minor threats, is the one that gets him. Suggests that surviving in that gangster environment has more to do with keeping your mind sharp than being tough.</fullReview>

Unfortunately his old associates don't want this to happen and Carlito is in a race against time to get away before his luck runs out. To complicate matters he rekindles an old romance with Gail who (wrongly) never really believes he can go straight. His bent lawyer oversteps the mark with someone and Carlito is in real trouble.

		<shortDescription>Stylish follow-up to SCARFACE. WARNING: SPOILERS FOR OTHER FILMS AS WELL AS CARLITO'S WAY..!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER: It is a pity that Brian De Palma opened CARLITO'S WAY with the climax of film in the same way Clint Eastwood did in A PERFECT WORLD. It really is unncessary to see the fate of the lead character at the outset as the opening credits go, as like THE GREAT ESCAPE and VON RYAN'S EXPRESS (**SPOILERS WARNING!!!**)you always wish McQueen would get the Switzerland and Sinatra would get on that train.Still for all that, the success and style of SCARFACE transposed into this adaptation of Edwin Torres' novels AFTER HOURS and CARLITO'S WAY. The concept of the protagonist trying to escape his fate, like Rambo when we see him at the outset of RAMBO III in a monastery, is not new, but the way it is styled in CARLITO'S WAY is essential for the story to work.Patrick Doyle's score is haunting and serves the film well and the 70's soundtrack (another of my favourites) gets me going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALL OVER ITBrian de Palma's gangster movies are much better (much more emotional, perhaps) than his regular thrillers, with the possible exception of "Carrie". And although his best piece of work on the subject is "The untouchables", this one is worth a look.It features the journey of Carlito Brigante, an ex-con trying to live a life off-crime, to the Bahamas. He runs his own pub (ironically called "Paradise") in order to get the 70.000$ he needs to hit it off to Bahamas with his ex-girlfriend Gail. Unfornately, he owes one to his lawyer Kleinfield, who ends up getting him in big trouble.First, the bad part. The movie is the opposite of subtle. People yell their opinions about the gangster world all the time, all the shots are big and grandilocuent, even the ones that don't need to be that way, and the final shooting is completely unbelievable. But that's not necessarily bad if it doesn't bother you.The good part features an excellent interpretation by Al Pacino and good supporting by Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller. There's a small and very good role played by Viggo Mortensen, wich is also one of the best scenes in the movie. De Palma movies always have very intense moments, and even when the whole package is not that satisfactory, these scenes remain in your head.Overall a very good gangster movie by a good director and with good acting. Enjoyable as hell if you don't look for a very witty and subtle story.SAY NO MORE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Long Awaited Return To Old Form For Al Pacino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I review this film, I would like to mention that during the early 1970's, Al Pacino's film career was off and running. "The Godfather", "The Godfather Part 2" and "Dog Day Afternoon" rank as three of the greatest films of the decade and of all time and they all starred Pacino. Unfortunately, they were also hard acts to follow as the majority of Pacino's output since then has failed to live up to expectations. "The Godfather Part 3" was an OK film but it was not on the same greatness level as its two excellent predecessors. Those who were disappointed with "The Godfather Part 3" (and there were many) may be more likely to enjoy this film in which Pacino's character is faced with a similar decision and storyline but his character here is a little more restrained and passionate than the mostly brutal and remorseless Michael Corelone. Pacino portrays Carlito Brigante, an organized crime kingpin who had been imprisoned for several years. His attorney friend (Sean Penn) grants him a retrial and manages to spring him out of prison. Carlito's intentions once he's free and back on the streets are clearly to go straight and leave the criminal life behind for good. However, some of his old cronies and some vicious young gangster hoods don't believe that it's possible and won't let the "legend" leave without a final fight. This gripping crime drama is Pacino's best film in years and a great alternative for those viewers who were expecting more from "The Godfather Part 3." Director Brian DePalma is also in fine form and considerably improving on his previous film, "Raising Cain." A supporting cast and period soundtrack (film is set during the 1970's) also contribute to its success.</fullReview>

I went to see the film knowing that he was in it, and yet, I failed to realize that he was the slime ball attorney until the final credits rolled.The problem I have is that I left Key West in the late summer (August) of 1992. The date listed for the release of this film on both the IMDb and the DirecTV guide is 1993. How can that be? Is there some discrepancy here or am I suffering from early Alzheimer's?Thanks, Markp.s.

		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie for the first time. From the start I really enjoyed the film. There was plenty of action and a really good story line. The directing and acting was excellent all the way through the movie. Any movie with Al Pacino is going to be a good movie right? I was really into the movie throughout the lenght of the film, to the point where I did not want to take my eyes off the screen because I was afraid I would miss something. However, without telling what happens, don't you think that the event at the end of the movie was horrible? They built up all this suspense towards the ending and then just crushed it. Even though I really enjoyed the film, I was extremely disappointed with the ending. So as a warning to others who have not yet seen the film, be prepared for the 'Worst Movie Ending In History'. They should make an actual award for that, this movie would definitely win, even this many years later!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Gangster Yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just out of prison, an ex-con tries to go clean, but struggles to escape the crime wave of his NYC neighborhood. De Palma is in rare form here. Although he can't help himself on occasion, he generally doesn't try to overwhelm the material with overly flashy and distracting camera work. He also doesn't encourage Pacino to overact as in "Scarface." The result is a film that is overlong but entertaining, although it doesn't rank among the best gangster films that followed "The Godfather." Pacino plays the kind of role he can play in his sleep, and it's a credit to him that he makes Carlito a sympathetic and interesting character. Penn is nearly unrecognizable as a coke-addicted lawyer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A defining De Palma film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After fully watching Scarface for the first time, i was looking forward to seeing some of his other work. Carlito's Way is the one that's keep crawling back to my DVD-player.Pacino has a really great role as Carlito, a Puerto-Rican convicted mobster that is out of jail after 5 years thanks to his lawyer friend David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). He wants to leave with his old girlfriend and get away from the environment that, so he says, has had much influence on his former actions. He decides he wants to lead a better life, but soon finds himself having to help his friend with some dirty business.If you've seen Dressed to Kill, Carrie or other De Palma films you'll see similarities in the of the camera , which makes excellent suspense. The camera sometimes takes the first-person position of a character often showing just an environment. Shots like this are not seen much in other films these days, but are really compelling to watch. A lot of De Palma-typical stuff is seen in this film, and the way it all works together makes this for me his best work to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carlito's ways with women...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not nearly as funny as De Palma's other masterpiece of the "unintentionally hilarious" ("Scarface" of course), "Carlito's Way" has its moments though. Pacino's struggle with linguistic intricacies such as "foreign accents", is once again, very funny, especially since he seems to occasionally switch from this supposedly "Puerto Rican accent" to his "Scent of a Woman" mannerisms. The insertion of "You Are So Beautiful" song was so out of place, it earns a chuckle. Also funny was a surprising cameo from Viggo Mortensen.It turns out Carlito is none other than Mr. Right. Who could have imagined that a mobster can be such a nice guy? You've gotta admire Carlito's ways with women. He's so respectful, understanding, kind and always in control (he's not even jealous)? Now of course that's completely unbelievable for a mobster (a killer that is), but it's alright, it's a De Palma film.The terribly uninspired narration by Al Pacino deserves a special note. Badly written and contrived, it adds nothing more than embarrassment.The movie is very enjoyable nonetheless. And unlike Michael Corleone, I really like Brigante.</fullReview>

There was no undersand created around the character and no realtionship with the audience.

		<fullReview>This movie is yet another fine gangster movie with Al Pacino as the main lead. You might think that this movie adds little to the genre, also because it stars yet again Pacino in the main role as gangster. Well, this movie is surprising good and original enough which is also thanks to the always wonderful to look at style of directing by Brian De Palma, who before this with Pacino already made the much acclaimed gangster movie "Scarface".The movie its story is original and is about an ex-criminal who just got out of jail and is determined to stay on the good path and escapes his old life. But due to unforeseen circumstances and some old 'friends' he soon is, against his own will, pulled back again in the dark gangster underworld and activities of New York City. The movie features more than enough good and original moments and has plenty of memorable scene's.Of course once more the acting is top-class in this movie. Having Al Pacino playing the lead in a gangster movie is always jackpot and he once more succeeds in portraying a good and realistic character. Also truly excellent is Sean Penn in a role that you normally would never expect him in. John Leguizamo is also really good in a typical gangster role. The movie also features the now very well known Viggo Mortensen in one of his very first big movie roles.The movie has some good looking and professionally made shootouts and moments of violence. The whole ending at the train station really is the best part of the movie. Director Brian De Palma surely knows how to create some tense sequences and the end chase of this movie is once more proof of that.The movie has a fine musical score composed by Patrick Doyle. It's not always fitting for the movie but that doesn't take away that it's a good score.When you're a fan of gangster/crime movies this is an absolutely must see for you. Also for De Palma fans there is plenty to enjoy here. There are some typical De Palma moments and camera movements and the end sequences on the train station alone should be reason enough for De Palma fans to go and watch this movie.In my opinion this movie is even better than "Scarface".9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Penn's Best Role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really is not much to say about this film -- Al Pacino stars with Brian De Palma directing. Separately, they both have made plenty of great films. Together, they made "Scarface". While this film may not be as iconic as "Scarface", it is every bit as good -- and features a character you can feel real sympathy for, as he is more than just a criminal.But I think what sets this film apart from others like it is Sean Penn. Oh man, this is easily his best role. I did not even recognize him until almost halfway through the film, despite staring right at the man. The voice, the mannerisms -- brilliant. And that hair, oh my. I cannot say I have ever been a huge Penn fan, but this is his crowning achievement and nobody could claim otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another '90s mafia flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Al Pacino. Just wanted to state that upfront. Now, his presence is not necessarily a guarantee for a five star movie, but usually it means that the movie is not total crap. This is the case with this particular title.The story is decent enough - Pacino's character, Carlito, is an ex-drug dealer, fresh out of prison, trying to go straight, but unable to do so, as one would expect (there's no quitting or retiring in the crime business).The characters are well enough developed. Carlito, as the main one, in particular. Especially his inadequacy in a world that's new to him (not only the legit world, but also the crime scene, with the new punks, people he knew but he finds to be changed, etc). Sean Penn (who I find annoying at times, but can't deny his talent) plays the support character of David Somethingorother, Carlito's old friend and lawyer. He once again does an extraordinary job. Some of the other characters might seem a little too stereotypical, but most of the '90s crime flicks suffer from this.Brian de Palma does a good job directing this flick, but I can't help wondering if he didn't spend too much of his career doing movies like Carlito's Way, The Untouchables, Wise Guys, Scarface (which are all great, don't get me wrong, just a little similar) and not enough doing things like Bonfire Of The Vanities or Raising Cain. But that's another story. Let it be said, however, that the movie is totally worth watching, be it that you're a mafia movies lover, or just want to see Sean Penn in a pair of round glasses, a la John Lennon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carlito's Way is about a Puerto Rican ex-con named Carlito Brigante who is just released from prison, tries to lead his life to a good path although being pressured by the people around him and his earlier life. Brian De Palma (Scarface and The Untouchables), directs another successful film that has colorful characters, a good soundtrack, and a good screenplay by David Koepp. The performances were good especially by Al Pacino (who performs with another accent like in Scarface), Penelope Ann Miller, John Lequizamo, and Luis Guzman. I didn't think that Sean Penn was that great in this film. I thought he tried too hard and I sort of thought he did the part pretty badly honestly. Don't get me wrong, I like Sean Penn a lot, but I just thought he played a dull performance. Overall, this is a good film by Brian DePalma, that will be appreciated more and more in the future. I recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carlito's Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Brian De Palma (Carrie, The Untouchables), I was looking forward to seeing the star of Scarface and its director reuniting ten years later. Basically Carlito 'Charlie' Brigante (Al Pacino) Puerto Rican ex-criminal who has served five years in prison, and he has vowed not to go back to his old ways, living as a regular citizen. He begins by rekindling his relationship with ex-lover Gail (Golden Globe nominated Penelope Ann Miller), buying a night club and saving money to go to the Bahamas. But Carlito's past fellow criminals aren't leaving him alone, his nephew gets him in a shoot-out, his criminal turning lawyer David Kleinfeld (Golden Globe nominated Sean Penn) wants "favours", and an old friend wants the police to catch him. Carlito plans to escape to Florida, but he has gotten involved with the wrong people for one last "favour", and he is wrongly blamed for a mob boss's death, so they are chasing after him. It all comes to a head with Carlito asking Gail to wait for him at the train station, and the mob gag members are trying to catch and kill him. Even after killing them all, Carlito still catches a bullet from Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo) and betraying Pachanga (Luis Guzmán), but don't worry, he lives. Also starring Ingrid Rogers as Steffie, James Rebhorn as Dist. Atty. Norwalk and The Lord of the Rings' Viggo Mortensen as Lalin. Pacino makes a good restrained, gently lisping ex-criminal that can't get away from his past, the supporting cast, especially Penn and Miller make fantastic performances too, and the witty script from Spider-Man writer David Koepp makes this quite a watchable crime thriller. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong performances but too slow story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Carlito Brigante is released from a thirty-year sentence after only five years on a technicality. But the five years left an impression on Carlito. He is going clean, he has a dream to move to Bahamas and rent cars to tourists. To do that he needs some money. He is set up by his friend and lawyer Kleinfeld to manage a disco. But no one really believes he is clean and the DA is out for him. Carlito struggles to keep clean and also rekindles his relationship with Gail, the woman of his dreams. But Kleinfled has some trouble with his mafia-clients and Carlito is a man that helps his friends. Even if it means trouble...Comments: First off, I believe this move could have been a lot better with just a simple adjustment. If it had not shown the ending at the beginning, the entire movie would have benefited. Now you know how it's going to end, right from the start. And its not too hard to figure out who either. Otherwise it is a well made movie, but it has its faults. For one, its very front heavy. By that I mean that it puts a lot of time to establish characters and the environment, and it almost seem like they panicked when it came to the ending, realizing they didn't have much time left to do it in. So the ending is simple, predictable and very short.The best part of the production is the acting. The entire cast gives a very strong performance with Pacino and Penn leading the way. Those two are exceptional. I also was impressed by Mortensen's short scene. But when the story is too slow, the acting matters less, unfortunately. So I can't rate higher than a (even though the acting almost deserves more)...6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Carlito's Way", Brian De Palma has attempted to present us with a "life as a gangster" type story much in the same way as his colleague Martin Scorcese did in "Goodfellas". The latter produced a compelling narrative with fantastic performances from his cast (De Niro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta) and a hard-line message. Not so Brian De Palma however.De Palma's inconsistency has never been in doubt, it's always prevalent. Yet surely one would question a man who casts Al Pacino first as a Cuban ("Scarface") and then as a Puerto Rican. Pacino is the most Italian looking guy in Hollywood. Mind you he gives a professional performance, and Sean Penn, as his corrupt Jewish lawyer, is again outstanding."Carlito's Way" is impressively shot too, but De Palma lets the film ramble on too long, and makes the mistake of showing the conclusion of the story at the beginning of the show (ala "Intersection"). A shorter, more action-thriller type approach would have worked much better than this failed endeavour. "Carlito" did not require the depth this movie tries to supply.A reasonable night's entertainment, highlighted by a well staged action sequence in the underground at Grand Central Station.Friday, May 13, 1994 - Astor Theatre</fullReview>

The monologue/narration is bad; it tries to supply some depth to the movie but the acuteness is just not there and it ads nothing to the plot - it reveals the ending at the beginning - depressingly little intelligence here; the movie lacks in punch and does not have the credibility it seeks. Al Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller's love affair is unconvincing, there's no chemistry between the two, their emphasis is often wrong. Thought Al Pacino as Carlito Brigante is quite good, Sean Penn is brilliant as Kleinfeld. Awful script, poor dialogues, soundtrack sucks, extras/rent-a-crowds are ham/bacon bones; it hurts to see such a talented director spend his time directing with such little enthusiasm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fortunately the rest of the film is good enough to make up for it. The opening shows Carlito Brigante, former criminal, being hauled away in a stretcher, covered in blood after being shot. Well, now I know how the film ends. The suspense of the film's climax is ruined if we immediately know his fate. Duh! Pacino (surely more deserving of an Academy Award here than he was for his overrated performance in Scent of a Woman) narrates us through the last week or so of Carlito Brigante's life as he is let out of jail after five years out of thirty for mitigates circumstances coming to light. Determined to go straight, Carlito shrugs off all advances from crooks old and new but is eventually drawn back into a quagmire of trouble by his cokehead lawyer (Sean Penn dressed up as Disco Stu from The Simpsons, who also deserved to take home a Best Supporting Actor Oscar)The 145 minute running time passes in a breeze and there's loads of interesting story developments to keep you hooked. But DePalma's sterile widescreen photography and sets reek of the crassness of Scarface. This film is miles ahead of that junk (but let's not get into a debate about that) though I do think that a more vivid production design and cinematography and slicker editing would have stopped the film from looking so bland.I don't think DePalma is a great director but I do enjoy Carlito's Way, The Untouchables and Snake Eyes. The fact that he has also directed such godawful sludge like Carrie, Scarface and Mission to Mars only proves how unpredictable he is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong B-movie, well-made but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether DiPalma likes it or not, the audience is entitled to think of this as the B-movie companion piece to "Scarface", since DiPalma is mapping the same terrain with assist from "Scarface" star Pacino once again playing an Hispanic mobster in the late 1970s. However, all the play-it-to-the-max ballsiness of the older film has been lost. And that the Pacino character here is a reformed mobster, much older and mellower than Scarface could ever hope to become, only excuses this in part - specifically, the sappy romanticism that finds its focus on the relationship between Carlito and Gail - which would be wholly unbelievable if this clearly weren't a B-movie to begin with, with all the plot-loops, stereotypes, "message" and daffy sentimentalism that implies.Still, even granting all this, there's a lot wrong here; That the Italians that show up at Carlito's club at the end all have names of the Family bosses of New York may have seemed witty when written, but unfortunately serious mob-watchers - and mob-movie watchers - may feel at first confused and then disappointed - the film seems to be playing for realism here, but it's only a joke after-all. Sean Penn starts the film at top form, but somewhere along the line decides it's not worth the effort, and he's almost right. Pacino himself seems to be running out of energy - his Spanish accent in "Scarface" was overdone, but was consistent with the character; here, he wanders into southern drawl, general Manhattanese, and 'Donnie Brasco' 'wop' (no offense, you know what I mean), trying to find some focus to his character that will explain his pulling punches while leaving him an edge. But he doesn't make it; Carlito feels like the wimp others think he's become. And when he needs his smarts most, they let him down - not just his smarts, but his actor, his director and his writer. Finally one has to remark the late '70s kitsch filling the background here. We saw this kitsch before, in "Scarface", where it played an important role in defining the emptiness of the culture Montana so desperately wants to dominate; here, it just floats around in the background, largely unfinished (those Afros! not every brother wore them in those days!), taking up space.But the real problem here is that a B-movie "Scarface" companion piece ought to be a distillation of the action episodes with some swift dialog to hold it together. This film is WAY too long and drawn-out. DiPalma used his slower moments in "Scarface" to give us rich set-pieces of humor and irony, like the cunnilingus-gesture pick-up scene, or the wildly gaudy room-sized bubble-bath scene. Here, the slow moments are filled with, well - talk; and if the talk were interesting, these would be bearable; but it's not, so they aren't.It's a well-made and watchable crime-story, but it not only pretends to more, it could have been more, much more; so it doesn't even get "B" for effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is just a carbon copy of Scarface, but because of that and the fact that Scarface is a great movie this flick manages to just hold up. I don't see how it could be called a classic though. It has it's moments and the visuals are good as are they in most Brian De Palma films. It has good acting and Sean Penn does another stellar performance but it's missing something. What it's missing is originality, and that is what Scarface had even though it was kind of a remake it's self. This film even ends the same way Scarface did. This film might be better if you have not seen Scarface but I could not say because I watched Scarface first. I don't see what would draw you to see this film besides having liked Scarface except maybe you are just a fan of De Palma and this is what you came across first. Only watch this if you want to see nothing new and a rehash and I will admit some times a rehash is a good thing.</fullReview>

He gives an object lesson in turf paranoia that Cube Gooding Jr would have done well to have studied for American Gangster. Naturally, the film is all about Al Pacino though, who doesn't simply re-tread the tetchy, loud-mouthed mobsters he's coined before but actually puts some effort into making you believe he wants out. Sean Penn, sporting a wig that makes clowns look styled by Vidal Sassoon is good as an out of his depth legal cockroach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough Gangster Picture with Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlito's Way (1993) **** (out of 4) Marvelous thriller has Al Pacino playing Carlito Brigante, a former drug dealer who gets released from prison and plans on going straight. Once out on the streets he plans to raise enough money to get away but it doesn't take long because the crime in the streets begin to find him and it doesn't help that his lawyer/friend (Sean Penn) gets himself in trouble with a crime family. It seems shortly after this movie was released to great reviews, the earlier Pacino/DePalma flick SCARFACE started to build its reputation as a cult favorite and sadly this 1993 masterpiece has pretty much been forgotten since, which is a real shame because it's clearly the best of the two movies. DePalma has certainly lost his way in recent years so it's probably hard for some to remember that at one time he was one of the greatest directors working and CARLITO'S WAY features some of his best touches and the performances by the entire cast is what makes this film so memorable. It goes without saying but Pacino was born to play a role like this. His Puerto Rican accent is top-notch and I really love the way the actor plays the part so laid back. This laid back nature comes across as experience with the character knowing the street laws and the way Pacino brings this across is very memorable. I'm not sure how long he had to practice or if it just came natural but the way he walks it's as if he just glides from scene to scene. As terrific as Pacino is the movie clearly belongs to Sean Penn who gives one of his greatest performance and I think it's easy to look back and say that this is where he greatness really started and took off. The sleazy character is so perfectly captured by Penn that you can't imagine any other actor doing the part. Penn has to go through a wide range of emotions from scared, to trying to be tough and to an eventual killer but he's believable every second. The scenes with him high on coke and slowly losing his mind are perfectly done. Penelope Ann Miller does a great job as the love interest and we get strong support from John Leguizamo, Luis Guzman and Viggo Mortensen in a small role. A lot of thrillers get bogged down with silly love stories but that's not the case here because the love story actually makes you feel even more for Carlito and you want to see him succeed and get away from his crime life. It certainly helps that Pacino and Miller have so much great chemistry together and this comes raging through during a love scene that DePalma perfectly directs to Joe Cocker's "You Are So Beautiful". You'll notice the camera quickly spinning around the two, which will have fans of the director thinking back to the prom scene in CARRIE where the same camera trick was done. The movie features one great scene after another but the highlight is an eleven-minute chase sequence at the end of the film, which has to be one of the greatest in film history. There are other DePalma movies that I enjoy more but I can't think of a greater sequence than the chase through Grand Central Station as it contains drama that just keeps mounting and mounting to the rather shocking conclusion. The blaring music, terrific camera moves and the way the story plays out is just pure magic. CARLITO'S WAY is a rather remarkable little thriller that clocks in just under two-and-a-half hours but there's not a dry moment to be found.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's start out by saying that a not so good movie, CAN have great acting. And that's what this movie's about: Al Pacino and Sean Penn were awesome in this overrated movie. They were both believable, cool and they really showed that they are not the overrated ones. Alright, to the movie. It was not a BAD movie, it was just not as good as I thought. I was highly disappointed, because I had too high expectations. I couldn't see anything different about it! An ex-con tries to live a good life, but his past comes haunting him, along with his former friends and enemies... OK? what's so special about that? Look, maybe YOU liked it, and you should like it. Everyone has different opinions, but I didn't think it was that good. But if you really want to see a real Al Pacino movie, then see Scarface, The Godfather movies (the third one is just as good as the two first), Dog Day Afternoon and so on.Thanks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe with Brian De Palma directing Al Pacino once again, my expectations were too high. Carlito's Way is not a bad film. It's filled with many memorable scenes and characters, but ultimately it just can't pull them all together.Al Pacino plays Carlito Brigante. He's a mid-level Puerto Rican crime lord who has just been released from jail after serving only five years of a thirty-year sentence. Apparently a technicality and Carlito's brilliantly slimy lawyer (Sean Penn) have set him free early. Carlito sets out to raise $75,000 and move to Jamaica so he can buy his way into the car rental business. Yes, he plans on going legit. His slimy lawyer basically laughs in his face when he hears Carlito's plan. How can a man with such a violent past ever go legit, asks the conventional wisdom on the street. Carlito isn't out of jail more than a day or two before he's already involved in a violent shoot out and running a seedy nightclub for the money he needs. He tries his hardest, but it's no use. Not only does he have trouble avoiding his violent tendencies, but he's surrounded by thugs and low-life's (his lawyer in particular) that constantly bring him down. He hooks up with an old flame and asks her to come with him when he leaves the city. Of course she says yes, but with everyone after Carlito by the end of the film, will they make it out of New York alive? Unfortunately, that question is answered in the first five minutes of this film. Why the hell did they do this? Well, sometimes that technique works. Casino and Fight Club come to mind. But here.... I don't like it. That conclusion would have been a hell of a lot more convincing had we not seen it happen so soon. The film plays itself out fairly well to get us back to what we've already seen, but I just wish the film could have started out in the courtroom.Pacino is good, but not great. His accent needed a little work, and it comes and goes. Of course, he is talented enough to make any performance more than watchable. I'll lay it right on the line... Sean Penn walks away with this film. His scumbag lawyer character is one of the most unsavory creeps I've seen in a film in a long time. Penn's character is the embodiment of nearly everything that can be wrong with a person. He seems to revel in his character's sleaziness. Most of supporting actors are also very good. John Leguizamo shows definite promise in one of his earliest roles.Overall, it just wasn't as good as I'd hoped. The film shoots itself in the foot by showing the ending at the beginning. And also, there are way too many references to other De Palma films in this one. It's like every ten minutes he has to remind you of all the other films he's done.6 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I Liked This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In reply to the people who`ve been coming on this site to ask what all the fuss is about I`ll point out that CARLITO`S WAY is an extremely well acted film . One thing I do admire about Pacino the actor is the fact he chooses quality over quantity . Look at De Niro in the past 10 years who`s appeared in some absolute crap like WE`RE NO ANGELS , THE FAN , and MEET THE PARENTS which leads me to believe that the star of TAXI DRIVER and RAGING BULL must be another actor called Robert De Niro . Pacino can never to accused of slumming it , and you know you`ll always be guaranteed an intense performance from him . Boy does Pacino give it 100% here. Amazingly Pacino didn`t even receive an Oscar nomination for this which is the best performance by an American actor from that year ( So much better than Tom Hanks ) , and he`s ably supported by Luiz Guzman and Viggo Mortensen and proving perhaps for the first time what an accomplished actor he is Sean Penn who was also strangely snubbed at the Oscar nominations . The only failure on the acting front is Penelope Ann Miller who plays the love interest</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Two Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the extremely choppy beginning hour or so doesn't kill ya first, you'll end up liking Carlito's Way when the ending credits appear nearly 3 hours later. The latter half or so is an action packed delight featuring tightly woven suspense segments, awesome memorable direction, acting, writing and cinematography. Unfortunately the development sequences more often then not show both DePalma and Pacino tripping over themselves in an embarrassing fun house mirror reflection of their classic Scarface. Pacino at times is a laughable caricature as Carlito, who among other things cant nail down which accent he likes best, John Milton, Tony Montana, or Michael Corleone. His acting is unbridled hammism at its worst, but even worse is the film itself. The beginning development scenes are either cringe bad, downright boring or both. But hang in there, because it morphs into well above average fare once it finally finds itself long about the 4th reel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so frustrating for me because I have such mixedfeelings about it. On the one hand Carlito's Way is a beautifulstory, and in some ways it's powerfully told. On the other handCarlito's Way is an awful script. Aside from a few very movingmoments, plus a couple intelligent ones the dialog is lacking, andthe structure is wandering. The first hour and 20 minutes feelslike 3 hours. The last hour of the film fares much better.It hurts to see such a talented director spend his time on anythingless than excellent.At times Carlito's Way felt a bit too much like Scarface-- De Palmariffing on De Palma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; Bad Of 'Carlito's Way'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GOOD - Al Pacino does it again, just mesmerizing as the lead character. He also does a nice job narrating the film in his slight Puerto Rican accent for this Hispanic mob story. Sean Penn also acts well is typical sleazy role. The ending features a spectacular, suspenseful cat-and-mouse chase through a train station, shooting while going up and down elevators.THE BAD - Tons of profanity; a major character (Penn) who is so unlikeable, such a snotty punk with that sneering face of his that I can't stand looking at his scenes. It's also a frustrating story about a bad guy trying to go straight (Pacino) but circumstances beyond his control doing him in, and it's not a happy situation. Also, at 145 minutes, it's a bit too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I know a Puerto Rican when I see one" -- Chris Rock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm shocked to see this film so well-reviewed, but seeing all the thumbs up on this site I do have to acknowledge the good points in "Carlito's Way". It's true that Pacino and Penn are two of the best American film actors ever, and their work in this film, as well as DePalma's effort as Director, does deserve praise. Latter day fans of the actors, or fans of Scarface, will see something of a reversal for Penn and Pacino - Pacino is simmering and reserved (complicated in a word, like many of Penn's pre- and post- "Fast Times" roles), and Penn is the bombastic psycho, a la Pacino's Tony Montana. And DePalma shows his technical and visual expertise, and deft handling of underlying violence, tension, and suspense, in many of the scenes mentioned in other reviews.But part of the reason the three principals here merit some applause, is that the script for this film is awful. It is paint-by-numbers without a shred of humor or irony. Pacino's "Puerto Rican" accent is unbelievably bad, as if he were mocking his own role, or if the text of the script were so bad he felt a need to mangle his own delivery. It's even worse than his Cuban accent in Scarface, without the cartoonish humor. Tony Montana couldn't even speak his few Spanish lines convincingly. Carlito sounds like a Cajun with bad gas, not a Puertorrique?o. Also, while I agree with other reviewers that Pacino's physical look in this film makes a big contribution (Penn's even more so), I have never met a Puerto Rican who looked as white as Pacino. Rick Aviles is Puerto Rican. John Leguizamo is half Puerto Rican. Pacino? Not remotely.This flaw is made worse by Pacino's voice over narration - one of my least favorite devices in cinema. The narration is so horribly written, it must have been added after the original cut. On occasion, narration is thus added to a completed film as an afterthought, where the original cut otherwise might seem confusing or incomplete, or to novel adaptations (like this one), to make up for the lack of illuminating backstory or detail. In "Carlito's Way", it's simply unnecessary and annoying. The film would have been shorter and better without it. I also agree with other reviewers that the very "True" romance between Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller is a departure from other Pacino gangster films, where his character is too unflappable or monomaniacal to be involved in and motivated by any such relationship. And the premise of two lovers who have been tragically separated - and shed some of their narcissism in the process - is compelling. But the pair's actual performances as lovers are childish and irritating. I agree with an earlier review here that the mock rape scene is so ridiculous that it's a chore simply to sit through it.To sum up, the whole cast and the director are excellent, but the script is garbage. Such a combo worked a lot better in "King of New York", a far less ambitious film, but one that is more watchable than this one because it sticks to its strengths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Al Pacino first enters the "El Paraiso" bar we see a man standing on the stairs to his office lighting a match. We hear Carlito: "Where are all the mini-skirts...". The man is entranced by a girl's behind and drops the match. Only a few seconds later does he shake his hand as if he got burned. This is one of many details (not listed on IMDb) that poison this movie. Other aspects will strain your belief:How can a 300-pound man survive in East River hanging to a buoy? When exactly did Pacino's character take out the bullets from the gun in Kleinfeld's room? Why does Carlito tell the mafia he "hasn't seen" his lawyer when that's a dead giveaway for his implication in the killing of a mob boss? A pro like Carlito simply wouldn't make that mistake.Of course Carlito's Way is not without its brilliance. The party at Kleinfeld's summer house where everyone is snorting coke, the early pool bar shootout, etc. Great performances by Leguizamo and Mortensen. Sean Penn is simply brilliant as Kleinfeld, the corrupt lawyer, and his portrayal no-doubt inspired the Rosenberg character in the Vice City and San Andreas games. De Palma, however, falls in a common trap in Carlito's Way, he's afraid to take chances. Watching the "making of" documentary included on the DVD was almost painful. Carlito's Way clearly had many great ideas that were later dropped. One example is how the dialog was extremely vulgar gangster slang but reportedly was later changed to regular English because it made the Latino community angry. The pool bar scene is extremely well shot, but David Koepp, the screenwriter, admits that it's only a device to fool the audience for the next hour and put up with the rest of the movie which is mostly talk. Ouch. (note: If you want a movie where Pacino delivers lines flawlessly, watch Glengarry Glenn Ross)Then there is Jorge Porcel in the role of Saso, the club-owner. Porcel seems deaf and wooden when Pacino interacts with him. I thought it was an error in editing the first time I watched it. Again watching the "making of" explains it. De Palma cast a non English-speaking actor who has no idea what Pacino is telling him or when to deliver replies. As the audience you might be asking yourself "why'd they do that?" Carlito's Way was a bomb waiting to explode, you see, for its portrayal of Puerto Ricans or Latinos on a broader scale, as criminals. Solution: cast Jorge, a well-liked Argentinian TV personality, in a supporting role and hope to appease the masses. Some directors who become veterans decide that after a while it's just not viable to take chances anymore. Politics is what hurt Carlito's Way the most. This movie could have been number two in a trilogy of De Palma/Pacino gangster movies but in fact buries any chance of another gem like Scarface from being released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought `Carlito's Way' was a distasteful movie. The movie portrayed Latinos as criminals and dopers. The other main character was a dishonest Jewish lawyer. Even though Carlito was surrounded by Latino beauties he lusts after a skinny white women with a Hampton Hairdo. The white women couldn't have an affair with a Latino unless he forced himself on her as represented scene with the chain on her apartment door. Of course you had to have some Italian mafia types to round out the stereotypes. Overall this was a horrible movie and an insult to all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are these sympathy votes and/or simply allegiance to Pacino (et al) talking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After wanting to see this film for years, and now finally having done so, disappointed to say that this is one of the worst I've ever seen. I've watched hundreds - thousands - of films, and can really only think of half a dozen or so that I've found to be worse than this. I could tell after the opening monologue/narration that this was going to be comedically horrendous, and only kept watching to see how much worse it might get.Having just sat and read through loads of pages of good reviews here, I cannot work out from where these positive comments are coming. From the first scene to the last, everything about it just seemed utterly ridiculous. The predictability, accents, costumes, set design (how is all of this 1975??), and, perhaps worst of all, the script. Completely over the top, all of it. I couldn't take any of the characters seriously, and simply could not believe what rubbish dialogue they were given to spout. Poor Viggo Mortenson - how can he not be ashamed? ('you no hear?' Please!). Poor everyone...I don't necessarily feel I'm including any spoilers, but have ticked the little box just in case; therefore, to further say: The theme of time/mayhem was slightly clever (ie 'we'll only be in there ten minutes', '30 minutes, tops', and 'i'll be 5 minutes, trust me' - and then of course, madness and violence ensues. But these were all as predictable as a character in a teen horror film saying 'I'll be right back' - we all know what's going to happen. Also found the station/stairs(escalator)/shoot-em-up correlation between this and The Untouchables (also DePalma) to be crossing the 'auteur' line bit too much - I kept waiting for the baby buggy to turn up. Yawn.Speaking of which, I note that in the 'goofs' section here, there is no mention of the moment where, after calling him Charlie (far too many times) in a scene in her apartment, at one point Penelope calls him Tony. And for any caption/subtitle users (I sometimes watch with them, as the house where I live can tend to be loud), in the scene where Pacino, Penn, and Steffie (gal from the bar) are at the posh country house, for one line of Steffie's dialogue, the subtitles mistakenly note that her character is called Gail. Nice.The only almost-remotely, almost-redeeming scene involved a certain peering through an apartment door and a mirror; but even with that, we are given Penelope Ann Miller. Really bizarre choice.In all my years of using IMDb and voting for films, I believe this is the only '1' I've given, and definitely the only review I've felt compelled to post. How can anyone who truly appreciates, say, The Godfather {or insert a standard considered-to-be masterpiece title} put this piece of gunk in the same calibre? I just don't get it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first It seemed OK.On hindsight it's a terrible film. Full of cliché predictable scenes and a jukebox soundtrack that make it a shame Shaun Penn had anything to do with this, someone whom ordinarily I hold in high regard. And there was nothing wrong with his performance in this. I'm convinced that the more times you watch this film, the more it'll begin to irritate you.**SPOILER** There is one or two delightful very memorable scenes however in my opinion. Firstly, when he's ran out of ammunition in the toilets, and secondly when Penn is sick onto the fence looking out onto the harbour.This film is text book, gangster film for the sake of a gangster film (A genre I usually try to avoid at all costs). Poor dialogue, coo-coo land fantasy plot lines, and probably it's most effective drawback is that it's made a mockery thanks to the terrible casting choices of ham extras and jobbing rent-a-crowds (Who are employed ad infinitum in an abundance of scenes).I get the feeling that sometimes whilst watching Paccino in this film, that even he wishes he'd never got involved.Pay close attention to the extras, it'll ruin this film for you. And rightfully so.</fullReview>
