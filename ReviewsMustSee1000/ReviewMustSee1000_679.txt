		<fullReview>One thing I can always promise you is that when people talk about the best vampire movies of all time, The Lost Boys is guaranteed to be on their list. In the 1980's, films were all about action, sex appeal, muscles and very good looking teenagers. Joel Schumacher, who was starting out at the time, was given the script and it was about kid vampires. He thought it sounded silly and offered a different idea of it being teenage vampires on motorcycles; who knew he had one of the best ideas that would create such a huge cult classic for decades? I absolutely adore this movie, everything about it: it's style, the script, the humor, the horror, the make up, the cast and the music. While dated, it still has a timeless fun style to it that will entertain those who are seeing it for the first time as if it was the opening weekend at the movie theater. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and it's interesting to see that I still love The Lost Boys so much, as an adult I have a different love for it than "the boys are sooo cute!", well, they still are, but besides the point, The Lost Boys is a great movie that will not disappoint.Michael and his younger brother, Sam, move with their just-divorced mother, Lucy, to Santa Carla, plagued by gang activity and unexplained disappearances, what better place to take your children?! The family moves in with Lucy's father, an eccentric old man who lives on the outskirts of town, and enjoys taxidermy as a hobby. The center of town life is the Boardwalk, which is plastered with flyers of missing people. While Lucy gets a job at a local video store run by a conservative man named Max, Michael becomes fascinated by Star, a beautiful young woman who lives with the mysterious leader of the local gang, David. Meanwhile, in the local comic book store, Sam meets brothers Edgar and Alan Frog, self-proclaimed vampire hunters who give Sam horror comics to teach him about vampires. When Michael meets Star the next night, David provokes him into a motorcycle race, in which he is baited into almost going over the edge of a sea cliff. David invites Michael to their lair, where he is put through an unsettling initiation that includes drinking blood from a wine bottle. The next night, while Sam takes a bath, his dog, Nanook, is forced to fend off Michael's bloodlust-driven attack on Sam. When Sam looks for his dog, he finds his brother has been attacked, but also that Michael's reflection in a mirror has become transparent. Sam calls the Frog brothers for help, they say the only way to save his brother is by killing the head vampire who they suspect is Max, Lucy's boss and new boyfriend.It's hard to pin point what is so great about this movie. I love the cast, starting with Kiefer Sutherland who plays David, the lead of the Lost Boys. He has only a few lines, but you'd think he was the title character the way he presents himself, you can tell he had so much fun with this bad boy role. Dianne Wiest, one of my favorite actresses, what a beautiful lovely woman she is, her character is so warm and wonderful. She plays a great mom and is so believable the way she reacts to the situations she's put in by her crazy sons. This was also the start of "The Two Corey's", Corey Haim and Corey Feldman who had great chemistry along side with Jamison Newlander as they are hunting for vampires. They're like Rambo's who take themselves way too seriously and that's why they are so hilarious but great at what they do. The make up effects are just great and the vampires had such a sleek sexy look to them but still terrifying; the scene where they show Michael their vampire faces is one of the most memorable and most frightening. This is without a doubt the sexiest vampire movie you could watch. It has everything a vampire film should have to entertain. I still love showing this movie to my friends who never saw it, I envy the look on their faces at the end when they fall in love with it too as I wish I could say I was seeing it for the first time too. But I watch it each time and love it as if I were watching it for the first time, it's a fantastic movie, I could go on and on, but I'll just end with: please watch this movie. You better be buying this movie right now as you're finished reading this comment.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schumacher mocks the shoes off vampires!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, among the most brilliant of vampire movies ever made, in the modern film era. Jason Patric and Kiefer Sutherland are destined to blow away all audiences of this visual masterpiece. However, the twist at the end, which I plan not to give away, was made slightly obvious, though well hidden at the same time. Joel Schumacher does a splendid job directing this true work of art. The frog brothers did a great job of adding humor to this otherwise, mainly serious film, without spoiling the suspense. That made the film far more enjoyable to people with interests in multiple genres. Jami Gertz looks absolutely attractive in her role as Star. However, the show is undoubtedly stolen by Kiefer Sutherland, in the role of David, the rebellious, dangerous, rude and rambunctious, teenaged vampire, who seduces Michael (Jason Patric) into joining his gang of vampires. The story is of a woman (Dianne Wiest), and her two sons, Sam (Corey Haim) and Michael (Patric), who move to a small Californian town, called Santa Carla, often referred to as the murder capital of the world, to live with her father after getting divorced. Little to their knowledge, the town happens to be inhabited by a motorcycle gang of Jim Morrison obsessed, teenage vampires. While the mother begins to fall in love with her boss from the video store, where she has been employed, Sam spends his time reading vampire comics, which were given to him by two brothers (Corey Feldman, Jamison Newlander), who claim the town is infested by vampires. He does not believe them, but grows to almost immediately, upon realizing that his brother, Michael, has been seduced by the beautiful half-vampiress, Star (Gertz), and joins the gang, led by David (Sutherland). He realizes that neither Star nor Michael are true vampire until they make their first kill, and they will not become normal again until the head vampire is killed. So, he calls up the brothers Frog, and gets them to come in and help him solve the job, though he is scared that he might have to kill his brother. Overall, a cinematic masterpiece. The directing, acting, writing, camera work, special effects, stunts and, of course, the epic cinematography work with the astounding score to bring together one of the most loved films of all time. The story is in fact an allegory to that of the lost boys of Neverland, from Peter Pan. A contemporary, without the temporary, classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What THESE guys would have done to Captain Hook!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK everyone agrees THE LOST BOYS was way ahead of its time. Dead set right! In essence it hasn't aged at all, only the fashions! By far Corey Haim's best flick, Cory Feldham's too, although I rather liked TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES (The original, that is)Schumacher's concept of placing the vampire myth in sleepyville USA was commendable, it really worked. Sutherland took his role in both teeth and gave us a stylish vampire-on-a-Harley with Jami Gertz in tow. God does SHE look young here compared to her role as Bill Paxton's neurotic fiancee in TWISTER?)Absolutely outstanding soundtrack that my kids have totally worn out the last decade or so. As a family we have probably watched THE LOST BOYS more than any other film. Everything gels, gr8 fx and, given the subject matter, a literate script. Deserving of the relatively high rating it has received here. WE have the same problem here in Castle Hill, WAY too many damn vampires!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie to me is more of a comedy than a horror. The scenes I remember most are the funny ones. Not to say it is a pure comedy, it isn't. It is though a very good vampire tale. The cast is superb, even Corey Haim and Feldman. This is definitely the best movie they did together. This one has a family of three (a mother and two sons) moving into her dad's home. They go around town and the younger one hears from some comic book workers that there are vampires in town. The older son is in fact being recruited by said vampires and is already becoming one after drinking a strange liquid. All in all I love this film and it is one of my favorite vampire flicks. Good mixture of action, horror, and especially for me...comedy. This movie is so very well made that you will find it hard to believe that the director of this would go on to make the pretty bad "Batman and Robin". This movie though is good, and has one of the best ending lines of any movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Excellent, Stylish 80's Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is one of the movies that I think epitomizes the 1980's. It has a genuine 80's look and feel, as well as an awesome soundtrack and some fantastic performances by 80's legends like Corey Feldman.This movie really draws you into it and makes you feel like you're right there in Santa Carla. The music fits the film perfectly. Nothing would have worked better. The setting is perfect. If you were a vampire and you were never going to die, where else would you want to spend your time? The amusement park, the abandoned cave with all that great stuff in it, and the railroad tracks (trust me, you'll understand after you see it) are absolutely incredible. The way Joel Schumacher uses certain POV shots and the eerie fog only add to the mood and atmosphere of the movie.The gore and special effects are great! Since this is an 80's movie, there is no CGI thankfully, so everything you see is really real. The make-up of the vampires is excellent with their piercing eyes and long fangs. The gore doesn't really show itself until the end, though there is a very bloody (but quick) campfire attack in the middle. Once we do get to the blood and guts, it's great! There's a melting vampire in holy water, an exploding vampire, two excellent impalings, and more where that came from.Finally, the acting is great. We have a very good cast, especially Kiefer Sutherland, who puts everyone else to shame. Jason Patric is a little dry, but he's great in his role. Max and Lucy have good chemistry, as well as Star and Michael. The Frog Brothers are classic and are responsible for most of the humor. Superb performances by all!The Bottom Line: A true 80's flick, with great performances, awesome special effects, a rocking soundtrack, and Corey Feldman!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Browsing through IMDB I was shocked to see this film has only scored 6.7! The brilliance of this film is undescribable, I first saw it when I was about 11. It changed me! I wanted to be a teenage vampire and live forever! I have probably since seen this film more than any other, I haven't a bad word about it. Fantastic effects, acting, writing, and the music, believe me you'll be straight out to buy the soundtrack once you've seen this, and play it as if it was one of your favourite albums. Everyone is great in this film but Feldman was born for this part, he's like an older version of 'Mouth' from The Goonies, in many ways this film like an older brother to Goonies and cousin of American Werewolf. They truly don't make movies like this anymore, they finished in the 80's (Gremlins, Fright Night, American Werewolf in London, Return of the Living Dead, Evil Dead, I'm sure there's more...). What more can I say?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great pop corn flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best popcorn movie I've ever watched. It has to be one of the best vampire flicks to hit 80's screens. (Well actually I can think of others but this one tops them.) Some critics refer to it as just one big MTV music commercial with all the pop culture references and all, but the soundtrack is the best feature of it. Kiefer Sutherland makes a fantastically sexy vampire and Jamie Gertz acts the best I've ever seen. Good to see some older pro's in for the ride as well (Dianne Wiest and Edward Herriman). I totally recommend this movie for a Friday night in. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you're strange...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film as a kid and it has always stayed at the top of my vampire genre list, you could bet I was plenty surprised when I found out that this little jewel of 80's cinema was directed by the now yawn worthy "Phone Booth" helmer, Joel Scumacher (the man who massacred the "Batman" franchise).The best element of this movie is that fact that it doesn't take itself very seriously, but in no way does that effect the relative creepiness of the main storyline. The makeup is top notch, as are the special effects and the acting is a perfect fit to the context of the film. Yeah, Corey Haim may not be a Dean or Brando, but he is pitch perfect as the annoying little brother who talks big and runs fast in the face of trouble. Jason Patrick is as good as an actor could possibly be in a role that requires very little character development but the big star here is Kiefer Sutherland who channels his "scary bad boy" look into a character who is as fun to watch as he is frightening. Rounding out the rest of the cast is Dianne Wiest as the sweet mother, Corey Haim and Edward Hermann as the vampire killing duo Edgar and Alan (a cute Poe reference) Frog and 80's movie staple Jamie Gertz as the gypsy-esque Star.(sidenote: Yes that is Alex Winter of "Bill and Ted" fame as one of the lesser vampires)The film has many memorable scenes including the vampire initiation and the scene where Patrick first approaches his brother in vampire form. Though the 80's fashion and music are powerful throughout they borderline overdone and are still enjoyable. Plotwise the set up is acceptable: Wiest and her two sons(Patrick and Haim) move into her father's house in Santa Carla, California, a quaint little beach side town that has been suffering from a high homicide rate. While mom looks for a job the boys look for something to do, Patrick setting his sights on the alluring Star and Haim settling into the local comic den, both fail to notice the ridiculous amount of "MISSING" posters on the walls. Patrick is led astray by a group of youths who like to drag race and hang out in a cave, eventually peer pressure rears its ugly head and soon enough Patrick is one of them. Then he finds out exactly why they only hang out after dark.Full of great one liners and comedic performances (Barnard Hughes is great as the eccentric taxidermist/grandfather) "The Lost Boys" is a film showcased by the small touches: we still have the usual vampire yarn, but the youthful overtones create a different effect. Yes its 80's but its damn fun to watch. Schumacher creates a film that is not only a fun take on vampires but a creative take on teenagers and their neverending trek to belong.Reccommended to those who have a sense of humor and enjoy vampire films.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 80s fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many films about vampires, but one that is almost always remembered with a shy smile on the face is definitely "The Lost Boys". As one of the best remembered films of the 80s, this movie has become part of pop culture and a defining film for that period as it showcases most of what was cool or hip in that decade. While its status as "horror classic" has a lot to do with the nostalgic factor, it's an entertaining film on its own right and its modernization of the vampire myth along with its tongue in cheek humor still make for a charming and funny session of pure mindless entertainment.The movie begins with Lucy Emerson (Dianne Wiest) as she moves to Santa Clara, California, with her two teenager sons, Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) after a bitter divorce. In Santa Clara, Michael becomes involved with a local gang of bikers who have a dark and mysterious secret while Sam becomes friends with two weird boys who claim that the town is being invaded by vampires and its their mission to get rid of them. As Michael begins to act strange, Sam suspects that his brother has become one of the undead and begins to take his friends seriously.Directed by Joel Schumacher, "The Lost Boys" is a movie that effectively combines a cool and attractive look with a simple but entertaining plot resulting in a successful and charming film. The story modernizes classic elements of the vampire myth and adapts it to its time with intelligence and definitely tongue in cheek humor. In fact, this self-aware comedy approach is what makes the film enjoyable, and it relies more on fun and laughs than in actual scares. The plot is rather simple, and lacks some character development, but it makes an interesting (although also quite simplistic) analogy between the troubles of youth and becoming a vampire.Visually the movie looks great, although by now it has that dated nostalgic look of a past decade. Still, the flamboyant visual composition fits perfectly in the film's time and context and it is one of the films biggest assets. Schumacher's fluid and energetic camera-work makes the movie flow at with a nice rhythm and the movie never becomes dull or boring.The cast is very effective and everyone makes a great job. Corey Haim is remarkably good and while he may not be a good actor, in this film he is perfect for the role of Sam. Jason Patric is less lucky and he is overshadowed by the very talented Kiefer Sutherland, who steals every scene with his charm and presence. Jami Gertz gives a somewhat forgettable performance but veterans Dianne Wiest and Edward Herrmann are both excellent in their roles and have some funny lines."The Lost Boys" suffers a lot from its own self-referential nature, it looks old and severely dated by now even when it's 20 years ago when it was released for the first time. The cleverly written plot is very entertaining, but somehow the lack of character development and the comedy take on the story make it to never reach its full potential. The premise is quite interesting but the "Lost Boys" theme is never fully explored leaving at a nice but a bit shallow experience.Definitely most of the charm of "The Lost Boys" is due to nostalgia, as the movie is now basically a time capsule of the 80s. However, it is hard to deny that despite being what one would call a "popcorn movie", in its time it was an intelligent, original and fresh take on vampires. While it may not be a landmark of horror of a life-changing experience, "The Lost Boys" is one of those films that will definitely deliver what they promise: a healthy dose of mindless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We trashed the one that looks like Twisted Sister!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haha, that line makes me laugh every time, just for how old school 80s it is. Not to mention the vampire that the kids just "trashed" didn't really look like Twisted Sister as he did more of a generic 80s pop metal dude. Middle school life in the late 80s (junior high back then) had some movies that were almost universally thought of as "cool". Some of these were Predator, Coming to America, Top Gun (yeah I said Top Gun), Big, and of course The Lost Boys. TLB was so popular with kids, I remember knowing the details of the plot before I had ever seen the movie.Two kids named Sam (Corey Haim) and Michael (Jason Patric) move to Santa Carla, CA with their mother in hopes of a new life. Sam is looking to just have some fun and find a cable hook up for MTV, while his older brother Michael gets involved with some teenage vampire punk kids. Michael is slowly being recruited into the vampire clique that hangs around the boardwalk, while Sam desperately tries to turn him back to a normal human with the help of the overzealous Frog Brothers (Corey Feldman and some other guy).Slick, stylish and shot like an 80s music video, this movie was a lot of fun. A few of the 1987 fashions here are enough to make this movie illegal in a some countries, but the hip feel of the film keeps it from being too dated. Well, in my opinion anyway, some kid today might think different. Afterall this movie is nearly 20 years old. Typing that just made me feel very, very old. Anyway the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, director Joel Schumacher especially knows how to shoot night scenes. This film was both a horror and a comedy at the same time, though I'm not sure which I preferred. Any movie that features both Corey Haim and Corey Feldman is going to be one that you can't take very seriously. If you don't know who these two guys are, better you never find out. Just watch the movie. Keep an ear out for INXS, Run DMC and The Doors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE this movie! The Lost Boys is a movie I can sink my teeth into! Summary: Michael(Jason Patric)and Sam(Corey Haim)have just moved to Santa Carla, California with their mother(Dianne Wiest), and into the house of their lovable Grandpa(Barnard Hughes). During the nights in which they spend their time at an amusement park, Michael starts following an attractive girl named Star(Jami Gertz), and is introduced to her boyfriend, David(Kiefer Sutherland), and his gang of punks. Sam starts hanging out with Edgar(Corey Feldman) and Allen(Jamison Newlander)Frog who claim to be vampire hunters. Soon, odd things start happening at home with Michael, and no prizes to who guesses what's happening! The Lost Boys is an awesome vampire movie with cool flashes of the 80's, and an awesome soundtrack! 7/10.Rated R for Vampire violence, language, and suggestive sexuality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's an absurd the low rating to ''The Lost Boys'' here in IMDb. This movie is one of the vampire classics from the 80's and one of the best vampire movies ever made!Michael,Lucy and Sam, the Emerson's family, are moving to a new and smaller town in California called Santa Carla. The reasons of this change of cities was financial problems and the fact that Lucy wants to give a better life to her sons. There they are living with Lucy's dad, and Santa Carla who looked such a calm city looks to be, in fact, a vampire territory. Michael, Lucy's older son, starts to like Star, a girl who is almost a complete vampire as David, the leader of their group. Michael, mostly because of Star, became a vampire as well, and many problems starts, since Sam made friendship with Edgar and Alan, two brothers who are also vampire hunters.This movie is VERY good, and all vampire fans should watch!</fullReview>

Very few films could boast this, in the world of visual effects that we live in now. Its not just the effects though, its everything, the script is still fresh, the characters still seem current and the story could still surprise new viewers. The only thing i was sure wouldn't age was the soundtrack and of course it hasn't.So for anyone who wants to see how a vampire movie should be made, check this out, it is still one of the best around.8/10 Brilliant</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Corey Haim is excellent (for once) in this Joel Schumacher comedy/horror.There are two gangs which run the boardwalk of Santa Carla at night. One is a lawless bunch of wannabe bikers, the other is a blood-thirsty group of vampires boys. This movie omits the gag war which ensues throughout the literary work, but still manages to be a lovable and highly-liked production.In my opinion, the reason behind this huge likability of this comedy/horror by the man who killed Batman (Yes, this is the same man who directed Batman 3 &amp; 4), is the casting. In all fairness to Mr. Schumacher, he also directed "Bad Company," which I found absolutely delightful, and "Phone Booth," which I found compelling and highly entertaining.These actors were perfectly cast in their roles, which lent a most endearing quality and a sense of something right, to this endeavor, which lacks in so many others. (Like Batman 3 &amp; 4.) The soundtrack was perhaps the true star of this production, as it was literally the best part of the movie. However, the performances were professional, witty, and realistically offered by these veteran actors.Another element omitted from this work, is the fact that Grampa was a veteran/retired Vampire Hunter, which explains his fortuitous entry at the end of this movie.This star-studded cast each did his/her part to lend to this work a complete believability inside this dark fantasy. Some critics have labeled this movie as "pure camp," and while the "Frog Brothers" did lend a campy element to this production, the movie itself was of a good quality and deserves the recognition and following it enjoys. Their manes, Edgar and Alan Frog are an obvious alludiation to Edgar Alan Poe, and is thereby acceptable camp as the homagic element in its purest form.Some of the scenes found within are quite compelling, dramatic, and portrayed with veteran talent; ie: the scene where David (Keefer Sutherland) opens the ancient, ornate bottle containing the blood from which Michael must drink. It is perhaps ~the~ most compelling scene found within this movie. There are some edge-of-your-seat moments, good sound comedic elements, and an otherwise all around solid story to be found here.The sets were excellent, the effects were horrifically believable, and the characters were well developed enough as to give the audience a good dose of concern for the principal participants. The addition of "Laddie" on the milk carton shows the level of detail and care given to this attempt, and again, the soundtrack just adds so much as the songs are fitting and right with each scene, carrying the audience from one scene to the next in smooth dissolves. Very well done.I found the love interest between Michael and Star to be sweet, desperate, and tragic, as I believe it was meant to be. The fact that she chose to make love to Michael rather than feed from him was significant within the story line, as was Max's asking for Michael's invitation before he would enter the house, and as was Grampa's distasteful curl of the lip at Max's doing so.Very well done production which highly deserves the kudos it's been given. I cannot say this movie was "scary," but it was suspenseful, funny, heart-warming, creative, and extremely regaling. A remake would be in order, I think, within the next 10 years or so. It would be nice to expound on the gang wars a bit more, and give a better character treatment to Grampa in this one. And even though I am a fan of this original work, a little more true horror and less comedy would not hurt my feelings in the least. Although, it will be very hard, in my opinion, to recast the role of "Sam." This, again in my opinion, was Haim's best portrayal in any role to date.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Vampire Movie for Anyone Who's Sick of Vampire Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the late 2000s, and the inexplicable Twilight frenzy had descended in all its sparkling, full-forced madness. I'm sure we all remember the ensuing scramble to vault onto the paranormal bandwagon, and how quickly the media became glutted with all things supernatural. So it goes without saying that when my mom dragged out a vampire movie, I wasn't thrilled.But I guess that's just another example why people go around saying "Mother knows best."The vampire movie was director Joel Schumacher's 1987 film The Lost Boys, and it's now one of my favorite movies. Despite the fact that it's over thirty years old and has been followed by a tidal wave of movies and books on the same subject, The Lost Boys remains a fresh, unique take on vampire lore.Unlike many recent paranormal stories, the film doesn't try to turn its subject completely on its head in order to carve out an original place for itself. The vampires are dangerous, careless, and strangely magnetic--in keeping with their roots. However, they've also been updated, given a modern edge. Rather than stuffy Transylvanians skulking in castles, they're a motorcycle gang racing around the cliffs of California. Instead of red-lined capes, they wear leather and piercings.The film opens with brothers Michael (played by Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim)--plus their mom--moving to California to live with their grandfather. Their mother begins seeing a new man, and Michael (the older brother) soon falls in with the aforementioned motorcycle gang. Meanwhile, Sam passes his time with comic books. At the local comic shop, he meets two boys his own age. They introduce themselves as the Frog brothers and warn him that the area has a vampire problem, explaining that they're vampire hunters.Sam doesn't exactly take their words to heart, but before long, he needs to. The motorcycle gang pressures Michael into drinking from a bottle of "wine" as an initiation rite. He downs it without realizing it's actually blood. However, because he hasn't killed anyone yet, he only becomes a half-vampire. With some help from the Frog brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), Sam and Michael learn that Michael's vampirism will be reversed if they kill the leader of the vampire gang (Kiefer Sutherland).Plenty of great story elements follow. There's a little bit of something for everyone: plot twists, action, romance, humor--and even water guns filled with holy water. For me, however, one of the most compelling things is the dynamic between Sam and Michael. It's never heavy-handed or all that sentimental?"No chick flick moments," as Supernatural's Dean Winchester famously insisted?but the brothers' relationship is at the core of the movie. Their bonds with their mother and grandfather are also fleshed out, giving the film a strong, family-centric backbone. Then, of course, there are the vampires: the eternally young "lost boys" the title refers to. For quite a while now, it's seemed like vampires have progressively been getting watered down. This one strolls through sunlight. This one's actually a really nice guy, if you give him a chance. That one drinks from Bambi, for Pete's sake. After being bombarded by all that, I was relieved to find vampires who could be menacing again. My only complaint is the relationship between Michael and another of the half-vampires, a girl named Star. While she's the one who gets him involved with the gang in the first place, I don't feel like their relationship adds anything to the movie. It seems more the studio tossed it in because they felt like a potential Hollywood hit would need some romance in the mix. However, I think that time could've been put to better use by focusing it more on the vampires themselves, or on brothers' relationship with each other or with their grandpa. All in all, this is one of my go-to favorites for recommendations or movie nights. The horror, action, and humor strike a great balance, and aside from the '80s hair and some of Sam's fashion choices, this one stands the test of time beautifully. If nothing else, it's a blissful reprieve from all the sparkling and humanity of today's vampires?a nod to tradition without bending backwards for it. I recommend this film as the vampire movie for anyone who's sick of vampire movies--because that's exactly what it was for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extremely Entertaining Vampire Movie (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSWell, I have finally seen the iconic horror film that is the Lost Boys. After the painful experience I had with the Two Coreys, I never wanted to lay my eyes on Corey Haim and Corey Feldman ever again, but I was interested in seeing this film. I put my anger at them aside and watched this film. I really enjoyed this movie, actually, and I think I am able to forgive Haim and Feldman over their awful "reality show." They are actually pretty good in this film, as well as Jason Patric, Barnard Hughes as the unsettling but humorous grandpa. and Kiefer Sutherland. Speaking of Kiefer, I think he is exceptionally creepy in this film. He may always be creepy, but still, he was fantastic in this film. However, I do believe that Jami Gertz was a little robotic as Star, but she was overall okay. I still do not know why this film was rated R. There was nothing that bad in it. It deserved a PG-13 rating. The soundtrack of this movie is also very good and entertaining to just hear. From the Doors to the spooky theme song Cry Little Sister, this film is jam packed with memorable songs from the eighties.Here is the plot of the Lost Boys. Lucy Emerson and her two sons named Sam and Michael move in with the sons' grandpa to the town named Santa Carla. At a carnival Michael meets Star, who is a member of a motorcycle gang, lead by David. To become a member of the gang, Michael must do a number of strange things, including jumping into the fog and even drinking blood. Michael then starts to change. He begins wearing sunglasses all the time in the sun, sleeping all day and going out in the night, and more. Sam begins to think that he is a vampire after he is given a vampire comic book by two vampire hunters named Edgar and Allen. After it has become apparent that the gang is made up of vampires, they try to find the leader of the vampires. Sam suspects Lucy's boyfriend, Max, but they then doubt that. Edgar, Allen, and Sam then make a plan to kill the vampire gang. They, with the help of Michael, destroy the gang, but then find out that Max is the lead vampire. When Max tries to kill Lucy, grandpa then kills Max.Overall, this is a down-right awesome vampire movie. This is the first of its kind about teenage vampires and after a barrage of countless rip-offs, this is still the best of the best. The make-up on the vampires is fantastic, the directing by Joel Schumacher is solid and creepy, and the writing can be light-hearted, funny, and scary, not necessarily at the same time in the script, though. This may not be the scary but today's standards, but that does not mean that this is not a bad film at all. Anyway, this is a must-see horror film that is sure to entertain anybody.Recommended Films: Dracula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All hail the '80s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When their mother Lucy (an appealing Dianne Wiest) divorces their father, brothers Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) find themselves dragged across the country to their grouchy grandfather's house in Santa Carla, California. Not only is it a wooden shack, it's filled with taxidermied animals and -- horror! -- doesn't have TV. If that was the sole sum of their problems, then this would be a pretty dull movie.Fortunately, Michael attends a concert in which he notices a beautiful flame-haired girl named Star (Jami Gertz). She likes him, he likes her, the cheesy '80s soundtrack swells. Much to Michael's dismay, however, he finds she's running with a biker gang led by David (Kiefer Sutherland, sporting the most serious "business up top, party on the bottom" haircut I've ever seen). Trying to get closer to Star, Michael falls in with David's gang and after imbibing a bottlefull of wine that looks suspiciously like blood, he begins to realize something's up when he starts levitating and trying to drink his brother's blood.Meanwhile, Sam meets the Frog Brothers who are serious and professional vampire hunters despite being all of thirteen years old. In order to save Michael from vamping out permanently, they have to track the lead vampire to his lair and stake him. Easier said than done!This is a great movie. Not "Citizen Kane" great, of course, or even "Titanic" great, but marvelous cheesy fun that's somehow of better quality than it deserves to be. The comedy is genuinely funny, the horror is genuinely scary, and the romance falls genuinely flat, but hey! you can't win 'em all. Jason Patric is at his youngest, prettiest, and most Jim Morrison-esque as Michael, and is a darn good actor to boot. I'll never understand why he never made the leap to big-time star. Spike from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: the Series" is such an obvious rip-off of Kiefer Sutherland's David that it's not even funny. Kiefer did the 'charming, charismatic, leather-clad vampire bad-boy with the peroxide-blond hair and more of a heart than you might expect' thing first, and did it better, IMHO.Okay, so the '80s fashion and haircuts may be scarier than the vampires, but this is still a fine little flick that should be seen at least once, if for no better reason than to bask in the beauty of Jason Patric and Kiefer Sutherland in their youthful glory. And if you don't go that way, you still have Jami Gertz to provide the attractive female eye candy. So check it out, and if you're like me, it'll leave you wishing for that sequel they planned but never made (curse you, film gods! It's not too late -- what have Corey Haim and Corey Feldman done since this movie? They could return for the sequel!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hip and fun thrill ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cult classic of the 80's, this vampire flick isn't really a horror film but a terrifically fun adventure.Brothers move to a California coast town where they are menaced by a gang of teen bikers... who just happen to be vampires!There's little wonder that The Lost Boys became a favorite of the late 80's. It's a movie that has a flair for comedy and thrills, as well as a surprisingly exciting story. This movie doesn't waste anytime with its fast-pace. The movie's comical dialog is quotable good! Joel Schumacher does a splendid job directing this movie, giving it a wonderfully slick look and a sexual vibe. The special FX are quite good as well, the climax of the movie being especially spectacular. The Lost Boys also has an awesome rock soundtrack, the Gerard McMann song 'Cry Little Sister' is a great theme for this movie and the Echo and the Bunnymen cover of 'People are Strange' is a perfect touch.The cast is a true highlight. Jason Patric is both attractive and convincing as a teen who is fighting the urge to bite! Kiefer Sutherland may look like he just jumped off of MTV but he makes for a great villain as the leader of the vamp thugs. Jami Gertz is good as a young lady who has fallen in with the gang. Corey Haim provides some comic relief as our young hero who's trying to save his big brother. Dianne Wiest is great as the boys mother, as is Corey Feldman as a local kid/vampire hunter! Barnard Hughes is a hoot as the grandfather, who delivers one funny conclusion for this movie.The Lost Boys is great fun all the way and remains one of the most stylish modern vamp movies around. Defanatly worth checking out.*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully Lost Boys Doesn't Take Itself Very Seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumaker's The Lost Boys is an outrageous comedy adventure with a cast composed of some of the mid-80s' hottest male teen idols. The film successfully walks the tightrope between schlock-horror-comedy, young adult romance-adventure, family movie, and talent showcase. And there is no gore! Like most of Schumaker's work, Lost Boys is very Hollywood. Unlike most of the subsequent vampire films, however, Lost Boys very rarely takes itself seriously. Though most of the film's humor is pretty dated, it essentially hybridizes Ferris Bueller's day off and Interview with the Vampire.Corey Haim and Jason Patric are two brothers who have just moved with their mom (Rachel Weist) to a new boardwalk town. Michael (Patric) wastes no time getting himself mixes up with a mysterious beauty (Jami Gertz) and her hive of vampires who literally hang out in a ruined hotel nestled within the San Andreas Fault. Meanwhile, his brother (Haim) has met a pair of ca. 9-year-old wannabe vampire slayers. Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric give particularly strong performances and really drive most of this film.The cinematography is very good and quite consistent with the film's tongue-in-cheek approach. The script is economical and appropriate, though a bit dated. The editing is fine. Schumaker is Schumaker, and if your familiar with him, you know what you're going to get in his films - well-paced economical entertainment designed for a big budget which blends Hollywood formulae with big name talent and an at least half-thought-out plot. In other words, Schumaker always at least tries to give a lot of bang for your buck. The formula works here, and, in my opinion, more than it usually does. Unlike most modern gothics, Lost Boys uses special effects and make up very sparingly. It is refreshing to see a horror film without CGI and vats full of cow blood. However, the film is fairly dated, and not all that original (similar in style and story to Return of the Living Dead, among others). Still, it's a better film than it deserves to be,and one of my top-rated from Schumaker.</fullReview>

It is by far one of the best vampire movies ever made. It had it all. The Corey's, Kiefer Sutherland, Jason Patric, Alex Winter and beautiful Jami Gertz. I've had my own copy of this movie for years now, but I still watch it if it comes on tv late at night. That's the only real way to watch a pearl like this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece! The greatest Vampire flick ever made!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys (1987) is one of the best and the greatest vampire flick's ever made! A true Schumacher masterpiece and a classic horror film! I love The Lost Boys so much, it is one of the best true horror movies ever made from the 80's! I always loved this movie since I was a child and the vampires in here are awesome! It encompasses everything that was so silly and cheesy and fun about the 80's. The hair, the clothes, the music, the attitude - it seemed like nobody ever took themselves too seriously in that time. Hell, look at Tim Capello's cameo in the movie, for Christ's sake! Super oiled-up buff sax-playing dude in tight purple spandex? Only in the 80's!The story is about Michael (Jason Patric) and his brother Sam (Corey Haim) who move together with their mother to stay with their grandfather in Santa Carla, California. One day Michael meets a girl and falls for her to know later that she is with a gang of guys who are vampires. They give him wine mixed with blood and Michael drinks it without knowing what it contains. Things change for Michael and he finds out the truth. He tries his best to resist the urge of becoming a vampire and fights it with the help of his brother Sam. This vampire movie is the epitome of excellent humor/horror. Just when you are sitting on the edge of your seat getting ready for the next scary scene you get a joke or a snide remark. As you are relaxed by the humor, you get hit with a nail bitter of a scary scene. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard; some of my favorite music came from this soundtrack. One of my favorite movies that I ever love a true classic, I think for once Joel Schumacher did a great job as the director, He screwed up Batman &amp; Robin (1997) but he made this movie right! This film is probably the best vampire movie I have ever seen, one of my favorites and the soundtrack was awesome loved Cry Little Sister and all of the tracks. The cast all around was very solid too I think probably the best cast for a vampire movie yet. I miss the 80's classic films, like one of them was Fright Night (1985) this movie is released 2.years later and it is another Vampire movie and right behind him. Gosh I want more Vampire flicks from the 80's like this one is. The Lost Boys is like Twilight of it's late 80's day. The difference between the two is that Lost Boys is a rock-n-roll vampire flick mixed with some goofy humor to make it the cult classic is has become ever since it came and went from theaters to VHS.In this film are famous stars like are Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer from 24 (2001) TV show, one of my all time favorite TV shows. Corey Feldman and of course Alex Winter he played in Death Wish 3, Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure and it's sequel Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey gosh I miss those movies. Why can't they make movies like are this ones today? The Lost Boys, Fright Night, Death Wish 3, Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure, Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey are classic movies where are they now?Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It's fun to be a vampire. When a single mother and her two sons move to the sleepy seaside California town of Santa Clara, they discover much more than they anticipated in this visually stunning blend of hip humor, horror and rock 'n' roll about the most compelling group of contemporary vampires ever to put fang to vein. That is actually the basic plot of the film! Anyway I am giving this film a 10/10 because the film deserves it and it doesn't deserve to be bashed and hated from people! I love this film to death I love it!!! The Lost Boys is a 1987 American horror comedy film starring Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland, Jami Gertz, Corey Feldman, Dianne Wiest, Edward Herrmann, Alex Winter, Jamison Newlander, and Barnard Hughes. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Warner Bros.

		<fullReview>Equal parts good and bad. In it's own misguided misbegotten way, The Lost Boys is an inventive timely vampire story, perfectly set in the 1980's. Also, its a stupid vampire movie with awful fashion and music, sh*tty music that's put on full display. Silly when it means to be dramatic, cheesy when it means to be fierce, yet ultimately entertaining. That's the real take away from The Lost Boys, its garbage that delivers the entertainment. Spirited, yet also goddamn idiotic, The Lost Boys, and people will speak so flowery of it, as if this movie were somehow more than a movie that prominently featured an oiled-up muscular shirtless dude playing a saxophone? That's a question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael...Michael...Michael...Michael...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a cult classic that many seem to either love or hate. Personally, I'm' sort of somewhere in the middle. Overall, it was a decent enough film, but it is unfortunately bogged down by the atrocious performance of main actor Jason Patrick. I haven't seen his other work, and I understand that this was an early role for him, but it was literally one of the worst performances I've ever seen. His mother (played by Dianne West) was equally annoying as the timid victim-type mother who let people walk all over her. Corey Haim was surprisingly entertaining as Michael's little brother, while Feldman and his on-screen brother who may as well have just been a mannequin, are self-proclaimed vampire hunters who have never even seen a vampire before. The best performance in the film came from Kiefer Sutherland, which should come as no surprise to those familiar with his other work. The only other really notable performance was that of the late Edward Herrmann as Max.This film does have it's funny moments, but I found they were just funny enough to make me let out a quick chuckle. The vampires are cool, but they are not revealed in their full glory until late in the film, which I found a bit disappointing, mainly because the rest of the film just isn't strong enough on it's own. There is also an attempt at a romance plot between Michael and Star (Jami Gertz), but it starts up like nothing and has absolutely zero substance to it.Some may say I'm taking the movie too seriously, and I understand it's supposed to be silly, but I honestly didn't think it was that funny overall. It kind of felt like the sort of movie you watch while having like a drunken movie night with your buddies. I give this film a 6/10.PS: The title of this review will make sense if you decide to watch the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lost Boys came out far too early to be considered satirical, however during a contemporary viewing its cynical tone can't be missed. Whilst its thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish for a variety of reasons (the amazing soundtrack, the campy tone and Dianne Wiest's parodical enigma of a clueless mother) the film suffers from plenty of set-backs. The tone is inconsistent throughout and features many examples of how slap-stick nonsense can really water down a solid story. It is incredibly dated too but that makes kind of makes it even more interesting. Best part of the film is really its soundtrack - Cry Little Sister (of course) and a cover of the Doors track "People Are Strange" by Echo &amp; The Bunnymen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gang of juvenile hooligans but the twist is they're vampires!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So how big a deal is "The Lost Boys?" Is it one of those universally praised horror films? A beloved cult item? Or was it just the people I hung out with in high school who liked this movie so much? The film obviously has enough of a following to greenlight two twenty years later DTV sequels and action figures and things. I saw the movie years ago and it never really grew on me. That's one of the things Halloween is about for me: Possibly reassessing potential classics.The central premise is actually fairly clever. It's a gang of juvenile hooligans but the twist is they're vampires! I'm not sure any movie did the roving gang of vampire teen things before this one. The film attempts to update the vampire for then modern audiences. That made the film successful in its day but has the effect of instantly dating it now. The style, fashion, and music is deeply rooted in the late eighties. Characters have perms, mullets, crimped, perfect hair-dos. They wear studded leather, denim jackets, and torn polyester. The heroes of the film dress in bright pastels. I'm partial to Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's cover of "People Are Strange" but a lot of the film's music was only cool in the late eighties. I guess it shouldn't surprise that "The Lost Boys" is a powerful bit of nostalgia for many folks.The movie's biggest problem is that it's main character is the least interesting character in the film. Jason Patric's Michael is a typically brooding teenager. He grunts a lot of his dialogue. His romantic relationship with Jami Gertz' Star is completely flat. Michael spends large portions of the film treating his mom and little brother like a jerk. He is a stock boring audience surrogate.Luckily, the supporting characters make up for it. The appeal of the Coreys mostly escape me but I'll admit, Corey Haim is fairly amusing. I like his exaggerated comic reactions to the strange things that happen around him. Feldman, Corey the Second, puts on this bizarre gruff voices. The Frog brothers are entertaining mainly because they pretend to be experts when they are truthfully clueless fools. Kiefer Sutherland is clearly the star of the show. His distinctive voice lends him a commanding presence, which works very well for this character. Edward Herrmann is fairly consistently awesome in most things and has fun playing two types here: First, the square boyfriend who is far too normal. Second, the evil head vampire, which allows Herrmann to gleefully over do it. The best character in the film is obviously Barnard Hughes' Grandpa. He makes creepy taxidermy animals, is obsessed with his (usually stationary) convertible, swings root beer, and has an off-screen girlfriend. He delivers his dialogue with such an off-hand casualness. Only Dianne Wiest proves unlikable. She's the classic clueless mom and remains clueless for far too long.The horror content is comic book-like and light. The movie holds off on revealing the vampires up until the horror point. Before that, the creatures of the night are mostly represented by swooping shots. Victims are lifted out of the area but little actual bloodshed is shown. The patience pays off, as the reveal of the yellow-eyed, bumpy headed vamps works well. The last act is truly when "The Lost Boys" starts to move. Shades of "kids-on-a-mission" flicks like "Monster Squad" or "Goonies" poke through as Sam and the Frog brothers prepare goofy, creative vampire dispatching methods. The bathtubs and squirt guns full of holy water are actually clever, while the death by stereo moment is far sillier. The entire last act, the confrontation between vampires and the reveal of the big boss, works far better then the film that comes before it.Joel Schumacher gets a lot of crap but give the guy some credit. He knows how to make a movie look good. "The Lost Boys" is especially gorgeous on Blu-Ray. The nights are dark and full of billowing fog. The red tent in the house at the end helps the suspenseful tone. Sometimes, his music video tendencies go too far, like the painfully earnest love scene between Michael and Star, but usually it lends a stylish, memorable look to the film. It's probably silly to look for queer subtext in everything Schumacher does but it does become apparent at times. Why would a teenage boy like Corey Haim have a poster of George Michaels, in short-shorts, thrusting his crotch forward, on his bedroom wall? When Michael's vampire instincts first kick in, he nearly feeds on his little brother. While he's in the bath. Finally, the bro-mance between Michael and David is nearly homoerotic, especially since Jason Patric has way more chemistry with Kiefer. And then there's the Greasy Sax Man...Conclusion? "The Lost Boys" is perhaps too prickly at first but eventually develops a likable zany streak. I'm not converting to the tribe yet but it doesn't surprise me people love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hip, slick 1980s vampire picture is good fun for fans of the sub genre. It's got a healthy sense of humour, some memorable lines of dialogue, an attractive and engaging cast of newcomers and veterans, a cool soundtrack, good visual effects, and some impressive production design and cinematography. It's very much of its time, with the title characters looking like some sort of rock band, but it's energetic and entertaining.Divorcée Lucy (a chipper, endearing Dianne Wiest) moves with her teen sons Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) to the community of Santa Clara in California. Michael falls in with a local gang led by David (Kiefer Sutherland), not knowing the truth that they're a bunch of blood sucking night crawlers. Luckily, Sam has made the acquaintance of Edgar and Alan Frog (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), two comic book store dudes who know the score and what to do about it.The interesting ensemble cast also includes old pros Edward Herrmann (as Max, a video store proprietor), and lovably ornery Barnard Hughes, as Michael and Sams' eccentric grandfather. The Lost Boys are played by Brooke McCarter, Billy Wirth, and Alex "Bill S. Preston, Esq." Winter. Jami Gertz is undeniably beautiful as Michaels' love interest.Working from a script by Janice Fischer, James Jeremias, and Jeffrey Boam, director Joel Schumacher does give his movie a sense of "cool" as well as a good pace; the finale is particularly exciting. Among the songs heard are a solid cover of The Doors' "People Are Strange" by Echo and the Bunnymen. The makeup effects by Greg Cannom are effective without being overdone.It does invite comparison to 1987s' other vampire favourite "Near Dark", but overall "Near Dark" is more thickly atmospheric and dreamlike and substantial. "The Lost Boys" is a hoot, but it may simply be too juvenile for some tastes.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

Rock &amp; Roll.... throw in some wickedly cool Vampires and you have one awesome flick. The casting was spot on, Kieffer was excellent as David, Jason and Corey played Michael and Sam to a tee and even Diane Weiss was wonderful as Lucy. One of the coolest soundtracks ever associated with a movie (non musical). Lost Boys made Vampires cool and sexy.Some movies should never be messed with and this is one. It's a damn shame that they went and made 2 really crappy b-grade sequels and an even bigger shame that Corey Feldman starred in both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super corny '80s vampire flick. Brothers Jason Patrick and Corey Haim, along with their mother, Dianne Wiest, move to their new home in a California city known as "the murder capital of the world". Turns out the murderers are actually vampires, hair metal vampires to be exact, lead by Kiefer Sutherland, giving basically the same performance he did the previous year in Stand by Me, except with, you know, fangs. Alex Winter of Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of his handful of cohorts. Patrick falls for a hot chick (Jami Gertz), who leads him to Sutherland's lair, where Sutherland turns him in to a half vampire. He'll only become a real vampire if he kills. Meanwhile, Haim hooks up with Corey Feldman (yay!) and Jamison Newlander, two kids who somehow own a comic book store and are secretly vampire hunters. It's nutty and pretty sloppy (it is, after all, directed by Joel Schumacher), but, boy, is it fun. Haim and Feldman, in particular, are hilarious. I could do without Jason Patrick, though. He always come off as kind of a douche to me.</fullReview>

This movie has all of them and it is also a really good story as well. One thing that I didn't like was the cheesy music and some of the jokes but the vampires over ride that. There is this cheesy kid and he and his brother move to this town with a vampire gang in it. His brother becomes a vampire and yeah you know that the younger brother has to protect his family and stuff. Then there are the Frog brothers and they help the younger brother out.

		<fullReview>Naw, THE LOST BOYS isn't anywhere near as cheesy as the insult above hurled at one of the main villains in the movie, but hey, considering the history of the script, it could've been a helluva lot worse. In its earlier stages, the James Jeremias/Janice Fischer-penned tale had possible scenarios where it could've been either "Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs-with-Fangs," or "PETER PAN-with-Fangs." Thankfully for us fans, the only thing retained from the "Pan" version is the title.So, let's go back, folks, to a time when the influence of MTV was already infiltrating popular culture to the saturation point. The reign of the "Brat Pack" was already in full swing, and teen dramedies had fused with music videos to give us such sagas as "FLASHDANCE" and "FOOTLOOSE." The more obvious signs of infiltration hadn't quite made it into the mainstream sector of the horror genre...until now.Originally intended for Richard Donner, (SUPERMAN, THE OMEN), he stuck with this baby through its most difficult birth pangs, until he read a nifty little something called LETHAL WEAPON. After several gazillion rewrites by almost every well-known name in town, and ditto the directors (one of them being PET SEMATARY'S Mary Lambert), the directorial chores were finally handed over to someone who had only directed one other film...Joel Schumacher. Imagine that - the man now infamous for having nearly destroyed a movie franchise (BATMAN), was also responsible for starting a remarkable trend...the "cool vampire" movie. And as it stands, THE LOST BOYS was, if not the best of the lot, the most AWESOME-looking. I mean costumes, art-direction and cast-wise. And even with its music video-ready pedigree, even the story (as it ended up thanks to a final going-over by Jeffrey Boam) had more substance than your average "THRILLER" wanna-be.Harried divorcée Lucy Emerson (an excellent Dianne Wiest), retreating from her ordeal has moved to the beachfront town of Santa Carla with her two teenaged sons, young Sam (Corey Haim) and older sib Michael (former Brat Packer Jason Patric), to stay with her loveably cantankerous father, (the late Barnard Hughes in one of his best roles), while she figures out her future plans...whatever they are.Well, if among those plans was the intention of shielding Sam and Mike from "bad influences," I'm afraid poor Lucy failed miserably in that department. Lured by the magnetic Star (Jami Gertz), Mike encounters our titular Bad "Boys", led by David (Kiefer Sutherland at his most charismatic and evil yet; Jack Bauer was EONS away at this point!) Decked out in leather, cool bikes and 'Poison'-worthy teased big hair, these guys set the ongoing trend for the new look of badass, rock-and-roll vampires. In the opposing corner, comic book aficionado Sam runs into amateur vamp hunters and book geeks the Frog Brothers, (BFF Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), who tip him off to the fact that Santa Carla is a lot stranger town than its surface would indicate, what with all the mysterious disappearances of the townies and such. Adding to the dramatic unease and tension is Lucy's interest in a new guy, local video store owner Max (Edward Herrmann). It's bad enough for Sam to deal with that she has a new beau, but add his big bro's sudden strange behavior (sleeping all day and the sudden, involuntary ability to fly), and the warnings from the Frog Brothers about Max's possible background for imbibing human plasma, and the stage is set for ongoing confrontations that are by turns hilarious (a disastrous dinner party given by Lucy for Max) and horrifying (the Frog Brothers and Sam's first and nearly fatal attempt at opening up a can of whup-ass on the Boys.)Together with Eighties vamp compadres NEAR DARK and FRIGHT NIGHT, THE LOST BOYS rounds out the group to make a super "Fearsome Foursome Feature Fang Feast"! Former art director Schumacher kept the focus on decade-rich style, while high-caliber actors Wiest, Herrmann and Hughes brought the substance. Not to dismiss the contributions of the younger cast members, who are all great as well (though the breakout performance award has to go to Sutherland), but the single most notable contribution of BOYS, if nothing else, goes to a killer soundtrack featuring the Bands and Singers Of The Moment (Echo and the Bunnymen, FOREIGNER's Lou Gramm, INXS with Jimmy Barnes, Mummy Calls and Tina Turner's sax player Tim Cappello.)I know this will "out" my deeply hidden inner geek, but the soundtrack highlight for me is by Gerard McMann, whose "Cry, Little Sister (Theme From THE LOST BOYS)" is one of those creepy and compelling songs that raise goosebumps on my forearms and has every hair on the back of my neck standing on end, but I will pop in the DVD JUST to hear the thirty seconds or so of this song that opens the movie. Hearing the voices of a children's choir singing what sounds like 'The Vampire Commandments' is just THAT ghoulishly good.So here's one more commandment - find the 2-disk Special Edition like I did and get it for your library...NOW!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well executed, clever idea, from writers Janice Fischer, James Jeremias and additional screenwriter Jeffrey Boam, that really never grabbed me personally. It may just blow you away however, depending on your taste.Simply put, this is a modernisation of the age-old vampire story, though perhaps 'vampires done for generation X' might be more accurate.Joel Schumacher has taken the whole package and presented it glamorously, with every element done (some over done) to a nicety. Glitzy, slick and under 90 minutes, Schumacher knew how to sell an entertainment like this to a youthful audience. Even a rock soundtrack is shrewdly thrown in (it's a good one too). Director of Photography Michael Chapman captures the action with flare and panache.Finally, the cast make it all work. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect as the sinister band leader, David. Jason Patric's central role, that of the confused Michael, is well played and good support comes from Corey Haim (no great actor but suitable) as his amazing little bro' and Barard Hughes as their reclusive, crazy granpa. Jami Gertz peps things up as Starr, the girl who led Michael into David's trap, and Corey Feldman drops by as a vampire eliminator (lame but necessary). Admittedly Dianne Wiest's enormous talent is wasted somewhat.Certainly I can recognise that this was a smart, well produced flick, just not to my taste.Friday, February 20, 1998 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this masterpiece in the theater with my sister (which makes me feel very old to admit) and have loved and admired it ever since. It made me want to move to California...or at least make friends with vampires. Well, I did neither, but I still think the movie rocks. It truly has it all: horror, romance, action, comedy, drama and a terrific soundtrack...oh, yeah, and the infamous Two Coreys. The 80's was a grand decade that churned out some terrific films: 'The Lost Boys' is definitely one of them. Rent it tonight and enjoy it with the lights off. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film for almost anyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly the only good horror movie I've seen that would qualify as 'family friendly', because it is. It's a high speed, energetic 80s action/horror flick with some pretty funny comedy parts blended in. The movie is short, the plot is simple, and the characters are enjoyable. Sure, it's predictable at times, and most of the action/horror clichés manage to warm their ways into the mix, but you'll be smiling the whole way through. I found myself chuckling at the amusing vampire hunting midgets called the Frog brothers, and I liked the campfire scene, very violent without tasteless gore or blood. The final battle scene was well done, too, very fun to watch. Directing and scenery were top notch, especially at the scene where Michael is 'turned', with the fog and lighting outside. The motorbike race on the sand was very cool. Overall the entire package has a vintage 80s sort of feel, free-riding and hard-hitting, not a care in the world.This is one of those films you re-visit every now and then for an enjoyable viewing, rather then a spiritual voyage. It's all very high quality and top notch, so film purists probably won't be disappointed. Recommended to pretty much anybody!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher's 1987 hit The Lost Boys is one of those movies you just can't keep yourself from watching over and over and never get bored.The movie has considerably a simple plot.The Emerson family (mother Lucy and her two boys;girl obsessed Michael,his little brother comic book obsessed Sam and Sam's loyal dog Nanook.)leaves Phoenix and moves to Santa Carla; 'the murder capital of the world' to live with Lucy's father.After a while Lucy finds a job in a video store owned by a polite local named Max.Meanwhile her sons manage to find their own special interests to kill time in Santa Carla;Michael falls for a very attractive native named Star who spends her time with a group of hippies led by David and Sam finds a comic book store owned by weird and hilariously funny frog brothers.Turns out the hippies Michael met while chasing his dream girl are vicious vampires responsible for all the missings in the city and Frog brothers are aware of the vampire activities in the city and trying to end it in their both classic and unusual ways.Things get worse when Michael drinks David's blood during a so called party and becomes a creature of the night.Now it's up to Sam and Frog Brothers to kill those bloodsuckers and save Michael and the others.The movie's going' in a very different way from the moment it starts.Of course it has some really effective scares but mainly The Lost Boys looks like a first class comedy seeking to entertain the audience by using the vampire myth and it definitely succeeds.The movie has a clear direction,a fun script,a great soundtrack which reminds us we're watching a definite 80's movie and a wisely chosen cast including Jason Patrick,Dianne Wiest,the great Kiefer Sutherland and the two Coreys who bring extra fun with their performances;Corey Haim and Corey Feldman with some good character actors like Edward Herrmann and Barnard Hughes.You want a different look in vampire myth? Go see 'THE LOST BOYS'!</fullReview>

Has some good scares in it no doubt but i would not classify this as a horror movie though it is about vampires. The music in this film also makes it really cool. I have no idea what the name of the song is they use but it really adds a lot of emotional depth to the film and just makes it seem cooler whenever i'ts played. The ending isn't as good as I would have hoped but that's okay cause the movie is still pretty cool. The twist in the end is something you knew was coming half way through the movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**May contain spoilers** I first saw this movie about a year ago, it was my mom's idea to rent it. When she told me it was scary I didn't believe her. But she was right. Its kinda un-nerving.The Lost Boys just screams 80's but thats whats so awesome about it. The performances by all are outstanding. Dianne Wiest is perfect as Lucy Emerson, the mom trying to rebuild her life with her sons after a divorce. Corey Haim and Jason Patric, have really good screen chemistry(being brothers) and give realism to the movie. Grandpa (Barnard Huges) is funny, as the eccentric old man, and who could forget the amazingly funny Frog Brothers (Corey Feldman, and Jamison Newlander, loved the Chuck Norris/Rambo voices!Jami Gertz is good in her role as Star, the only girl vampire in the movie, her and Jasons chemistry is breathe taking. Max (Edward Herrmann) is really versatile, being able to play the lovable video clerk, as well as the deranged head vampire. The Lost Boys (Dwayne, Marko and Paul) all play their roles wickedly, with just enough humor to be likable. Lastly there's David(Kiefer Sutherland) the leader of the head boys, his portrayal of David is hauntingly refreshing, he's charismatic enough to lure you in, but evil enough to make you want to run, he steals the show, IMO. Overall this movie is one of my favorites, it's a cult classic, with just enough of a mix of humor, romance, action, and horror, to appeal to almost anyones tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the coolest films of the 80's, and one which still stands up to today's impressions of 'coolness', The Lost Boys is an entertaining mix of horror and comedy, filled with great performances, which had a massive influence on the both Buffy the Vampire Slayerm and teen horror movies of today. Made for the MTV generation, the films stars are all good-looking and charismatic, but unlike todays 'stars', they do not try to steal the spotlight or feed their own egos.Diane West and her two sons move to a new seaside town after a divorce, staying with her father while she decides what to do with her life. The town seems good at first, and she is quickly offered a job by a local shop owner Max. Meanwhile her sons explore the town, which seems to have a history of missing people. Her youngest, Sam played by Haim looks at the comic store where he meets the Frog brothers who insist on giving him a vampire comic which they claim may save his life. The older brother Michael follows a beautiful girl around, Star-only to find that she is part of a biker gang led by David (Sutherland). Michael finds out that David and his gang are vampires, and that if he wants Star he must become one. He completes the first stage by drinking blood. becoming paranoid, Sam believes that the town is full of Vampires and thinks his brother has become one, and they soon try to work out how to prevent Michael and Star changing. With the help of the Frog Brothers, Feldman and Newlander they try to work out who the Head vampire is, as his death will save the others. So begins many laughs and scares before the final fight.In the style of Home Alone, the film tries to be inventive with household goods being turned into weapons, giving the film that mix of comedy and horror; The vampires are coming, the kids must prepare, but all they have are water pistols. The two Coreys are particularly good, making us wonder why they never got bigger parts, and Sutherland shines as the boss of his gang. Many twists ensue, the music is effective in enhancing the mood, and there are plenty of one-liners to remember. Probably the most entertaining Vampire movie ever, dark but not bleak, funny but not absurd, The Lost Boys is influential and should be enjoyed by all fans of Buffy, and be respected by critics as it is not just a simple, bland teen film. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the movies that defined my youth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea how to reconcile the Joel Schumacher who directed this moody, classic thriller with the idiot who would later ruin the Batman franchise.But not to begin on a negative note. I think I first saw this movie when I was six or seven years old. Needless to say it scared the crap out of me and burned itself into a small part of my memory that it has occupied ever since. As I grew older, I came to understand the symbolism in the movie as well as it's amazing mood and feel.Anyway, this film is about teenage rebellion. In this case, the oldest son falls in with the "wrong crowd" in a major way. But, as with many memorable movie, things are never that simple. You can feel the peer pressure that Michael is under when the group is all chanting his name and urging him to drink the bottle of blood. The presence of the beautiful girl in the group doesn't make things any easier either. I think a lot of us can put ourselves in Michael's position at 18 years old and know we'd probably cave in and fall into the situation just like he did.What follows is a freaky journey into a reckless world beyond anything Michael or any other kid would ever truly experience. All set to a fantastic soundtrack. "Cry Little Sister" gets my nomination for best movie theme song ever. The movie truly creates it's own world and draws viewers in.That being said...it's not absolutely perfect. The younger brother and his friends the Frog Brothers seem there purely for comic relief that is a little unnecessary. The whole thing with Max and the climax of the film is also a little rushed.Regardless, however, this is one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen. If you haven't watched it, you absolutely have to rent it one night with your friends, family or significant other...make some popcorn, turn out the lights and spend 100 minutes immersed in this freaky little classic.</fullReview>

I like the fact that the vampires look like normal people until they attack and that's when they actually look like vampires (which freaked me out). Kiefer Sutherland was good in this movie. He was very creepy. Jason Patric also good and some nice eye candy too. The two Coreys were just cute and entertaining at trying to act tough. Well, I thought this was a very good vampire movie and it was actually watchable! I think most vampire movies these days are just plain stupid, over cliched, and just totally unwatchable.

		<shortDescription>An 80's horror flick which stands the test of time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Scream all horror films seem to use the same mold, the same kind of humour and very little to set them apart from any other horror film. What happened to the clever black-comedy? Lost Boys still after all these years is yet to surpassed. It's clever, funny and stylish (apart from the clothes and the haircuts). I find that one of the most unbelievable things about The Lost Boys, is that the quality of the cinematography is still really good for a film which is over 15 years old, and the soundtrack still sounds quite fresh, compare other films of the same era and they sound and look really dated and most of the time you feel slightly embarrassed that you liked them in the first place. It's a shame that Hollywood lost the ability to make a decent horror film, now all that remains for us to see is if anyone out there can you rescue this dying genre.</fullReview>

And the surreal childrens voices lilting in the background portray the situation beautifully. The contrast in the movie is amazing, comic relief, horror, and that subtle sense of misunderstanding all carry the film wonderfully.- My brother said to say that his favourite scene was when Max came around for dinner and the frog brothers and sam attempted to unvail his underlying bloodsucking tendencies. The cast is great and i bet everyone after seeing this movie wants a dog just like nanook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no doubt. The Lost Boys is my kind of film. It's just got it all, and even more. Funny, spooky, good-looking and weird, this is the film I have seen the most times by far. Kiefer Sutherland is the greatest in this film, and everyone else, especially Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, are also quality. I cannot ever get bored of this, this is the perfect cult film, the best film to put on video when you want to be entertained. The critics hated it, but what do they know? This is the best film of the 80's, and of any time. The soundtrack treads uneasily between brilliance and badness, but when it's good, it's really good. Forget Fright Night, Vamp, Weird Science, The Breakfast Club or any other contemporary 80's teen movie. As good as they are (and some of them are really good), they don't hold a candle to The Lost Boys. Just where are all of these actors now? I haven't seen Jamison Newlander (who plays Allan Frog) in any other film, as well as Brooke McCarter and Billy Wirth (the two lost boys who aren't Sutherland and Alex Winter). Some of the scenes in this are brilliant, truly brilliant: the bit when The Lost Boys lead Michael (Jason Patric) to the edge of the cliff on his bike is superb, and the scene on the train bridge is genuinely creepy. Hey,the film's not perfect, who cares? For the most part this film makes my night. 80's entertainment at it's best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the horrible, horrible excuses for vampire movies in our pop culture these days, it's refreshing to revisit a top-notch example of the genre done oh-so-right. The Lost Boys is an 80's masterpiece, with amazing performances by the entire cast. It shows that vampires were once modern and hip without being manufactured exclusively for thirteen year old girls. Sure, the Corey's were at the pinnacle of teen heartthrob status in 1987, but there is more than enough in the rest of the film to satisfy beyond that demographic. Kiefer Sutherland is possibly the coolest vampire ever on the silver screen, and the subject matter is appropriately dark without being overly disturbing or sacrificing moments of levity.Really, it's a great film that's held up very well over the years. Although I doubt that the Twilight crowd would agree, but then again if they had any taste they wouldn't like Twilight in the first place.</fullReview>

Some strange kids inhabit the place and when older son Jason Patric spots Jamie Gertz in a tight fitting blouse among them, the old raging hormones do take over. Kiefer Sutherland heads the gang and believe me they've got quite an initiation rite.His older brother's strange behavior is concerning Corey Haim and the only people who share his concern are a couple of brothers named Frog, played by Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander. It's rumored that Santa Clara has been a haven for vampires for many years, but the only two who want to do anything about it are the brothers Frog. Until now.The Lost Boys was one of the great Eighties Brat Pack movies, with a cast full of tongue in cheek performances. The Coreys, Haim and Feldman, were at the high points of their respective careers as teenage idols and they both show why they were. Best in the film however are Dianne Weist as their absolutely clueless mother and Edward Herrmann who employs her at his video store.There's a sequel coming out 21 years after this film made its debut. I'm trying to picture Haim, Feldman, and Newlander fighting another crowd of teenage vampires.Anyway you got to love a film with a pair of characters named Frog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fabulous late-80s vampire fare....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was made in 1987, and it still looks cool. Kiefer Sutherland sports a height-of-eighties-fashion bleach-blonde mullet and he still looks cool. It's a fabulous mix of vampire/teen/comedy/horror and nearly 20 years after it's release, it still remains a favourite amongst many movie fans, and this has to be one of the most popular vampire movies of all time. Every child of the eighties knows and loves it, and the plot rings true with anyone who's been roped into doing something slightly dodgy by some git who's cooler than you are.The story centres on Michael Emerson. He, his mother and brother have recently moved to Santa Carla after his mother's divorce. With nothing to do until school starts, he spends his evenings mooching around the beachfront's boardwalk and eventually falls in with a motorcycle gang. Who just so happen to be vampires. Nothing unusual there, then. Egged on by the gang, Michael unwittingly drinks blood, which gradually transforms him into a vampire. Michael's brother enlists help from a pair of vampire hunting brothers to save Michael (and the rest of the town). The cast are superb ? they're all pretty 80s youngsters, obviously employed because of their market value at the time, but decent actors nonetheless. Jason Patric is perfect as Michael, the gorgeous but gullible new kid in town, who falls for the beautiful Star and unknowingly, descends into vampirism to get closer to her. Kiefer Sutherland does a great turn as the ultra-cool, menacing (but seductively persuasive) leader-of-the-pack-vampire, David. The vampire gang are impossibly cool, the epitome of 80s fashion and teen attitude. Not to mention having cast Alex Winter as Marco - Bill S. Preston Esquire with fangs! Jami Gertz's Star is fittingly mysterious and evasive, but for me, the real stars of the show are the Frog brothers - teenage vampire hunters/comic bookstore owners, fighting the good fight for Justice, Truth, and The American Way. Michael's brother Sam enlists their help to put a stop to vampirism taking over his family (and, eventually, the town). With lines like "Kill your brother. You'll feel better" they're the best bit of comic relief in this movie. Corey Haim manages a good performance as Sam, Michael's younger brother and Diane Wiest is fab as their unsuspecting mother.The entire film really looks good too. It's comically gory, lots of body parts exploding, stakings and burnings. And it contains some of the more 'realistic' vampire-esquire makeup effects ? the vampires look like they really would like to tear your face off. Although the movie is nearly 20 years old, apart from certain elements of hairstyles and clothing, (like David's choice mullet and Star's exploding-poodle-style perm) it doesn't look that dated at all, and has a cracking 80s power ballad soundtrack. Set in Santa Carla's beachfront (so named to avoid associations between Santa Cruz and the film's gang-related themes.) it's full of carnival music, twinkling lights and sparkling nighttime beaches, which give it a slightly surreal atmosphere. Think what it'd be like living in Blackpool permanently. I think I'd turn to vampirism just for something to do. Of course there's always the token struggle between good and evil, from Michael's Mother nearly sucumbing to the charms of the head vampire, and Michael almost being shoved across the line into fully fledged vampirism, but it's all still very entertaining. Slightly darker than a teen movie, but just as fun, this will remain a firmly beloved classic for at least another 20 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets better with every viewing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie came out when I was like six years old. Here is a brief little plot-summary: Michael and Sam are two teenage brothers who are moving with their recently divorced mother to Sante Carlo, California to stay with their eccentric grandfather. It is clear from the get go that Sante Carlo is an anything but normal town. This is explained by shots of the people while a cover of the Doors' "People are Strange" plays over the opening credits. Within a few days, Michael has already found the wrong girl and hooked up with the wrong crowd. Pretty soon, he's hanging out (litteraly) all night and sleeping all day. Sam, being the comic freak that he is, knows that's something is up and finds assistance by a coupla dorks who claim to be vampire killers. How would I describe this film? Entertaining. Pure and simple. It is the definitive "style over substance" flick and that is just fine by me. This movie is all about entertaining the viewer and nothing else. Over the last thirteen years, I have seen this movie probably about thirty times and it has yet to get old. It is also a great time capsule of the 80s. There is a highly polished look to the whole thing, the music is awesome, and the good looking cast doesn't hurt. When you watch this today, you might find some things to be hilarious. For example, that singer on stage with the oiled biceps, playing the sax. Watch that scene with a few friends, and you might find that the laughter is highly contagious. I would have to say that my favorite character would be the grandfather. He had the best one-liners in the movie and his prescence alone, kept me laughing. I also think that this is one of Corey Feldman's best movies. He didn't have a whole lot of screen time, but he did give a fun, convincing performance and it would be cool to reunite the two Coreys for a sequel. If you are one of the few people who have yet to see this, you're missing out. This is what great horror flicks should be. Pure fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Growing up I watched this movie countless times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It didn't really stay with me but remains a movie I thought was wonderful growing up and were I to see it again I'd probebly enjoy it, though I doubt I'd go banannas over it like when I was a kid.It's a nice fun young person vampire flick. I'm not a big fan of vampire movies but have seen a few-this is not a scary type movie, more a fun one of two boys who move to a small town on the west coast and get mixed up with a bunch of vampires. Best of all, this movie introduced me to Jason Patrick who's quite the talented actor. Many I know, became major fans of his, through this movie.Lost boys is light, it's fun, pretty setting-decent acting-a gem for today's kids groing up who may not have seen it. I myself saw it so much as a kid I got horribly sick of it and vowed not to watch it again but I'll probebly see it once more in the future. This movie is a must see for fans of vampire movies, it's no longer a favorite of mine at all, but a great movie for kids(actually all ages) and a fun quirky one-check it out if you haven't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At its best, Joel Schumacher's THE LOST BOYS is a witty and affectionate spoof of the vampire genre a la FRIGHT NIGHT, with good '80s effects work from Greg Cannom and a script that is littered with references to vampire movie folklore and films that have preceded it. At its worst, this is extremely dated and cheesy dumb entertainment, cynically aimed to exploit the younger market by mixing then-popular child stars with teenagers as their peers, and very few adults (I think perhaps three in total) in the cast. I know a lot of people hate Schumacher's work, but I remain pretty much ambivalent about this and his 8MM; I can enjoy the films for their merits but am also acutely aware of their failings.At least THE LOST BOYS is fast-paced, and easy enough to just sit back with and enjoy at face value. Although the costumes and mullet-style hairstyles have sadly dated, the age-old story of human vs. vampires can never really grow old, whatever the setting, so the '80s cheesiness is never overwhelming (except in the soundtrack, occasionally, in which atmospheric singing is mixed with clunky heavy metal rubbish). Schumacher keeps his tricksy, MTV-style visuals to a thankful minimum and packs the film with lots of jokes for it to appeal to a wide audience. The idea of a youthful vampire "gang" of male teenagers is used for its showy value alone (motorbike riding at night; midnight dare jumps off railway bridges) yet the themes are never fully explored above a comic-book simplicity. The makeup of the vampires isn't used until the latter stages of the film, which is for the best, and largely effective (somehow a few prosthetics and scary contact lenses work wonders).The trio of intrepid, GOONIES-style heroes are played by the two Coreys, that is Haim and Feldman, and the relatively unknown Jamison Newlander who takes a back seat in action. I'm pretty nonchalant when it comes to the two Coreys, but your mileage may vary: Feldman was always appearing in the movies I enjoyed back as a kid in the '80s, so I guess I was a bit of a fan of his, although I'm not too sure about his unsuccessful adult career later on in life. The ever-wooden Jason Patric (the "star" of the disastrous SPEED 2) is the handsome but poorly-acting male lead, complete with designer stubble, a greasy mullet and '80s padded leather jacket; unfortunately he has the most complex performance of the cast as he struggles to balance his human and vampire halves, although thankfully with so many minor characters he isn't focused upon too often. Jami Gertz is the bland female love interest, whilst Dianne Wiest and Edward Herrmann give strong support as the two lead adults.As for the vampire pack, two actors are distinctive: Kiefer Sutherland and Alex Winter. Winter (better known for his role in BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE) manages to genuinely look creepy as his weirdo vampire, and that's good because that's ALL he has to do. Sutherland, meanwhile, puts in a thoroughly nasty turn as the chief vampire and it's a delight to see him get his comeuppance (what, you're surprised?) - in fact he's the best actor in the film and this is his most famous early mainstream performance as far as I can recall. The rest of the vampire gang are pretty unmemorable and just kind of blend into one.THE LOST BOYS boasts an exciting, frenetic climax of spook house-show shenanigans as the vampires launch a frenzied attack on a rapidly-becoming-destroyed house, complete with taps bursting, stairways smashing down and all manner of huge explosions. Then there are the messy final disintegrations of the vampires which act as an interesting precursor and influence on the later mayhem of 1996's FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, with vampires dissolving in holy water, bleeding, getting impaled, and exploding. My only complaint is that Sutherland doesn't dissolve after being staked - surely a missed opportunity for a fine piece of gooey special effects work. THE LOST BOYS may not engage the brain particularly, but it's harmless stuff and quite entertaining if you don't take it too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Several lost boys but, unfortunately, only one lost girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1987, "The Lost Boys" chronicles events in a Northern California coastal town after a mother and two sons move there from Phoenix. The older son, Michael (Jason Patric), gets involved with a wild local gang led by the sinister David (Kiefer Sutherland) while the younger son, Sam (Corey Haim), hangs out with two geeky vampire hunters (Corey Feldman &amp; Jamison Newlander). Meanwhile the mother (Dianne Wiest) starts dating a supposedly suspicious shop owner, Max (Edward Herrmann). A young Jami Gertz plays the sole babe. This is a stylish and hip vampire flick that expertly meshes horror and humor. I usually don't like horror-comedies, but this one works well. The horror is pretty horrifying (in a fun way) while the comedy is consistently amusing. The coastal California locations are superb. However, the excellent train trestle sequence was shot in Alabama (see below). I generally don't like 80's new wave pop rock, but the soundtrack is enjoyable, particularly the creative Lost Boys Theme "Cry Little Sister" by Gerard Mcmann (with a catchy chorus sung by children). "Lost in the Shadows" by Lou Gramm is good as well. INXS, Roger Daltry and Echo And The Bunnymen also have songs on the soundtrack, the latter group doing a mid-80's version of The Doors' "People Are Strange," which is very close to the original song and actually sounds like its Jim Morrison singing. The sax-playing beefcake sequence featured one-hit wonder Tim Cappello playing "I Still Believe."Speaking of beefcake, this zeroes in on my problem with this movie: There are multiple lost boys, but only one lost girl. Although Gertz is good-looking she's always wearing a long skirt and so we never get a good look at her beyond her face (and I'm not talking about nudity, btw), with the exception of a campfire sex scene that doesn't work because it's premature and overall lame. Needless to say, a mid-80s horror flick without babes is scandalous. Director Joel Schumacher needed to take notes from the six Friday the 13th movies that had been released by the time "The Lost Boys" was shot. Oh, wait, Schumacher is gay; nevermind. While the movie was largely shot in Santa Cruz, California, the vampire cave entrance was 350 miles south at Rancho Palos Verdes whereas the train trestle sequence was shot in Bayou Canot, Mobile, Alabama. The boys were able to jump into the underlying fog because the river was only 12-15 feet below, although the movie gives the impression that they were way higher up. Interior shooting was done in the studio at Burbank. The movie runs 97 minutes.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So 80s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want the ultimate feeling of an 80s movie, you will receive it from the very first beginning. Nice and funny and kind of nostalgic, but gets weaker as the plot moves on. Even the cast is exemplary for a movie from this decade. I really like to see Corey Feldman acting as the though guy even though he is still not a grown up. There are some parallels to the movie Stand by me. Although Alex Winter is playing just a short role, he is fun to watch. Not very believable in his role, but very likable (almost always grinning). The soundtrack is nice and totally fits. On the whole Jan Fischer couldn't decide what he wanted the movie to be. Horror or Comedy? In the end it's not a mix but an alteration of both and I don't think that worked out well enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay to watch and definitely better than that rubbish Twilight Saga.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember liking this film more back when it came out. I anticipated it after my first time seeing a commercial for it on TV. It is definitely a movie of its time. Revisiting it twenty years after its release, I kind of saw it in a different way and now almost thirty years later, my feelings haven't really changed. Although this film is far from bad and it certainly is better than any of those recent rubbish Twilight movies, there has always been something unsatisfactory about it. Like my main problem has always been the rushed ending. The vampire tribe were probably the most compelling characters and then they get killed off so quickly. I mean, how did Paul (Brooke McCarter) allow himself to be so vulnerable when he sees all that garlic and holy water in the bathtub? He tells Edgar and Alan, "Garlic don't work, boys!" and then he gets the holy water splashed in his face and then basically dies a quick death. I like the effect of the blood and the water that basically bursts through the drains and the pipes from the kitchen and bathroom. But it could've been drawn out a bit more, I think. Another thing is how the hell was the scrawny little Corey Haim able to defeat Billy Wirth? It just didn't seem plausible to me. On the whole, the movie does have decent character development such as between the brothers Michael and Sam (Jason Patrick and Corey Haim, respectively) and even the delightful underused character of Grandpa (Barnard Hughes). Then things get even more interesting as they settle into the town of Santa Carla. The whole thing has an alluring vibe to it and some of the dialogue is even quite amusing. I like how the whole thing plays out, but things become unnecessarily hurried especially after Michael is outside Sam's window and Sam says, "What are you? The Flying Nun?" I like the tongue in cheek humor. There are some things about it that work, but it's pretty much a middle-of-the-road movie for me. My grade: C.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a mixed bag of Vampirism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It truly is a mixture. It is as gory as all heck. It tries to be funny. The cast is really doing a good job at being either a vampire, a vampire hunter or a totally clueless mom. BUT it never seems to make up its mind as to what exactly it wants to be.It's fun to see "Baby Kiefer Sutherland" who could easily have played the vampire without bothering with those painful contacts (read the trivia page). He is pretty much re-playing the mean bully-boy he played in "Stand By Me" only with teeth. "Marco" looked familiar and he turned out to have been either Bill or Ted who had an Excellent Adventure.Corey Feldman had perfected this particular role by the time he made The 'Burbs. I like Dianne Wiest but she whispers in that high, feathery voice of hers and it's difficult to hear or understand what she is saying.Anyway ... mixed bag. OK as a comedy, sort of scary. Actually, laughed at some of what was SUPPOSED to be frightening. Nothing to go crazy trying to find.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people say that vampires during recent decades which were the 80's, 90s and now haven't been the best since Dracula came onto our screens in 1931. In my personal opinion, I think it depends on what the film entails and the reason for it being the best. I would reckon this film is one of the best.I really like how they got actors who aren't really famous because they didn't need to be Hollywood's great to be good, they were truly good. The only person I did recognised was Alex Winter as one of the biker men. He was involved in 'Bill and Ted's excellent adventure'. He actually did look like a real biker with hair extensions and wearing a black biker jacket. The hair extensions probably hurt I reckon haha!I thought Jami Gertz as Star looked absolutely beautiful, she still is and like, she seems to be such a pro as an actress! I never seen her before in films that I've seen. I'm glad they got her character and Jason Patric's character Michael together, they were definitely a match, I was over the moon!Didn't anyone think Corey Haim looked so much like the kid from 6th sense? I thought he looked 110% like Haley Joel Osment, they are literally clones honestly. He actually was adorable as a teenager but like all of us, our faces change when we get older so he's not the same anymore! He was also a great actor!If you're bored and feel like you wanna watch a vampire movie, go ahead and watch this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic to remind us of how a modern vampire movie should at least be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amid these days' stupid vampire movies where the vampires glow under sunlight, this movie sure is a classic example of how a vampire movie should be at the very least. Stories about vampires have dated back even before Bram Stoker's Dracula story. I guess there's something in the whole pseudo-immortality that allures people into watching or reading more and more vampire stories. Yet new stories shouldn't mess with the more critical point of the lore, like making them glow under sunlight. In a way one can also say that the whole glow under the sunlight thing comes from diluting two parts of the lore depicted in this movie; that vampires glow in the dark and that the half vampires are still able to withstand sunlight. I like how the movie put its twists, even with clues here and there one can still fall for its story flow and suspend their findings. The acting overall seems very much a standard. But for me again the still is a great one in terms of a vampire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Lost Boys" is one of those movies that walks the line between awesome and silly, but never really goes overboard. There's a surprising likability to the entire movie, vampire darkness steeped in teen movie, and it feels like something that would've gone off the rails in lesser hands. But what I really like about this movie is that it is shamelessly a product of its time; the formidable array of mullets, the look, the feel. There's no way to remake this without genericizing the hell out of it. No lubed-up sax guy, no deal. And speaking of the '80s, this is definitely one of the really good soundtrack movies. Who knew Echo and the Bunnymen would do a great Doors cover? And I admit no shame in saying that I've always liked the Lou Gramm song. I don't care if it's overwrought, "Lost in the Shadows" represents this movie to me. Not sure what it is, but it's cool."The Lost Boys" is a lot of fun, definitely in the midnight movie vein. It should always be watched with like-minded friends.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chamber Goth Style To Spare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing to me how fresh this movie feels in 2015, even as it radiates late 80s style. The Lost Boys really relied on great characters, then took it up a notch by layering atmospheric visuals and a well matched soundtrack. It keeps a perfect balance between the Gothic angst of Michael's storyline and goofy humor with the two Coreys. There were some stretches where it dragged, but also had some editing that today's movies could really learn from. The best example of this comes during the climactic final act, when the final showdown between heroes and vampires gets down to business. And that business is killing off bloodsuckers in a highly satisfying fashion. Most movies would drag this sequence out with lingering deaths and tension- killing chases. Here, everything is nicely timed, especially the head vampire Max. He reveals himself, beats up all the heroes, then holds a young son hostage and forces the mother to join him in a matter of seconds. And just as it looks completely hopeless, grandpa comes crashing in and gets the final word. It made me remember how I felt as a teen, watching with friends on a rented VHS tape. I can still hear Kiefer Sutherland calling, "Michael...Michael..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is a truly excellent film. I remember how gobsmacked I was when I first watched it as a young teenager. That haunting boy choir melody takes me immediately back to the first time I saw it and gives me a chill!This is a film that beautifully blends two elements that don't always go well together: comedy and horror. It gets it so right I'm not even sure how Joel Schumacher pulled it off. The serious and scary characters like Kiefer Sutherland's menacing David are offset beautifully by Sam, and the Frog brothers.These two sides of the film sit neatly beside each other without ever really coming together until the climactic end. It would have been very easy indeed for this film to end up neither funny nor scary but somehow it manages to be both through neat dialogue, simple jokes, and outstanding pacing.I sat through this again last night for the first time in years and I savoured every minute, and was stunned to see a lowly rating of 7.2 on here.

		<fullReview>People are strange when they get caught in the rain. So goes the song that opens this comedy horror hit set in a small California town where the teen population is made up by 50% living and 50% Undead. Dianne Wiest is returning to her hometown with her children to live with her father (Bernard Hughes), a crotchety grouch who keeps a supply of his special soda which is off limits to his grand kids, and forgets to reveal certain secrets of the town to his returning child. The oldest son, disillusioned by having to have left his old home, manages to make new friends, but unfortunately they are the wrong kind of friends.Shortly before the family was seen driving up the California coast into the town, an amusement park was invaded by the teen night creatures who prayed down on a couple making out in their car, turning them into a late night snack. Wiest plays her typical happy-go-lucky single mom, and finds romance by getting a job at the local video store, finding romance with her boss, eligible bachelor Edward Herrmann. She's disturbed by the presence of the strange teenagers who come in, and the caustic conversation that occurs between them and Herman. The younger son gets mixed up with a bunch of strange kids whom we later find out are on the search for evidence of how they can destroy these midnight teen creatures.The violence increases, the blood flows, and yes if you haven't figured it out already, these lost boys (and girls) are vampires. That even includes a little boy, turned into a night creature desperate for nutrition for the human plasma. The idiotic teenage vampire hunters begin to suspect that Hermann might be the head vampire, and when a plot to expose him involving garlic doesn't work, it seems like they are on the wrong track. But is it too late for the older son? He seems to be turning into one of them, and if choosing the wrong crowd can get him turning into a creature of the night, then he doesn't have a chance of avoiding the stake.Sleep all day! Party all night! That is the promise that the older son's new friends give him, and all it will take is one last drink of the red liquid to complete their mission. But with evidence creeping in on this rough teenage crowd, it seems like the mirror of their souls will not be reflected as time runs out. This is horror comedy at its best, certainly not quite as gruesome as the scary movie films but definitely much better. There are lots of surprises along the way, and then there's a musical opus that is almost classic as a film reaches its dramatic and violence conclusion. Veteran actor Bernard Hughes gets a great tag-line, being sort of the Sylvia Sidney ("Mars Attacks") hero to save the day, although he doesn't use bad music like Slim Whitman to do so.One of the great top popcorn films of the late 1980s, this was the film that established Dianne Wiest as one of my favorite actresses. She had started off in mostly supporting neurotic parts, and with "The Lost Boys", she began playing kindly moms confused by their children, and here, started the trend. After this along came "Parenthood", "Cookie", and my favorite of her parts on screen, the Avon lady mom in "Edward Scissorhands". There is some stupid comedy with the two vampire hunting teens, as they seem more like pals of Sean Penn's from " Fast Times at Ridgemont High", but perhaps their characters influenced the creation of Buffy, the vampire slayer. It is a must for horror movie fans, and more than 25 years later, it seems like something just so fresh, almost like it came out yesterday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most notorious vampire movies ever made is The Lost Boys, a film that brought together Corey Haim and Cody Feldman, off to teen stardom. The surrounding cast were all solid in the film, all being respected, and well-known actors and actresses that include Jason Patric, Dianne Wiest, Jami Gertz, Edward Herrmann and Kiefer Sutherland. The story is original, having a lot of comedy and scares mixed within each other beautifully. It's also a really tough tossup on which brothers have the better character duo, between The Emersons or The Frogs. The story also stays faithful to vampire lore and has some decent special effects. It seems the one thing that was somewhat lacking was the use of a good instrumental theme song or soundtrack. There are many who enjoy the music to The Lost Boys so that was something that wasn't really my taste. Although, the ending while entertaining and hilarious, it was rather predictable. Otherwise besides those gripes, The Lost Boys is definitely a one of a kind vampire movie, and even with strong competition it's easy to say it's one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Finally Figured Out Why I Love This Film So Much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is one of the best vampire movies ever made. To me, it is one of the best horror movies in general. What so many horror movies miss are the proper connections with the actual story and characters, and the horror elements. The Lost Boys has deep meaning (which I consider to be allegorical) which takes advantage of the horror, not the other way around. That is why the majority of horror movies are all mindless.The films follows teenage brothers Michael and Sam (Patric, Haim) who move with their mother Lucy (Weist) to their grandfather's house (Hughes). Sam makes friends with brother vampire hunters (Feldman, Newlander) who caution his every move, while Michael befriends a mysterious group who make him a part of them. You guessed it, vampires! Soon, both pairs of brother must band together to take down the head vampire to turn Michael back to normal.Moving to a new town is very scary: new schools, new jobs, new friends. Peer pressure always gets the better of you. You do whatever you can to fit in and a lot of the time there's no going back. That is pretty much the case with Michael. He follows Jami Gertz which leads him to "the lost boys." They are mysterious so he is interested. He tries to go back when he uncovers what he has become, but he cannot. In real life, when somebody starts smoking out of pressure, it is super rare to break that habit right away. The only way for Michael to stop being a vampire is either by death or killing the head vampire, whomever that may be. Sam, on the other hand, is stronger and wiser. He outright rejects Feldman and Newlander right away, only returning to them later. Had it been Michael, he would have accepted them right away. As a horror movie, there has to be a strong scare factor in order to work. These vampires are actually terrifying. Some of these are the scariest vampires ever put to film. Even more scary than many innovative horror movies these days, no gross or stupid. The vampire bits are not even the only good parts. The astonishing vampire bits are just a plus. That is why the story and characters support the horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is quite simply one of the greatest achievements in film of the modern age of humanity. It is an understated masterpiece worthy of the cinematic genius of the likes of all the Oscar-worthy wonders of 1939 even, possibly greater.Okay I'm just messing with you all. ha. Look, The Lost Boys is quite simply this: If you're into the whole 80's scene, love 80's movies, love horror and more particularly you love your horror vampire style and slightly flavoured with campy 80's goofiness, then you will absolutely love this film.The two Coreys bring their usual A game to the affair, as does Keifer Sutherland. It's well-cast and about as well-acted as this level of writing allows for. The soundtrack to this movie in particular stands out for me, even today.The whole vampire craze among movie fans is greater today than it was in the 80's, and although this film might pale by comparison to a lot that have come along since, it's still a fun watch and is actually one of the ones that over time is fun to watch again... which is something I can't say for a lot of other movies of it's time.Just have fun with it, and don't take it too seriously or it will definitely leave you wanting.6/10 + 1 for "Cry little sister" song = 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a classic, 80s vampire comedy-horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark, daring, haunting, humorous, lovable and somewhat intriguing; the Lost Boys is one of my most-loved comedy-horrors ever and it's full of fun, yet scary moments guaranteed to make you back off, or jump, depending on your age. It's so fun - and the Frog brothers really make it great, they're just so awesome. The Lost Boys is very different; but it's great knowing it's an 80s film. Superb comedy-horror with very unexpected and jumpy moments. It's a real classic and it's one of the greatest films of the 1980s; without a doubt. 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manages to Effectively Combine Comedy with Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that manages to effectively combine comedy with horror to yield a pretty enjoyable movie. Essentially, a mother by the name of "Lucy" (Dianne Wiest) and her two sons, "Michael" (Jason Patric) and "Sam" (Corey Haim) have left Phoenix and have just arrived at her father's house in Santa Clara, California. That night Michael sees a beautiful woman who goes by the name of "Star" (Jamie Gertz) and decides to make her acquaintance. However, after following her he encounters a gang of bikers led by a man named "David" (Kiefer Sutherland) with whom Star happens to hang out with. But these are no ordinary bikers. Meanwhile, Sam encounters two boys in a comic book store named "Edgar Frog" (Corey Feldman) and "Alan Frog" (Jamison Newlander) who claim to be vampire hunters and after giving Sam their phone number tell him to pray that he never needs to call them. At any rate, as I stated earlier this was a pretty good movie which mixes action, suspense and comedy together very well. And while there are a few minor plot holes here and there I still found it quite entertaining and have rated it as slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sweet mother of Moses. If the quality of a film is to be judged on its homo-erotica and/or penetrative incest, then this movie gets a near perfect score. As Michael and Sam made doe-eyes at each other, body fluids exited my lady orifice with gushing ecstasy. Tears of blood also came unbidden, which - being a vampire myself - I lapped up eagerly.I have to say that the film was very true to the vampire lore. Yes, I have an aversion to holy water, and when I drank some by mistake last Easter I had a stomach ache for *days*. The not so good points: When the older brother pretended like he was attracted to that girl when in reality he was obviously much more interested in his brother. The farce was embarrassingly obvious and the self-denial palpable. Another drawback: The brothers' sexual tension was consummated off- screen! DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING. I hungered for a bloody bout of love- making but was left with only the furtive glances and triumphant glow in the boys' faces post-coitus. Fluent in subtext, I counted roughly 700 occurrences of off-screen love-making, so there was certainly more than ample opportunity for the negligent director to capture cinematic gold. Besides this, the film delivered a self-assured and wonderful tale of vampires and brotherly romance, leaving my armchair upholstery embarrassingly damp. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Joel Schumacher's light-weight horror chiller The Lost Boys" qualifies as an above-average vampire epic with atmospheric settings, gorgeous photography, good performances, and an interesting story. Kiefer Sutherland heads up a group of vampires who like to ride dirt bikes. Jason Patric and Corey Haim are the new kids on the block in the coastal town of Santa Clara. They live with their mother, Lucy (Dianne Wiest), who operates?of all things?a video store. Michael (Jason Patric) falls in with the wrong kids and falls immediately for a cute gal named Star (Jami Gertz of "Twister") and they fall in love. Meantime, Sam (Corey Haim) suspects that Michael has been changed into a vampire. Now, Michael sleeps a lot during the day and he wears sunglasses. Two of Sam's friends, Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan Frog (Jamison Newlander), insist that Sam kill his older brother. Things get really explosive toward the end and Schumacher gets a little gritty. One vampire that invades Sams' house but he dies when their pet pooch, Nanook, knocks him into a bathtub filled with Holy Water from a local Catholic Church. Alternately funny and then straightforward, "The Lost Boys" chronicles Michael's brief life as a vampire and his battles with David.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only is The Lost Boys praised as one of the greatest Vampire related horror movies to ever come out of cinema but it's also got elements comedy that break up the seriousness of it all and well, it works!Some of the things that I really like about The Lost Boys is the outstanding story and the acting. The bond between Sam (Corey Haim) and Michael (Jason Patric) is excellent and you really relate to their brotherly bond.The soundtrack fits the movie perfectly, hell, I'd go as far to say it's in my Top 10 favourite soundtracks of all time.Because many others have already broken this movie down and reviewed it in detail I'll keep this review short by saying if you're a fan of Vampire movies or Horror movies in general and you have yet to see this then you definitely owe it to yourself to buy a copy and give it a watch.Overall this is one of the greatest Vampire/Horror movies I've ever seen and deserves the cult following the movie has behind and supporting it to this very day. 9/10</fullReview>

If you are looking for a good vampire movie stop looking because you found one.This movie also has several plot twistsand really explores the mythology of the vampires. It tells us how toprotect yourself from vampires in a fun way while also being very serious. It also features the Frogg brothers who are hilarious.

Marginal film almost works; it has a good cast, and a most funny closing scene, but it is just too much a triumph of style over substance, and is also quite violent at times, comedic at others.

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Suspenseful Horror Comedy,One Of The Greatest Vampire FIlms Ever Made And A True Classic. Joel Schumacher At His Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is one of the greatest Vampire films ever made,an Excellent Horror Comedy that combines amazing direction,a brilliant cast,non-stop terror,great laughs,a wonderful script,a terrific score and soundtrack and fantastic special effects. All those elements make The Lost Boys one of Joel Schumacher best films,one of my favorite Vampire films and a true classic.The Lost Boys tells the story of teenage brothers Michael(Jason Patric)and Sam Emerson(Corey Haim)who along with their Mother Lucy(Dianne Wiest)have moved from Phoenix,Arizona to Santa Carla,California to move in with their Grandpa(Barnard Hughes). While in Santa Carla,Michael falls for a beautiful,but mysterious girl named Star(Jami Gertz)who runs with a gang and the leader David(Kiefer Sutherland). Unfortunately for Michael,David and his gang are blood sucking Vampires and want to bring Michael into the fold. Worried about Michael,Sam enlists the help of Vampire killers Edgar(Corey Feldman)and Alan(Jamison Newlander)The Frog Brothers to help Michael and kill the Vampires.The Lost Boys was the first Vampire movie I saw and not only is it one of my favorite Vampire films but is also one of the all time great Vampire movies and a classic because The Lost Boys is a film that is exciting and thrilling while also being a funny and over the top film that has a lot of style but great substance as well. One of the great things about The Lost Boys is the film's take on the Vampire genre. Instead of being another Vampire film with a Gothic setting The Lost Boys is set in the bright and sunny locations of Southern California with vibrant colors and neon lights which make The Lost Boys probably the lightest looking Vampire film ever made. What also makes TLB so unique and fresh is the way the Vampires look because David and his gang look like Rock stars instead of Dracula because you wouldn't think of David and his gang as blood suckers but as a Rock band waiting to perform at a concert. Their look is great and fascinating because it makes their actions so terrifying and intense. TLB is a Vampire movie that wonderfully balances the genres of Horror and Comedy mixing Suspense and laughs. The Horror works because of the scare and surprise scenes that are shocking and unexpected because the scenes happen so fast and quick putting viewers on the edge of their seat. The bloody and gory special effects are well-done and memorable but it's not too disgusting and compared to most Horror films in the 1980s the blood and gore is light. Despite being a Horror film the movie never takes itself too seriously and it's not really dark. The Comedy in TLB is hilarious because of not only the way the movie toys with the Vampire genre and it's trademarks but also the many lines and moments that happens throughout the movie where some the lines and moments are done in a straight manner or is offbeat and at times quirky. When you watch TLB you're scared but at the same time you want to laugh. TLB is a film about great style and being that the film was released in 1987 TLB is a reflection of an MTV Music video at the time with tons of music in nearly every scene,the look of the main characters and the flashy visual style with fast cuts and slow motion that makes the movie film at a fast pace that never slows down until the very end. The Lost Boys is like an MTV Music Video on Steroids. Michael and Sam are great characters because despite the things that happen to the two of them they are still brothers who love and care for one another because they are family and the relationship between the two has great depth. The screenplay by Jeffrey Boam,Janice Fischer and James Jeremias is great and quotable with dialog that is funny and slick and with fun pop culture references as well as references to other Horror films. The Action scenes are amazing,thrilling and suspenseful and when the Action happens it explodes like dynamite and will punch you in the face. The ending of The Lost Boys is brilliant and filled with excitement,twists and thrills that will have you cheering and clapping. A terrific ending.The whole cast is wonderful. Jason Patric is excellent as Michael,with Patric bringing emotion and depth to the role. Corey Haim is brilliant and funny as Sam,Michael's little brother. Kiefer Sutherland is amazing and menacing as David,the Vampire gang leader. Jami Gertz is terrific and beautiful as Star,Michael's love interest. Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander are fantastic and hilarious as Vampire killers Edgar and Alan,The Frog Brothers. Dianne Wiest is wonderful and charming as Lucy,Michael and Sam's Mother. Barnard Hughes is outstanding and funny as Grandpa,Lucy's Father. Edward Herrmann is great as Max,a video store owner and Lucy's boyfriend. Brooke McCarter(Paul),Billy Wirth(Dwayne),Alex Winter(Marko)and Chance Michael Corbitt(Laddie)give good performances as well.The direction by Joel Schumacher is brilliant and stylish,with Schumacher always moving and going wild with the camera with close-ups.zooms and great camera angles that keeps the film moving at a tight pace. Amazing direction,Schumacher.The score by Thomas Newman is fantastic,thrilling,intense and adds to the film. Great score,Newman. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by Gerard McMahon,(Cry Little Sister,The Theme From The Lost Boys),Lost In The Shadows(Lou Gramm),Echo And The Bunnyman(People Are Strange),INXS And Jimmy Barnes(Good Times And Laying Down The Law),Roger Daltrey(Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me),Ritchie Zito(I Still Believe),Run-D.M.C And Aerosmith(Walk This Way),Eddie And The Tide(Power Play),Mummy Calls(Beauty Has Her Way),Clarance 'Frogman' Henry(Ain't Got No Home)and more. Amazing soundtrack.In final word,if you love Horror-Comedies,Vampire films or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see The Lost Boys,an excellent Horror-Comedy,one of the greatest Vampire films of all time and a true classic that is Joel Schumacher at his best and is a film you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of the eighties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is, in my opinion, the best film of the eighties. I was born during the 80s so only watched this later on but still haven't changed my opinion of this. The characters give a freaky subject perfect sex appeal and also add a comedic value to the macabre topic. Back in the 80s the only vampire films out where traditional drink your blood types and this has so much more to it. The director has made this film perfect. I would describe it as an early twilight style film but without the lovey dovey story line. Keifer Sutherlands character makes the film what it is. It's his best performance as far as I am concerned and he even outshines Jason Patrics character Michael. The film centres around Michael and his change to become a vampire. Keifers character is the leader of said vampire gang and torments Michael beyond belief. Michaels brother Sam makes friends with two comic book geeks (Corey Feldman is one) and becomes a vampire hunter only to find that their mum is dating the head vampire max. Did anyone else notice Laddie's picture on the milk carton close to the beginning of the film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is not very complicated but it's very grabbing and interesting. I've seen this movie hundreds of times and it never gets old.The acting is pretty good, no one really stands out but they all gel together well, Corey Haim (RIP) was a favourite of all teens at the time. Although Jason Patric as Michael and Kiefer Sutherland as David are the most interesting characters are best friends off set.Most fans recognize Corey Haim as Sam and Corey Feldman as Edgar Frog, also known as "The Coreys" by fans are bff off set and starred in heaps of films together. The cute hottie with the comedian duo type is a show seller.Barnard Hughes as Grandpa is the movie stealer though with his one liners and old style charismatic charm. Eccentric, mysterious and quirky yet with a hidden and vast knowledge. I loved his character.The movie has great cinematography, colorful and at times Gothic. The amusement park backdrop is cheery yet suspiciously eerie. The scene of the flying vampires swooping down for their attack is bloodcurdling.The special effects are mostly vampire make-up and blood. A few death scenes are chilling yet funny and are not overdone with hardly any blood and gore.The soundtrack is amazing with awesome 80s songs that still seem rockin today. Cry Little Sister by Gerard McMann is the highlight of this movie, very creepy and disturbing, it is the perfect song to set the mood.A perfect mix of drama, mood, colour, special effects, soundtrack and acting. It has achieved cult status and deserves it. This is the best Joel Schumacher film in my opinion. It has just the right amounts of gore, horror, comedy and romance.If you haven't seen this yet do yourself a favour as it is a must for all horror fans alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable and entertaining vampire effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his brother gets mixed up with a rowdy gang in his seaside town that turns out to be a pack of vampires, a young kid teams up with a pair of local vampire-fanatics to stop him before he turns into a fully-fledged vampire.A thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining vampire effort, this one has a lot going for it that really works well. One of the main abilities of this is to actually update the traditional forms of vampire lore into a more modern and rather intriguing series of concepts that play into the era pretty nicely. Rather than feature the traditional European version of the creature that runs around dressed to impress with a focus on keeping his identity a secret at all times, this one's use of rebellious free-spirits who don't really care and figure on just draining anyone they believe will blow their identity but look and act like typical teenagers allows them to blend in quite nicely and make it seem like an attractive, worthwhile life. The updating of the hunting tricks is pretty clever as well, and the ways of incorporating them into the story makes for some nice fun, as well as the different confrontations towards the end when they invade the coven to wipe them out which generates the film's action quotient. While it's got some signs of the time present that come off as goofy, as well as a few other minor flaws, it's overall really fun and entertaining.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.</fullReview>

Divorced woman, Lucy Emerson (Wiest) and her 2 sons, Michael (Patric) and Sam (Haim) have just moved to Santa Carla, California to live with her father (Hughes). Soon, Michael and Sam discover that there's vampires living among them after Michael falls in with a gang of punks. Sam seeks help from vampire hunters, Edgar (Feldman) and his brother, Alan (Newlander) to rid them. Sutherland (24) plays punk leader, David, Gertz plays Star, an attractive girl Michael finds romance with and Herrmann (Overboard) plays Max, a man whom Lucy starts dating. This is one of the best vampire films with a good cast, good score and great make-up effects. I recommend this 80's horror classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very cool vampire flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you combine the cheesy style of 80's films and the exciting horror of vampire films The Lost Boys is what you get, and it is exactly what you would expect from an 80's vampire flick. Jason Patric and Corey Haim play two teens who just moved to a small coastal town in California, only to discover that the town may or may not be frequented by vampires. Michael (Patric) gets himself involved with this gang of punk rocker looking vamps and it's up to his brother Sam (Haim) to save him with the help of some local self proclaimed vampire hunters. Whatever you think The Lost Boys might be like, you're probably right.The Lost Boys is super cheesy, but super fun as well. The music solidifies that 80's cheese and the overall look of the characters just adds to the very time period specific quality the film has to it. There's no exceptional camera work, superbly intelligent screen writing, or dense and complex story being worked here, but The Lost Boys is definitely a lot of fun, and that's all it really strives to be. Honestly, there's really nothing wrong with this film because it does what it came here to do, tell an awesome vampire story. It does take some liberties with the vampire lore, but it's things that can be overlooked.Really, as far as this film being a vampire film goes, it really succeeds on an entertainment value level. The vampires look awesome in this film and they perfectly locate that area between being incredibly scary and really badass. We don't get any real vampire action till about halfway through the film, but it's worth the wait. There are some great human versus vampire scenes in the last half of the film, especially the final standoff between the vampires and our protagonists.The Lost Boys as a whole is a wicked cool film. It doesn't amount to much more than a neat vampire flick but it certainly excels at being one. I definitely enjoyed this film throughout. It gets a little slow and a little choppy as far as editing goes towards the middle, but it catches its footing for the final act and really pays off. The Lost Boys is simply just a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was the setting intentionally ironic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I lived in Santa Cruz, the place where this movie was filmed, when I was a kid. When I watch the movie, I wonder if they intentionally chose Santa Cruz as the setting out of irony, because Santa Cruz is one of the safest and most peaceful places in the U.S.At any rate, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's not what one would call a "good" movie. It's not the kind of movie that's going to change the world, but it's entertaining, and that's what movies are supposed to do.To sum it up: If you grew up in Santa Cruz, you'll love this movie because you'll keep recognizing places at the Boardwalk (The Giant Dipper) and the caves. You might also notice that it's an entertaining movie.If you didn't grow up in Santa Cruz, it's probably an 8 or 7. At any rate, it's a fun movie to watch.</fullReview>

First I must say I have been a huge fan since seeing the flick in 1987 at the theatre and growing up I have watch it more that 100 times. I haven't watched the movie in a little while and was curious to see how the movie would hold up now that both the film and I are both 25 years older. I was blown away how great the movie still holds up. I will be honest the first 20 minutes dragged a little watching it, but then I was totally lost in the film like I was watching for the first time. If anyone hasn't seen the movie it is a must have.

From strong leaders to carefree grandfathers, this movie had it all. The plot was simple but kept many things hidden until the end, dropping only subtle hints.

		<fullReview>This is my favourite movie of all time!!! This 80s movie has never grown old-it has the BEST cast BEST director, it has the perfect combination of cute guys (and Star for the guys), comedy and a great storyline. I REALLY wish they had done a sequel MUCH sooner though like about 2 years max after this and had all the original cast-the sequel was extremely disappointing! Corey HAIM was fantastic in this movie, really played the part the best it could be played! Joel Schumacher was an awesome director and should have done the sequels too and as I said before a LOT earlier. 20 years after the original doing a sequel was only going to work if they had the original cast and Joel!!! This movie will always be my favourite and obviously I give this a 10/10. I don't know ANYONE who doesn't like this movie! Vampire movies are the best there have been loads but none of them are a patch on this! Really hope they do a re-launch and show this at the cinema again on its 30th anniversary as I am STILL watching it and STILL LOVING it in 2012!!! LOVE LOST BOYS-THE ORIGINAL xxx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being Dated Only Adds to the Charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys screams eighties, but that is part of the reason it is so much fun. And you don't have to have grown up in the eighties to enjoy it. Is it campy? Absolutely, but a mixture of well used horror tactics, iconic lines that you will never forget, and a well rounded cast make it great. The true star of this movie is Kiefer Sutherland who delivers an astounding performance with mullet in tow. Jason Patric gives a suitable enough performance, although pales in the blinding light of Sutherland's character. Corey Haim is absolutely adorable in this and shows that although he might not be the greatest actor has more then enough talent and charm to worm his way into your heart. (Too bad he never got his comeback I personally believe the man could have gone places.) Feldman and Newlander provide comic relief as the Frogg brothers but I must admit that they get a little annoying after multiple viewings in my case anyways others might disagree. Add on top of that astounding performances from the casts veterans and you have a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review! Plus my little obsession with The Lost Boys.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! What an excellent film! This is definitely one of my favourite films, even though it is quite old. I watched this film when I was really young (I even have it on video which proves how ancient it is haha). I bought it on DVD years &amp; years ago because I love watching it. Its usually on the TV so I grab the opportunity and watch it, it never gets old. So if you haven't watched this brilliant movie then please do.Two boys and their mother move into a new town in California called Santa Carla (also known as the murder capital of the world) to live with their Grandpa after their parents divorce. The brothers soon start to discover that the loud, crowded town is swarming with blood sucking, brutal killers: Vampires! Michael, the elder brother, chases after a gorgeous girl called Star, who has recently become a vampire as well her son. Michael accidentally mixes into the vamp group, oblivious to what they are. David, the rebellious, dangerous vampire in the group, tricks Michael into drinking his vampire infested blood and he becomes partly one of them. He later realises that until you make your first kill, then you are only a half vampire. To become normal again, they have to kill the head vampire, which seems simple enough.. but they don't know who it is! Meanwhile, their mother starts working in a comic book store where she soon falls in love and starts dating the owner. He seems quite charming and lovely enough but the sons do not seem to grow a liking to him. The Frogs, who work in this comic shop, are two strange but hilarious brothers who completely hate vampires! They try to convince Sam, the youngest brother, that vampires exist by showing proof and giving him vamp comics. Sam finally believes that vampires are real and starts to help his brother become cured, although he is scared he will have to kill him.Ladies and gentlemen you will have to watch the film to find out the big but kind of obvious twist what happens. Trust me, this is a fantastic film (although it wasn't that scary for me, so if you are looking for a real bloody, gruesome, terrifying film then this is not for you). It is just classic film which is a must see as the acting and everything is just amazing. Please, give it a try :) Enjoy! I gave it a 10/10 - (I cant believe it only has 7/10 as it deserves more).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vampires done the right way in this '80s cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living in the modern era of overdone vampire stories, "The Lost Boys" makes for a worthy retro antidote. With films and TV shows full of characters who simply are vampires these days, "Lost Boys" reminds us how part of the allure of the vampire is the mystery and suspense created by not exactly knowing if someone is a vampire or even better ? suspecting it.Although it doesn't take long to realize who the vampires are in "The Lost Boys," it doesn't make their reveal any less effective. The '80s hair biker gang led by Kiefer Sutherland as David has the trappings of an iconic cinema cult of renegades who revel in their immortality. The story holds out on reviewing their true form long enough for us to take them seriously. Brothers and main characters Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) serve as perfect entry points into this vampire-infested world of small-town California. After their mom (Dianne Wiest) forces them to move in with their grandfather, Michael and Sam each uncover strange things in their new town. After chasing a girl (Jami Gertz), Michael gets caught up in this mysterious gang and finds himself avoiding sunlight among other things. When Sam takes notice, he enlists the help of the Frog brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), two comic book geeks who moonlight as vampire killers."The Lost Boys" bathes in '80s film cheese. There's boy-sees-girl-across-the-room romance, a comic book store, a carnival, gangs ... the list goes on. The film epitomizes that decade in movies, which either makes it corny or classic. I would argue that as the plot thickens, it moves from the former to the latter.The key to the film's effectiveness is the slow unveiling of the vampires. The scene in the tree where they show Michael what he has become by turning into their vampire forms and attacking their pray has a massive impact. Although we never see the transformations in process thanks to budget issues most likely, the colored contacts, make up and Joel Schumacher's approach are enough to freak you out in all the right ways. The cumulative amount of blood and guts at the climax also adds that cult-classic horror camp that will put a stupid grin on the face of any of the genre's fans.Horror elements and vampires aside, "The Lost Boys" is 100 percent '80s through and through with themes of broken families, fitting in and losers saving the day. It undoubtedly inspired some of the films of the early '90s as well. In that sense, it's not just a fun film, but an important one.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Death By Stereo"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Gen X'er work buddy of mine was shocked when he recently learned that I--a baby-boomer horror buff--had never seen the 1987 scare film "The Lost Boys." Already a cult item of sorts for those of a certain age, the film is one that had somehow slipped by me for the last 24 years...until last night, that is. And now that I've seen the picture, I can honestly say that it strikes me as a somewhat dated albeit undeniably fun outing that is regrettably deficient in the Shocks, Scares and Horror Department; still, I can understand its appeal for those who were of an impressionable age during those nascent days of MTV. In the film, we meet the Emerson brothers, Michael (the older, played by hunky Jason Patric) and Sam (an extremely endearing performance by the late Corey Haim), who move to "The Murder Capital of the World," Santa Carla, CA, with their divorced mom (the ever-cute and always dependable Dianne Wiest). Before long, Michael gets involved with a bad-boy biker gang that is actually composed of bloodsucking vampires and led by a peroxide-dyed Kiefer Sutherland, all to impress the lovely Star (Jami Gertz), and Sam realizes that his older bro is slowly turning into a creature of the night himself. Good thing that the managers of the local comic book store, the Frog brothers (some very funny van Helsing renditions here by Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), are well practiced in the art of vampire extermination....An ingratiating mixture of style, comedy and scares, served in fairly equal thirds, "The Lost Boys" is certainly a nice-looking and perfectly entertaining film. Director Joel Schumacher has given his picture a polished look that at times strongly resembles an early MTV music video, never more so than in the lovemaking scene between Michael and Star, with those soaring-in-the-clouds visuals. (Indeed, Sam even comments on his need for MTV in one scene; almost as dated a reference as his comment regarding "Dynasty" a little later!) The picture features a terrific soundtrack (very cool to hear Echo and the Bunnymen essaying The Doors classic "People Are Strange") and makes inspired use of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk for many of its action sequences. Still, as a horror film, the picture is fairly tame...until its final 20 minutes or so, however, when we are treated to some pretty impressive zombie slayings, courtesy of our brave young heroes and their garlic-infused holy-water pistols. In a film with much to admire, though, perhaps the single best element is that wonderful cast of future stars on the rise. And how fun to see Edward Herrmann, a good 13 years or so pre-"Gilmore Girls," here playing a very different sort of paterfamilias! In all, fun stuff for all ages, although some aging baby boomers may wonder what all the fuss is about, as they seek out a vampire movie with a bit less teen angst and a bit more bite....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is a horror film that knows how to use special effects to their advantage. This movie is about a family of 3, Michael and Sam who are brothers and Lucy who is the mother, which has jut moved in to a vampire-infested city where deaths and missing people are a common occurrence. Take away the vampires in this movie away and its all about peer pressure, Michael trying to prove himself, trying to prove he is tougher and stronger than he really looks. Unfortunately in doing this he falls down a path that he doesn't desire to be along but his brother Sam's love helps him stay grounded. This movie has it all it has great acting, a costume designer who knows how to demonstrate ones character, cinematography that actually makes sense and excellent mise en scene to express how truly bloodcurdling these creatures are. Michael starts to fall in love with a half vampire called Star, this is how it all started. When Michael drank David's blood he too turned into a half vampire, the only thing saving Michael from transforming into a full blooded vampire is the unconditional love from his true family and his grandfathers hobby of hunting animals and displaying them on his wall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy, scary and funny vampire movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 8/31/2010 -- 8 out of 10 (Dir-Joel Schumacher): Campy, scary and funny vampire movie that I consider a classic in the genre. Joel Schumacher, who is one of my favorite directors, blends so many things into one movie and makes it entertaining as well. The story is about a newly divorced mother and her two children moving into a new town(dubbed 'murder capital of the world' on back of a billboard) and in with her demented father. The eerie element is introduced in the first scene as Kiefer Sutherland and his boys invade a local carnival and then a death occurs. The older son, played by Jason Patric, is enticed by a woman, who appears to be part of this group, and then unknowingly is initiated into it by drinking the blood of the leader. He first, though, has to have his own first kill to truly become one of them, and his younger son, played by Corey Haim, along with a goofy couple of brothers, try to stop this from happening. These brothers try to hunt down and kill the lead vampire, which is supposed to reverse the curse. The movie is filled with hilarious one-liners which shows me that it's not taking itself too seriously and makes the movie better. It also has wonderfully atmospheric scary shots with a little over-the-top violence in the last half hour. The humor, though, wins out and makes this movie a classic that shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maggots, Michael. You're eating maggots. How do they taste?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*May Contain Spoilers* Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Being only fifteen, many people my age aren't aware of "The Lost Boys" or any other movie from that era. So, if you are a fifteen year old kid sitting at home with nothing to do, thinking "I want to watch a vampire movie", chuck "Twilight" out the window along with all your preconceived notions of any movie made before 2005, and be ready to be sucked into the world of "The Lost Boys"."The Lost Boys" centers around Michael(Jason Patric), a young man who just moved to Santa Carla(Whose welcoming sign has "Murder Capital Of The World" inscribed on it's back in blood red paint, I may add) with his newly divorced mother Lucy(Dianne Wiest) and his younger brother Sam(Corey Haim). Lucy, reluctant to force a "huge legal battle" upon herself and her boys, is flat broke and moves in with her eccentric and, for lack of a better word, silly father(Barnard Hughes).That night, Sam and Michael go to the town boardwalk where they see a concert (because what movie is complete without a greased up muscle man playing the saxophone?) where Michael spots Star (Jami Gertz). He becomes infatuated with her and starts to go after her. (Not in the creepy stalker way, but the whole 'I just want to talk to her' way). Michael soon catches up with the girl, but is too late as he sees her on the back of David's (Kiefer Sutherland)'s motorcycle. The next night, the same thing happens, but this time David seems interested. He challenges Michael to a race. Michael, skeptical of his chances against David's expensive bike, says "I can't beat your bike." David then says "You don't have to beat me, Michael. You just have to try to keep up." They race, and David easily beats Michael, with the help of his friends Dwayne (Billy Wirth), Paul (Brook McCarter) and Marco (Alex Winter). Michael gets angry, and physically pushes David, shouting "Just you, man! Just you!" David then says "How far you willing to go, Michael?" David then takes Michael back to his lair, and after a few mind games, has him drink from a bottle of wine. However, it wasn't wine he was drinking. Star warned him that it was blood, but he didn't believe her. He drank. Soon, he started to experience strange symptoms, such as sleeping all day, longer fingernails, and irritability. He thinks nothing of it until he has a strange craving for his brother's blood, and is attacked by Sam's dog Nanook. When he sees his reflection in the mirror, he is translucent. Sam, at first is afraid and is convinced that Michael is trying to kill him, but soon realizes that Michael is as much in the dark as he is. He agrees to help, and enlists the help of the Frog brothers (Corey Feldman &amp; Jamison Newlander), two 15-year-old self proclaimed Vampire Hunters. Michael learns that he is only a half vampire until he makes his first kill, and to be turned back to normal, the head vampire has to die. So, Michael must fight his rapid transision into a creature of the night while he tries to kill the one who turned him.This is an amazing movie. It truly is. Jason Patric is a very good eye-candy type lead role; Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, and Jamison Newlander are hilarious. But, I must say, this film is carried by the performance of Kiefer Sutherland. He truly brought his character to life and made this movie what it is."The Lost Boys" is a different kid a vampire movie. It truly set the standards for vampire movies to come. What I like most about it is the fact that isn't too serious. It is a very youthful, and, quite frankly, a funny movie. 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Campy Attempt At Vampire Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are basically two distinct (but related) stories in one going on in "The Lost Boys," which revolves around a family (mom Lucy and brothers Michael and Sam) who move to Santa Carla, California from Phoenix after mom's divorce. Santa Carla apparently has a reputation as the "murder capital of the world," and we soon find out why.The first of the stories begins when Michael (Jason Patric) meets a local beauty named Star, who's tangled up with a local gang. This is the story with potential. The gang are actually a gang of "young" vampires, who set out to "recruit" Michael. I liked the idea of young vampires, which of course builds on the whole problem of gangs, and kids who don't fit in but want to fit in. The gang was pretty convincing, and Kiefer Sutherland especially was great as David, the apparent leader of the gang. Had this been developed as a straight horror-vampire movie about this roving gang of young vampires terrorizing the town and this family in particular it might have been a very effective horror movie. However, those who put the story together decided to introduce the second part of the story, which frankly didn't work as well.In Santa Carla, a couple of even younger teens (led by Corey Feldman) know what's going on and fancy themselves as vampire hunters, their knowledge about the undead apparently having come out of vampire comic books. To save his brother, Sam (Corey Haim) hooks up with these guys, who use every cliché trick in the books (garlic, wooden stakes, holy water, sunlight) as they set out to destroy the creatures of the night. To me, this aspect of the story came across as silly, and every time the "horror" aspects of the gang started to become convincing, we got Feldman et. al. getting back into the picture and turning this into a vampire-hunting comedy. The final confrontation is overdone rather than climactic, and in the end Grandpa comes across as being as silly as the young vampire hunters.To its credit, the movie surprised me with the final identification of the "head vampire," who has to be destroyed to release Michael. In the end, though, I wish this had stuck to horror and let go of the attempts to be a teen comedy at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched this for upteenth time this past weekend. It was so hard watching this movie after learning about Corey Haim's death. I decided to watch it along with my kids who were about the same age I was when I first watched it. I watched it from about 10 years and all throughout my teen years because regular TV aired it a lot. I had a huge crush on Corey Haim...he was so adorable and funny. Yes Jason Patrick was bomb back then too. It was eye candy and the movie was scary just enough! Corey Haim you had a lot of Black fans too. My best friend SL-G was a big fan of Lost Boys and we would always refer back to that as being a good old school movie. Remember sis? Oh Corey will miss you and remember you. RIP, and my heart goes out to your best friend CF too. PeaceLove, SJW in Denver</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and hip take on the vampire legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dracula, one of the most famous monsters in all of literature and film, has been the subject of many movies since the Silent era. In most cases he was depicted as a charming and seductive figure who wore a cape and slept all day in a coffin. But of course there was another side to him, a dangerous one. By the 1970s and 80s the Horror genre experienced a major shift and people were taking classic tales and updating them in interesting ways. The 1979 version of Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot' introduced viewers to vampires lacking the charm and instead were vicious and cruel. Almost a decade later Warner Bros. would bring us another new take on the legend, this time one more aimed at younger audiences and the film was both a hit and went on to have a major cult following.Pros: Great work from the ensemble cast. A good score and also a cool soundtrack. Stylish direction. Fast pacing. Plenty of good humor. Nice cinematography. Great special and make-up effects work. Some pretty frightening scenes and images.Cons: Thin plotting. The fashions and hairstyles really date the film.Final thoughts: This was truly one of my favorites as a kid and even though I may not like it as much as I did then, it's held up really well and is still a lot of fun to watch. The vampire sub-genre was running out of steam a bit and thankfully films like this and 'Fright Night' gave it a shot of life in the arm.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teen-vampires '80s style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched this in the eighties I really enjoyed it but when I dusted off my old VHS copy I was a little worried that it wouldn't have aged well... I needn't have worried as the story is as good as it was then with extra amusement given by the sight of hilarious '80s hairdos.At the start of the film Michael and his younger brother Sam move to Santa Carla, California with their recently divorced mother, little realising that it is the murder capital of the world and home to a group of vampires. When they go into town Michael is somewhat smitten by a girl called Star who it turns out is with David, the apparent leader of the vampires. At this point he thinks they are just the local bad boys and doesn't suspect a thing when they invite him to their lair for some Chinese food and a drink of "wine". Meanwhile brother Sam is hearing about the presence of vampires from the Frog Brothers who work at the local comic shop and their mother is getting to know Max after applying for a job at his shop. That night's activities have left Michael half way to becoming a vampire and if he is not to become a fully fledged vampire he must persuade his brother and the Frog brothers to help him destroy the head vampire... and not kill him too.Jason Patric and Corey Haim are good as Michael and Sam and Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander are suitably funny as the Frog brothers but it is Kiefer Sutherland who steals the show as bad boy vampire David, it was clear that he would go onto bigger things. As well as an enjoyable story the film has decent special effects and a great '80s sound track.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always hard moving to a new town where you're a teenager. It gets even harder when you end up in Santa Carla, a small coastal town that has a problem with . . . . . . vampires.Corey Haim and Jason Patric play the two sons (Sam and Michael, respectively) of Dianne Wiest. Sam is a youngster trying to make new friends in town while not coming across as uncool while Michael ends up meeting a beautiful girl (played by Jami Gertz) and going up against some local biker boys, led by David (Kiefer Sutherland). Antagonism becomes grudging respect becomes camaraderie as Michael finds himself slipping under the influence of the local vampire posse before he even realises the awful truth. Fortunately, Sam is being made aware of the situation by the local oddballs known as The Frog Brothers (played brilliantly by Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander). As Michael battles against his developing "condition" and things become more dangerous for everyone close to them, the brothers and The Frog Brothers prepare to battle their fanged enemies.This movie is a marvellously entertaining vampire flick that keeps lads and horror fans hooked with some decent scare moments and blood-drenched death scenes while female audience members seem to have been drawn in by the attractive male leads and a soundtrack that contains a great mix of fun rock and haunting melodies. Some people may roll their eyes at the thought of a glossy Joel Shumacher vampire movie but, what the hell, it's fun and for many people it remains right up there with the best vampire movies made in modern times. Personally, as I have grown up and changed my tastes slightly, I now find myself preferring many other movies, including the likes of "Near Dark" which was released the same year and sadly overlooked at the time, but I cannot deny that whenever The Lost Boys is on and I end up discovering it during a bout of channel-hopping I will end up watching most of it.There are many things to pick at, many things far too easy to focus on that you can claim drag down the whole film, but the highlights just about outweigh these things. The whole feeling of fun and exuberance mixed with the frights, the fantastic soundtrack, the witty script that includes such enjoyable simplicities as "death by stereo" and some superb aerial camera-work that really takes you up there with the group as they scour for victims. Throw in some 80s nostalgia for those of my generation and you have a fine, fine film.See this if you like: Vamp, Bordello Of Blood, Fright Night.</fullReview>

There are few films quite so fun. I love the song Lost in the Shadows and I love the acting in this. I also love the subtle nods to both Jim Morrison and to vampire literature great, Anne Rice. I wish they would make more horror films like this. Lost Boys: The Tribe was a huge disappointment in comparison. It seems a shame when quality films are saddled with poor sequels. The Lost Boys has a fantastic soundtrack. It was quirky and fun. Lost boys is a cult classic that any fan of horror, comedy and or eighties rock would enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best non-cinematic term to address The Lost Boys would be to call it a sugar rush. It provides an exiting burst of energy, but one that does not last long, and the ending does not feel as good as the rest of the experience. The Lost Boys has a breezy sense of fun, a great sense of humor, and a very funky look, but it all goes by a little too quickly for us to enjoy it to the full. At best, it's fairly entertaining.The story is well constructed at the beginning. Some films take fifteen to twenty minutes to set up a premise, The Lost Boys accomplishes this before the opening credits end. We are informed of the time and place, we know who the protagonists are, and we sort of know who the antagonists are. Michael and Sam are moving to Santa Carla to live with their grandfather, following their mother's divorce. One night on the boardwalk, Michael hangs out with the wrong group of people, and the next morning he is a vampire. This pretty much summarizes the first act. From here on the story loses its rhythmic pacing and moves into adrenaline mode. Sam with the help of two new friends seeks to destroy the head vampire and save his older brother. Lost Boys gets silly, but it winks at its own sense of idiocy, and never gets too nasty, or violent or gory. I think the movie provides a good blend of material for the horror fans, but it needs a little more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, along with From Dusk 'Till Dawn(A film I still haven't seen), has alluded me for quite some time. I just never got around to seeing it until now, though that can be said about many other films. From what I've seen, Vampire flicks are either really good or really bad, very few fall in between unlike slasher and zombie flicks. This teen romp is the former, as for all of it's visible faults, it is still one of the best vampire movies I've seen. It surprisingly feels modern and up to date despite some 80's stylings. The cinematography is superb in that it really proves that Schumacher did some work on location. There's definitely a reason why I've heard (from rumors) that this film is shoved down the local residents throats by being played in theaters at all times. The soundtrack is good, but I though the angelic chanting of the main theme grew very tedious towards the end. The acting for what it's worth, is pretty good. The cheesy lines are delivered well with a few exceptions mainly on the younger cast members accounts, but that's expected. Kudos to Keifer Sutherland for avoiding this despite having what could have been the cheesiest deliveries and a mega-mullet to boot. The plot is simple and executed well- the characters for the most part act as realistically as they can for their situation and avoid doing anything completely stupid. I felt the film could've been a tad longer, there just didn't seem to be too much vampire action or character development(besides Jason Patric) by the time the final confrontation happened, though that's probably for the best, as most of Shumacher's movies seem a little too long anyway. Those who haven't seen it should check it out, it's by no means scary(Neither does it intend to be), but it is definitely worth a view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, slick, wicked, and stylish vampire flick that rocked the 80's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lost Boys" is without a doubt one of the best vampire films ever made. Simply for the way it was presented in a cool and hip kind of way it's hard core and Gothic gory involving teenagers captured the late 80's just fine. And the star power and music of the film carried it to blood thirsty success. A family a mother(Diane Wiest)and her two teenage sons(Corey Haim and Jason Patric) move to an oceanside coast city in California to live with her father(Barnard Hughes). Only from the start the family sees and finds that this town is unlike any other it's just wickedly strange! Kiefer Sutherland who plays heavies so well is timely wicked and cruel as the leader of a cult vampire crew that causes havoc upon the town. And you find with this vampire classic that it's not camp or cartoon like as it's more fun with stylish gore and exciting drama, the feel good fun is even more enjoyable with Corey Feldman entering as a young vampire hunter! Plus you don't have to worry about any unreal special effects as the scenes and action of this film are straight up. Really probably maybe the best vampire film ever made it has such good drama and the acting from the stars are tremendous a treat seeing the work of Haim and Feldman plus Sutherland is wickedly raw and the films music all make for a hip and cool stylish cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Supreme Fantasy-Horror, With Forgivable Flaws...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This set off the careers of much fine talent, no need to recite them here. I will just say this: Joel Shumacher can take anything and turn it into a force. I say this because Lost Boys was intended as a children's fantasy flick. If you pay attention, this film could have gone very badly on some of the writing alone. Not that it was badly written, it's just, even by 80's standards, very clichéd in spots. And with the wrong talent, this would have been so-so at best. On to the talent: Haim turns in a fantastic performance. He just pops with personality and really shines in his role as the pseudo-cool outcast...too bad this is one of his last greats. Get this if you want him in A-form.Feldman, ever the over-actor, is still believable (and unforgettable) because of the age of his character. We're all pretentious as kids, you know. That's why child actors don't always grow up to be fine actors. People lose favor with their imaginations.If you want to see the Corey's shine, this is the film.Jason Patric is great in this film. Great, great, performer he turned out to be. He almost rejected this roll because he thought it was going to be an exploitation film about kids. So, even at 18, this dude had his sh**t together.Sutherland is magnetic, in possibly his best roll ever. Disagree if you want, but he owned this film with authority and has never fully duplicated or come close. Even so, I like him. He was awesome in Freeway.The entire of "tribe" of vamps had a seedy, brooding, vibe.Dianne Weist was INCREDIBLE as the paternal, on her own, starting over, single mother. She just pops with sincerity. I have seen her in many rolls and this is one of her better moments, though she has had many.Grampa is freakin' awesome. Enough said.Jamie Gertz turns in a terrific performance that bests that movie she did with Ralph Machio. No, seriously, that girl is hot.Joel is very good at atmosphere and vibe. And that is what this movie succeeds at most, aside form the great performances.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive teen horror of the '80s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Corey Haim and Jason Patric star as a pair of brothers new to the fictional California beach town of Santa Carla, 'the murder capital of the world.' There, they're split between two worlds: Sam (Haim) is drawn to the world of Vampire hunters (along with Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander); Mike (Patric) is invited directly into the world of the vampires themselves (including Kiefer Sutherland, Alex Winter, and Jami Gertz). Together, they find themselves mixed up in the wild world of the Santa Carla Living Dead.This was the beginning for The Two Coreys. Both had worked together previously, but none had reached the level of stardom (and friendship) that they achieved in this film. It has long been my favourite vampire movie and my favourite 80s flick. And, after all these years, that hasn't changed. The Lost Boys stands alongside Scream, Friday the 13th, etc. as one of the best teen horrors of all time. It's simultaneously thrilling and hilarious, and contains some of the best scares of the films of its kind. The acting is top-notch from a great and up-and-coming cast. Schumacher's direction worked well with the story. Everything worked. However, I do have a take a little bit off for the strange and out-of-place ending that I was never a big fan of. But, it wasn't enough to come close to ruining the film for me.Final verdict: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still hailed as one of the best vampire movies out there, "The Lost Boys" centers around four teenage vampires in a small California town, who live like a vampire should live - with no fear of death.Michael (Jason Patric), Sam (Corey Haim) and their mother Lucy (Dianne Wiest) recently moved to California from Arizona, and Michael starts falling for Star (Jami Gertz), a girl he saw at the boardwalk.Sam runs into two comic book dealers Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan (Jamison Newlander), who tell Sam that the town is overrun with vampires. Sam doesn't believe it until the Lost Boys decide to choose Michael as their next initiation.Michael slowly becomes more vampire-ish, and Sam wants to save him, but the only way to stop Michael from being a vampire is to kill the head vampire.But who is the head vampire? Is it David (Kiefer Sutherland), the leader of the Lost Boys...or is it Max (Edward Herrmann), Sam's mom's new love interest...or is it someone else? They need to find out soon before Michael becomes a total vampire.A different take on vampire films, and seemingly the prototype for modern teenage-vampire movies and shows, "The Lost Boys" delivers in the thrills, chills and laughter, and is a romping good movie to see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few fun loving Vampire films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is one of the VERY FEW fun loving vampire films, its a movie that nearly the whole family can enjoy (despite it being rated a 15). its a great cute little horror film, its not as soft as "The Little Vampire" but it has a lot of cheeky funny moments that sometimes makes you feel like your watching a great Disney movie. ultimately its another great addition to the cult classics and a fine addition to the vampire department. Jason Patrick does a fantastic job of playing the older teenager son, who is struggling to deal with the fact that he's turning into a vampire. And Kiefer Sutherland also does a great job playing the creepy vampire leader of the lost boys. generally the cast here was well picked and all play their role the way it was intended and slightly beyond. The Lost Boys has a fantastic cute little story line that doesn't make you feel left out or confused its quite basic to follow. however a warning to parents, The Lost boys does have a few strong violent scenes but these hardly last very long and there are only a few. Many of you will have watched this from your childhood or teenage years and by now you either love it or not, however if you haven't seen this film and are into vampire films and don't mind fun plots in horror films then you should defiantly give this film a look. I'll give this film 8/10 it has a fine cast a GREAT soundtrack, and has a fun adventure like plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I had only seen a short chunk of this movie when I was in Film School. I just finished watching my super scratched up BlockBuster rental. It was ghetto, I played the movie full screen and then it skipped when they kill the head vampire. So I flipped it over and finished it on wide screen. Awesome film. Great music, I love the theme track throughout Lost Boys. Good story. Cory Feldman and a movie from the 80's everyone should watch if you love that time period like myself. Keiffer Sutherland plays a great bad guy like in Stand By Me which I recommend if you like this film as it has Keiffer, River Phoenix, and Corey Feldman. This movie also had a little bit of cheese appeal. I love the old Grandpa, he's too funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie, great cast, great story. "The Lost Boys" is an adventure I can go for. After moving to the West Coast. Starting over is a big step. Two brothers Michael(Jason Patric) and Sam(Corey Haim) start making some new friends there. Some of them ending being cool Edgar Frog(Corey Feldman) and his brother Alan(Jamison Newlander), and there are those who are only night owls lead by David(Kiefer Sutherland) and his crew. However, they are worse than night owls, they're vampires! They suck Michael in to their group, they fly at night, they do kill those surf Nazis. But their lifestyle is not for Michael. It's up to Sam and his friends to stop those fiends. Since their mother(Dianne Wiest) is useless to them in the beginning since she's seeing Max(Edward Herrmann) who the boys suspect as a bloodsucker too. They spike the Parmesean cheese with some garlic(Better yet, I bet it was just plain garlic itself). Give him a glass of holy water. The vampire killing scenes are just plain fantastic. The kill one during his resting period. The put one in a tub filling with holy water and garlic. One was "death by stereo", and Michael and David met face-to-face. Only to find out that Max was the head vampire. Plenty of horror, plenty of comedy, this movie was fun! 3 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lost Boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys offers what is considered on of the best twist on the modern vampire and is to be in the company of Fright Night and Near Dark of the 1980's. Schumacher gives us the famous "Cory" duo for the first time in film, and Kiffer Sutherlands first major role as the leader of the Vampire gang. To accompany this, there is good acting across the board through great direction and writing. The gore is fun and the comic timing of The Lost Boys has contributed to some of the best one-liners to come out of 80's pop culture. By far a worthy classic amongst the Vampire genre and not to be missed even by some of the most jaded of movie critics. A borderline 8 star held back slightly to a 7 because it is a product of its time and can be dated. However it's very re-watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It's fun to be a vampire. That's a very good tagline for this kind of flick. "The Lost Boys" (1987) is one of my favourite 80's flicks along with: -Platoon (1986) -Scarface (1983) -Thief (1981) -To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) -The Goonies (1985) -Cocktail (1988) -Die Hard (1988) -Raw Deal (1986) -Ghostbusters (1984) -Black Rain (1989) -Rumble Fish (1983) -Trading Places (1983) -The Blues Brothers (1980) -Blow Out (1981) -Maximum Overdrive (1986) -Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) -Blue Velvet (1986) -The Shining (1980) -Aliens (1986)The 80's is probably one of the best decades for movies and a lot the films I love are from the 70's and the 80's. "The Lost Boys" boasts great actors: Kiefer Sutherland (Stand By Me, Young Guns, Flatliners, 24), Jason Patric, Alex Winter (Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure). It's got great music, style and a comic twist on the horror genre. A definite film to watch. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beer, blood and bubbles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm currently screening many films in this period and I think "The lost boys" deserves a special mention because it made me reflect (once more) on the American ability to build up such reliable screenplays. Joel Schumacher made a great job handling a story that involves stuff like: monsters, flying people, gore and motorcycle accidents. I think that when you have to set up this kind of scenes you really need a script that "holds you tight". The characters of "The lost boys" are edgy and well designed. You see one of them, you listen to what he says and you feel like... Uh, this guy's got something to hide! And until the very last line, there's something that you wish to know. Why is granpa so keen to alcohol? He grabs a beer from his personal shelf of the fridge (It is his own fridge, but he has his specifically own shelf!) and he has the first sip straight away. He opens the fridge, he grabs and opens the bottle, he sips and finally closes the fridge. He's pretty much of a weird fella but he's got a wise side and you would never call him an alcoholic in his sixties. If you think about other movies ("Frida", "Mysterious skin", "A bigger splash") you feel just astonished from their visual beauty and you enjoy them because it just carries you away. "The lost boys" may not carry you away, but takes you to the end warm and excited. And that's all we ask from a movie about vampires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A childhood gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was something I have seen on an old VHS when I was a kid. I loved it, but for some reason I could only remember that it was with vampires, Keifer Sutherland and the song (Strange, by the Doors, great song). Actually, I best remembered the song.So I have been searching for it, without really looking, until I've decided to ... ahem... really look, and saw it again. It certainly did not have the same effect as it had in my childhood, but it was nice nonetheless.First, to the people that said this is one big commercial: you are right. It is all about music, youth and corruption. Watch MTV, enjoy the "young rebel" fashion that is supported by all major labels, buy the tape, but don't get too corrupted, we need you to work when you grow up. But it is also one of the best vampire movies of all time.The plot is about a gang of vampires, enjoying their night life and total freedom, but after all, they were "made", one head vampire was at fault, and the idea is rendered beautifully by the death of Kiefer's character. With all his vampirism gone, he is just one dead young kid.If you have the time to reminisce over the gone golden era of the 80's, where people still remembered the 60's ("I was this close to being called Moon Child or Moon Beam") and still enjoyed moderate freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first impression watching this as a teenage girl? Eye-candy overload! Let's face it, the Lost Boys themselves (along with their almost-recruit, Jason Patric) have got to be one of the best-looking groups of young men ever brought together for one film! And Keifer Sutherland? He looks sexy in a MULLET! Enough said.On further viewing, this one has come to be my OTHER favorite Schumacher film, beside POTO. The camera work, music, costumes, sets . . . as the Phantom himself would say, "Bravissima"! And the performances are superb, including those from some very young (at the time) actors. My favorites? The entrance of the Lost Boys on the carousel in the opening and the campfire massacre. Mr. Schumacher saved the vamp/gore effects for this moment, but when it came, did he ever deliver! As indicated above, I am a child/teenager of the eighties, but I grew into a thirty-five-year old woman who still adores this movie. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... Is there a direct link between vampirism and 80's fashions?? Will people who regularly wear leather jackets and have immaculately coiffured hair automatically become more vulnerable to joining the ranks of the undead? How about if you live in a town where open-air concerts are regularly staged by sweaty saxophone players with glistening torsos? If "The Lost Boys" taught me anything it's that these details are ominous signs - and it *should* have taught me something, because it's been played in regular rotation by me since I was a nipper... My hair is a mess and I don't model myself after The Fonz, though, so thus far those teeth haven't grown and I've managed to avoid having fangs as my newest accessory.There's something about the very time-specific style Joel Schumacher brought to this tale that just works. Throw in a hip young cast on the cusp of greatness - or, in the case of 'The Coreys', implosion - and you really have something that should be a banner event for kids of that time. Impressively though, the jokes are actually funny and still hold up well to this day.The film as a whole is never going to send a chill up your spine, but what affectionate nods to its genre there are still rock in that nostalgic kind of way that really has a kick to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film because I judge films on their titles, and this one had quite the snapper. Basically, this film is amazing. It follows two brothers who move from their home in Arizona to Santa Carlo. Once they get there, strange happenings begin happening, which leads both to the eventual conclusion that the town has a fair number of vampires.This movie is funny, interesting and, if you are younger, more than a little scary. The score I really appreciate, and was actually one of the first scores I ever did pick out to love. The humor is that kind that is both intended and not. A lot of the jokes and scenes are funny, but at some points there is just a time lapse and you release just how ''80's" the film is, which, as stated, is humorous. The plot is sound and the characters likable. I recommend this film for anyone under the age of fifteen and anyone over the age who enjoy mildly scary flicks, humor and a whole passel of eighties hair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few vampires movies that will make you watch over and over again and not get you bored. The timing is just right, 97mins. It's not too long it's not too short. It's not all serious. It has some jokes in it and it is funny. And when I say jokes I don't mean jokes like farting or anything like you seen in those scary movie series. The jokes follows with the script and not ruin it. And it makes good quotes. It's more of a teenager vampires. Actually punk teenagers. Love the costume. Welcome back to the 80s!!! The story goes like this. A mom, Lucy, and her two teenage sons, Michael and Sam, goes to Santa Cruz to stay with their grandpa. Then Michael saw a girl, Star. He follows her. He found out she is in this gang who is led by David. He then found out that they are Vamps and he is becoming one. Sam found out Michael is a Vamp. He called his new found friends, the Frog Brothers, who are vamps killer. This is where the fun starts.The lighting is brilliant. The makeup is perfect. They really look like vamps!!! Camera work is good. As I said before the costume are great. Brilliant script. It never gets boring or make you want to get off you butt just to get some drinks.This is truly one of the best vampire movies EVER! Of all the vamps movie i seen, this ends up on my Top 5. If you are looking for some good vamps movie, check out Interview With A Vampire. A Comedy one maybe From Dusk Till Dawn. This is a MUST watch for all horror fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time in years this afternoon on some cable channel; the first time I saw it was in the theater as a 16-year old boy in 1987, right after I got my driver's license (no pun intended to connect to the Coreys' later film).The music/soundtrack still stands out as one of the best parts of the movie. It still works 20 years later. The Coreys are ridiculous, of course, but this movie really doesn't try to be serious (does it?). It approaches the themes with light-hearted seriousness, if that's possible.Jason Patric probably should have played Jim Morrison instead of Val Kilmer; there's a particularly striking moment in the cave of the sunken hotel where he is standing in front of a Morrison poster. But in this movie, he just over-acts. Jamie Gertz does, too. Lil' Sutherland does what he does best in this movie; it's funny to see him now on "24" in such a different place from his "Stand By Me"/"Lost Boys" roles. Twenty years changes a lot.Overall, this movie is still entertaining despite all its flaws. It doesn't try to be anymore than it is: a silly romp through a legendary evil arena. For that mission, it succeeds. It's fun to watch, even after 20 years. It hasn't aged, because it wasn't trying to be more than it was at the time it was made.(By the way, having grown up near Santa Cruz, CA, where this was filmed, that's always kept it close to my heart. Might be worth a little extra in the rating for me ...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best vampire tale ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people won't agree with my summary, but I stand by my opinion. When tales of vampires first began hundreds of years ago, to me it's a shame that this isn't the way it all started out. It seems as if most vampire movies are produced like stage productions. The Lost Boys refreshingly is from a different mold.The Lost Boys is an updated take on the vampire myth. A divorced mother and her two sons are forced to move in with her father due to financial problems. Eventually the boys run into trouble, and become involved with vampires themselves. They do their best to protect loved ones by solving the issue alone, unfortunately they are unable to keep their secret.Personally I am a huge fan of this film. I've watched it dozens of times over the years, and still enjoy it immensely. Joel Schumacher has directed many great films, and this is definitely one of them. The cast is 1st rate. The soundtrack is excellent as well, and adds only positively to the movie. The combination of comedy and gore are perfect in the movie, and the portrayal of being an 80's teen was hit nail on the head perfect. This is an excellent movie, and should be viewed by all. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lost boys is a film about a biker gang of teen vampires and their attempts to turn a recently divorced mother and two sons in to the undead. They set about recruiting the older teenager,the rudderless Michael. In their path is his younger brother Sam, who along with his friends the comically humourless Frog brothers set about to kill the vamps. Joel Schumaker wisely keeps his trademark campness to a minimum here and avoids doing any political 'gay' elements which would have alienated the audience, instead he keeps the social commentary in the background with the affecting shots of homeless teens eating from rubbish bins, easy prey for society's predators - undead or otherwise. The vampires here are disturbing, razor teeth and wolf like features and sadistic laughing from the shadows hit the nerves. The direction has a humour to it without ruining the horror. Best is the stoner grandad with the last line in the movie '..all the damn vampires'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vampire Classic... Redefines the Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A single mother and her two sons move in to the grandfather's home in a West Coast town. The younger son (Corey Haim) meets two alleged vampire hunters and comic book collectors (one being Corey Feldman) while the older son (Jason Patric) becomes friends with actual vampires. Family ties become the ties that bind or the start of a civil war.This film really hits home for me. The creative force behind it took a genre (vampire films) and combined it with that 1980s youth mentality to produce a vampire film that will stand the test of time. Richard Donner was supposed to direct (he had previously worked with Haim/Feldman on "Goonies") but handed control over to Joel Schumacher. I have no real love for Schumacher, but he did something wonderful here and I can't help but commend him for that.The supporting cast is also great. Kiefer Sutherland (who has gone on to great things) and Alex Winter (who went on to make "Freaked" and then disappeared). Edward Herrmann plays Max, the mother (Dianne West)'s boyfriend. I have a fond memory of seeing this film for the first time at my friend Jodey's house and having another friend comment, "I bet that guy drives a Lexus" (due to Herrmann being a Lexus spokesman at the time). The memory still cracks me up.The cast and crew are great, but three things deserve some attention: music, comics and mythology. The music was great, to say the least. The use of the Doors "People are Strange" was nice. I don't like the Doors, but that's okay because Echo and the Bunnymen were kind enough to do a cover. There's even a large Jim Morrison poster in the vampire's den (which really seems odd, but alright). The best song is what I would call the theme which has children singing "thou shall not..." which is played at key moments to tug at the audience emotionally. I was moved, I won't lie. It's not even a good song, but it fits.The comics were a nice touch. Whoever wrote this (and I apologize I can't recall offhand) loved vampires and loved comic books, because they knew how to balance the two perfectly. Not only is a comic a driving medium for getting the word out on vampires, but there is just a comic book undercurrent that connects the primary protagonists. I was an avid collector in my youth, but I was certainly not as informed as Haim or Feldman on the specific nuances of old school Batman or Superman issues.Last, the mythology is amazing. Most horror films, and vampire films in particular, can be judged by the way they represent the source material. This movie addresses mirrors, garlic, sunlight, holy water, getting invited into residences and stakes through the heart. In some areas they deviate from the classical traditions, but do so in such a respectful way that this seems all the more perfect (any deviation has a plausible explanation -- it's not just merely thrown out the window). Being traditional and new at the same time is hard, but mastered here.If you see only only Haim/Feldman film, see "Goonies". If you see two, see this one. (If you see three, see "License to Drive" or "Dream a Little Dream", I guess.) And if you see only one 1980s vampire movie, see this one. I can think of no other film that appeals to both children and adults while staying both serious and light-hearted, classic and modern. Besides, you'll never see Kiefer Sutherland with hair like this again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun horror comedy from the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the horror films made from the 80's "The Lost Boys" has managed to maintain its status as a sort of a classic. While it is true, that the film does contain some very nice imagery, it also shows some signs of aging because of the over blown "look, I'm 80's" style. There's punk rockers and mullets everywhere.Despite all that, "The Lost Boys" actually is quite good dose of horror mixed with some comedy. Acting isn't anything to note about, as it usually is in the movies like these, but the diction is pretty good and some of the scenes actually look very nice.TLB tells a story about a family, a mother and two brothers, who move to stay with their grandfather after moms divorce. Younger of the boys soon notices, that there's something strange about the new home town, while the older bro stumbles to a vampire gang lead by David (Kiefer Sutherland). There isn't anything spectacular about the script and the movie is actually quite predictable, but then again it is a genre film.Joel Schumacher has very unsteady career in quality ways, but with TLB he's managed to do very nice film, that even has some minor statement about alienation from the society for all those, who differ the norm.My score 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Lost Boys" is a key movie from the 80's Horror and glam because it truly displays what was going on in the 80's. I mean, the fashion, music, the Slasher craze, teen actors, etc."The Lost Boys" is now a cult Vampire movie; enjoyable and well done. The violence and gore is very toned down and the plot is easy to follow and also very "light" but it surely manages to entertain all kinds of audiences.The acting is pretty good. Jason Patric, Barnard Hughes, Diane West deliver solid mature performances. While Corey Feldman, Jami Gertz and company deliver fresh, believable performances.The soundtrack is excellent. The Doors, Sisters Of Mercy, etc. A Metal, Rock soundtrack with excellent songs that are used in key moments in the movie. "Cry Little Sister" is a now cult song.Overall, I would only recommend this movie for a younger audience or for Vampire fans in general. The movie is entertaining, has great f/x, decent violence, a creepy atmosphere, and some great action sequences.This is a must see if you like the 80's Horror. Though I repeat, it would be highly enjoyed by a younger audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher may have taken brickbats for his "Batman and Robin" film (according to its detractors who hate what it did to the Batman franchise), but they have no cause to complain about the horror, humor and fantastic pleasures of THE LOST BOYS, a rich time capsule from the 1980s that put new zest into vampire films.Not that any of it is meant to be taken seriously. The story is roughly that of a divorced mom (DIANNE WIEST) who moves to a small California town of Santa Clara where she expects to raise her two normal sons (JASON PATRIC and COREY HAIM). The minute the boys zoom off on their motorcycles to visit the local boardwalk, they run into the local bad boys who don't seem too much worse than your normal bad kids. KIEFER SUTHERLAND with his bleached blond hair is the leader of the gang and Jason has his eyes on Kiefer's girlfriend.But this is no normal gang. And Corey is soon telling his mother that they have to have a serious talk about something. He's sure his brother is becoming a vampire after hanging out too much with Kiefer and the gang. The story takes a dark turn but never loses its giddy sense of humor as the bat cave boys begin to act up. One of the funniest scenes has Corey on the phone asking her to come home from a dinner date while Jason is flying in and out the window on another phone assuring her things are OK.It's rib tickling fun and Schumacher gets just as much humor out of the whole thing as he does horror. There's a busy soundtrack full of '80s sounds and this is one of the reasons Andrew Lloyd Webber picked Schumacher to direct his PHANTOM OF THE OPERA years later. He had seen THE LOST BOYS and was very impressed with Schumacher's handling of visuals and music.If you like vampire flicks, this is one of the best--quirky fun with enough special effects for horror fans to enjoy to the max.</fullReview>

It's too bad they killed them all off. I think everyone should see this movie at least once. If you are into good movies of the 80's then this is one on your list or at least should be. I also wounder whatever happened to: Jason Patrick? Billy Writh? Brooke McCarter? Also the Attire is to die for. The most memorable part of the movie was when David(Keiffer),Paul(Brooke),Dwayne(Billy),Marko(Alex) where in the tree and called Michael(Jason) over to the tree and Vamped out and killed all those surf-Nazi while trying to get Michael to turn into one of them but Michael didn't.

		<shortDescription>Okay horror/comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys tells the story of a family that moves to a small town that is the murder capitol of the world. The older brother ends up getting sucked into a group of teenage vampires, and ends up becoming a half vampire himself. As he struggles to fight the change, his younger brother gets the help of two teenage vampire experts to find the head vampire and end the plague on the town once and for all. While this is an entertaining and sometimes funny movie, it is nothing more than another 80s teenager movie starring a couple of nobodies and b-actors like Jason Patric, Corey Feldman, and Corey Haim.The plot is a little fast and underdeveloped. There isn't really a lot of character development involved. The movie just kind of starts and rolls into the action right away. Not a whole lot happens in the movie. The plot isn't really complicated at all. I know, it's sometimes nice to sit down and watch a good movie with not much of a plot, and I admit it's better than a bad movie with too much of a plot, but I can't help the feeling that this movie could have been so much more. I have no problems with Joel Shumacher's directing. It's a common misconception that he is a terrible director just because he directed Batman and Robin, but that was a mistake. Those people seem to forget he directed St. Elmo's Fire, Falling Down, and Phantom of the Opera. This movie is kind of funny. The scenes where Corey Haim is scared of his older brother are the funniest scenes.The acting in this movie is okay. Jason Patric isn't an impressive actor, but he's okay in this. Corey Feldman and Corey Haim are always bad, no matter what they're in. Obviously, the best performance in the movie came from Keifer Sutherland, who plays a complete and utter bad ass teen vampire. I only wish his role was longer.Overall, this is an okay movie for a rainy day, but there was some potential lost on it.6.5/10</fullReview>

It not only has one of the sexiest, most charismatic vampires on the screen (Keifer Sutherland before he played good guys), it appeals to the horror nerd within the viewer. Who wouldn't want to think that years of reading cheesy comics was good preparation for fighting the undead, or that squirt guns can be used as deadly weopens? The initiation scene is perhaps unintentionally erotic,k and the whole movie has a nice atmosphere.

		<fullReview>Combining the old-fashioned horror flicks from the '30s and the Brat Pack feeling of the '80s, "The Lost Boys" comes out quite interesting. It features a family moving to a California coastal town which turns out to be inhabited by vampire punks. And these dudes sure know how to party! Some of the scenes here are really impressive, and the use of the Doors' song "People Are Strange" is also really neat. And it's got a good cast: Jason Patric, Dianne Wiest, Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland, Jami Gertz, Alex Winter (of "Bill &amp; Ted" fame), Edward Herrmann, and Barnard Hughes. And that ending? Maybe it was a little confusing, but I sure didn't see it coming! Really cool. Too bad that director Joel Schumacher degenerated in later years; "A Time to Kill" was his last good movie, as far as I know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've grown up as a huge fan of The Lost Boys, and to this day, I'm still not bored of the film...Young brothers Michael and Sam move to Santa Carla with their mother to live with their lonely grandfather. Although the town is strange to them, they do their best to settle down. One night while out at the carnival, Michael and Sam go their separate ways, and Michael meets a mysterious but beautiful girl, Star, which is where the story really begins. Michael then meets Star's companions, a small group of trendy bikers who ooze sex appeal, the main one being David. David's intimidating behaviour towards Michael leads to a bike race, and they end up in a cave next to the ocean. This was their home and it is that night Michaels life changes forever as he, oblivious, is given blood to drink. Sam notices Michael's behaviour is becoming increasingly unpleasant but behind the anger is something even more scary...the truth. With the help of Sam and the Frog Brothers Michael must find the head vampire so all half-vampires will return to normal - Michael and Star, who by now he has fallen in love with. Together they must battle the blood-sucking creatures of the night, and now the excitement really begins!! Excellent performance by all of the cast and an amazing soundtrack. This film will never get old!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant and surprising vampire tale from 1987</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two brothers, Sam and Michael (Corey Haim, and Jason Patric) move to Santa Carla, California with their mother (Dianne Wiest). Once there Michael, the oldest brother, falls in with a rough crowd for the affections of a girl (Jamie Gertz), and Sam falls in with two kids who work at a comic book store. Michael soon discovers that his new friends are really a pack of vampires, and his brother Sam soon discovers that the two kids working at the comic book store call themselves vampire hunters. In the middle of this is poor Mom who just wants to find a job and start a new life, but even she can't escape the trouble that surrounds Santa Carla.The Lost Boys was definitely up there as one of the better horror movies of the late 1980s. It had style and decent acting with some offbeat humor that kept me entertained. This movie was probably one of the last good films involving both Coreys. Even Kiefer Sutherland, who now plays a cop in the hit series 24, made the role of the seeming lead vampire one of his own. The weakness of the film comes in the last act when all the build up is nearly thrown out the window for a quick fix of an ending that becomes just a battle of Peter Pan proportions. Still it was good enough to be given a 7 out of 10Another 80s vampire film to go up on the same list with Fright Night which was another impressive movie about the same thing, though out two years earlier. Both have held up overtime, but Fright Night, in my opinion, was still the better film. Neither one is the greatest film of all time, but they were both entertaining and are still well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Interesting...but also a rather unusual vampire movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been described as part comedy and part horror. I personallydidn't see much that was funny in this movie. I'd say it was part thriller and part horror. What was interesting about this movie is that changes some of the general facts about vampires. But this isn't the only vampire movie I know of that which does this. For example in 'Interview With The Vampire' there was at least one scene in which the vampire Louis had a reflection in a mirror, and it is generally said that vampires have no reflection. Vampires with reflections are also seen in the film 'Underworld'. Well the way how Sam became a vampire after meeting the teenage boys and the beautiful girl named Lucy, is that one of the boys David (Kiefer Sutherland) gives Sam what appears to be a bottle of red wine, but is actually vampire blood. After this night Sam begins to show the signs of vampirism. The general way a human becomes a vampire is that a vampire drains a victims blood and then gets the victim to drink the vampire blood.Another alteration in this film is that sunlight kills vampires. Well in this film the sunlight doesn't kill the vampires it merely makes them weak and almost inactive. Sam also does have a reflection in a mirror but it isn't a normal a reflection it's like seeing a ghost in the mirror. Sam isn't the only human turned vampire that is good, also Lucy and her young brother. Who Sam, along with his brother Mike and two vampire hunter later rescue from the other vampires and they all go back to Mike and Sam's house for the final showdown with the vampires!I did say that I didn't think this film was a comedy, but there a funny scene in the end where the Grandfather of Sam and Mike kills the head vampire. Afterwards he just casually walks over to the refrigerator , takes out a drink and says"The one thing I didn't like about this town. All the damm vampires."Over all I'd say this film really is interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILER**Given that I was 8 when it first came out, this movie was the stuff of playground legend for quite some considerable time for me, being blessed with the kind of parents who firmly believed that the film classification system was set in stone. When I finally got to see it, it didn't disappoint. Terrific story, and pretty original for it's time - when i first saw this, i didn't have a clue who the vampire Lestat was, so it really did stand out. Great cast, the 'oldies' give sterling performances and you just have to love both the coreys, as well as jason patric - what the hell happened to him? Classic teen movie, they just don't make em like this any more. Lost Boys was clever and funny without being too ott or tongue in cheek which, sadly, is the norm for this genre these days. And as for Kiefer Sutherland - well, as much as I love me, it pains me to observe that he only ever seems to play one character - moody, maverick, darkly sexy - hell, take the fangs of David, and you're looking at a teenage Jack Bauer! Deeply disappointed by the dvd - would have loved to see some extras ,but is was milding amusing to see the appalling lipsynching used in a attempt to make Corey Haim's immortal 'my own brother . .

		<fullReview>I think this is required viewing for teenage horror fans. It's the training film, so to speak, for future vampire enthusiasts. That's not a slam, by any means. This film was released when I was 17 years old, perfect timing for a girl who already had a vested interest in horror films, and was not at all adverse to seeing some young, good looking bad boys on the big screen.The Lost Boys of the film (named after the group of children in Peter Pan, who can never grow up and live without parental supervision happily ever after) are a group of tough punks, haunting the beaches of Santa Carla (actually Santa Cruz) on their roaring motorcycles and living in a dank bacchanalian cave decorated much like any other teenagers bedroom. Michael (Jason Patric, son of Jason Miller, the young priest in The Exorcist) is the new kid in town, having recently relocated with his newly divorced mom and kid brother from Phoenix, Arizona. Michael seems to be a well adjusted kid, but he yearns to fit in with the tough Lost Boys when he sees a pretty girl hanging out with them. All of a sudden, he's wearing leather jackets and getting his ear pierced so Jami Gertz will like him. It's a familiar theme: good kid goes bad when he tries to fit in. But it's summer, school hasn't even started, and I had to wonder why Michael suddenly felt a need to be uber-popular when he's already a buff, good looking guy.No matter, it's still a fun film. Michael's younger brother Sam (Corey Haim) provides the comic relief with his friends the Frog brothers...and the comedy is refreshingly genuine, instead of the moronic bathroom humor we have become accustomed to as of late. There's some nice references to the vampire films of old, with a geeky video store owner named Max (as in Schreck) playing the leader of the undead, and the innocent mom named Lucy, playing his target female. The Lost Boys themselves are incredibly intimidating and convincing as the group of thugs with fangs; even sweet-faced Alex Winter (best remembered for his role in Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure) is frightening here, smiling maniacally and ripping his victims apart in the flickering light of a beach bonfire with the rest of them in the films most frightening scene.This is one of those could-have-been-perfect films, missing the mark by mere inches, but it's still a strong entry in the vampire genre. It has a great sense of humor and some very cool, moody camera work that elevates it above the norm. The soundtrack is also great, all over the place from punk to calliope music, yet somehow it works perfectly. This is an innovative, well done vampire film with just enough fresh ideas within it to make an old tale new again. Should be seen at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I was quite young but I loved it and still do to this day. It's intriguing, clever and even hilariously funny in places.***SPOILERS***Lucy Emerson (Dianne weist) and her two teenage sons, Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) move to Santa Carla, California to start a new life and live with her eccentric dad (Barnard Hughes). The boys soon realise that something is very wrong in their new hometown - people are constantly going missing and they find out that Santa Carla has the highest murder rate in the country! Every night is filled with the boys hanging out at the local fairground, while Lucy gets herself a job in a video store owned by Max (Edward Herrmann) who soon becomes her new love intrest. Michael develops a love intrest of his own - the lovely Star (Jami Gertz) whom he sees one night at the fairground. After following her he becomes caught up with her biker gang buddies led by David (Keiffer Sutherland). Michael soon realises that the gang aren't what they seem - they are vampires and manage to convert him into one aswell. Sam soon discovers whats happened to older brother thanks to some help from Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan Frog (Jamison Newlander)- a pair of brothers who run the local comic book store who also happen to be devout vampire hunters. Desperate to save his brother, Sam realises they must kill the head vampire and rid Santa Carla of the evil undead!The casting and acting in the movie was perfect - Sutherland is brilliant as the evil David. Patric puts in an excellent performance as the confused and newly converted vampire Michael while Gertz is simply delicious in her role as the sultry vampiress desperate to put an end to their dilemma. Haim, Feldman and Newlander add humour and jokes amid the serious issues (the scene where they are having dinner with Max is hilarious!) Even the older actors put in brilliant, believable performances. Weist shines as the sweet, kind mother, oblivious to the dangers around her. Herrmann gives a solid performance trying to fit in with his new girlfriend's family. But the real star is veteran actor Hughes as Grampa - his lines are great - especially his closing line at the end of the movie!The plot of "The Lost Boys" is good fun and the best 'vampire' type movie that Ive seen for the simple fact that it doesnt take itself too seriously and is fairly tongue-in-cheek in some parts then eerie and gory in others. The twist at the end is good and handled very well!I think this movie is very under-rated - I can't believe it only got a rating of 6.7 on here. I would definately give it 8/10 - highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is a good '80s film. It has the best of both worlds. One moment, you're looking at all the killings, next your laughing yourself silly. This is another good teaming of Kiefer Sutherland and Joel Schmacher, who teamed up for the even better films A Time To Kill (1996) and Phone Booth (2003). They also teamed up for Flatliners (1990), but I haven't seen it yet.This film tells the tale of a family, a mother and 2 sons, who move to Santa Carla with their weird, but funny grandfather (Barnard Hughes). The oldest son Michael (Jason Patric) has a crush on Star (Jami Gertz), so he tries to fit in with the gang she hangs out with, which is led by David (Kiefer Sutherland). But when David offers Michael a drink, it turns out to be vampire blood, which transforms Michael into a vampire. He seeks help from his brother Sam (Corey Haim) and the Frog Brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander) to stop him from completely transforming and kill the vampires.The Lost Boys is a very funny horror film. The Grandfather is just a crack up, especially in the garage scene. And when Sam is singing in the bath. Funny as. This isn't a favourite of mine, but it's definately worth watching.Rating: 3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the cooler vampire flicks in the 80's and I really feel that it set the stage for a lot of teens from that era. The story was just fantastic and some of the characters were truly amazing, spinning on the popular peter pan tale of the "Lost Boys" who never grow up and get to do whatever they want all the time! For a group of teenage Vampires in Santa Clara, CA, it's up all night and sleep all day in a cave by the ocean. It sort of teaches the lesson that doing whatever you want gets old and stale after awhile, when Authority, the master vampire and suitor to the main characters mother, steps in and starts to dictate the rules! This movie was a 10/10 for me! Even after over 15 years, it's still a fantastic saturday night movie for me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Joel Schumacher started out as a set decorator in Hollywood, and it shows... check out any of his movies, and you'll see sets and locations which are very nicely done. All the right touches are in there, which is probably why Warner Bros. loves him so much.Unfortunately, he's not much of a director. He quite often fails to get anything resembling the best out of his actors or script, and has a tendency to ramble on, taking meaningless side trips through his own form of reality.Thankfully, this movie is a rare exception.Hollywood has been doing vampire movies for about as long as film has existed, and the stories have gotten quite old... most modern day vampire movies, in fact, don't even follow the 'rules' of vampires."The Lost Boys" does stick to traditional vampire lore (for the most part), but it adds its own modern twist: most vampires you see wear the standard evening dress, sleep in coffins, linger in old mansions... this movie shows you what it's like to be a young, hip vampire. Why change your habits and lifestyle just because you're Undead?The performances are nothing spectacular, though they are interesting... and the movie is short enough that it never gets boring. The camera work is decent enough, if nothing special. The soundtrack is good, but doesn't match the modern radio / music video soundtracks of recent years. The special effects are mostly not there... camera tracking takes the place of flight, with a few prosthetics and some heavy makeup completing the list of anything fancy.But none of that really matters.It's often said, but just let yourself go when you watch this movie... you don't have to get so totally into it that you believe every word and gesture, but just sit back and relax - enjoy it for what it is.Some of the performances are so dead serious that they almost verge on satire, while with others you can see them having fun with their roles. Which is probably a good reason to make a movie in the first place... if you can't have fun with a character, why bother?As of 2003 this movie is 16 years old, but it has aged well. A bit cute to see some of the stars in it, and compare them to where they are now... Kiefer Sutherland, for instance. Compare him to 'David' in this movie, and 'Jack' in the Fox series "24". Or Jamie Gertz, or Dianne Wiest, or Edward Herrmann. Just seeing these folks in their 'younger' days can be fun... but that's not the reason to watch the movie.It's not scary, it's not really tension filled, it's not riveting. But it is fun. Sleep all day, party all night... never grow old, never die. This movie is a good - if somewhat mindless - look at what 'California vampires' would be like, what eternal youth can really be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one that, I find, is neither as good or as bad as most people say. I really like this movie, but I'm not going to say it's one of the best I've ever seen. On the other hand, people should not come on this site saying bad stuff about this (or any) movie, which they "saw on tv". I mean, when has there EVER been a good cut of a movie on tv? Television always butchers movies, and this one is no exception (and, yes, mullets were once in. It was called the 80's. Look into it).The Lost Boys is kind of like the family horror flick. It's not really scary, nor was it meant to be. It just deals with the traditional horror figures of vampires in a fun way, as juvenile delinquents. So rent it, try it out. If not for Coreyx2, do it for Kiefer Sutherland. He really makes this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of the 80's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVE this movie! The Lost Boys is a movie I can sink my teeth into! Summary: Michael(Jason Patric)and Sam(Corey Haim)have just moved to Santa Carla, California with their mother(Dianne Wiest), and into the house of their lovable Grandpa(Barnard Hughes). During the nights in which they spend their time at an amusement park, Michael starts following an attractive girl named Star(Jami Gertz), and is introduced to her boyfriend, David(Kiefer Sutherland), and his gang of punks. Sam starts hanging out with Edgar(Corey Feldman) and Allen(Jamison Newlander)Frog who claim to be vampire hunters. Soon, odd things start happening at home with Michael, and no prizes to who guesses what's happening! The Lost Boys is an awesome vampire movie wiht cool flashes of the 80's, and an awesome soundtrack! 7/10.Rated R for Vampire violence, language, and suggestive sexuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good 80's Camp Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were way too many movies in 80's that were just silly teenie slasher films. There still too many today. But ever once awhile they make movie that in the genre that is not only tolerable, it's actually good. Like most of these camp classics, Lost Boys is quick to poke fun at itself instead trying to be serious. Schumacher and Co. knew they weren't making Oscar material stuff, and anyone that expects otherwise and complains otherwise really needs to exercise common sense a little. The Lost Boys does have a light horror fare, goes a little blood happy every once and awhile, but for the most part is tame. it's more of a 80's teen drama, which can either be good or horrible depending on your preferences. I'm somewhere in bewteen. The cast was probably one of the reasons this movie has endured so long. Jason Patric always turns in a good performance (see Narc for evidence), Kiefer Sutherland hones his skills as a bad guy, and The Cory's meet on screen for the first time. It's a memorable cast filled with memorable actors who, despite what atrocities they may have made later on in their careers, are a least good in this one movie. Schumacher does a good job of adding some style to the film, albeit 80's style.Bad hair, synthesizer music and levistic attitudes. It's what the 80's were about. If you like the 80's, you probably already know and love the film. It was an odd period in mainstream film, and Lost Boys is rather good culmination of all that defined 80's cinema. For better or for worse.7/10* * */ * * * *</fullReview>

Everytime i watch it i cant get that one song where the girls in the background says, "thou shall not fall, thou shall not lie, thou shall not sleep, though shall not kill." I also love how they use the names of the desciples as the chars names showing religious reference which has been in most vampire flicks. Pual, Marko (Mark), David and of course Michael (archangel reference). I wonder if star was suppose to be referenced with the star of David (ponders... she was always with him doing what he says as if she was his property...THE STAR of DAVID).Its a great movie about a family that moves to Santa Clara and find out that the city is festering with vampire youths and they soon be come their new target as a Vampire Brady Bunch as was said in the movie. its worth watching.

		<shortDescription>A Vampire Movie With Wit and Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, The Lost Boys is a place in time, 1987, a great year for cinema, when I was just 17 and I hadn't seen Silence Of The Lambs. The 80s were an era of franchised horror flicks, of Halloween and Friday the 13th and Hellraiser with lots of numerals. You can just imagine the concept of this movie, "teen horror comedy with vampires". The Lost Boys turned out to be so much more. The concept of kids coming of age and having to choose between normality and evil. The fantastic cinematography. Many of the slow-motion scenes seem like pure magic now. A 22-year old Jami Gertz, looking absolutely gorgeous as the lost hippy girl "Star".Saxophonist and bodybuilder Tim Cappello, in the beach front performance was great. In fact, the movie has a killer, high-powered uptempo 80s soundtrack, with Cappello (I Still Believe), INXS, Sisters Of Mercy and more.A movie very much like it, is the more serious "Near Dark" with Adrian Pasdar, Jenny Wright, Jenette Goldstein (Vasquez in "Aliens"), Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton from Katherine Bigelow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, this movie did not live up to my expectations. I am a Kiefer Sutherland fan, so I went into this in a good mood. But, compared to his other movies, his acting here isn't up to par. The dialogue came off as being wooden and one-dimensional, and the gratuituous blood only partially makes up for the movie's pitfalls in the other areas. Also, the movie never gets into detail regarding the various tenets of vampirism, so some things are left unexplained. If you are looking for a good Kiefer Sutherland movie, try The Three Musketeers or the Cowboy Way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little more than a vampire movie. ***SPOILERS***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lost Boys" was without a doubt the hit with the teen crowd that Warner Bros. expected it to be. And surprise, it was the hit they wanted it to be. Take a closer look and you will realize this is more than a teen vampire movie. The key word here is TEEN. This films central theme is not vampires, but it's about enjoying the pleasures of youth. The films title, in case you don't know, is borrowed from Peter Pan's gang, "The Lost Boys", who were a bunch of kids who could never grow old. In this film, "The Lost Boys" are a gang of teen vampires who could never grow old. The story, in more than one way, does resemble "Peter Pan", largely with the aforementioned themes of youth.This theme is realized here but it's also clear that some people won't get that, so I'll open you up to it a little. One example would be, with the exceptions of Dianne Weist, Edward Herrmann, and Barnard Hughes, why do you hardly see any other adults in Santa Carla? Also during the concert scene, the only people you see are teenagers. Not a single adult is seen. This leads to the speculation that Santa Carla may in fact, be a haven for teenagers who could have possibly run away from home, are lost, or are looking for something to do with their lives, while they're still young. Santa Carla does in several ways resemble Neverland. Neverland was populated by nothing but kids and despised any adults who came to their land. Another example would be Dianne Weist's romance with Barnard Hughes. When they first meet, she says that "We were that age once". It is also evident that between these two, they may be trying to relive the younger, happier days of their lives.A final example would be the "Lost Boys" themselves. David (Kiefer Sutherland), the gang's confident leader, seems to obviously like the fact that he's a vampire. In fact, he embraces it, something that any kid would love. All they do basically is ride bikes, sleep, party, and drink blood; all things that any teenager in his position would do. It's also a coming-of-age story too. Michael (Jason Patric) is also probably beginning to experience love for the first time in his life. He pines for Star (Jami Gertz), who is the only girl in David's gang. But his need for blood also seems to be getting in the way of that though. His younger brother, Sam (Corey Haim) is too young to be experiencing love. (He's still into comic books and things like that). Also Michael joins David's gang, something that many teenagers when they're young, would do. To have a sense of belonging and making new friends, I think is Michael's ultimate goal.Apparently, some people have missed that point entirely by thinking that this is just another 80's vampire movie. On the contrary, I think that the 80's setting perfectly fits this movies material. I think, that had this film been released in 1997, ten years after its release, the outcome would have been very different. Had it been, this film would probably have been filled with the sex, drugs, and gory violence that seems to inhabit most of today's teen movies. So the 80's setting WAS a good idea after all...10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie many times, I own it on DVD, Its one of the best Vampire movies I've seen and I have to say that my favorite character in it is David (played by Kiefer Sutherland), his pure evil yet so seductive, he can bite my neck anyday (I'm a huge Kiefer Sutherland fan) Its also has its funny moments in amongst the horror, like the frog brothers, they advertise themselves as what I like to call Vampire exterminators, except there antics in trying to kill them are funny as well as stupid eg. they go into the cave where the vampires live (the 2 of them, along with there friend Sam) and stake one of them in the middle of the other 3 vamps, what was the thinking behind that i'm guessing none as the the other 3 vamps wake up and try to get the boys with out much success I might add. Well I recommend this film to anyone who like a good horror flick and also anyone who is a Kiefer Sutherland fan, its my opinion that his early work is his best like the film Stand By Me!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pretty decent 80's vampire movie. The story is good enough and it's well acted by an allstar 80's cast...Jason Patric, Kiefer Sutherland, Jami Gertz and the two Coreys (Haim &amp; Feldman). After a divorce, Sam and Michael move with their Mom (Dianne Wiest) into their Grandpa's (Barnard Hughes) house in Santa Carla...The murder capital of the world. With the help of two boys, the Frog brothers who work at the local comic book store, they try to figure out how to deal with the town's vampire problem. A bit corny, but somehow it works for me. A nice blend of cheesy humor mixed in with some hard core vamps. It features a good and appropriate 80s soundtrack, including an eery original theme song, "People are Strange" performed by Echo and the Bunnymen, and Run DMC's version of "Walk This Way". *** (Out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is a very entertaining film, and as long as you keep reminding yourself that it was made in 1987 you might be able to ignore the hideous 80s haircuts and fashion that blight the entire cast. Nope, no black capes and slicked back hair for these vampires - they're a gang of teenage biker boys, led by David, who's played menacingly well by a peroxide-blonde Keifer Sutherland.The plot centres around Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim), two brothers who move to their eccentric grandfather's house in Santa Carla with their mother Lucy (Dianne Wiest). At first Santa Carla seems like a great place to live with a lively youth culture, but they soon discover a darker side - a hell of a lot of people go missing in Santa Carla, and this is due to the town being plagued with vampires. Michael becomes involved with the vampires and the rest of the film is devoted to him and his brother trying to break him free from their hypnotic grip, with the help of the Frog brothers, Edgar and Alan, the self-styled 'vampire experts' who's knowledge of the bloodsuckers comes straight out of comic books. Needless to say, their antics provide a great deal of comedy, as well as a fair share of the action.Overall the acting in this movie is pretty good - Jason Patric gives a sensitive performance as David; Jami Gertz is appropriately needy as his love interest and fellow vampire; Corey Haim is convincingly cute and hysterical simultaneously; and Barnard Hughes is wonderfully eccentric as the grouchy Grandpa.The soundtrack is great if you like 80s rock and it really sets the tone of the movie well. While The Lost Boys isn't a masterpiece, it'll probably make you laugh and keep you entertained so I'd definitely recommend it to fans of vampire movies or anyone with nothing to do on a Friday night!</fullReview>

Two brothers (Jason Patric and Corey Haim) move to Santa Monica with their mother (Diane Weist) after she gets divorced. They move in with Weist's aloof father (Bernard Hughes). However, as they get to know the city better and more people start to disappear, the two brothers become convinced that the city is being over ran by vampires headed by Kiefer Sutherland that Patric has become friends with. Jami Gertz plays Patric's love interest Star who tries to warn him of danger that lurks behind every coner. Edward Herrmann plays Weist's love interest who, Haim suspects to be a vampire. Exciting and scary also with a terrific ending filled with lots of humor and a great supporting turn by Bernard Huges.Rated R; Extreme Violence, Profanity, and Sexual Situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My one reason for seeing this film, the sexy Jason Patric. In this film,he is Michael Emerson, whom moves to Santa Carla, along with his brother, Sam, and mother, Lucy. Michael, soon falls for the beautiful, and mysterious, Star, despite her so-called boyfriend, David. He ends up following David and his gang, to their hang-out. While there, he drinks from a bottle, that is wine. Or is it? Soon, Michael ends up a vampire, and he drags his brother, two kids, whom have dedicated their lives to hacking off vampires, and Star, (whom he get's a little bed crazy with), into a hellish nightmare, beyond imagination. Very well acted, much due to Corey Haim, (Sam), Diane Wiest (Lucy), and Corey Feldman (Edgar Frog), and of course, Jason Patric. Also, Jamie Gertz, whom played Star, did a great job, she made her character her own person,:sexy, seductive, mysterious. As for David, well, I never did like Kiefer Sutherland that much. As far as my one line summary, that just means, I hated, and I mean hated, Interview with a vampire. Not only was it dull beyond belief, at least get people that can act. Thus, I'm refering to Antonio Banderas, what a lousy actor. Above all, this film, is by far one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen. No, wait, this was the best vampire movie I've ever seen.

Things mysteriously start to happen to Michael after he meets one hot chick, Star (Jami Gertz) at the faire and her boyfriend David (Kiefer Sutherland) is not what he seems - and neither is his biker buddies.Sam, a comic book enthuasiast, enlists the help of two Brothers Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan Frog to help him help hunt down David and his gang of vampires...but not before Michael begins to turn into one himself....The Lost Boys reshapes the vampire tradition combining heart-pounding terror with rib-tickling laughs (like Sam singing in the bath tub).Sutherland is great as David. He takes his role and adds that extra bite to being a vampire. The star of the whole movie has to be Corey Haim. Sam is one of the quirkiest and enthuasistic teenagers on the planet who sometimes lets his imagination run wild - which is not always a good thing.A real good vampire movie which gives the awesome Blade movies a run for their money!*** out of ***** or 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Scary, One of the Best of It's Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tsunami-size wave or horror movies with a self-conscious sense of humor is always traced back to Wes Craven's Scream, but here we have a movie that serves as the granddaddy of the modern, hip, funny horror movie. The Lost Boys (a great title, as it alludes to Peter Pan, and the whole stay a boy forever thing) turns vampire lore on it's ear, transporting the legend from gloomy Europe to the sunny world of southern California, centering on a flock of teen vampires, headed by a menacing Keifer Sutherland that try to bring a naive newcomer Michael (Jason Patric) into the fold. the script is peppered with great humor, much of that coming from Corey Haim as Michael's brother, and Corey Feldman as one of the young "Vampire Hunters" enlisted to help. Schumaker does a great job of balancing scares with laughs, and the talented young cast does a terrific job. Standouts are Patric, who would eventually star in Barry Levinson's Sleepers, and Haim, who in spite of his one-dimension as an actor, was quite a charming, appealing young male lead in his time. I love the way this film glamourizes this vampire lifestyle. it's vampires are handsome, magnetic, and the life they lead is one of mystery and excitement. never grow old, never die. And the use of the Doors song People are Strange, along with Jim Morrison's image in the Vampire's lair does a great job of giving them that air of something important, hip, romantic. for, as with the young death of Morrison, there is a romance tied to being young forever. and this film is about the temptation to succumb to that, or to lead a normal life, as symbolized by Michael's relationship to his brother, and to his mother, the wonderful Diane Weist. Brilliant. I count it among Near Dark (1987) and Fright Night (1985) as among the best of modern vampire tales.</fullReview>

Sam (Corey Haim)makes friends with two vampire freaked comic shop owners.As the story continues,Mike realises that he is a vampire and must get the girl he likes out of there away from them (Star). Sam and his new friends know about the vampires and they go to hunt them.There mother0 starts dating a man they think may be the head of them all but is he? I won't spoil anymore,but Lost boys is a must see vampire movie,one of my favourites.You will not get much better than this,and not anymore stylish either. I would say it tries to be scary and comic at the same time,and the vampire make up is just spot on. Watch it if you havn't already and see what you think.I rate 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the lost boys was a good movie, and the actors were great. There was some parts that were a bit on the cheesy side, though i think its a quality that is expected in all vampire movies, especially the ones from the 80's. Still i found it to be a very enjoyable flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Lost Boys at a young age so I only liked it really for the popular cast at the time and for the really well done finale. However, as I grew older I came to find that this movie is extremely excellent and several chums of mine agreed, but when showed to people who had never seen it and had such high expectations, they were disappointed. This movie is good if ya just watch it for fun with a bunch of friends and even better if ya watch with friends who have already seen it. If you liked this you might also want to check out The Monster Squad and The Goonies. (Beware:There is a shirtless, saxophone playing, purple spandex wearing, Michael Bolton look alike so watch out!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that I started this movie with absolutely minimal expectations. This being very difficult on my part considering all the reviews I read proclaiming its godlike presence. I first heard of it while reading reviews for some other less acclaimed vampire movie and `needless to say, this is not The Lost Boys' or something much like it, came up suspiciously often, as though The Lost Boys was the highest of the high. At top of the vampire film autography food chain. So, one rather uninteresting day, I rented the movie in the, mind you, favorites section of Family Video. I could not find one single bad or just `ok' opinion of this movie. Down I sat to watch it, still, my expectations were not high. Even they, however, were NOT met. This movie would have been a fun little bit of entertainment to watch had I been 13 rather then 17. As it was however, it was a shallow peace of childish entertainment. Example of a good vampire movie: Interview with the Vampire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best Vampire movie I think that has been made. The entire cast worked great together and I woudl say this is definitely a Vampire movie worth watching over and over again. Kiefer Sutherland, Jami Gertz, Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Jason Patric, Diane Wiest (Law &amp; Order), Alex Winter (Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure), Barnard Hughes ( Buzz from Blossom) is a riot in this as Grandpa. The entire cast worked so well and no wonder it was also good was that it is a Joel Schumacher film. I would have to say that this was the pinacle for Feldman and Haim. After this thier career just plummeted. Watch this movie and you will recognize so many faces in it, the effects are cool, the camera shots are really good and the music is perfect for this type of film. If you are gonna watch some supernatural flicks then definitely add this to the list. The Craft, Lost Boys, John Carpenter's Vampires, Modern Vampires and Fright Night have to be the top 5 supernatural flicks to watch. None are boring at all. Lost Boys rates up there with Breakfast Club as one of the best films from the 80's. Remember, a Vampire cannot come into your house unless he is invited. Once again, ohh that Jami Gertz..what a babe she was/is.</fullReview>

It's really hard to believe that this movie was made in the '80's it visual effects were state-of-the-art in the years in which this movie was made. Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, from 'Stepmonster' provided the humor; while Kiefer Sutherland (David) and his gang of Blood-suckers the horror and Jami Gertz and Jason Patric the Romance; all contribute to the excitement.</fullReview>

One night they are hanging out at a local boardwalk watching a concert. When Michael spots a beautiful girl in the crowd. It's love at first sight for Mike but what Michael doesn't know is that this pretty girl is deeply involved with a dangerous group of hip young vampires lead by Kiefer Sutherland (who is excellent in this movie). Michael is soon drawn into the group. Great one liners and a rock filled sound track helped propel this movie to the top of my must see movie list. GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Pan and Dracula as they should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is probably one of the best vampire movies.Most vampire movies have leading vampires that are centuries old and are tired of their lifes,being lonely.See Nosferatu in Venice to know what I'm talking about.In this one the vampires are all still young and have found a way not to be lonely.They live together as a familie and try to turn friends and lovers into vampires as well.Immortals and with good company to keep you interested in life.The motivation is excellent. They have also figured they are better than mainstream humanity,which is right.They believe they are better than anybody else.Doesn't their claim remind you what the Hitler Junge believed in Nazi Germany?Max would be a good Fuhrer too,once he started getting more ambitious. It also has referances to Peter Pan.The Lost Boys are Peter Pan's gang.The vampire gang of this film has the same name.Peter Pan was cruel towards his enemies and towards everybody from his Lost Boys who questioned his authority.Doesn't Max behave in this way?Peter Pan and his Lost Boys had found a way to be forever young.Those Vampires found one too.Remember the movie "Hook"about Peter Pan growing up and being a lawyer?Forget it.He has grown up being a vampire calling himself Max. The music is excelent.Especialy the song"People are strange"is unforgetable once you see this movie. By the way the mysterious guy in this movie is the Granpa.What part does he play? Worth having.Too bad it's almost impossible to find it in Greece anymore and the TV only aired it once.</fullReview>

If you like hot guys (Kiefer Sutherland, note the name, and Jason Patric) vampires, and campy humor, this movie is for you. Watch at least once and you'll be hooked! And if you already have seen this movie I recommend Freeway (1996) and Interview With The Vampire (1994?). Freeway also stars Kiefer Sutherland but is not about vampires. Interview With The Vampire stars Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and Kirsten Dunst. Its about vampires but is not funny.

		<fullReview>While this film definitely isn't the best vampire film ever made, it does have its moments. It also predates the current fascination with vampires in youth culture by about five or six years, which makes it a tad pioneering in that aspect.Kiefer Sutherland has the dominate look in this movie...while the Coreys Haim &amp; Feldman provide much of the comic relief as two of the vampire hunters. Think of it as a more adult version of the Goonies.The movie provides a few memorable scenes, especially the trail trestle and the bathtub scene, that have been emulated or parodied in some way elsewhere. The Lost Boys doesn't really live up to the title, but it is a fun film to watch...and definitely should be on everyone's vampire list.</fullReview>

At the carnival Mike falls for Star who leads him to the pack, and Sam finds the Frog brothers, vampire slayers who end up being a big help. When Mike becomes a vampire, Sam and his new friends help to kill the 4 vampires lead by David, and terminate the head vampire who turns out to be Max, their mom's date!!!!!!!!!

The sound track by the Doors is good to. Sutherland, like his father in many films, gives a very good performance.Patric is also good, and there is a comical but well played role by Fieldman of Goonies fame and lesser known Mork and Mindy. All in all, Lost Boys is a very enjoyable watch and a must see for the film fans of eighties horror like Fright Night I+II. Very good film good actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This got blasted by a lot of critics when it came out in 1987. I never knew why. I liked it then, I like it now. Two brothers (gorgeous Jason Patric, annoying Corey Haim) move with recently divorced mom (Dianne Wiest) to CA and get mixed up with a gang of vampires. Plot wise this is no great shakes and some of the acting is really bad (Corey Feldman and Jami Gertz in particular), but the film is a lot of fun to watch. It moves quickly, looks great (especially on DVD), has some very good performances (Kiefer Sutherland and Wiest really stand out) and is never too gory or bloody (film deserves a PG-13, not the R it got). WARNING! Some possible spoilers ahead----Also some of the lines are priceless--"My brother! A scum-sucking, blood-sucking creature of the night! Wait till mom finds out!" or "Don't kill me Mike. Basically I'm a good kid." Also, there are fairly decent special effects, a few good jolts and a great soundtrack. One of the best horror comedies of the 1980s. This withstands the test of time very well.</fullReview>

And it is a true teen angst classic. So you want to lump it in with eighties films, but it is one of the few FILMS that stand up against the test of time.So Haim and Feldman never made a good movie since, except maybe Licence to Drive, forget that Jason Patric has never been so good up until your friends and neighbors, Keifer Sutherland, well he just keeps on trying doesn't he?

There are a lot of pretenders to the throne and that's what they are : pretenders. This movie has the word "CULT" written all over it. The atmosphere is kind of light-dark. Kiefer Sutherland plays his best role ever. The humor is pretty good. The Frog brothers, those guys are rich. And one thing is for sure, after seeing this movie I am never gonna eat noodles again.

On to the movie... I like this movie, it does have some quirks that SPOILERS can show (the scene with the motorcycle lights outside of the house being one of them) but the soundtrack is great (save for Elton John's out of place contribution), the movie has a surreal campy atmosphere (Joel Schumacher didn't want this feeling in this movie, but too much editing for this effect would've hacked this movie!) that I particularly like, the night shots seem to score the movie's intention.

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie last year when a friend lent it to me. What i expected from this movie was a lame, boring b-movie flick. But what i got was an awe inspireing cult classic vampire movie. The effects even compared to todays standards look pretty good. I can say without a shadow of a doubt this is my fave movie ever and anyone that hasn't seent it should go and rent or even buy a copy this second. It is a must see movie that everyone should get to enjoy. There are rumours of a Lost Girls movie possibly being made i am already psyched for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bloody good time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher directed this fun, exciting and bloody 80's vampire film. And it has just about everything needed for any 80's blockbuster, the duo Corey, Kiefer Sutherland, loud 80's music, innovative camera tricks and violence. The story tells the tale of a mother (Dianne Wiest) and her two sons, Sam and Michael (Corey Haim,Jason Patric) who have just moved from Phoenix to sunny Santa Clara, California. The mother has just been divorced and moving the family in with her father (Barnard Hughes). During a night out at the carnival, the mother gets a job at with a mysterious video storeowner named Max (Edward Herrmann). The eldest son Michael meets the girl of his dreams, Star (Jami Gertz) and her assumed boyfriend (Kiefer Sutherland) and his gang. The youngest son Sam has a run in with two guys (Corey Feldman,Jamison Newlander) who run a comics store by day and hunt the undead in their spare time. After this one night they all will realize that Santa Clara isn't, as it seems. This film is pure fun, plain and simple. The actors have fun with their roles and don't play them too serious, just enough to get the point across. It makes for a more enjoyable film. What makes this film most fun and different is Joel Schumacher's direction. There are a lot of colors that make each scene standout from the next. The `attacks' are filmed in such a fast-paced action sequence style that they amaze and shock all at the same time. The CGI is pretty good and hardly anything looks really unreal. This film runs like MI2. You may have to wait for the intense action sequences but when they come put you seat backs and tray tables in their up right positions and get ready for take off. One of the best vampire films of all time (running along side with Blade and From Dusk Till Dawn) Lost Boys is a whole lot of fun and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lost Boys has it all. The Corey duo teams up for the first time in this vampire flick from Batman Forever director, Joel Shumacher. With a well rounded cast with Jason Patric, Keifer Sutherland, and Dianne Wiest in the leads, this film can't miss. It also might be a good one with any kids of the 80's out there. The classic clothing worn by Corey Haim, scream 80's. In my opinion the film wasn't too scary, but some parts definitely kept you on edge. The film turns out to be an 80's classic, and the soundtrack is just as effective, it definitely lives up to the cult classic hype.</fullReview>

I just wanted to leave a comment on this film because Warner is working on a "Lost Girls" title. This is being done on the strength of the cult popularity of "Lost Boys" and the popularity of the Buffy Series. A vampire version of The Craft??? Sounds fun to me.

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Silly Brat-pack Vampire Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys Joel Schumacher USA 1987 97 mins Been feeling a bit under the weather lately? Too many late nights? Keep missing the daytime or having to wear sunglasses when you do make it up before dusk? Well, student life eh?... or maybe not... how do you feel about garlic? Crosses? Stakes? Yes, it's vampire time again.... Boasting not just one but both of those lovely late 1980s/early '90s pubescent "pin-ups" (or so I was told at the time) called "Corey" this is a sort of brat-packer attempt at the typical vampire/horror flick. The basic plot type thingie runs a bit like this: Dianne Weist is a recently divorced mom of two who moves herself and her boys Sam (Haim) and Michael (Jason Patric) nearer to her father in Santa Carla, California. Sam starts to worry about his brother's new gang of chums and his strange social activities and also happens to make friends with a somewhat batty comic-mad self-appointed Vampire hunter (Feldman enjoying himself). Both gang up and with a little helpful advice from Grandpa (Barnard Hughes having an obscenely fun time!) decide to start investigating a bit. Inevitably blood is spilled and supped and much vampirical make-up applied (including some impressively effective red contact lenses), you might also catch the odd special effect (well ok a bit of flying anyway) and some decent music - including the excellent "People Are Strange" (you will be humming it as you leave) and "Don't Let The Sun Come Down On Me" (groan). Bloodsucking support comes in the form of Alex Winter (who you may recall as "the one that isn't Keanu Reeves" from the Bill &amp; Ted films) and Keifer Sutherland (yet again competing with Kevin Bacon for the title of "most dodgy films made in a decade"). Both do fine in their roles as does the rest of the gang but the person to watch out for is Barnard Hughes, he somewhat steals the show making the most of his occasional lines and the fact that he doesn't have to play too kindly an old fella for once. It's a very silly romp (Joel Shumacher directs) but as it knows it's own limitations it is much fun with it, although you probably need to be able to overlook a few things - try not to picture Jason Patric in The Doors whenever he appears (I find this almost impossible) and attempt not to have Blossom flashbacks whenever Grandpa makes an appearance (maybe you were fortunate enough not to have grown up watching the damn thing?). If you can do that and can cope with the eighties facade - in fact the decade suits vampire movies quite well if this and The Hunger are any sensible measure - then you should be fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly it is. The only competitor is Dusk till Dawn and I don't count that as it doesn't have a real plot and is a bit of a spoof. This film however has an excellent plot, making Vampirism come into modern day as a kind of drug, a youth culture type thing. It is scary in places, it is very funny in places. The set pieces are excellent and the memorable lines even better. My favourates include:1) Edgar Fogg: "Holy Shit! The attack of Eddy Munster!"2) Sam: (Seeing his Brother MIcheal has no reflection in the) (mirror) "Your a creature of the night Micheal. My own brother a god damn, shit-sucking vampire! Yeah well! YOU WAIT TILL MOM FINDS OUT"3) Edgar Fogg: " 'Burn Rubber' does not mean WARP SPEED!!!"4) Sam: "Death by Stereo."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those films that can be watched many, many times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw The Lost Boys when I was nine on its TV premier and I'll admit it scared me badly. In fact, very badly. But when I finally got the courage to watch it again a couple of years later I thought "Woah!", this film's actually quite amazing. Of all those vampire films made in the 80's (including Fright Night, Near Dark, Vamp), The Lost Boys stands out as the best of them. It's also the best vampire film ever, full stop. The reason I love this film so much is the unsettling, creepy atmosphere delivered by director Joel Schumacher who sets the mood perfectly from the very start. Schumacher puts some danger and excitement back into the genre, and the first hour of the film is extremely well directed.It's got a terrific, exciting story, involving brothers Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) moving with their mother (Dianne Wiest) to the coastal town of Santa Carla, which is notorious for being the "Murder Capital of the World". This doesn't stop the brothers going out to the local amusement park that night, where they get a taste of the town's nightlife. It's not long before Michael falls for the wrong girl and he gets caught up with the dangerous Lost Boys,a group of vampire bikers led by David (Kiefer Sutherland), who gets Michael to join his friends by making him drink a very suspicious looking drink that could be blood (Of course it is!). Soon after Michael starts to become one of the undead, and its up to Sam to work out what to do.That's enough of the story, though. I've seen this film more than any other and I still can't get enough of it. In fact, it's almost perfect. Certain scenes, such as those at the amusement park, the cave, the train bridge and the beach are truly excellent, complimented by the brilliant use of music, lighting and camerawork. There's just one flaw: after the tremendous, suspenseful build up, I for one found the initial spectacle of the big house-bound booby-trap conclusion a little disappointing after a while, as Schumacher ditches the interesting dramatic conflicts of the main characters in exchange for non-stop special effects and action, which is well staged in its own right, but in my opinion seems like a bit of a cop-out. Still, what preceeds this is absolutely superb stuff, helped mainly by Sutherland's excellent performance. He delivers the best performance in the film, and is undoubtedly the best screen vampire ever with his scary and charismatic presence. Overall, The Lost Boys is first-rate entertainment and one of those films that can be watched many, many times. One of the quintessential films of the 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great mood and atmosphere. Stunning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of my favorite vampire movies. True, it doesn't stack up to Interview, but hey, Interview was made from a novel, and a very stunning novel at that. The comparison isn't fair. What strikes me the most about The Lost Boys is the mood and atmosphere generated by the film. The ocean wind, the crashing waves, mist gently swirling below the railroad trestle, the eerie music integrated seamlessly into the scenes, the simultaneous decadence and horror of the Boys' existence. Michael struggling with his own golden-eyed beast as the Boys ruthlessly tear apart the beach party. David, on top of the bluff, "How far are you willing to go?" Now, it's true that the humor can get a little old, especially if the Coreys irritate you. And it's true that there are a few(only a few) painfully horrid lines uttered by said Coreys. However, Kiefer Sutherland more than makes up for it, and after you see the shimmering blue-black ocean flying by beneath you and hear the swishing of long coats and the demonic laughter that is uniquely David's, you may just feel tempted to put on a dark coat and skulk around on your local carousel, and you will almost certainly think twice before heading to the amusement park after sundown...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 80's Classic - Yet Still Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember seeing this one with my friends in the theater the day it came out. The Lost Boys is by far Kiefer Sutherland's best work. The film evolves around two brothers, who along with their mother move to the seaside town of Santa Carla to live with their grandfather. It just so happens that Santa Carla is also known as the "murder capital of the world". People disappear in this town like its a bodily function or something. Michael, the older brother, while in pursuit of the soon to be love interest (an incredibly sexy Jami Gertz), manages to fall in with the not so in crowd of punks who live in Santa Carla (actually, they're a group of vampires.....no, this is not a spoiler). Lets just say that the story progresses from there and becomes a well written drama with tremendous comic overtones. The actors were perfectly cast, from the innocent mom (played by 2 time Oscar winner Diane Wiest), to hip little brother Sam (Cory Haim's only good role), the incredibly alluring Jami Gertz and the sinister and devious Sutherland as David. Not to mention, Cory Feldman is spot on as one half of the Frog Brothers (Santa Carla's underground vampire mercenaries). I wound up seeing this one 8 times in the theater and still love everything about it. The soundtrack is excellent, and Schumacher actually does a great job directing as well as setting the feel and look of the film (unlike his blunders with the subsequent Batman films). This film is pure entertainment from start to finish. The plot constantly moves and provides a few interesting turns here and there. I really can't say enough about this film. Every time I watch it something else about it effects me in a whole new way. I own it, and would recommend purchasing it to anybody who thinks about it. The Lost Boys is just one of those unique films that unconventionally gets a hold of you and does not let go. Truly one of my all time favorites.SSB - October 6, 1999 - NYC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words cannot not describe the awesome power of "The Lost Boys"! You have to experience it for yourself, with a loud stereo and a big screen. I was awestruck at how uplifting and wild the ride was. I would compare this film to your average roller coaster! It's amazing how fun this movie is. Sure some of it can be a little silly, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the film. What really holds the film together is Kiefer Sutherland. He's a cunning, violent punk who has played the role of a gang leader before. He fits the role of a leading vampire perfectly! There is also an extraordinary amount of humor in the film. My favorite scenes are the ones with the two vampire killers, because everything they say or do is right out of whatever movies or TV shows they've seen. Corey Feldmen too, has played this kind of role before. This is also director Joel Schumacher's best film, at least his most watchable. His direction of the overly extravagant "Batman Forever" and "Batman and Robin" turned me off, because they shied away from the seriousness of the first too films. However, "The Lost Boys" works perfectly for him, because extravagance and overkill are his game. The special effects are pretty good for the time. They look a hell of a lot better than those dingy CGI images! The soundtrack is incredible! The music adds action and exhiliration to the scenes. The indescribeable vampire sounds reminded me of the horrifying witch sounds in "The Blair Witch Project". Don't expect an intellectual masterpiece, but also don't expect a stupid film either. There is something to be learned from this film. It's the consequences that peer pressure can cause somebody. The main character is Micheal, who becomes friends with the town gang. Little does he know that they are actually vampires, and want him too to become a vampire. It's about recklessness and initiations that can cause a perfectly normal guy into a nasty, vicious punk, or in the case of this film, a blood sucking vampire. Nonetheless, whether you are trying to learn something from this film or not, I still recommend it to you! It's an awesome movie!</fullReview>

And let us not forget the cool gang of vampires with the ever-so-hot Keifer Sutherland. Then we move to the story that takes place in Santa Carla, murder capital of the world. The story is great and just gives off this awesome dark feeling. It's even funny with these witty one-liners. Oh, and then the soundtrack! The soundtrack is amazing and fits this movie perfectly.

		<fullReview>Next to "Fright Night," this is definitely one of my favorites. John Carpenter's movie "Vampire$" just doesn't compare. The humor in "Lost Boys" is better and much more mature considering that a lot of it is coming from young teenage boys and the suspense is way cooler. The vampires are likeable (frankly, they're the reason I watch that movie over and over again!). The actors in "Lost Boys" are great (even the good guys who aren't my favorite characters). I loved the cave...and I won't say more about that...just that I loved it. The atmosphere of the town and the beach lends itself to truly memorable scenes and you can almost feel the wind coming up off the waves. I've never heard a soundtrack that fits its movie more! There are upbeat songs and songs that grab your heart and give it a little twist with their haunting tunes and words. I bought it right after I saw the movie the first time and I still listen to it a lot.All in all, I recommend this movie for anyone who fondly remembers the 80s. It takes me back every time to a time and style that I miss. A truly great film...a truly great soundtrack. If you love vampires and you love the 80s, rent it today and watch it over and over!</fullReview>

"The Lost Boys" delivers in every way, just adding to the list of great horror films that came out in 1987. This movie is still just as fun to watch today as it was 12 years ago. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film years ago and although I enjoyed it I pretty much forgot about it until I caught it on the telly. Seeing it again made me fall in love with it. The humor is spot on, the one-liners brilliant, the acting great and the soundtrack really fits in with the film. My favorite part had to be the exploding vampire, not the greatest effects but still great. It has its flaws, continuity errors but all in all I really enjoyed this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Lost Boys for the first time 11years ago, and I still can't understand how ahead of its this time this movie was. The soundtrack is marvellous and like the whole movie, is very very modern. All the actors, specially the vampires, have a wonderful look. Schumacher made everything in this movie to look extremely modern, and he actually did. I can hardly say this was the most "ahead of its time" movie ever made. It's certainly the best vampire movie ever made. When I say everything is good in this movie, I really do. If you don't agree with me, do what I am going to say: compare the ingredients of Lost Boys with the others vampire movies (like Fright Night, Interview with the Vampire, Near Dark,Vampires) then, remember Lost Boys was made in 1987 (above his time), finally you will notice how good Lost Boys is. To get an end, you have to make justice for it, vote at least 10, it's the least thing you can do to give Lost Boys the recognition it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. What makes me love it even more is that is was filmed on and around the boardwalk, close to where I live. One interesting aspect is the scene where David and the gang ride their motorbikes off of the boardwalk and out onto sheer cliff. Now, if you were actually to do that you would ride straight down the beach and into the Pacific Ocean. I wonder where the cliffs came from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many of us when we were teens felt alienated from the rest of the world? I'll bet all of us and this film gives the perfect set-up for Michael's vulnerability- the breakup of his parents' marriage forcing his mother,brother and himself to move in with his grandfather! Understandably depressed and down he soon ditches his younger brother to be enticed by this mysterious girl called Star. Before he knows it,he's suddenly part of the 'in'crowd and is so thrilled that he never thinks to question their nocturnal habits! Well, before too long, he's sleeping in all day and partying all night (and not remembering too well what happened)and his distraught mother is having no luck getting him to tell her what's bothering him and his grandfather is too wrapped up in his own world of taxidermy to be of any help ( it seems)! It's up to his younger brother(and his friends the Frog Brothers ( a great sequel could have been made with them as the focus) to see if he can save him from this mess he's gotten himself into thanks to his own lack of 'bat-sense'! Still, its indecisive tone (about whether to be a straight horror movie/comedy/social commentary) is a stumbling block. Apart from Michael, Star and an 'Eddie Munster' wanna-be we are given no insight as to what led the vamp pack to join up with the head vamp(whose ID isn't as surprising as the movie would want us to believe). Worst of all, an unnecessarily gruesome (and gross) conclusion REALLY weighs it down at the end!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the Lost Boys is certainly identifiable as an 80's movie because of the costumes e.t.c, the quality of the movie is certainly of one of the highest standards that came out of the 80's. The music is eeringly effective as is Joel Schumacher's direction. This movie would probably be more successful if it was released today given the popularity of horror films in the late 90's (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer). Probably Corey Haim and Corey Feldman's most memorable performances. Also rating a big mention, Jami Gertz who has a great screen presence in this movie as the 'lost girl' - 'Star'. Certainly a movie that can be watched again and again.</fullReview>

It was a revolution that started the vampire craze in the 80's and 90's with this and Fright Night. Does it still hold up today.The film follows a young Micheal played by Jason Patric who gets bitten by a bat and starts to turn into a vampire and gets chased and hunted down by a group of vampires.This film has a good 80's feel and terrific special effects. But the only problem is that it shifts from a quiet calm film to an out of control gore fest with vampire guts everywhere.

		<fullReview>I do find Joel Schumacher very hit and miss, when he's good, he is very good, when he is bad, he is very bad. The Lost Boys is a contender alongside Veronica Guerin as the best of his movies. Of course the feel is very 1980s, hence I can understand why some may find it dated. However, the 80s feel adds to the charm of The Lost Boys to me. The film looks very stylish and has a killer soundtrack, my personal favourite soundtrack of Schumacher's movies actually. The script has some cheesy moments, but it is still very entertaining, and the story is swiftly and intelligently told. Schumacher's direction is one of his more secure directing jobs too, no heavy-handedness, no over-saturated colour or frenzied camera work here. The characters are very likable, especially Corey Haim's, and the acting is great. Haim is adorable, but it is Keifer Sutherland who stood out to me as the most impressive and perhaps most dynamic performer of the cast. All in all, a lot of fun, one of my personal favourites of the late 80s. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monster Movie Fun At It's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the rare few movies that epitomized summer monster movie coolness! I had so much fun at the movies watching this film that it for me defines my 80's movie going experience. Wish I had seen it at the drive-in! I'm the same age as the actors and was going through a similar situation in my life as the character Michael. I also work in comic books and at that time almost was drawing toons for the company Blackthorne seen in the movie so this flick hits home for me on many fronts! It's a great story, great cast, kick butt soundtrack and has everything a movie is supposed to have.I at first thought it would be some dreary vampire movie but the comedy level didn't overshadow the horror and suspense and good old fashioned storytelling that makes the difference between a mere movie and a work of cinema.The cast just rules in this movie and what's extra cool is that Keifer Southerland hangs out in my neighborhood. I would see him every night at his favorite bistro and I was a fan of his for years as he was also a rodeo expert. I always left him alone though as I know it is rough being a celeb and all the crap they go through. However you have to hand it to him in this movie. He ROCKED this movie and gave us a villain that stands out. Being a vampire villain of note takes lots of character and ability as you have such a long history to prove yourself against.When I scored a copy of the DVD I'll never forget that there was only one copy left in a humongous video store and I snagged it, walked up to the counter and a fellow saw my purchase and screamed out "Great choice! Awesome movie!" and we chatted about how cool it was and the theatre going experience it provided.Surreal, funny, suspenseful, action, horror, you can't beat this flick for being one of the rare pound for pound "good ones" Hollywood has produced.Sure there are mullets a-plenty but that was the style back then and the flick still holds up.Did I mention you couldn't beat the cast? Just superb.This is a must have movie for those Saturday afternoons and evenings when the gang is around the house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lost Boys offers thrills and is a trip back to the 1980s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first time I saw The Lost Boys, I thought the film was fantastic. I was fascinated by the visual impact of the movie. The amazing carnival scenes, the beach-concert scene-all of these scenes helped to establish a great atmosphere in the movie. The Santa Carla Boardwalk was made to be the place to be at night. Then the audience saw The Lost Boys. We got to see them visually. The camera and Schumacher established that they were rather shady characters-very dangerous and fun-loving. They didn't speak, but the audience could see their impact on the boardwalk, and later on the main character, Mike Emerson. To give a short summary, the Lost Boys is a film that centers around the lives of two brothers,Sam and Michael Emerson, and their mother Lucy as they move from Phoenix to Santa Carla one fateful summer. The brothers each face their own conflicts: Mike feels like he has to fit in the cool crowd, and Sam feels that Santa Carla has nothing interesting to offer him. Lucy too has a problem: she's flat broke and needs to find a job. Soon Mike falls into the wrong crowd when he meets Star, and he starts hanging out with four young wild bikers-David, Paul, Dwayne and Marco. When Mike starts to change his behavior(and levitates off the bed) Sam realizes that it is up to him to help Mike. But it all starts to get complicated when Sam and Mike's mother starts to date Max, her boss. Sam ends up with the conclusion (with the help of the Frogg brothers, who he met at a comic book store)that Max has something to do with his brother's transformation into a vampire. When their plan fails, the Frogg brothers come up with another conclusion: perhaps the reason Mike is transforming into a vampire is because of David and his friends. It is then that the trio come come up with a new plan...I will leave out the rest of the movie, because I don't want to reveal too much. The Lost Boys is an excellent film-it's thrilling, it's funny, and the visuals and 80s music are great. I personally liked to see California as it was back in the 1980s. The songs in the film, such as "Cry Little Sister" and "People are Strange" were and are my favorites. The participation of Kiefer Sutherland in the film helped a lot. He was perfectly cast as David. He added an air of danger to his character, and he was eternally "cool" in the role. The other actors- Brooke Mccarter, Billy Wirth, and Alexander Winter-were all perfect in their roles as vampires too. For their part, the two Coreys and Diane Wiest completed the rest of the movie with their participation in the Lost Boys. If you like the 80s, action, comedy, vampires and if one of your favorite actors is Kiefer Sutherland, then you'll love The Lost Boys.</fullReview>

He provided me two facts that make me wonder if this is true...1-Corey Haim wear's a shirt reading "born to shop"okay, that doesn't mean anything, but how about2-the Rob Lowe pin-up (bare stomache revealed) hanging on his closet door.these clues both remain in the movie, watch it again if you don't believe me. so what do you think? could it be a possibility?debonaire82</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It tries to be renewing, but is too conservative at the same time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you aren't a very big fan of vampire movies, you better leave this one alone because it will be quite disappointing. I know what I'm talking about, because I like vampire movies (even though it is not my favorite kind of movies), but I wasn't impressed by this one at all.So where did it fail? Well, it tried to be original and renewing, which I appreciate, but it was conservative as well. They did an effort to show us vampires in a different way (this ones could actually fly, they sleep in a cave instead of a coffin, don't wear an "old-fashioned" costume...), but on the other hand the filmmakers didn't want to be too progressive either. They still let the main characters fight the vampires with holy water, a lot of garlic and by bashing a wooden stick through the vampires' hearts.And that wasn't my only problem. Perhaps it was all very new in the eighties, but today we have been flooded by teenage horror movies, making that this one really doesn't stand out above the others. Add to this a dated and far from original scenario and you know that you have a movie that isn't really worth much attention.The only reason I can imagine that you want to see this movie is the music and the costumes. If you are a fan of eighties pop music, than you'll hear some fine classics in the soundtrack. If you want to have a good laugh, than you should pay some attention to the way they are dressed. Especially the 'bad' guys look like the Village People. LOL. For me however that isn't enough to like this movie. I give it a 5.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Santa Carla: Murder Capital of the World.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys practically defines 80s teens movies as a horror movie with a pretty hot teen cast. Two Brothers, Sam (Haim) and Mike (Patric) move with their newly divorced mom (Wiest) from Phoenix to Santa Carla, a place where, if the corpses were to all stand up at once, there'd be one hell of a population problem, as their goofy backwoods grandfather (Bernard Hughes) explains. Mike is the first to find out why when his interest in a girl suddenly lures him into a world of trouble with a clan of teen vampires lead by a guy named David (Sutherland). And as Sam's brother turns into a "goddamned bloodsucking vampire," Sam has to call on the strange Frog brothers (Feldman and Newlander) for help, despite his disbelief of their previous warnings that Santa Carla has a major vampire problem, and to their suspicion, possibly werewolves and ghouls as well. They have to find out who the head vampire is before Mike, Star (Jami Garr), and Laddie (Corbitt) become full vampires. This is one fantastic movie as teenagers try to save the day from the cave-dwelling bloodsuckers. Even their enemies--David (Sutherland), Marco (Winter), Paul (Wirth), and Dwayne (McCarter) are cool, even though they are vampires out to kill Sam and Mike and everyone else. The cast was great in this movie, even Bernard Hughes as Sam and Mike's grandfather because he is just so completely goofy. Edward Herrman and Diane Wiest are likewise funny as their dates are usually spoiled by the intervention by Sam and his vampire hunting endeavors. But, the reason why this is probably the great 80s movie that it is aside from the story, is the hot teen cast, particularly the gorgeous Jason Patric and even Kiefer Sutherland in a part very contrasting to the wierd roles he seemed to be accustomed to in those days. Jami Garr, too, was fantastic as Star, breaking out of previous typecasting as a geek like Muffy Tepperman on "Square Pegs" or for her brief role in Mischief.Unfortunately, for those who are Corey Haim and Feldman days, this film (and possibly License to Drive and Dream a Little Dream) mark the last good movies that either will appear in as they eventually went on a junkie fest and turned into bitterly annoying teenagers in the later 80s. This is one the greatest films that you'll see either Corey in. As for other qualities of the movie, you do get a real feel for 80s culture, particularly in the opening sequence along Santa Carla's pier. Mohawks and rad pads everywhere, oh it's a scene, man! And the soundtrack is pretty good, too, with a collection of songs by INXS, Echo and the Bunnymen, and Tim Capello (who used performed with Tina Turner in the Mad Max music videos "We Don't Need Another Hero" and "One of the Living").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dianne Wiest and her two sons (Corey Haim and Jason Patric) move to a small town that is really inhabited by vampires that come out to murder at night. Everything is tongue-in-cheek though as Patric falls under the spell of beauty Jami Gertz and starts to hang out with Kiefer Sutherland and his gang of motorcycle thugs. Soon Patric starts acting strangely and Haim (already warned by spooky teens Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander) realizes that his older brother is really a creature of the night. As all this goes on Wiest tries to keep her father (Barnard Hughes) out of trouble and also finds romance with electronics store owner Edward Herrmann. As the film advances it is apparent that twists and turns could end up dictating the direction the film is going to take. "The Lost Boys" is a strange over-achiever. It should not be as good as it is, but it is saved by some funny performances and by solid direction by the usually dependable Joel Schumacher. Overall I liked the movie and I found it to be one of those guilty pleasure experiences. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reliable vampire fun that suddenly gets lost and confused.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Either THE LOST BOYS is a modern-age urban vampire movie going down the drain, or a "family" film with some greasy bloody stains. You can't hardly think but recognize this being a modern retelling of historical legends that pertain to vampire slayers, be it fact or fantasy. With two Coreys (Haim and Feldman) having a good time, you can expect this to be just as fun as THE GOONIES. That alone doesn't make it too easy to call this a chilling horror film which has nowhere to go but down. I won't think for a moment that Kiefer Sutherland and his band of razor-sharp cycle punks would make it look "stylish", a word many of us love to use in describing vamp flicks. Those who grew up in the 80s like I did will have found this extremely enjoyable, and just as much as any movie would shout out the words "Death by stereo!". True vampire addicts who like their thrills and chills 100% guaranteed need caution here, because this feels more like a kid's day in the park than anything else. But then, you get the fangs, the blood, the whole damn thing. Okay fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Teen's Vampire Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a vampire movie for teenagers, or at least was when it came out. A number of these actors became well-known as adults. Teens definitely would like this film better than adults.However, older folks can still be entertained by this if they don't let the obnoxious teen attitudes get to them, and just enjoy the colorful scenes in here. It's lightweight horror-comic entertainment but gets pretty tense in the last 15-20 minutes.Overall, this just didn't leave a good taste in my mouth. I did let these teens' attitudes get to me, making me annoyed at times. I was a bit aggravating watching the too liberal mother (Diane Weist) in the way she handled her kids, too.There are so many other good vampires movies that worth keeping. This is worth a rental but not a purchase.Some of those younger actors were Keifer Sutherland, Jason Patric, Corey Feldman, Jamie Gertz and Cory Heim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mother ( Dianne West) with two sons ( Jason Patric and Corey Haim) have moved into San Carlas California, but one night while checking out the local amusement area the older son Michael meets a gang of vampires led by David ( Keither Sutherland) and go out to drain the blood from people and two comic book experts ( Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander) know the secrets of the vampires.This happens to be the best vampire movie made in the 80's next to " Fright Night" directed by Joel Schumacher. The casting is good, the make-up and vampire effects by Greg Cannom are great, acting's good and it's a very entertaining, gory and hip yet comical horror thriller that takes the vampire genre on a new 80's spin.I strongly recommend this movie to every horror and vampire fan out there but it's only owning in the new 2-Disc DVD special edition with great extras, it's a class act movie of it's genre.Also recommended: " Fright Night", "Vamp", " Fright Night 2", "Evil Dead II", " Demons", " The Forsaken", " Bram Stoker's Dracula", " Vampire Hunter D", " The Craft", " An American Werewolf in London", "From Dusk Till Dawn", " The Toxic Avenger", " Rabid", " Shaun of the Dead", " The Evil Dead", "Re-Animator", " Bordello of Blood", " Dracula ( 1931)", " Near Dark", " Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust", " Blood: The Last Vampire", " Ghost Ship", " Freddy Vs.

One son befriends them while the other forms an alliance with brothers Feldman and Newlander, who run a comic book store by day and are wannabe vampire hunters at night. Still stylish and scary after all these years. Unfortunately, the story is a bit dull in hindsight, and opportunities for great twists are not taken advantage of? not to mention the rushed finale in an otherwise well-paced horror flick.

		<shortDescription>Good Blend of Comedy/Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is an 80's vampire film that is better than most vampire films out there. It also helps that it is part comedy. There are some very amusing scenes that involves the grandfather, the dog, and of course the Frog Brothers. This film is filled of lush cinematography wince the camera work and lighting is above-average. The makeup is also really good and is better than it's time.Joel Schumacher's film is about a widow and her two teenaged sons moving to Santa Clara to find out the town is not all that peaceful. The older son Michael and the younger one Sam finds out the town is full of vampires. With the help of the Frog Brothers, they must eradicate the gang of vampires known as the Lost Boys in order to get peace.The acting is not all that bad. Corey Haim is decent as Sam but his acting wavers every now and then. Jason Patric is good portraying the stormy Michael. Dianne Wiest is okay but a little annoying as the mother. Corey Feldman is amusing and reminds me of his role in the Goonies. Kiefer Sutherland is actually really creepy as David, the leader of the Lost Boys.Overall, this is a fun vampire film that has plenty of funny moments. In fact, I see this more of a comedy than a horror. But, it's still very creepy. I loved some of the high, aerial views set to 80's rock-n-roll. This is nothing special, but it's something definitely worth watching. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a bit of sweet and sour from the 80's and is nothing if not an artifact of its time. Not really holding up that well, it still manages to entertain with its eye-candy and teen idol panache. It manages, if not full well, to combine Horror and Comedy and deliver an entertaining, fluffy piece of film that was better then and in hindsight somewhat sugary.It has a fresh over-saturated colored look and synth beat that came straight out of the MTV generation's psyche and the movie managed to capture that current of an electric pallet and teen swagger that was in much display as the decade unfolded.Overall, it is better as a time capsule than a period piece of Art. It has a runway fashion appeal for the female crowd and some gory goings-on for the boys and for this it is a rather unique take and as a one shot it is a curiosity that is worth checking out.</fullReview>

One thinks without this, there would be no Twilight, but thats my only criticism of the film.What we have is one of the most fun horror movie ever made, in the same Vein as 'Fright Night' this has young characters in jeopardy, but always with a little pop culture reference at hand.The main thing that is noticeable in this movie, is the homo-eroticism.If you read between the line, the film could be about young men coming out of the closet, David only really comes out of his shell when he meets Michael and the rest of the titular characters, but dismisses the rest of the crew.The wine scene could be classed a a euphemism to another certain bodily fluid, which 'converts Michael, and the longing gazes between him and David are rife throughout.That aside,it's a great movie, with laughs and scares aplenty, and some of the best effects seen in a movie in 1987.This is the movie that put Haim, Sutherland ad Patric on the map, and they should be eternally grateful.The recent sequels have not tarnished the film, and that first sequence of Sutherland appearing on the boardwalk, is as iconic 24 (he he) years later as it was back then.A great vampire movie, and one of the best cult films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i believe that this film is not the best of vampire films, but this is possibly the high expectations i have these days. i thought that this film can relate to younger viewers because of the plot. The gang violence and the drugs and alcohole (the blood). peer pressure is also a factor in this movie as the eldest brother decides to join a gang because he is the new kid and had no friends. I didn't really like this film because it was kind of old. but some parts of the movie were quite good. the effects could possibly be the best part of this movie, even though i don't remember much of this movie but i still remember some of the effects</fullReview>

Some may disagree as it has gone from a box office smash, to a cult movie and now to a hot topicified film, but leave the Hot Topic children alone. They just want attention from other people who have seen the movie. The movie was well worth watching and compared to Schumacher's other garbage, this was his zenith. Now if you haven't seen this film, I suggest watching it during a hot summer night with a girlfriend down on the beach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE LOST BOYS (Joel Schumacher, 1987) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall this film coming out, but have stayed away from it until now because I had assumed it was strictly a modernistic juvenile version of the vampire legend. As it turned out, the real heroes are resourceful, knowledgeable boys a' la THE MONSTER SQUAD (1987) &#x2013; which I did catch on VHS many years ago and now intend to revisit soon.The cast is certainly interesting: Kiefer Sutherland may have the showiest role (as the lead vampire), but Jason Patric is also good as the confused new kid in town unwittingly initiated into the vampire cult. The ubiquitous two Coreys (Haim and Feldman) still exude the charm which made them a popular team around this time; Barnard Hughes almost steals the show as the eccentric grandpa who eventually saves the day, and utters the film's great closing line; Dianne Wiest and Edward Herrmann are less appealing in their roles as the adults.The vampire make-up is OK, and it was nice to see them hanging upside down in caves rather than lying around in coffins. The extended climactic fight may be excessively gory for a kiddie film, but ends the film on a satisfactory note. The reveal of nerdy Herrmann as the villain was not too convincing &#x2013; nor is his clamoring for Wiest as his vampire bride!! &#x2013; and the film would have been better off without them.I liked the in-jokes where movie posters/video box covers &#x2013; including O LUCKY MAN! (1973) &#x2013; were incorporated into the film's production design; also effective was the use of a children's ditty on the soundtrack &#x2013; but that sax-playing muscleman/rock star act was beyond camp. By the way, executive producer Richard Donner was intended to direct but passed on the chores to Joel Schumacher who, all things considered, made a slick, hip and entertaining job of it.</fullReview>

If you ask me to watch the lost boys today I would think that it is sheer eightees cheese but when I was a young teenager I thought that it was the ultimate in cool. Its got a great haunting soundtrack to it by The Sisters of Mercy and that must have been what captured me at the time. Needless to mention Echo and the Bunnymen's cover of The Door's 'People are Strange'. Its a vampire movie, quite wicked at times. Sleep all day, party all night, its fun to be a vampire. The cheesy bits in this movie are like when the kid brother is shocked that his grandfather who is going to be hosting them has no TV and so he says "you know what no TV means? Answer: No MTV." Thats terribly cheesy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Hughes's Near Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is not a horror film or a gorefest. It's a movie made ever so strictly for its target audience, grungy teenagers, and equally as strictly for its time, 1987. If you're not a teenager, and you're not watching it in 1987, you're not going to enjoy it as much. Its focus is on the glamrock, the hairstyles, the clothing, the hip lingo, how sexy Jason Patric is, and how gawky the adults are.For me, an 18-year-old in 2006, it wasn't exactly moving. What I did like about it was the early performance as a villain by Kiefer Sutherland, who would later chill us to the bone as pure evil in several other films, notably An Eye For An Eye and Phone Booth. Being the only vampire that isn't intensely annoying and ugly, he gives the film a lot of ammo, as do Patric, Wiest and Haim, even if Haim is given most of the cheesiest lines.The script is loaded with fun but tiring clichés and dialogue that even teens probably cringe at, especially by the Frog brothers, like "It's the attack of Eddie Munster!" and "The bloodsucking Brady Bunch!" But, the music is actually really good, and the soaring aerial cinematography is fun. If only the movie were made nowadays with much more gore and vampire violence, which this film is practically devoid of, and less formulaic plot elements like Dianne Wiest's naive mother character and Edward Herrmann's dorky older man character. This movie could've been a lot more than it is, but it's OK. If you were a kid in the 1980s, you'll surely love it for sentimental reasons.</fullReview>

Despite this, this is the best film, with the best soundtrack ever made. i remember driving my parents mad by playing the theme song "cry little sister" repeatedly!!

It's basically about a divorced woman played by Diane Wiest and her two sons played by Jason Patric who plays Michael and Corey Haim who plays Sam They move to a small part of California were in the night the two brothers and their mum go to a amusement park where the mum goes to look for a job in a videostore and the older brother fells for a girl named star played by Jami Gertz but she turns out to be part of a group of teenage vampires. He introduces himself but is stopped by David played by Kiefer Sutherland he is the leader of the vampires. He challenges Michael into a motorcycle race and then David wants Michael to join them. By doing this he has to drink some blood and just then he is turned into a vampire. But Sam befriends two brothers played By Corey Fieldman and Jamison Newlander who are called Elgar and Alan in a comic book store and the two brothers warns Sam that in the town there are vampires but Sam thinks they are talking nonsense until one day Michael returns home and Sam realises that his brother has turned into one. while the mother is dating the owner of the video store who is the head vampire of the town.

		<fullReview>The Lost Boys starts as recently divorced Lucy Emerson (Dianne Weist) &amp; her two teenage sons Michael (Jason Patric) &amp; Sam (Coery Haim) arrive in Santa Carla where they intend to live with Lucy's Father (Barnard Hughes), despite having the unenviable tag of 'the murder capital of the world' Santa Carla doesn't seem like a bad place to live. One night at the beach Michael takes a fancy to a girl named Star (Jami Gertz) &amp; becomes involved with a gang of bikers lead by David (Kiefer Sutherland) who turn out to be Vampires &amp; trick Michael into drinking Vampire blood &amp; turning him into one of them. Meanwhile Sam has met Brother's Edgar (Corey Feldman) &amp; Alan Frog (Jamison Newlander) who warn him that the area is crawling with Vampires which Sam thinks is ridiculous, that is until he witness his Brother Michael turning into a Vampire as he flies, has no reflection, sleeps all day &amp; wears sunglasses all the time. Sam calls Edgar &amp; Alan who say they will help destroy the head Vampire which will cure Michael, however David &amp; his Vampires are vicious killing machines...Directed by Joel Schumacher I have to say I really liked The Lost Boys &amp; think it's a great 80's teen horror. The script by Jeffrey Boam, Janice Fischer &amp; James Jeremias is a light comedy horror that isn't exactly deep or meaningful but it provides terrific entertainment if your in the right mood, it moves along at a great pace &amp; is never boring or dull. The character's are great &amp; very likable especially Sam &amp; the Frog Brother's who provide some pretty amusing moments, usually silly over-the-top character's don't work for me but these guys did from the way they talk &amp; ride everywhere on BMX bikes to a scene where they burst into a Church interrupting a christening to fill bottles with holy water. There's some cool action scenes &amp; some nice gore along with plenty of bloodsucking Vampires. This is also one of those films that has a barrel load of memorable dialogue, there's some really cool quotable lines in The Lost Boys. It's not perfect &amp; there are a few plot holes here &amp; there like Max (Edward Herrmann) having a reflection when the other Vampires don't but it didn't seem to matter that much as I was having fun with it.Director Schumacher does a good job &amp; the whole film is pretty stylish throughout, there's some nice Vampire attack scenes, some good action &amp; he keeps things moving at a nice pace. I also have to mention the soundtrack as it's brilliant, I don't usually notice the music in a film that much unless it's really bad but The Lost Boys has a fantastic 80's soundtrack that I thought was great. There's some decent gore although it's not too gruesome, there are some exploding Vampires, stakes through the heart, impalings, severed limbs, melting Vampires, biting, blood squirting, flesh ripping &amp; of course death by stereo.Technically The Lost Boys is great, it's well made with nice production design with &amp; good special effects. The acting was pretty good &amp; the Frog Brother's are very funny.The Lost Boys is a stylish, cool, funny 80's Vampire horror film with an awesome soundtrack that I must admit I really enjoyed. Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

It really is as simple and silly as that. The soundtrack is wonderfully cheesy. The performances are exaggerated and overblown but it all adds to the fun of the fair.This film is perfect for a summer evening. The Corey's are a solid addition to any 80's film.

		<fullReview>The Lost Boys is a great film to watch as a "guy's (or girls, or both) night in" film. The plot is not too complex, but it does seem as though it is juggling a lot of characters. There's the family that just moves to a new town populated by vampires. There's the video shop owner, the motorbike riding vampires and two teenagers who run a comic book store. All of these characters interact with each other and produce an interesting, sometimes funny experience, that does sometimes work as a horror. Personally, I found the Frog brothers characters to be the most entertaining, Corey Feldman doing what he does best, and something only he managed to do - look cool during the 1980s. Though the film is okay taken as is, there are lots of little touches to the film that really make it worth the watch, the muscled, mullet haired, greased up saxophone player, the homosexual undertones in Corey Haim's character, great, I mean great, use of gore, the grandpa character all add little touches that make it a great watch with a group of mates. Corey Haim's acting is notably poor. Sorry, about the link there, but it's been on my mind. He really is bad, and the editor has had to work some miracles to make him look like he's reacting to what's going on, this is notable most in the scene where Grandpa brings him a stuffed animal. But this is okay in a film like this, where we're not expecting an Oscar winning performances, and to be honest, don't want them. So get some mates round and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever this film is on the TV, it is always described as 'Kiefer's finest hour' and I absolutely agree. It's hard to believe that an enthralling performance that held such passion and presence was made when he was barely twenty! Most of the film's best moments belong to Sutherland - Apart the Frog Brothers - and although there is a clear absence of the fashion police it's still a cool, slick movie It tells the story of a divorcée and her two sons Sam and Michael as they move to the 'murder capital of the world' Santa Carla. Eager to make an impression, Michael becomes smitten with a local girl called Star who lures Michael into a world of a Motorcycling vampire gang led by David. At first he sees David as a love rival for Star but quickly realises things are a lot more sinister... Aided only by his brother and his Kooky comic store buddies Edgar and Allan Frog. Michael does battle with David in a bid to save his family and his own mortal soul. This film is an absolute CLASSIC, I LOVE Everything about this: The music, the suspense, the acting, Kiefer and his sexy snarls....a pity about the mullet and Jamie Gertz performance!</fullReview>

Kiefer Sutherland is the real breakout star here. Both Corey Haim and Corey Feldman also contribute to the film's clasicality. The best film of 1987. I loved all aspects of this film. While some may find it boring, I think it makes up for it's lack of major gore with explosively funny and engaging chemistry between the cast. Another title for this film could have been something like: "Teenage Vampires", or: "This Sucks".The ghostly and eery opening sequence will send shivers down your spine.</fullReview>

This movie has some great one liners that still make me smile. Also, as someone who lives close to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, it's fun to see the landmarks I know so well in this movie. Brings it closer to home. Any movie will fail if you hold it up to too many standards.

As soon as the film began, I knew I was gonna love it."The Lost Boys" involves a family - ex-hippie mother Lucy Emerson (Dianne West), tough-guy big brother Michael (Jason Patric), imaginative little brother Sam (Corey Haim) - which moves into Santa Carla, reportedly the murder capital of the world. At first, it seems like a cool town - Sam is pleased to discover a comic book store - but then things start to get weird.Sam teams up with two wacky young vampire slayers (Jamison Newlander and - ta-daa! - Corey Feldman) and begins to suspect his mom is dating a vampire (Edward Herrman); meanwhile, Michael becomes a half-vampire with his mysterious new lover (Jami Gertz). Can the Emerson family survive a week in this city of death? Whether they can or not, I sure as hell loved surviving the 97 minutes of this film. "The Lost Boys" is an 80's classic. The stars, the filming style, and the soundtrack all help to make it so. Joel Schumacher - recently made notorious for ruining the "Batman" film franchise - gives some fine direction from a terrific script by Jeffrey Boam, Janice Fischer, and James Jeremias.One of the highlights of the film is its excellent cast. Corey Haim, 80's fave Corey Feldman (who's hilarious, by the way), Jason Patric, and Kiefer Sutherland. Sutherland's performance is classic and among his best as the leader of a young vampire gang.The soundtrack is excellent, including the score by Thomas Newman. The film's theme, "Cry Little Sister" by Gerard McMann, is perfect. In a way, it completes the film, wrapping around the film in a blanket which gives the film's message: "It wasn't their fault, they were just young".One of the greatest parts of the film is the vampire effects, which includes those perceptive, reddish eyes. Greg Cannom's special effects were ahead of their time, and help make some dark scenes truly creepy.I find "The Lost Boys" to be quite underrated. Most people say it was dumb, childish, or not scary. What they don't understand is that for the most part, the film's not trying to be scary. It is a COMEDY. Even the extremely bloody final fight isn't really scary (by the way, the film is worth seeing if just for this scene)."The Lost Boys" is a classic of the eighties, and I think we can call it a horror classic as well. It has everything a film should have - great acting (and cast!), fine direction, an original script, terrific effects, and a fitting soundtrack. "The Lost Boys" is quite possibly the best vampire movie ever and is essential for horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>80s Vampire Pop Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was seventeen and I fell in love with it for the following reasons: a little vampire camp, cool soundtrack, great special effects, a funny script that would soon pave the way for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and one very sexy Keifer Sutherland and Jason Patric. The film was directed by Joel Schumacher, produced by Goonies producer Richard Donner, and stars Oscar winning actress Dianne Wiest as a recently divorced mother of two sons named Michael (played by Jason Patric) and Sam (played by a post-"Lucas" Corey Haim). She has made the move to the beach town of Santa Carla and the capital of missing people and vampires. As they adjust to their new life in Santa Carla, Michael meets and falls in love with a beautiful and mysterious young woman named Star (played by Jami Gertz) who apparently belongs with a group of motorcycle boys led by David (Keifer Sutherland). It turns out that they are a group of bloodthirsty vampires with Star only being half-vampire. David lures Micheal into the gang to transform him into a vampire and make him a part of the gang. Meanwhile, Sam befriends Edgar and Alan Frog (funny performances by Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander) who are more like junior vampire hunters. As Michael falls more and more under the spell of David, Sam and the Frog brothers are in a race to save Michael and Star and destroy the vampires. Cute, funny, sexy, a little campy, but a lot of fun...a film that would make way for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. Plus, any girl out there would definitely want David to come up to her in a motorcycle...eat your heart out, Dracula;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for my generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the day I saw this film for the first time...2nd Jan 1991 (God, I'm sad!!). Having premiered on BBC1 quite late the previous night, and being a youngster at the time, I had recorded it and had woken up very eager to watch it. All my friends had been talking about it for months...I couldn't wait...I start to watch..."People are Strange" kicks in...I am hooked. It was definitely a film for my generation; regardless of how good it actually is, everyone of roughly my age (I am now 27) who saw it when they were younger absolutely loves it...it's the same with Big Trouble In Little China...it the cinematic equivalent of smoking...it's cool and it has an effect on impressionable youngsters!! I can't tell you how good this film is in the grand scheme of things, I am completely blinkered on the subject...I still see it through 13 year-old eyes...I still love it to bits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun vampire film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two brothers that are new in town, discovers that not only are a group of troublesome punks really vampires, but that they are also responsible for those missing kids around town who's pictures are on the side of milk cartons, in this fun energetic vampire film. When Michael the oldest of the two brothers falls for a young girl that hangs around the group, he is immediately drawn into their circle. Soon his younger brother finds that his sibling is acting much like the vampires that he is reading about in comics, a little too much! He sleeps in the day time, gets attacked by the family dog. And has an uncanny ability to fly outside his bedroom window etc. But when Michael finds out what he has become &amp; what his new found friends really are, he tries to take his new found girlfriend out of the group. But the group is not about to let them go so easily. Soon Michael has to team up with his younger brother &amp; two teen vampire hunters called the Frog Brothers, whom despite being brave &amp; cocky don't know as much about vampires as they think. Now Michael has to kill the leader of the vampires in order to once again render him &amp; his girlfriend human. Setting a battle between the humans &amp; the undead which features holy water, garlic, crosses, steaks &amp; flying vampires galore! THE LOST BOYS is a fun time all around! especially if you're a fan of vampires, or even if you're not! THE LOST BOYS makes for an entertaining, energetic, vampire film. I think what makes THE LOST BOYS such a classic that has still held up even with today's audiences, is that the film is so well written, sharp, funny, &amp; scary. Also the performances here are really good, with the actors making us care for their characters &amp; giving them that little extra something to help keep them memorable &amp; interesting. The special effects were really well done here &amp; JOEL SCHUMACHER'S direction is very well executed, Shumacher knows his stuff behind the camera &amp; has shot one of the best vampire films ever made. The setting &amp; scenery the film is blessed with also earns it some extra points &amp; the script is very sharp &amp; witty. R.I.P. COREY HAIM were going to miss you! Followed by two direct to DVD sequels, starting with LOST BOYS: THE TRIBE (Pssst, if you were smart you would skip that load of dung &amp; head straight for the third film which is so much better! &amp; truer to the original)**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different look at vampires without the Dracula bit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that this film is a classic! but that's my opinion so don't beat me up about it!What more could you want after basically all the traditional Count Dracula and Transylvania stories have been done. It is good to see a different idea for the vampire theme, and it a darker side to a Peter Pan story. The idea of a group of teenage boys never growing old and never dying because of their lust for blood relates to the little children in the Peter Pan tale in the same way as they both have a "Neverland". The "Neverland" for the vampires though is Santa Carla.After a small family move to Santa Carla a mother's two teenage boys get sucked into the vampire world of Santa Carla. Both in different ways from each other. After visiting the fair at the pier one evening the older one Michael (Jason Patric) has his attention grabbed by a mysterious girl named Star (Jami Gertz). Sam the younger one (Corey Haim) sees that Michael has fallen for this pretty young lady and he follows Michael, who in turn is following Star. By following Star this leads to some life altering changes for both of them. They then realize they have uncovered the big secret of why Santa Carla is the " murder capital of the world".So that and a good 80's soundtrack you'll be in for some entertaining viewing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and campy vampire movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way back in 1987 I went to see this movie only because I was one of the extras at the Santa Cruz (Santa Carla) Beach Boardwalk about a year or so earlier. Being a resident of Santa Cruz, I recognize most of the locations where the movie was filmed. It was a lot of fun, and being a big fan of (most) vampire movies I knew I'd love it.Aside from the excitement of being there while it was being filmed, I find I never get tired of watching this film. It's the perfect combination of comedy &amp; horror, with very little gore. In addition to being a great movie, the soundtrack is one of the best compilation albums.There are several great lines in this movie, some still ring true in the area today, such as Jason Patrick asking a local if there are any jobs here, and getting the response "nothing legal."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic 80's Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lost Boys" is a great flick that is a little bit more hip and comical than the usual vampire movies. It is for those 80's lovers who don't mind the cheesiness so much. It has a great cast of characters played by those great 80's actors, such as the Corey's(Feldman and Haim), Jami Gertz, Jason Patric, Bill (from "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"), Dianne Wiest (from "Footloose"), and of course the fantastic Kiefer Sutherland! The guy who plays the grandfather is pretty great too! The Lost Boys is mostly a horror movie, but it does have some very funny comic relief thrown in too. This movie also has a great soundtrack, including INXS! As someone who grew up on this movie I highly recommend it as one of the best 80's flicks!-------Even if you are not a fan of horror movies(like myself)!</fullReview>

I was 20 years old when this film was made, and it's a movie I can still watch over and over again! Now that's a fanatic! It is a classic movie of the 80's that has romance, suspense, horror, comedy, drama, and action. Got to admit, Jason Patric is sexy in his black leather, earring, and long curls! Keifer Sutherland plays a role that you don't usually see him play. The music is wonderful! I would recommend to anyone to watch this movie! I find myself engulfed in it when I watch it! I have always been into "the wild bad boys", and these guys bring it to the table! Joel Schumacher did a wonderful job on the making of this film! His best ever. Corey Haim and Corey Feldman play a great combination together in this movie! Two thumbs up!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as much a reflection of the MTV generation as it is a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as much a reflection of classic 80's MTV generation as it is a film, Lost boys is spawned of an era where flashy visuals and "cool" one liners are what made a blockbuster... If lost boys was to have been released in today's generation of film, chances are it would have been laughed out of the cinema or appreciated only by the few.This isn't to say Lost Boys isn't a good film, in fact it is by many thought to be a great film (me included). Not a great film in relation to the likes of lost in translation, punch drunk love and scarface (some of my favs). But it delivers what is required, on a very different level. The plot is predictable, the story is very 80's glam, the characters are poorly conceived and despite the usual high standard of acting delivered by Kiefer Sutherland the acting in general is weak and 'corny', ? So what is it that makes this film great, what is it that makes so many 80's films considered classics. The reason is because it has plethora of memorable quotes (My own brother a goddamn, s**t-sucking vampire! Oh, you wait 'til mom finds out buddy), sharp exciting filming and a dominant 80's sound track.In short don't watch this film if you want great effects and a edgy horror, Edward Herrmann as a head vampire isn't going to leave traces of brown fear in your pants. But if you want a sharp fun film, with enough quotes to impress your friends for a month, and laughs and smiles a plenty, then Lost Boys is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a documentary on what was hip, stylish, and sought-after in the 80's. The young men were pretty, but bad. They wore leather. They rode motorcycles. They came and went as they pleased. The girls were cute, but mysterious. They wore glitter and lace. The soundtrack was padded with (at the time) modern covers of hip older (and even not-so-much-older) songs. It had Keifer in a spiked mullet and earrings. It had the Coreys, Feldman as Rambo, and Haim as a smirking saved-by-the-bellian. As for standing the test of time, it is still fresh, well-paced and smart. It is quirky, and so never looks foolish against changing times and tastes, because it let itself be a foolish to begin with. And when you get right down to it, which one of us didn't want to be the third Frog brother?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE LOST BOYS is one of my favorite Vampire films. Its funny and thrilling at the same time. But you could definitely tell who the Head Vampire is right from in the first 20 minutes. Its kinda obvious its not David. Hint hit. You know who I'm talking bout. One thing about some vampire movies, is that you can tell who betrayed who, or who did this and that. I do however, love the music in this movie. Very 80's and a good selection for the film. My favourite song in this movie is CRY LITTLE SISTER. (The theme song) I just wish there was a bit more blood and gore. Thats what the movie needed to make it a bit better. Other than that it was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The lost boys' has to be one of the best teenage vampire movies of all time. It was the first movie of the genre to create a stylish, sexy gang of vampires who invole themselves in the contemporary teenage lifestyle. This strayed from the stereotypical idea of the conservative lone vampire which had dominated most movies in the genre around that era.A stunning cast including Jason Patric, Corey Haim and the extremely talented Kiefer Sutherland as David the intimidating leader of the vampire pack bring a contemporary take on the teenage comedy horror flick to life.With rememberable lines such as 'death by stereo!'this movie will allways be a classic. Even seventeen years on it looks as fresh as ever but with an eighties feel which will forever remind us of how brilliantly outrageous the fashion industry was then!.Set in the picturesque calafornian costal town of santa carla which suited the movie perfectly and made it visualy stunning in another way apart from the graphics and makeup. Unfortunately many of the sites seen in the movie were destroyed in an earthquake in 1989.The characters are unique and interesting adding more depth to the plot. This is some of the casts best work ever.A must see film for any horror/comedy fan or any fans of the cast members. my personal favorite 10/10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * Brilliant WARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* Michael and Sam Emerson(Jason Patric and Corey Haim) are a couple of regular American teens who have moved with there recently divorced mother(Dianne Wiest)to the sea side town of Santa Carla. Moving in with their eccentric Grandpa(Barnard Hughes),the boys find life in the small town quite different to Phoinex,Arizona where they had moved from. For a start there is the incredible amount of unexplained, mysterious disappearances that seem to plague the area. It's not long before the youths find themselves caught up in a whole load of trouble. Michael falls in with a gang of enigmatic bikers lead by the charismatic David(Kiefer Sutherland)while Sam meets a couple of boys.The Frog brothers(Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander)who's parents own a comic book store. The feisty lads try to convince Sam that Santa Carla is infested by the supernatural undead ie.Vampires. But by that time it's too late as Michael discovers when the true identities of his new biker pals are revealed to him. When Sam finds out the truth about Michaels new pals and what his brother is becoming. He tries to warn his mother. But with little success. Now with only the Frog brothers to turn to and with Michaels love for David's main squeeze Star(Jami Gertz) being the one thing thats holding him together. The pair of them have to help one another to stand up against and defeat the evil in Santa Carla. As one of the more well known teen horror movies of the late eighties.'The Lost Boys' although by no means entertaining and with a healthy dose of tongue n' cheek humor, is no classic. Directed with the stylish and enthusiastic energy you would have expected from Hollywood veteran Joel Schumacher. Its a perfect example of a movie that lets style take a back seat to substance. After all this was merely the 'Breakfast Club' meets 'Salem's Lot'. An excuse to make a vampire movie for the teen crowd. The mostly young cast all gave wonderful, spirited performances. Even Corey Haim. An actor who along with his more talented counterpart,Corey Feldman. Found himself relegated to direct to video dross. Sutherland was suitably chilling in his roll as lead vamp David. While Patric showed the promise of a future star. Sadly however he never quite made the grade. Speed 2 didn't exactly do him any favors. The older actors were also good value. Dianne Wiest was her usual reliable self while screen veteran Hermann is good value. Ultimately for me the best character has to be Grandpa. Played with charming, comic brilliance by Barnard Hughes. He was only equaled by the Frog brothers(Feldman and Newlander).Together they ultimately made the movie. Surprisingly the visual effects have aged well and there is the odd chilling moment. That said there was something lacking that I cannot quite put my finger on. Something that lapses the movie in to mediocrity. That said the movies climax as the kids fend off an attack by the remaining members of Davids gang of Vampires does set your pulse racing while the last line of the movie which is uttered by Hughes is unforgettable. Even though 'The Lost Boys' isn't a movie classic. It does have that nostalgic quality for me. Enough that I would want it for my DVD collection. But if you get the chance don't expect too much from it.For me the better movie of the late eighties was possibly Tom Holland's 'Fright Night'. It's no classic either. But sadly under valued and under looked. But if you get the chance. Do give Schumacher's pic a look see.  Robs Rating: * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has received praise and criticism over the years that is undeserving, in my opinion. It's just a bad movie. There is very little camp value, and it's a stain on Keifer Sutherland's career. The cinematography is dark, and this is probably how it's meant. But that doesn't justify not being able to see some scenes without adjusting the TV. It's not scary, the ending is anti-climactic (55 gallons of blood per minute doesn't justify it), and it's just lazy. Long story short, this is not great. It's gotten way too much attention for a sub-par vampire flick... then again, at least it's not "Queen of the Damned" (now THAT sucked).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I said that Interview With the Vampire was the best vampire movie of all time I forgot to mention this one along side it. Kieffer Sutherland is perfect as the leader of a gang of rebel vampires who are always causing trouble. Jason Patric finds himself being draw into the group of vampires and it is up to his little brother Corey Haim and vampire hunter Corey Feldman to rescue him before he himself becomes one of the bloodsuckers. This movie relies more on atmosphere and mood than violence and gore making it a cut above the rest. The setting is a beautifully shot beach area in the late 80's which has a very feel good quality to it and the blazing soundtrack is fueled with great rock songs, most noteable People Are Strange by The Doors. Horror fans should defiantly check this one out and learn that you don't need to have everyone in sight getting hacked up to make a horror classic like this one.</fullReview>

Basically, Michael (the older brother) chases after this girl and who he finds out is hanging around vampires in a mean gang, and then Michael ends up trying too impress the gang leader and failing at the first task.The directing, acting, writing, camera work, special effects, stunts and the astounding cinematography made the film look epic, and made me fell intrigued.There should be a number two of this movie if there already isn't one, because a lot of people would be interested in watching it.Al-over, great movie, intriguing and great vampire movie! We need vampires here, then things would get more interesting..If vampires were real here, would you still live here?I think what made the film so interesting, was that it was set in 1987, where they wore different clothes, spoke differently and the towns looked nothing like the ones we live in.They should make more films like this, just too be different..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lost Boys is the best teenage vampire film, and those who disagree can suck my big, fat jugular!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hailing from the 80s, the decade when horror films really knew how to be fun, Joel Schumacher's The Lost Boys is naturally packed with all the trappings of the era, including a catchy, radio friendly pop/rock music soundtrack, impossibly loud shirts, and big hair. Whilst this nostalgia factor is undoubtedly a major factor in the enjoyment for its older fans (myself included), spirited performances from the enthusiastic cast, a very witty script, and excellent direction from Schumacher ensure that, even if you were still just a wicked glint in your father's eye when the film originally came out, The Lost Boys is a guaranteed good time.Equal parts horror, action, and comedy, the film stars Corey Haim and Jason Patric as brothers Sam and Michael, who move to coastal resort Santa Carla with their mother, unaware that it is a hotbed of vampire activity. After Michael is lured into joining a local gang of young bikers, Sam discovers that his brother's new acquaintances are members of the undead; employing the help of local vampire experts, the Frog Brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), he attempts to locate and kill the head vampire before his brother begins to feed and becomes a fully-fledged member of The Lost Boys.With classic turns from 'the two Coreys' (making it about as 80s as you can possibly get), great performances from a young Kiefer Sutherland, Alex 'Bill from Bill &amp; Ted' Winter, Oscar winner Dianne Wiest, and Barnard Hughes (grandpa from TV's Blossom), plus excellent special makeup FX (from Greg Cannom) and slick and stylish visuals that avoid being so 'MTV' that they irritate, this is pure brilliance from start to finish.As for those whippersnappers who dare to utter the name Twilight in the same breath as The Lost Boys, consider these points before making the same mistake again: Twilight's Corey count is zero; Twilight is totally bereft of saxophone playing bodybuilders; and in Twilight, not one vamp suffers 'death by stereo'. Nuff said!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was deprived as a child and didn't get a chance to see this while I was growing up so I don't have the same type of respect that everyone else does for this film. After their push-over mother moves to Santa Carla to her father's house to start a new life after a recent divorce, her sons, Michael and Sam begin noticing that the town is not the typical suburban life that they are used too. The town seems to revolve around the boardwalk and amusement park where several burn outs, dead beats, and any petite thugs might want to hang out. During a lame new-wave rock concert(if that's what it was) on the fair grounds, Micheal notices a girl name Star that he becomes attracted too. What he doesn't know is that she is part of a cult of motorcycle riding vampires who feed off the living and live in a secretive cave down near the bay area. The leader of the vampire pack, David, convinces Michael to drink a sacred bottle of blood (in which Michael presumes is just red wine) to prove that he has what it takes to prove that he is worthy enough to be with Star. Meanwhile, Sam makes friends with owners of a comic book store on the boardwalk, Edgar and Alan Frog, and they warn him about the vampire infestation in the streets of Santa Carla.After hanging out with with the vampire cult and noticing dramatic changes in his body and lifestyle, Michael begins to realize that he himself is turning into a vampire and is having second thoughts. But Low and be hold, thanks to comic books, his brother finds out that in order to have his brother changed back into normal, they have to kill the leader of the vampire cult. Clever, huh. To protect their family and brother, they use every bit vampire remedies (Garlic, Holy Water, Wooden Stake) to defeat the vampire gang that is about to attack them and their grandfathers home in an act of revenge from a previous murdering of one of their own vampires.The film is slow and doesn't pick up till the end where they have a final battle between the vampires in a "Home Alone" type household. Not really that exciting but, the message of getting into the wrong crowd is definitely apparent and forewarns the dangers of joining the wrong crowd. I can't figure out the purpose of the theme park but it looked cool with all of it's colorful flashing lights, as I am sure was the only driving force that Joel Schumacher was trying to get at. No real point of the film rather than to have intense transformation scenes. I can picture a bunch of "socially challenged" 9 year old kids laying around at a sleepover, contemplating what they would do if they ever got into a situation. I would say that the film is worthy enough to fall asleep too but that's about it. And Corey Haim is annoying as hell in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>granted i'm only a year or so older than this movie, but i've had it since it came out on VHS and have seen it more times than i can count. It is just a very well produced story with a solid script, awesome acting, and a soundtrack that is no less than phenomenal. this movie was WAY ahead of its time, and is still a movie that can be watched any number of times. I live less than an hour from Santa Cruz, and have been to many of the places shot in the movie, making the experience seem more "real" than a middle America slasher flick. nothing seems really out of place in this movie. there isn't so much violence it's boring (see mortal combat), and has just the right amount of comic relief and story building. This movie is one of my favorites</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher's empty visual flair is one of those fledgling talents that needs better material to push it further.'Lost Boys' was his best work until 'Falling Down' and he hasn't changed from that point on.It is stupid, reliant on converging the emerging teen market from the 50s with the glossy effects of the 80s. Schumacher obviously studied Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' many times. Since 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' has been using the methods from here in all of its seasons, I guess you can say it hasn't lost its edge unlike other similar movies. Everything is skin deep.So, in a nutshell, this movie is MTV, HBO, Nickelodeon, the Blob, Beetlejuice, Evil Dead 2, Gremlins, American Werewolf in London, and Stand By Me. Hasn't dated as bad as 'The Graduate' and 'Point Break'. One thing I like is Schumacher's attempt at creating long exploratory shots, but the use of aircraft is obvious. Those moments alone are more detailed and interesting than all of the 'Lord of the Rings' movies.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read another comment from a reviewer and it said " ahead of it's time" and i cant think of a better way to describe The Lost Boys. For a film that is 15 years old you wouldnt know it , apart from the 80's fashion and music. It still looks cool and the soundtrack fits the film perfectly. It is 90 minutes , which is just right for a horror movie (not too long) and it has a good blend of humour without making it too stupid. Joel Schumacher deserves a lot of credit for a very watchable horror flick that will go down as one of the better ones of the eighties. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that THE LOST BOYS is definitely one of the most overrated films of all time. Many thought it was great, I thought it was stupid. It's about a mother and her two sons who move to a beach town. The younger son befriends two boys in a comic shop who claim to be vampire hunters whilst the older son joins a gang of punks who turn out to be vampires.THE LOST BOYS has some very very cheesy dialogue (some of which is very cheesily 80's) and although it's a comedy, you'd be most likely laughing at it instead of with it.In conclusion, I absolutely do not see the reason why this film is being idolised by so many film lovers. Plus, it feels a bit like the director Joel Schumacher focuses more on the costumes and the fashion than the storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before "Twilight" there was... Cheese-Fest ? with extra garlic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>80's teen flick crossed with modern day-vampire horror: Two brothers move to Californian coastal town, plagued by vicious, hedonistic vampire pack. Conflicts ensue. In some quarters, this is reported as a cult movie. More straight to the point: this is a vampire story for the VERY noncritical Nickelodeon crowd, that more or less defines the decade in everything, from music soundtrack to fashion, sets and music-video visuals. Innocuous and nostalgia-inducing, to be sure, but still an obvious-at-every-turn, grand cheese-fest (Feldman's lingo, the beach concert, the obligatory romance... oh, brother!) that actually might work better if viewed as a straight comedy, because turkey laughs are plentiful. Too bad the bits MEANT to be funny, aren't particularly so for anyone over 14, either! Best thing in it is Sutherland, who makes quite an impressive vampire gang leader. So, yes ? before "Twilight" there was this... Cheese-Fest ? with extra, extra garlic! ?"Death by stereo!!" Oh, you did not just seriously say that, Corey Haim, did you?

Brothers move to the California town of Santa Carla with their jokester grandpa and recently divorced mom, unconvinced that the local punk gang of bikers is really a pack of vampires, until the eldest (Patric) falls in with them! Hip, campy teen spin on the vampire saga isn't too action-packed until a final showdown, but the fun humor, rock music, and effects that are convincing for their time do a job of making up for the weak plot. Sutherland is an ideal?not to mention scary?choice for the gang's spikey-haired leader. 97 min., rated R. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>80s are Lost, but NOT the Memories and NOT the "LOST BOYS" !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a teenager in the 80s, in 1987 - when Lost Boys was made in fact I was doing my final year of high school. I'll never forget seeing Lost Boys at the Pictures for the first time as a 17 year old with a girl whom I took as a first date. She was so impressed, we dated for like 3 months (WOW - Milestone for the 80s). My own impressions of the "Lost Boys" then and now was and still is "WOW". AND the reason I dropped my girlfriend was because I discovered I was in Love with Kiefer Sutherland more than her - ha ha ha JOKIN ! BUT I gained enormous respect for "David" the Vampire, Keifer and his acting Talents. So much so, that he inspired me to be an actor, to go into show business. I too wanted to be a part of the "BRAT-PACK" ! What happened, one of my best friends in high school MADE it, and I did'nt ! Who is this friend of mine ? None other than Eric Banna (from Chopper, The Hulk, Troy) - TRUE STORY ! But he's no Keifer, sorry Eric, and we hav'nt talked for years. So that's what Fame is ? Go Figure . . . . . I'm happy just to be "A Lost Boy""One thing about living in Melbourne I never could stomach, all the damn Vampires !"</fullReview>

Don't know how they're going to bring back any of the cast into the sequel...if they even make one. Heard Keifer Sutherland would be given the opportunity to return.

You expect vampires to live in small, mildly inbred coastal towns, wear black leather and ride motorbikes whilst being generally unruly. Michael and Sam are your typical 80s teenage brothers rebelling after their parents divorce.

It used to be classified as a horror with dark humor. Now there is no horror. 2.) To see some more famous actors in their youngeryear. Perhaps Corey Feldman, but I was thinking more of Kiefer Sutherland. I just saw Freeway and Dark City again and I think he is one of my favorite actors. 3.) To see the 80's style! Skin tight jeans, mullets, rolled bandanas; in this area, this movie had everything. However, I was dissapointed in not hearing any rad 80's slang, but still interesting. These three reasons were, for me, not to make up for the plot and a lot of questionable acting - besides Kiefe - to make this reminiscent visit worthwhile. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Looking like an INXS music video coupled with the self-amused swagger of "Less Than Zero", "The Lost Boys" has attained quite a following for '80s aficionados, but aside from giving the infamous "Two Coreys" (Haim and Feldman) amusing roles, it fails to broaden its scope beyond the youth market. Dianne Wiest is certainly nice to have around as the kids' mom, but this is pretty much the same character she played in "Parenthood". The design of the film, and the costumes, seem far more important to director Joel Schumacher than a keen sense of dynamics between the characters, and the oneupmanship is like something out of a frat-house movie. It's both dreary and posed, like a Goth ad for hairspray. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather disappointing cult film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I don't see a TV, Michael. No TV means no MTV."So says Sam (Corey Haim) to his brother (Jason Patric) as they check out their new house in Santa Cruz. That quote best describes "The Lost Boys" -- a vampire film for the MTV generation (opening with Echo and the Bunnymen's "People Are Strange" Doors cover); for people who want lots of blood and guts but no intelligence. The movie is billed as a comedy but it's not funny. It's also billed as a horror but it's not scary. What is it, then? I don't know. Like its characters, it seems to be lost.Michael and Sam move to Santa Cruz with their mother (Dianne Wiest), which happens to be the murder capital of the world. Little do they know that a blood-thirsty pack of teenaged vampires are responsible for the mass murders of the city. They roam the boardwalks at night, spotting prey, and feasting as they dive down through the sky for a midnight snack. Security guards are killed, children are killed, and stoned party animals are killed -- all at night, by the vampires, who -- as legend has it -- are allergic to daylight.The movie was made in a time when special effects were so poor that showing the vampires flying through the sky might seem ridiculous. Instead, we get lots of swooping camera techniques that try to make us see through the eyes of the lead vampire, David (Kiefer Sutherland), who transforms Michael into a vampire one night and literally hangs out with him.The title for the film comes from the story of Peter Pan and his lost boys (all four lead vampires share the names of these lost boys, too). In that tale, the kids in Neverland never grew old for unexplained reasons. Here they never grow old because they've vampires. They are immortal. But, of course, onion garlic and holy water and stakes through the heart will kill them. Tough break.Clever concept, but poor execution, helmed by Joel "Batman and Robin" Schumacher, who also directed "St. Elmo's Fire," which perhaps explains why Sam has posters of Rob Lowe and Molly Ringwald on his bedroom wall. (Why, exactly, he has a poster of Lowe stripping out of a shirt, can be left for explanation by someone who knows.) After his brother becomes a "half-vampire," Sam alerts the Frog Brothers, local vampire hunters with way too much time on their hands. (One of the brothers is also played by Corey Feldman, who used to be a huge teen icon during the 1980s and now has trouble finding jobs anywhere.) They go on a rampage, kill one of the vampires named Marko (Alex Winter), and are pursued by the rest of the pack.What's even worse is that the film tries to implement more than a few twists, especially towards the end, which soon becomes absolutely unbearably awful, unsatisfying and absurd. I have to wonder how on earth this movie ever gained as good a reputation as it has over the years.To be fair the cast struggles with the material. Jason Patric is acceptable as the lead hero, but I never felt any strong feelings for him. The two Coreys (Haim and Feldman, who reunited on several projects over the years since "The Lost Boys") aren't even very humorous, especially Feldman, a comedic relief character who usually manages to become the annoyingly likable persona of any given film, but evidently tries too hard here, particularly with his forced low voice (no, it isn't natural). It's one of his worst roles that I've seen him in. Edward Herrmann, as Wiest's mandatory love interest and possible on-the-side vampire (or so Sam suggests at one point in the movie), is severely miscast -- an actor used to playing roles such as that in "Richie Rich" and "Intolerable Cruelty" who tries to act smart here and doesn't succeed very well at all. The best performance comes from Kiefer Sutherland, as David, but his role is misadvertised -- we are led to believe from the commercials and posters and DVD covers that he is one of the main characters of the film, yet I'd be surprised to hear that he shares more than fifteen minutes of screen time. Sutherland presumably enjoyed working with Schumacher (a real hit-and-miss director), because he teamed up with him again for "Phone Booth" (2002), which is undoubtedly superior in almost all ways."The Lost Boys" simply isn't very scary, funny, or even entertaining. The ending is embarrassing and tries to throw in a bunch of twists, but they're just plain silly. It's not a very good vampire flick and not even on par with some of the best cheesy horror flicks out there ("Gremlins" is the perfect example of this sort of movie done right). It tries to add originality to a concept that has been squeezed dry over the years since Max Schreck and Bela Lugosi made it popular (film-wise, that is). How disappointing that they cannot even manage to make us laugh at some of the vampire stereotypes, and instead serve us some laughably bad ideas with a laughably bad script and a truly lame "twist" ending. Mel Brooks' "Dracula, Dead and Loving it!" wasn't anything special but at least it was smart enough to spoof a dry formula, rather than suck its blood dry, so to speak.</fullReview>

The actions of the characters, the plot, seems to follow no logical pattern. Maybe this movie explores some unorthodox attribute of vampirism where any environment with vampires becomes a mire of morons. The action sequences almost don't exist. You don't see anything.

That must be the way a lot of cult classics are. The fact that thereare vampires out to get people is not the highlight of the flick. Thecharacters like the Frog Brothers, Edgar and Alan (one played by CoreyFeldman) is a nice touch. It is also very eighties including Rob Loweposters, big watch clock, and a guy's t-shirt that reads "born to shop." It has classic lines like "Death by stereo!" The combination of horrorand comedy works well. The Boardwalk in Santa Carla is a fun</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you think this is a good vampire movie, uh, with what are you comparing it? the lost boys couldn't be more lame. it's only redeeming qualities? jamie gertz and the genius of putting the two coreys in the same movie. remember, this was done by the wiz kid director that made "batman and robin" and we all know what a pillar of movie magic that flick turned out to be. for a real vampire flick, check out either "nosferatu" (and "shadow of the vampire," for good measure)or take a look at carl dreyer's "vampyr, der traum des allan grey" (don't worry, there's little dialogue so you won't have to worry your puny head with "reading" the foreign words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was this piece of garbage, anyway? Was it a comedy? Drama? Or just a vehicle for a bunch of spoiled actors to take home a big payday? It certainly was not entertainment. Shallow? Yes. Insipid? Certainly. Plain silly? To be sure. I don't like comedy vampire films to start with, and this crap just took the cake. Don't bother with this turkey, it offered nothing in the way of excitement or chills. I rate it down there with "Buffy the Vampire Sleeper".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie SUCKS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I'm not talking about blood, either. I tried watching this horrendous 80s vampire flick the other day. I only got about 30 minutes into it, and for sure, it put me right to sleep. I woke up a few hours later, with my mind in a daze, wondering if I should try watching it again. I decided that if it put me to sleep that quickly, it wasn't worth even trying to watch. I mean, this movie is so BORING. I honestly don't have a clue what its about (teenage vampires, perhaps), what its supposed to be (a comedy? It wasn't funny), or what the whole purpose of the movie is, as it has not a single iota of entertainment value. My advice: stores should remove all forms of sleeping pills from shelves, and replace them with copies of the Lost Boys. It would be a whole lot more effective, without any negative side effects, plus, its non habit-forming! Imagine that...</fullReview>
