		<shortDescription>Decide for yourself (I question the sincerity of IMDb votes to date)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at the New Orleans premiere and found it to be an interesting spectacle that I largely enjoyed watching. I'm writing to let the public know that the numbers look strange at this point (September 17, 2006). Why? Nearly 20% of the votes have been in the 1-3 range (which would rate this film to be in the ranks of the worst low budget films ever made). One voter has commented that he did not see the film, but hates Sean Penn's politics so he won't see it and will give the film a 1 just to spite Penn. At the same time, nearly half of the votes give the film a perfect 10. I don't think that the polarized ratings to date reflect careful attempts to rate the film. Perhaps that's often the case with IMDb. I suggest taking them with a grain of salt for the time being and deciding for yourself if you are interested in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big, Brassy, Gorgeous Images; Literate Script; Politics: What's Not to Like?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics slammed this movie and I loved it. Shame on the critics.I love movies that transport me to an exotic place and a distant time. "All the King's Men" lushly recreates mid-century Louisiana. There's a lot of money up on the screen, beautifully lit and photographed: vintage, boat-like automobiles, forties and fifties fashions and fabrics, Spanish moss, ante-bellum mansions, a bronze bas relief map of Louisiana, set in a floor, that is put to amazing use.There's a scene where a young woman returns from an illicit tryst in dim light. Her hair ripples to her shoulders in honey blonde waves. Her plump lips are painted, matte, in the color of dried blood. Her jilted lover, his fedora slung low on his forehead, stands in silhouette, watching her every move. Neither speaks.In another scene, a backlit woman enters a bar and places her white cotton gloves over her hand.Just, lovely scenes that capture another era.I'm a political junkie, so I went to see this movie in spite of the bad reviews. It didn't let me down. It's a political soap opera from the first frame to the last.Deals cut in smoke filled rooms, double crosses, fiery speeches to enthralled crowds. I ate it up.The stars! Sean Penn, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Kathy Baker, James Gandolfini...Jackie Earle Haley, someone I'd never heard of before, was memorable as a gun toting body guard.Sean Penn's performance has been panned - too much arm waving. I loved the arm waving. Penn's arm waving doesn't come across as forced or inorganic. This is a man who can barely contain himself -- he's a human tornado. The historical figure with whom Penn's character, Willy Stark, is associated, Huey Long, was a powerhouse builder of bridges, hospitals, and roads. Penn conveys that kinetic energy and passion.And the script! Thank God someone was willing to write a script in which people take some risks with language, communicate complex ideas, employ figures of speech! Heavens! In a movie in which nothing explodes and no cartoon superhero saves the world! I loved having to listen to what people were saying to know what was going on. I loved the flowery language. This is the South, after all, from several decades ago, and, yeah, those folks did love their language skills.Another reviewer denounced the film's score as bombastic. It is bombastic, wonderfully so. It suits the subject matter perfectly. This isn't a movie about a shrinking violet who sits at home and writes poetry; it's a movie about a sweaty man who takes power and makes his mark.Okay, so why didn't I give the movie ten stars? Sean Penn's character is fully realized, but the other characters are not. "All the King's Men" is a big, fat soap opera. There's a lot of sex, threats, lust, longing, suicide, and betrayal to fit into two hours. The film should have been longer so that characters other than Willy could have been fleshed out.Patricia Clarkson is a case in point. Her character sets some key events in motion, but she's barely there -- either the character or the actress.Anthony Hopkins comes across as just that -- Anthony Hopkins -- not the character he is playing. While everyone else does their best to produce a Southern accent, Hopkins insists on speaking with a British accent, and this sticks out like a sore thumb.Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo are meant to be, like Blanche Dubois, representatives of degenerate Southern aristocracy, but they both seem entirely too robust to be degenerating.Jude Law is better in a similar role as a member of the fading aristocratic class. Law always seems to do well in roles where he is punished by, rather than enjoys, his beauty. Just so here. Too bad that, in key scenes, Hopkins doesn't create any chemistry with him.The lack of development of secondary characters -- and everyone, compared to Willie Stark, is secondary here -- made the film oddly emotionally unmoving to me. Again, there are scenes that contain the kind of elements that might have packed an emotional wallop that left me dry eyed.Willy Stark's rise to power is built on the poverty of the citizens of Louisiana. The movie didn't convey that poverty to me. According to one website devoted to Huey Long, Lousiana had three hundred miles of paved road, two bridges, and high illiteracy rates when Long took office. If true, those stats are startling.Finally, something else was missing, for me. Whenever one observes a charismatic politician, there is always the question: Does he really care about the people? Or is he just addicted to the adulation? I never had that question about Sean Penn's Willy Stark, as I do about, say, Bill Clinton. Willy Stark, here, is imperfect, but sincere. He wants to help his people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the (negative) hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was one film in 2006 that suffered because of hype and rather uninformed critics, this would be it. First, the magazines played it up because of the all-star cast and fantastic source. Then, all of sudden, the nation's movie critics decided it wasn't what it was cracked up to be, and piled on it. One problem with the critics is that many of them clearly have not read the book. Richard Roeper complained in his newspaper review, for example, that the movie never shows you how Stark went from bad to good. Well, having reread the book in anticipation of the movie, I can state emphatically that that is because the book never explains it. Take your pick critics: is your criticism going to be that it's unfaithful or that it followed the book? Furthermore, the move is NOT a remake. The original All The King's Men movie, no matter how good it was, focused the story on Willie Stark. The real story (and this version) is focused on Jack Burden (which is why the whole backstory with Anne Stanton is thrown-in). To call it a remake shows how self-centered Hollywood can be (as fans of Brokeback Mountain are no doubt ruefully aware).Now, what I thought of the actual movie: first and foremost, Sean Penn gives a absolutely brilliant performance, one of the best I've ever seen. I saw a Huey Long documentary a couple month before the movie, and Sean Penn evokes him magnificently. The scene where Willie Stark is stumping the state is simply film-making brilliance, as are his several hauntingly shot speeches. Jude Law gives a fine performance, as do all the supporting actors, especially Patricia Clarkson, who nails Sadie Burke. Some people had a problem with the accents, but I thought that Jude Law and Kate Winslet did adequate impressions and did not lose anything for it. And of course, the power of Warren's story shines through the whole movie. I do not personally know anyone who did not really like the movie.Why did it not work with people? I'd say two reasons: first, first-person narrated classics are notoriously difficult to translate to film. Another example that comes to mind is The Great Gatsby, which has a similarly detached narrator, and did not succeed despite Robert Redford, Mia Farrow, Karen Black and Sam Waterston among the ensemble. Second, to be brutally honest, if your favorite films are normally comedies or horror movies, you won't like this kind of movie.All I can say is that I am surprised and somewhat astonished at the negative piling on. For any moviegoer who likes an epic story of humanity and politics in their harsh reality, All The King's Men is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historically Inaccurate, but it's not a historical movie. It is very entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being from Louisiana I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was great and the story was entertaining. As others have stated, the accents are not done well. In fact there are more than a few characters who don't even try to imitate a southern accent, for which I am very grateful. I am quite sick of actors trying to portraying a southerner by speaking as if all the teeth were removed and the brain has been lobotomized. Others have complained about a boring script to which I completely disagree. This is not a fast-paced movie but it keeps the story moving and the dialogue is fresh. The slow periods give you time to pause and let the previous scene sink in, while also giving the viewer the opportunity to absorb the ambiance of the scenes. The people in this movie are portrayed as they really were in the 1940's and 50's. There is no surprise hidden here. Although this movie is based on the book of the same name, neither are factual of Huey Long and his legacy. These stories are loosely based on a person, with a few facts thrown in for recognition, but not for historical purposes. I applaud the entire cast and crew for their great efforts in bringing this movie to fruition. This is what entertainment is all about and it shows a little of the corruption that existed (and some would say still exists) in Louisiana politics of the past.Go into this movie with an open mind and you will find yourself entertained and pleased with the whole experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful showcase of talent in a gripping film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A door-to-door salesman, Willie Stark (Sean Penn), is a straightforward man with decent morals and a commitment to the common weal. Such a winning profile is quickly spotted by political hucksters who disingenuously persuade him to stand for Louisiana State Governor simply to split the opposition vote. Stark gets wise to this attempt to use him as a pawn and, in a dramatic turnabout, throws away a prepared speech and appeals to the people, declaring himself a 'hick among the hicks' who will stand up for the commoners' needs. Once made Governor, he does indeed set about popular reform programs, also hiring reporter Jack Burden (Jude Law) to dig dirt on anyone who stands in his way. Jack, unfortunately, comes from the wrong (well-heeled) side of town and soon finds his loyalties torn when Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to publicly support Stark. Jack also has some unpleasant surprises in store as he is reunited with childhood friends Adam Stanton, a determinedly unmaterialistic character who doesn't want to be in anyone's pocket, and his luscious sister Anne (Kate Winslet), both of whom are tangling in different ways with Willie Stark before very long. This is a towering story set in the deep south, amid sweltering ideals and where goodness only comes out of the dirt - which means that everyone has some dirt on them somewhere.All the King's Men is quality, heavyweight cinema with outstanding performances backed up by very professional direction and cinematography. Penn sets the standard, delivering one of his most moving demonstrations of carefully chiselled acting skills but, aided by a tight script and editing that doesn't waste a frame, every other actor also seems to be giving it their all in every frame. At well over two hours, it kept my attention all the way through, and a score by Oscar-winning composer James Horner served only to underline how effectively all these top talents are assembled.Having given All the King's Men such accolades, you might think I'd be struggling to find fault with it but, although many of the elements might individually be worthy of an Oscar, my overall impression was that the film showcases a lot of remarkable talent rather than putting it to its finest use.This is the second time Robert Penn Warren's book has been made into a major movie, yet we might wonder if much of the subtle analysis that space allows an author is being woefully denied filmmakers because of time restraints. Although the movie is to be congratulated for not using a trowel to lay on contemporary analogies about political power, corruption and oil, some character development in other morally ambiguous areas would not have gone amiss. Did power finally corrupt Willie Stark, and how far did he go in using criminals to further his beneficial public works? Penn creates a powerful figure, but the story, for all its tension, remains sadly predictable. The title is never clearly explained in the film, although it can elsewhere be attributed to a motto used by real life Governor Huey Long (on whom the story is arguably based): "Every Man a King" - which was part of a Share Our Wealth program of heavy taxation for wealthy individuals and corporations. In 1929, Long had called a special session of the legislature so as to enact a five-cent per barrel 'occupational license tax' on production of refined oil, in order to help fund social programs. What would originally have been complex trade-offs between a rich elite and an impoverished, post- Great Depression lower class, is in the movie reduced to high-sounding truisms about ideals and finding things of value. The rhetoric, forcefully delivered (as it is here) is an actor's dream, but although the story is beautifully and dramatically told, it lacks enough surprises, is heavy with the gravitas of its own self-importance, and may tempt some audiences simply to exclaim, 'So what'? Reading up on the background can supply a context that gives All the King's Men greater depth, but as entertainment it is a tour-de-force that is at the same time slightly unsatisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the New Orleans premiere of this movie, and my friends and I all thought it was amazing. The way it was written by Zaillian (straight off of the book, not an adaptation of the previous movie) was great. And the cinematography added so much to it. Sean Penn is an amazing actor, and that really shows through in the role of Willie Stark. It was kind of funny to watch Anthony Hopkins use an extremely bad Louisiana-British accent. I am a fan of history, so lots of little things worked their way in to amuse me. And seeing New Orleans things and knowing right where they are was a great thing. I recommend people go see this movie, as I plan to go again on Friday when it opens officially.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful interpretation of the Penn Warren novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the book and have taught it every year to my AP students. We've been excited to see the film and have had big hopes for it. I find the 1949 film nearly impossible to watch, because they made so many changes to really critical parts of the book. I think this movie will be a great addition to my DVD collection to help establish setting and so on for future AP English classes. The script keeps lots of the dialogue, images, and the looping storytelling from the text I understand the compressions they needed to do--and they generally worked. The acting was powerful: lots of nuances from Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins, and the rest. I saw reviews busting on Law for being so beautiful--a tragedy we share, of course--but honestly, I thought he did well at getting to the heart of Jack. It really helped me to see the locations where they filmed: the statehouse, Burden's Landing, Mason City, and more. My one quibble is the ending-- I love the book because it tells a tale of redemption, of making things right, of reconciliation--I think the film hints at it, but doesn't quite get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, highly recommended.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to catch the premiere of this movie and I am endlessly pleased that I did so.There have been comments about the miscasting, but from what I have seen, this is mostly relating the movie to the original. All of the people that I talked to said that they liked it and that the actors portrayed the people really well. These comments came from natives of New Orleans.The movie itself is gripping throughout most of the some 2 hours. The visual and auditory effects do a great deal to enhance the story. It is evident that the actors put a lot of passion into their roles and the fact that they returned to New Orleans for the premiere shows that a part of them went into the movie.All in all, the cast is great, the sound is great, the movie is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, old-fashioned picture making and a jolly good show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Zaillian wrote "The Interpreter", one of the most improbable screenplays of last season. This, a remake of a very good movie, he wrote and directed, and it's a meticulous Southern soap opera buoyed by terrific performances from Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and James Galdolfini. Though a period piece, it proves that what we learn from history is we don't learn from history. A tale of the haves (oil men and the judiciary, ably repped by Anthony Hopkins here)) working like heck to keep the have-nots in their place, it is more relevant today than it ever was. Penn plays a naive traveling salesman who rises to the position of "Governor of Louisiana" after he taps into the prevailing zeitgeist. Naturally, his efforts to improve the lot of the working man fall foul of big business interests, so Penn is forced to solicit an ally with the assistance of well connected Jude Law. Films about political machinations are as common as bums, but this rises above its weary brethren by focusing on the personal agendas of its players and wisely sitting on the fence with regard to Mr. Penn's true motives. It takes a while to work through the gears, but once it's cruising, it's a pretty thrilling ride and possesses a refreshing European sensibility in its more intimate encounters. Photography by Pawel Edelman, who shot "The Pianist", serves the material perfectly. Solid, old-fashioned picture making and a jolly good show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zaillian bit off more than he could chew, but it's a worth while effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to some of the bad reviews out there, this is a good film. Not great but an enjoyable ambitious yarn that suggests just enough to make you think. It does have grave defects which I put entirely at Zaillian's feet, but it is worth your while to see it.First off, the film is perfectly coherent. I did not read the book but I had no trouble following the story or the time shifts. What it lacks is cohesiveness (more on that later).The actors' accents were not distracting to me. I can't tell a Louisiana accent any way so for me, accents are not a big deal. Differences between Penn's and Law's accents and delivery are actually an asset because they reinforce their class differences. If there's a problem here, it's that some of the actors don't even try to sound Southern at all (Winslet and Hopkins). Hopkins started out with some sort of Southern drawl and then gave it up altogether later. But as I say, it's not a big deal for me.Next, THE GOOD STUFF: -- I am a fan of Jude Law and for me, his sardonic, sly take on Jack Burden is the best thing in this movie, though I have to say his efforts are undermined later on by the inexplicable script (more later). Law is an honest, gifted and clever performer, and he plays his Burden as an outside observer whose idealism is used as an excuse for moral irresponsibility. Burden is drawn like a moth to Stark's flame and he lays aside his scruples in Stark's service (but it is not clear whether Burden had scruples to begin with or whether he lost them with Stark). Law makes you sense Burden's growing self-hate and hints that what he actually resents is his privileged heritage. You also sense that somehow the key to Burden lies in his blighted relations with Anne Stanton, but this is under-developed as well. Law gives a thoughtful controlled performance. Sadly the story does not give it more substance.-- The film looks beautiful; each scene is gorgeous. Trouble is, the scenes don't quite flow and the film feels oddly static.-- This is NOT a message movie. It doesn't offer easy answers. Instead, it does make you think and ask questions. On the other hand, I am not sure what exactly it's trying to say and what questions it intends to raise.THE BAD: -- Sean Penn is miscast. I actually like the actor. I don't agree with his politics but they don't bother me. However, he is wrong here. He is supposed to the a man of the people and a natural leader, but that's where he is least convincing. In his public speeches, he is a one-trick pony, playing off people's anger at the establishment and nothing more. But there should be more, shouldn't there, something that makes people including Burden love him? Also, Penn's over-the-top gesticulation may be true to Huey Long, but they are distracting on screen. In the private scenes, Penn is fine, excellent even. He suggests the insecure little guy, the loser at heart that knows deep down he's out of his league. But then that has always been Penn's forte.-- The script *SPOILER* -- this is by far the gravest defect. It's as though Zaillian could not decide whether to tell Stark's story or Burden's story. He ends up with both and succeeds with neither. You don't see at all how power corrupts Stark. One day he is a clean-living guy, passionate about advancing the causes of the poor. The next he's having affairs and taking bribes. With Burden, you don't see why he should do the things he does for Stark. When his actions killed the man closest to him, he merely shrugged it off and explained it in a voice-over. It is exasperating There are hints about his thwarted relations with Anne, but this is left frustratingly vague. Why did Anne end up with Stark? Was it to get back at Jack? Why did Adam get tangled with Stark in the first place? There's not enough in the film to indicate anything. I suspect much of the story ended up on the cutting room floor because Zaillian bit off more than he could chew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually The Canadians Are Spot On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is actually pretty dreadful on many levels. First the music is thuddingly melodramatic; it's like the producers saw the dailies and said "well...there's not much going on, but we'll fix it with the music". The pacing is often glacial, but most disastrously, the film is FATALLY MISCAST. Sean Penn is screeching and braying as Willie Stark, and during his long speeches about "the hicks" he gestures like John Belushi doing Joe Cocker. He simply is nothing, physically or temperamentally like Huey Long on whom the character is based. On the other hand, I bet Penn would have been great as the journalist Jack Burden, and certainly far superior to the miscast Jude Law who is unbelievable as an investigative journalist. Ironically James Gandolfini gives a good impression of what Willie Stark should be in the secondary role of Tiny Duffy. And Jackie Earle Haley is chilling and most effective with virtually no dialog as Sugarboy, Willie's gunsil. Almost every other actor, Hopkins, Winslet, Ruffalo is wasted in this totally unnecessary remake of a very good 40's film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best film of the year....with or without critic support.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer for this film roughly two months ago, I was excited to see the entire movie. The only downside seemed to be that it was one of many that were an obvious attempt to get an Oscar out of it. But that's the norm this time of year.I was later surprised to see so many begin to trash this film left and right. I actually watched the trailer again to be sure I still wanted to see it. It still looked decent to me. Maybe it was because I'd never seen the original. Maybe it actually was a horrible remake. Plus after seeing and hating the much trashed Black Dahlia, I figured I should consider passing on making the same mistake twice.But no, there I was on the opening day, hoping this wasn't going to be another Dahlia. And it was nowhere near it. It was incredible. The score is outstanding, the much attacked directing was very strong, and Sean Penn gave one of his three best performances he's ever given.Jude Law as the press writer/associate is very good. But his narration is weak and not needed as often as it's used. Patricia Clarkston is solid, but not anything of great note. I'm actually glad they didn't focus too much on her feelings of scorn towards state hero/villain Willie Stark (Sean Penn). Much better to keep the movie focused on Penn and Law, who surprisingly work well together.The accents were only hard to take in the first words of (the miscast) James Gandolfini, who plays Tiny (not so tiny) Duffy, a very crooked crook. But his voice grows on you eventually. I think it was more the familiarity with his voice as Tony Soprano (tv character) that threw me off.And in a scene where Willie attempts to (very poorly) sing a promotional song for himself. That really should have been left on the cutting room floor.The only overall complaint I would mention is that for once, I'd like to see a Southern movie actually use predominantly Southern actors. Penn, Law, (the not mentioned by me, but very good) Anthony Hopkins, and Clarkston are all great in their roles. But only one of them (Clarkston from Lou.) is Southern. In fact, when you add love interest Kate Winslet into the equation, three of the main six characters are British. That shouldn't be.But all that aside, this movie far surpasses any other I've seen this year. And actually puts Hollywoodland, which I enjoyed, to shame. Steven Zaillian has made an outstanding film, that is receiving a very unfair treatment in the press.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this over the weekend with my best friend who claims to be a full-blown Louisiana c***-a**, and we both really enjoyed it. My friend also tells me that all the Louisiana people she knows wave they hands in the air like Willie Stark, and she even said that her people couldn't talk if you tied their hands up. So all you big-city reviewers complaining about the hand-waving just don't understand that Sean Penn and the rest of 'em just did a good job with their research, that's all. I even asked my friend - was that a true accent (Willie's) and she said "yup". I will grant that sometimes it was a little bit hard to understand, but it was accurate. They even showed some of the film to people in Lousisana to see if it was accurate and not only did they say it was good, but the movie got all good rave reviews down there. So all you nit-picky, itty-bitty big-city know it alls, just hush up. And if you like a movie that looks good and takes an ounce of sense to follow, then you will like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terribly Miscast and Horrifically Butchered by Zaillian.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn is the biggest name of the star studded cast of the remake "All The Kings Men." The lead really is played by Jude Law. Jack Burden (Law) is one of the kings men and the story is told through his perspective as he works for Willie Stark (Sean Penn) as Stark's thirst for power gradually drifts from "a man of the people" to a power driven Governor looking for bigger and better things. He's willing to take from the wealthy and give to the poor, and he's willing to cross moral lines to justify his actions. Sean Penn is over the top and some may not like that, but he's hardly over the top when he's not on stage preaching to the people. This is a powerful performance and one that isn't explored enough through the course of the film with Stark's interesting downfall. We really never know how corrupt he gets, which would make for a more interesting story film. The complexities of the film and the greatness of the source material gives this film a lot to work with, and ultimately, too much to work with. Willie Stark is the most interesting aspect of the film, and Penn delivers an Oscar worthy performance. Combine that with the fantastic art direction, and the incredible style and look of the film along with the cinematography and you'll be scratching your head as to why this turned out to be such a horrible disappointment. The costumes, the sets, the beautiful score, and the cinematography are all on Oscar nomination worthy levels. The source material screams of a Best Picture nomination, but the main issue, and all the blame for it's failures, can be blamed solely on the shoulders of director Steve Zaillian. The best parts of the film go ignored and substituted for the back-story between Jack Burden and the people that were close to him. His story doesn't go into enough detail of Willie Stark's demise and their relationship. Virtually every decision made by Zaillian is the wrong decision. The casting is among the worst I've ever seen in any motion picture. James Gandolfini plays Tiny Duffy, and the moment this Jersey born Italian -- which is just about the furthest thing from a deep southerner you can get -- talks is laughable. I felt pain watching Gandolfini attempt to play a part that he just can't pull off. He doesn't have the proper look. Zaillian wanted a big man, and I guess Gandolfini was the most marketable fat guy he could find, so he fit his bill. This film gets very British instead of southern. Jude Law and Mark Ruffalo are both horrible actors to begin with, but man, these two are beyond horrible. They both look so lazy. They think if they stare off into space for five minutes that it will look like they are deep in thought. The real lead actor, Law, brings nothing to the table. He doesn't have an emotional bone in his body and he mopes around, from scene to scene, without blinking as he does nothing with his complex character. His acting is all on the surface. He seems incapable of digging deeper, and all we see is a rubber expressionless face. Ruffalo is in the same boat, but not nearly as bad. Anthony Hopkins has created great characters in the past and put together an impressive resume, but once again, he doesn't fit the part, nor does he even attempt to fit it. He keeps his thick British accent. It was, however, a relief watching him compared to Law or Ruffalo, because he brings an energy to the screen that those two boring actors couldn't even think of doing. The only supporting performance that was any good was by Jackie Earl Haley, and he doesn't say more than two lines in the entire film, but he's always popping up, and by films end, he finds himself in the middle of all the chaos. His mannerisms in the final scene -- along with the look in his eyes -- is better acting than Law and Ruffalo put together for the entire film. The greatest downfall comes with Zaillian's overall direction of the film. He really has no clue where he wants the film to go from scene to scene. He doesn't even know how he wants to start the film as it starts in the middle of the film before going five years into the past with a worthless scene. He seems more worried about shot selection and set up than storytelling. The opening scene is an eye catcher, and got my hopes up even though its shot like a shampoo commercial. That scene is over-directed and every scene after that is over- directed. Zaillian directs this as if he's ready to garner a Best Director Oscar. He shows off and draws attention to himself, but forgets about the story line that meanders around, instead, he we focus on a sub plot between Jack Burden and Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet) that we really don't care about. The film is confusing because the direction is so bad. Zaillian has his moments, and you can see moments of greatness peek through, but he tries to go for too much, and ultimately falls off the tracks. He tries too hard in professing ideals through reoccurring voice-over and flashbacks. The ending is interesting and abrupt, but loaded with symbolism as we see two good men slain as they succumb to the evils that go along with wealth and power. Zaillian creates an incredible disappointment filled with interesting philosophical ideals and some great symbolism thanks to the source material, but the flow of the film is confusing and the choice in actors are beyond repair. We see moments of sheer brilliance from the great art direction to the powerful lead performance (Penn), but Zaillian has his hands all over this and makes too many irreconcilable decisions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful film. I have to say, the two highlights were Sean Penn and the filmography. The film begins with interesting angles of the state seal in the floor of the rotunda of the Louisiana Capitol. Third best scene in the entire movie, purely on filmography (as there are, at this point, no characters). Second best is Sean Penn as Willie Stark, riling up the people in his stump speech. I am a Poli Sci major at Tulane (that's how I got a ticket to the premiere), and I'm watching Sean Penn believing he's a real politician, and this guy for sure has my vote. This sequence skips around, Stark giving his stump speech in different places to different groups. I am wanting to cheer and applaud with the celluloid crowd, and only my sense of propriety stopped me from doing so. So bonus points to Sean Penn for making me believe in him (after three campaigns, that's hard). The second to last scene in the movie is hands down the best, and, if I could make one criticism, I might suggest that the movie end there. Dr. Adam Stanton, now understanding that he and his sister have been used by the governor, assassinates Governor Stark as he is lauding his escape from impeachment. Stanton shoots Stark, and Stark's bodyguard shoots Stanton. They fall on the seal (just like the opening), and their blood runs together in the grooves. They even assume a pose like one they took on the capitol steps. It's really fabulous.The film is not laugh out loud funny - the biggest laugh came when Gov. Stark, when asked about his appointment of his former handler to the position of Lt. Governor says, "Well, somebody has to be lieutenant governor," and Louisiana Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu was in the audience - but it does make you think. It reminded me of the book and film "Primary Colors," in it's criticism of politicians. Because Stark did build a highway, did get schools, et cetera. So is he good, or is he bad? "Time brings all things to light."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful "Remake" of Robert Rossen's 1948 Best Picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many times this year will today's Hollywood know-nothings take the classic films of yesteryear and remake them into dreadful, awful, insulting trash? Is there perhaps a remake of Casablanca planned for maybe Cindy Lauper and Adam Sandler? Sean Penn, regardless of his personal politics, is just plain dreadful and silly; going around screeching like a madman, as if anyone would listen to this pint sized jerk except maybe Newsweek or the New York Times. Citizens of rural Louisiana 60 years ago? No way on earth! It takes a man, not a boy-man, to fill a man's shoes. Broderick Crawford played Willie Stark in the 1948 Academy Award winning (best picture, best actor) original. He's a tough act to follow; but... but most people these days didn't see the original and you can bet Columbia Pictures hopes they never do. Only one man alive could possibly have stepped into Crawford's shoes and play Willie Stark with conviction. That man is James Gandolfini. The makers of this alleged remake are so brain-dead they actually have Gandolfini in the movie --- but playing the wrong role. Besides that, the new picture lacks the award winning direction of Robert Rossen as well as the superior black and white cinematography of the original. As Humty Dumpty might say: All the king's horses --- and all the king's men --- couldn't put Columbia Pictures --- back together again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually thought the film was pretty good, but definitely not for everyone. I actually don't like either Sean Penn or Jude Law, but I thought Jude Law's performance the best I've ever seen from him. The story is actually more about his character than of Sean Penn's. "Jack" is actually what the film was about. Most of the other characters were barely seen except for him.My main complaint about the film is that it shows nothing new. I guess that's to be expected from a movie that was based on a 1946 novel that many future plots were taken from. I was annoyed, also by the photography (being a photographer myself). I found there was too much contrast in some parts, not enough in others. Depth of field was also kinda strange, too shallow in some areas. I mostly attributed this to me sitting near the front.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zaillian's 'All The King's Men' is a well shot film. I liked how he created the feel of the 50's Lousiana with dark washed-out colours, the costumes, cars, money, interior architecture and the simplistic settings. Some of the visuals are very impressive as they brilliantly highlight the darkness of that era. However, the script seems a little contrived. In spite of having a wonderful stellar cast that includes talents like Sean Penn, Jude Law, Mark Ruffalo, James Gandolfini, Kathy Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson, Anthony Hopkins and Kate Winslet (could anyone ask for a better cast?), none of the characters, (with the exception of Penn's Willie Stark and Law's Jack Burden) are fleshed out enough and none of them, with the exception of Ruffalo's Adam Stanton, are particularly likable. Not every actor masters the Southern diction but I'm glad that they spoke with an accent their more comfortable with than a forced Southern-I'm-chewing-glue-while-talking accent. Yet at the same time it was too obvious especially when Anthony Hopkins spoke with a British accent. All the actors do a fairly good job. The dialogues are a stand-out. I particularly liked how the characters played around with words, mostly the double-entendre. At some points the film moves at an extremely slow pace. We don't see much of the poverty, which Willie Stark claimed to demolish. We do see him build hospitals but a glimpse of the hardship of the poor people would have given us a better understanding of the depth of their difficulties. Instead all we see of them is when they're cheering Stark. In addition to that, the ending is very predictable. In a nutshell, 'All the King's Men' is an interesting but contrived film that could have been a lot better had the aforementioned flaws, especially the sketchy characters, been taken into account for reconsideration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing this new version of All the King's Men, I ran and reviewed my VHS of the Robert Rossen 1949 classic that won Best Picture of that year, Best Actor for Broderick Crawford and Best Supporting Actress for Mercedes McCambridge.One thing I will say for this version, in the previous one they never actually give the name of the state this takes place in. Could be just about any southern or midwestern state, in fact with the lack of black faces in 1949 there was no suggestion it could even be in the south. Here they not only name the state, but the picture was filmed inside the state capital building of Louisiana in Baton Rouge where Huey Long was assassinated.Of course it's no closer to the real Huey Long story than the first one with all the same reasons I enumerated in my review of that film. This film is updated to the early fifties, right before the civil rights revolution. It loses something by not being set in the early thirties during the Depression and the rise of the Long family in Louisiana. The populist message of Willie Stark/Huey Long isn't right for the times.Sean Penn as Willie Stark certainly is suggestive of the redneck machismo of a demagogue. Of course his slight build works to a disadvantage to Broderick Crawford whose sheer bulk was domineering in the part as it should be in this film. Patricia Clarkson's role is whittled down to a nub from the part Mercedes McCambridge won her Oscar for as Stark's girl Friday. Of course the subplot of Stark's football hero son Tom is non-existent. In almost every way this version of All the King's Men comes up short in comparison to the earlier one. Still its good entertainment and particularly look for Anthony Hopkins's performance as the former judge driven to suicide by Stark's blackmail. That part was expanded from the original story.</fullReview>

A reporter named Jack Burden(Jude Law) suggests to former runner up mayor Willie Stark(Sean Penn) to run again, and give the people what they need. Stark decides to do it, and begins to be overly honest with the people. He soon brings Jack as his right hand man. But when Jack comes aboard, he soon begins to realize that everybody around him has too many skeletons in there closet. A truly great film about politics and power, also with great setting, mainly because I'm from New Orleans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many films in which exceptional and talented actors participate which leave audiences praising their contribution. However, heavy guns are not needed in this remake of the 1949 version with the same name. "All the Kings men" is loosely based on the rise and fall of Louisanna's famed governor, Huey Long. Having seen the original Black and White, and then viewed this updated colored version, I can say with all honesty, neither Hopkins, Penn, nor the addition of Jude Law, and his incredible persona, could save this remake. This film has a great deal going for it. The sincere and passionate speeches made by the up and coming Governor are to say the least, inspirational. The dark drama of conversations in the car and hotel scenes are dramatic and create tension and tenor. However, too much weight is given to the muck-raking and soul-searching scenes, some of which are never exploited for the audience. This movie version spends an inordinate amount of time panning the secrets of Willie Stark (Sean Penn), the relationship of Jack Burden (Jude Law) and how they interplay with Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins). In doing so, the film loses its direction, for the heart and soul of the historic and meteoric rise of the famed politician. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even a stellar cast made up of some of the finest talents in the business - Sean Penn, Jude Law, Patricia Clarkson, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Kate Winslet and Anthony Hopkins - can't save "All the King's Men" from being a tired, pointless remake of the Best Picture Oscar winner of 1949.Robert Penn Warren based his original novel on the life and career of the notorious Huey Long, aka "The Kingfish," who served as governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932. Like Long, Warren's main character, Willy Stark, is a charismatic leader who offends the powers-that-be with his populist rantings, yet eventually becomes as lowdown, vile and corrupt as the politicians he initially railed against to get himself elected.This theme of the corrupting influence of power - and the corrosive effect that corruption has on the American political system - may have seemed fresh and insightful in Warren's day, but it is strictly old hat today. Moreover, in Steven Zaillian's pretentious rehash, Stark transitions from being an idealist to a cynic in such record-setting time that the audience is completely at a loss as to how to read the character. Is he a man genuinely committed to helping his fellow citizens who eventually loses his way, or is he just another snake-oil salesman from the get-go exploiting the gullibility of the masses to get what he wants? The film doesn't seem to know, and the audience, quite frankly, doesn't really care.Stunningly, the movie is helped not one whit by its strictly A-list caliber cast. Penn hams it up shamelessly as the over-the-top Stark, spewing spittle and bile, regardless of whether he is whipping a downtrodden audience into an emotional frenzy or plotting the downfall of his manifold political rivals. Law, on the other hand, underplays to the point of catatonia the part of the governor's idealistic assistant (and narrator of the tale) who sells his soul to the devil by doing Stark's dirty work for him, even going so far as to blackmail the very man who raised him in order to prevent the governor from being impeached by the state senate. Clarkson, Gandolfini, Ruffalo and Winslet do little but stand around in the wings waiting for something dramatic to happen (as do we all), and Hopkins is simply too lazy to go through the trouble of even attempting a Louisiana accent let alone perfecting one. The movie definitely could have used some serious paring down from the original storyline, since it is stuffed to bursting with characters who come and go seemingly at random, and whom we really couldn't care less about. To add insult to injury, James Horner's original music, with its overemphatic underlining and theater-rattling crescendos, should be studied in film schools as a model of how NOT to score a motion picture.This movie doesn't hold a candle to such superior political dramas as "The Best Man," "The Candidate," "The Distinguished Gentleman" and, yes, even the original "All the King's Men," which boasted the incomparable Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge in the lead roles. Despite its coming from a simpler time, there was fire and passion in that version of the tale, two elements that are sorely lacking in this meandering, lethargic and undercooked remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the 1946 Pulitzer Prize winning book written by Robert Penn Warren and a remake of the 1949 film of the same title, 'All the King's Men' tells the story of southern politician Willie Stark (Sean Penn). Jack Burden (Jude Law) is a newspaper columnist in New Orleans who after a deadly school tragedy convinces Stark to take his, at the time small following, and attempt to become governor. It's not long though until Stark realizes his running is but a ploy to "split the cracker" vote so the current governor can be re-elected. He then holds no punches as he takes his own path and wins over every person considered to be a hick. He accomplishes this by repeatedly enforcing the fact that he too is a hick and if elected will do his mightiest to serve them well. This in the end gets him his seat in the governor's mansion. As time passes though, Stark himself begins to travel down the road those he initially spoke against when he starts to take what are thought to be means that are inappropriate to get his way.Zaillian's reconstruction of 'All the King's Men' starts out decidedly strong with its nicely written script and marvelous acting by Penn. Shortly after the election of Stark as governor though the film quickly loses it's drive and becomes a bit glum with only, sparse but nonetheless sharp moments. No one except for Penn is able to pull off a believable Louisiana accent. (Hopkins, who plays Judge Irwin, doesn't even try.) It's too bad they aren't able to because the script is actually really good. Of course what else could we expect from Zaillian? He is after all the same person who wrote the screenplays for 'Gangs of New York' and 'Schindler's List'.It's not entirely the actor's fault that the movie isn't up to par. Where Zaillian's brilliant writing ends, his mediocre directing begins. When a movie is only two hours of length, yet feels to be three, you know something went wrong. The most awful moment would have to be just before the closing scenes, that being the assassination of Stark and death of his killer. It was horribly long, and painfully boring. Once they're dead, they're dead. There's no need for five minutes of aerial spinning around two dead bodies with close-ups here and there of their blood flowing into one stream.'All the King's Men' isn't totally bad though. As I stated, Penn is great. The screen lights up with intensity and passion when he's speaking to the people. And although the other actors weren't capable of delivering stunning performances, the well written script makes the film good enough to sit and watch. The bottom line is, yes there was much more that could've been done to improve the film, but despite the weak direction and overall acting, 'All the King's Men' is highly underrated and is worth viewing at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a foreigner with not much ideas about U.S. history and politics, I have watched this movie with no bias and quite some problems to understand many phrases of Southern accents (which are quite fascinating on their own). However, it appeared to me as an interesting and pretty complex political story of the usual fight between rich and poor, honesty and false promises, racism, corruption... you name it. Even though the movie can catch one's attention for its full running time, some of the desired tension and drama are missing, and much of the final outcome is quite predictable. Overall, it's certainly no Oscar candidate, but also doesn't deserve low ratings as some (politically motivated) users distribute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, I don't understand all the hoopla over Sean Penn being "miscast". Despite the obnoxious way in which he happens to voice many political beliefs that I subscribe to, he (not Jude Law) is "one of our finest living actors." I've yet to see a comment here that suggests someone they thought would be more apt to play Willie Stark.As to the accents in the movie, I found Gandolfini's to be much more distracting than that of Hopkins. Even though Gandolfini doesn't sound like his most famous character in real life (check the credits---he's had a "dialect coach" for years), "Tiny" still sounded to me exactly like Tony Soprano trying to pull off a Cajun accent.All in all, the movie was very good. Whenever a film runs over 2 hours and you don't notice it until you're on the way home, that's a good indicator. And besides, how can a movie that actually makes Kelly Leak look like a competent actor be bad?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so glad that I went to see All The King's Men with my mate Betty (not her real name but I don't want to embarrass her), who is from Louisiana. A keen student of her state's history, she was able to explain the background of this story to me, particularly about Huey Long, otherwise I might well have been adrift. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it ? I did. It is pretty well acted, well filmed, well intentioned and obviously tells a story that needed telling (again), one of political corruption and the less-than-perfect past of America's democratic process. But it is also perhaps less than perfectly written - or edited? ? in that for someone not familiar with Louisiana's political past or with the book or previous movie incarnation, it is pretty complicated to follow. Hence my thanks to Betty. I see that director / screenplay writer Steven Zaillian was one of the writers of The Interpreter, a movie that spoiled a reasonably interesting story line with some truly banal dialogue, (and also starred Sean Penn.) The Interpreter was one of the most disappointing films I've seen in many months. This one didn't disappoint me, but I felt the screenplay assumed too much prior knowledge from the audience, about a period of history and a state that many people, rightly or wrongly, are just not familiar with. Maybe a screenwriter gets so engrossed in the story, when they are adapting a book, that they forget that some of the audience may not have read it? I hadn't, although I will now.Something that puzzled both Betty and me, is why the story, originally set in the 1930's, was updated to the 1950's. I make no claims to be an expert on the USA (although in the nine years I've lived here I've discovered that I know a lot more American history than many Americans), but I'm fairly confident that I'm correct when I say that 1930's America and 1950's America, were two very different places. The original story was set in the 1930's, when America was in the grip of the Depression. By the fifties, the USA had successfully cooperated with Europe to defeat the Nazis, the economy was picking up rapidly and people were much more optimistic. I really don't think the movie works in the 1950's in the way that it might in the 30's. Sean Penn plays Willie Stark, a politician who wants to rouse "the hicks" to defeat the greedy, corrupt, incumbent state politicos, and bring about a new era of better government in Louisiana. The story is told largely through the eyes of reporter Jack (Jude Law), and ties in loosely with a backdated love story about his relationship with Anne Stanton, and her brother Adam. Adam finally becomes one of Willie Stark's stooges as the new squeaky clean(er) politician also flirts with corruption. We are posed the age old question, does power always corrupt? Are there levels of corruption, and if Willie Stark / Huey Long used corrupt means to improve Louisiana (and I'm reliably told that he DID improve Louisiana), does that really count as corruption? Stark and Adam both end up dead in a bloody reckoning, and an era ends. It's an interesting story and I shall seek out the book now. But I come back to my original point, a movie has to stand as a work by itself, it can't assume that its audience already knows the story. This was told in partial flashback, and the dialogue was occasionally hard to follow, meaning that there should have been more exposition of what was going on. I've never been a Jude Law fan (see my unflattering dissection of Closer) but I actually thought he was pretty good here, and Kate Winslet can do little wrong for me. I'm also not a big fan of Sean Penn, but I feel any faults with the characterization are more due to inadequate writing than his acting. The character moves too quickly from local Good Guy to dubious Big Guy with little in between. Two major gripes; Anthony Hopkins plays a corrupt southern judge with a Welsh accent. He's a great actor but totally miscast here if he wasn't prepared to attempt a more accurate accent. I mean Welsh? In 1950's Louisiana? Really?...? There are limits to the elastic stretch of my credibility. And where in nineteen fifty something, did that ice skater find hold up stockings? They certainly weren't around when I was a kid in the 50's and 60's. This mystified me, as hours ? well minutes ? of internet research have revealed to me that the British company Pretty Polly invented and launched Hold-Ups in 1967. A small point, but exactly the kind of thing that drives me nuts!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could they mess up such a seemingly bullet-proof story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not read the novel. But from the plot outlines and the cast lists publicly available I felt quite certain that I could not go wrong when picking this movie to watch. I have also learnt that the original adaptation had won Oscar. Still, I have been completely, entirely mislead. The movie is basically about Willie Stark's (Sean Penn) rising political career, in the course of which he gets even more cynical, disillusioned and, sort of, fanatic, as he has been when we met him in the beginning.The three little crosses symbolizing three little children's deaths at the beginning of the movie are a good symbol all through All the King's Men, representing the willingness of all characters to go over the graves of even their most beloved ones.And now I come to the point where this film got out of the grip of the director: while it can be interesting, if all characters in a story are equally repellent, still, the overall story only works, if at times, a side of them is shown, which is, even if not easy to relate, but at least some sort of understandable.The characters here seem to act on impulse entirely. For no reason. No personal gain. Maybe they are just bored. But they do not seem to get any thrills from their actions, either.Why would you ruthlessly betray the person you loved as a father all your life, if a) he has never harmed you and b) you do not gain anything from it (besides, you are rich as can be, so you need no money either; nor have you any ambitions).Why would you not keep in touch with the so-called love of your life, who obviously also loves you, and your best friend? Where did the wife of Willie Stark disappear to? The reasons for which Willie Stark kept Tiny Duffy in his inner circle is simply ridiculous. You can expect nothing but vengeance from a man you have made a popular laughing stock.And what doe they want with poor Anthony Hokpins'es character stroking his chair all the time when he is on screen? In the end, when his best friend ever races to his death, the journalist stands by with wide eyes (obviously a specialty of Jude Law, and frequently used all through the movie). Besides, the performances of Willie Stark in public are driven to the border of absurdity. Willie Stark sways around while giving speeches as a flag in a hurricane. He is ruthless, mean, cheats on everybody he has around him, and the script is still centered around Jude Law's character simply destroying everything in his own life on the first plea of Willie Stark. Jude Law's character is not threatened, he is not promised anything. He does awful things just for kicks. Oh- yes, and he is the good guy. (Besides, I think that Jude Law is the same in most of his roles. This one included. So prepare to see Jude Law a.k.a. Jude Law.) Sean Penn is brilliant though (as he has always been, but he comes close to how good he was in Hurlyburly, thus is even much better than in Mystic River). Kate Winslet, Anthony Hokins and Patricia Clarkson have stupid roles and try to manage. Jackie Earle Haley is wasted. James Gandolfini is also a waste for the role of a quite unintelligent brute. Maybe it was the scriptwriters concept to show how the weak character of the journalist becomes free prey to someone of the willpower of Willie Stark, I do not know. But even this failed, since the journalist is an absolutely abhorrent person himself - anyone betraying the guy who raised him in love for no reasons is- this just doesn't work.I do not know what the concept was meant to be, but you have Wiillie Stark's road to madness, and Jack Burden's road to hell. Both of those fail to interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 50's, in Louisiana, the smart populist, manipulative and wolf hick Willie Stark (Sean Penn) is elected governor with the support of the lower social classes. He joins a team composed of his bodyguard and friend Sugar Boy (Jackie Earle Haley); the journalist from an aristocratic family Jack Burden (Jude Law); the lobbyist Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini); and his mistress Sadie Burke (Patricia Clarkson), to face the opposition of the upper classes. When the influent Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins) supports a group of politicians in their request of impeachment, Stark assigns Jack to find some dirtiness along the life of Irwin, leading to a tragedy in the end.In spite of having a constellation in the cast, "All the King's Man" is a low paced and boring soap opera. The dramatic and tragic story has some good moments, when the Machiavellian Willie Stark uses his political skills to develop strategies and revert situations, but the lead character of Jude Law is annoying. His romance with Anne Stanton, performed by Kate Winslet, is simply awful and unreasonable, and I do not know why the relationship of Jack with Judge Irwin is only disclosed by Mrs. Burden after his death. The cinematography and art decoration are very beautiful, but I did not like the story. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "A Grande Ilus?o" ("The Great Illusion")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Powerful Moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just returned from seeing a very moving experience. "All The King's Men" is better than what I expected and will go on to become a screen classic. Sean Penn is a genius and is one of the most riveting of all screen actors.Everyone in the cast is splendid. I was deeply moved by the cinematography. I live in Louisiana, in New Orleans specifically, and the poetry that is Louisiana has never been more ethereally presented; thank you Pawel Edelman. Louisiana is like no other place. Seeing the live oaks in City Park moved me to tears. I've been afraid to go there since Hurricane Katrina came this way thirteen months ago. The "slow" pace of the movie is not a discredit to the director. There is a lot of story here and it can not possibly be taken in in one viewing. I look forward to seeing it again on the big screen and also owning the DVD edition when it hits the stores.I have one recommendation to anyone reluctant to see this movie: read the review in The Los Angeles Times by Kenneth Turan.Patricia Clarkson is our hometown gal. I truly hope that her portrayal of Sadie Burke will garnish her a nomination for at least best supporting actress.What can one fault in Jude Law's performance? Accents? In New Orleans we hear so many accents one would think that they're in Brooklyn, N. Y.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the people who posted comments on how terrible this movie was need to first learn that this movie was a representation of the truth, a highly accurate one I might add. Sean Penn's depiction of Huey P. Long (Willie Stark) was incredibly well done, and the supporting actor playing Jack (Jude Law) did a fantastic job of portraying the relationship between the two characters.The story was powerful and motivating, well written, again, and the cinematography was superb. While parts of the plot had to be altered from what happened in reality, the story was still captivating and educational.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw a sneak preview last night, words cannot describe how convoluted the script is. Normally great actors do lousy jobs at conveying their roles here. Don't let the big names in the cast fool you, stay away from this yawner. The plot is hard to follow, not because of a complex story but because the screenplay was half-baked. It seems almost as if the writer just gave up. Why do we continue to remake great films into pathetic ones, Hollywood? Please use new ideas. Do not ruin memories of great films with more recent movies of terrible ones. Remember I saw this film for FREE and I am still upset that I wasted 2 hours of my life. If you pay for this, be forewarned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Accents + Shaky Camera + Predictable Plot = Bad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went to a pre-release screening and were optimistic about the movie.The British accents peaked out every once and a while in the "Louisana" born characters. The shaky camera movements were nauseating. We weren't sure if they were intended or just a poor projection. We'd figured out the story about half way through and thought about leaving the theater to see something more interesting. But, we stuck it out and aren't any better off for having done so. There is a nude scene that's reminiscent of Titanic. Everyone seemed to be drinking booze, but never shown drunk on screen. The Jude Law character was the most sympathetic. We never developed an attachment to the Stark Character or the Kate Character. Stark became annoying with all the speeches. There were entire statements where we could only make out one or two words. Stark's accent was difficult to follow without subtitles. Now that I think of it, subtitles would have helped all the accents out. I guess that means if you must see ATKM, rent it and turn the subtitles on</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious, Star-studded, and Terrible !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I begin ? The list is really long.It's a complete shame for (Steven Zaillian), an honored scriptwriter, to write a mess like that. The characterization is lost. I didn't understand the character of (Willie Stark), or what was meant through him. He's a good man, using bad means. OK, but so all the politicians, good politicians for that matter. So why the fate he met ? Politics turned him from someone who loves his wife and doesn't drink, into a womanizer and a drunken. But not thief. If that movie talks about how politics is somewhat dirty then it's so naive. And if it tells about the transforming of one man from pure idealistic into something else, then it flops.Then, that character played by (Mark Ruffalo) ???? Who is that guy ? He's some sad doctor, who plays the piano, and that's it !! First off; why he's sad ? The movie gives no answer ! Plus, how in god's name he went to kill as easy as that ?? So someone told him that the project he works in is a lie, and he's maybe going to jail, so he doesn't make sure of that or quit, No sir, he goes to assassinate the manager, and in public, to be a killer instead of a possible imposter ?? Now this is a higher level of "fabricated", being one of the weakest motives ever made in a movie to date. That awful writing made poor (Ruffalo) look like an idiot for all the time !What was (Jude Law)'s problem from the start ? What was the thing that pushed him to hate the rich people, and be unified with (Penn), deserving a wink from him ? How (Penn) left (James Gandolfini) beside him after uncovering his actual agenda ? Then, suddenly, we know that (Law)'s little old fellow reporter (Patricia Clarkson) is having an affair with (Penn) ?, Suddenly (Penn) has an affair with other girls, many other girls, and suddenly with the lead's girl ?? When things run in that manner; it's clear that this movie has an affair with TALKING, NOT SHOWING ! I didn't like that melodramatic third act : "He's your father, he killed himself, because of you, then your friend is going to kill your boss, then gets killed" (???!). And that last shot, with a flashback for (Penn) making a fiery speech to some hick voters ?? I didn't know, is it a way to ask god to have mercy upon the right goals ? Or is it to take a revenge at that lair ? Or is it to elegize a noble man who had left us so early ? I don't know, and maybe this movie doesn't as well ! Let alone that shot at the climax, Oh that shot, where the blood, of both the poor and the rich, is shed and connected together on the symbol of the state ? What the heck is that ?!! It's the top of this movie's stupidity and pretension !The movie is full of dialog. Meaty, sometimes too sophisticated for its own good, dialog. (Sean Penn) makes a speech every 15 minutes, in a way gets on the nerves. The music at nearly every scene's end gets a crescendo, which naturally refers to suspenseful next event that never happens (mostly you get another speech for Penn !). Furthermore, repeating the same move over and over produced a bore. And the direction, by (Zaillian) himself, led everything blandly; I think if it was made in the 1940s, it would have had artistically interesting traits (else shooting one scene in black and white pointlessly !). (Penn) is an alive actor no doubt, but that script is dead. It's insulting to work with it or agree to do it in the first place. His voice was too weak to be thunderous; so he was shouting and shouting hysterically in a way over his abilities. And physically he wasn't anyway convincing; lacking the loin's charisma of his character, looking like (or very much being) a thin actor who wears a fake ludicrous paunch.The movie tries to be a bit Shakespearian (Macbeth, Julius Cesar,..), a bit noir (a narration by cynical journalistic detective), and a bit satiric, but that mix didn't work at all. It's where the movie thinks more than does, and the drama can't inform a meaning, any meaning. So is it about : as long as the sonata is good, don't think about its writer's sins ? Nobody is perfect (Penn, Hopkins,..) ? Politic sucks ? (Rather this movie sucks !). Frankly I didn't catch on the meaning of the movie's title either. Ahh, this is WHOLLY clueless !I know that somewhere there is an impressive smartass who will figure it all out, and tell us how this is a great movie in terms of so and so, clearing up the deep and genius meaning behind it. But for me I hated what I saw, not finding a solid and enjoyable thing in it. And with the names of the stars, the scriptwriter, it becomes worse, ending up as heavy factitious crap. In other words : it's more messy than (Penn)'s hair in his second scene, and more puffy than his fake paunch ! (All The King's Men) fails at being anything, unless a forced Hindi melodrama. On second though : the worst Hindi melodrama is more clear and meaningful than that !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Don't Have To Hate Sean Penn To Hate This Movie -- But It Helps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn's performance is not the worst thing about this movie. He knows just how to play Willy Stark once he's gone mad -- he's brilliant at portraying spittle spraying hysteria, an angry man driven by personal demons who uses public issues as an outlet for his fury. (It's almost like he's not acting at all.) But he has no idea how to play the early, innocent Stark -- the one who gets into politics because he thinks it's all about helping other people. He shouts at crowds, "if you don't vote, you don't matter," but there's no sense of why these people mattered to him in the first place. They don't stop being human to him after he makes it, it's more like they were never human to him in the first place. And that raises questions about both the script and the original novel by Robert Penn Warren.The real problem with the movie is that Robert Penn Warren began with a fundamentally fraudulent view of the South. In his view, there are only two kinds of southern white -- the honorable, cultured aristocrat and the depraved, unredeemable, subhuman redneck. William Faulkner expressed a similar world view in his novels contrasting the stately Sartoris family and the sniveling, groveling Snopes clan. But Robert Penn Warren is much more sentimental, much more inclined to crude stereotypes, much less interested in tragedy and more interested in sentimentality and melodrama.In the book, and the original 1949 movie, the brutish Willy Stark is contrasted with the decent, sensitive, Stanton family, and the well bred gentility of people living "the good life" at Burden's Landing. These people may have lost their way, the story goes, but if only Willy's beastliness would awaken their finer feelings all would yet be well. The only redemption Robert Penn Warren can imagine for the South is a restoration of the old nobility, a return to faded gentility. It's a tired old lie, but it provides at least a modicum of drama. In the original movie you can almost believe that sensitive Anne Stanton is hypnotized by Willy's crude animal vitality and seduced almost in a state of trance. Southern ladies can't sin, after all. By the same token, when Willy is gone you can almost believe Jack Burden and Anne will forgive each other and go on to build quietly meaningful lives as an act of atonement for their sins.Now cut to the modern movie, circa 2006. The old drama is gone, not because Sean Penn is such a wretched Willy Stark, but because the shallow, snarky script writers can't understand what the original conflict was in the first place. Here the folks at Burden's Landing are no longer gracious, cultured, and charming. They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and spooky -- they're altogether ooky! And it's no laughing matter, because if life at Burden's Landing means nothing then there's no reason to care what Willy Stark does. He doesn't need to hypnotize Anne Stanton because in this version she's got the morals of a trailer park slut to begin with. No-one believes any more that her kind of virtue really exists in the first place, so how can Willy ruin it? And if he's not ruining anything, why be upset at what he does? So instead of ending with real tragedy, real death, and real renewal for the young lovers, this movie ends with a pointless montage of Willy's speeches -- as if he's the one who must be sentimentalized. Robert Penn Warren came from the South, and he believed in all the wrong values. But this new movie was made by Hollywood types who come from nowhere and don't even have bad values to believe in.And you can't blame that on Sean Penn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent cast but a poor adaptation of the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This cast was poorly used. All are excellent actors, but except for Sean Penn, were miscast, in my opinion. The soundtrack was so poor that we were forced to use sub titles while viewing it on DVD. And, that may be due in part, to British actors attempting to portray Southerners ! Whose idea was that ??In addition,the script was very convoluted, but that may be expected in light of the original material. One of the best parts, however, is the additional features on the DVD that chronicle the life of Huye Long,the Louisiana politician whose life Willie Stark is based on. Truly, real life is more fantastic than the fiction ! All things considered, however, I wouldn't entirely pan this movie and would suggest renting it at least, because it is very entertaining and a hell of a lot better than most stuff on TV !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willie Stark, a man of the people, is elected governor of the great state of Louisiana only to engage in the same underhanded maneuvers against which he railed in his ascension to the highest elected office in the state. That's essentially the story behind All the King's Men, a reportedly faithful adaptation of the Robert Penn Warren novel of the same name (also adapted in 1949), with Sean Penn as Stark and Jude Law as Jack Burden, the journalist who helped propel Stark to fame and fortune.Told from Burden's point of view, the story is supposed to show us that although power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely, or something like that. Burden meets Stark before the latter even enters politics, trying to get a new elementary school built to code. Instead, local cronyism allows the school to be built on the cheap, setting the scene for a fire escape to break and kill three children. Stark decides to try to run things his own dang way, but it's not until he's energized by Burden and by his aide/lover Sadie Burke (Patricia Clarkson, who's excellent here) that he transforms himself from just another white dude trying for some power into a galvanized, vibrant, gesticulating lightning rod for the have-nots in the state. Stark jumps from parish to swampland to hovel pledging to rid state government of fat cats and to work for the people. Somewhere along the way, though, he changes into the very thing he'd vowed to eradicate, all in the name of protecting those who could not protect themselves.Penn is good as Stark, although his accent (along with that of most characters in the film) takes some getting used to, thick as it is. If you've ever seen the 1949 version starring Broderick Crawford, though, you might have had in mind someone a bit ...larger, perhaps, more substantial. Penn's a pipsqueak, but he's a damn fine actor, so he's somehow able to essay strength, conviction, and tenacity into a larger-than-life character. Were it not for the frequent incomprehensibility of his diction, Penn's performance might be termed a powerhouse show. But I never got a feeling I knew why Stark changed. One minute he's gladhandling, the next minute he's applying pressure to a retired judge who won't support him (Anthony Hopkins). Where was his motivation? Was it pure greed, lust for power, what? Warren's novel probably elaborated a bit more than Steve Zaillian's screenplay did.At least Penn has a strong supporting cast around him, but Law still didn't feel quite right as the reporter/columnist. Why did he join up with Stark in the first place? (Stark tells him it wasn't for money or because Burden believed in Stark but because Stark was what he was and Burden was what HE was, whatever that means.) Essentially, the character of Burden was just a vehicle to tell the story of Stark's rise and ultimate fall. In fact, that's basically how the other characters come off as well, just window dressing to whatever scene the bombastic (and iconoclastic) Penn chews up and spits out.There's even a contrived romantic subplot - along with the ever-present specter of Buried Secrets - involving Burden and Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet). It's fun to see Winslet and Law, both of whom have done excellent work elsewhere, but the relationship feels forced, as does the character of Anne's brother Adam, played by Mark Ruffalo. Such wonderful, youthful talent, wasted! The twists involving these characters are pretty obvious, leading to hamfisted direction and over-the-top acting.Ultimately, his remake fails to really grab the viewer, leaving one to watch it dispassionately when we should be rooting for Burden (and Stark, at least at the beginning). It should be a story of manipulation and coercion on both psychological and physical fronts. But it is fun, at least, to see Jackie Earle Haley (remember? The Bad News Bears' Kelly Leak) as Stark's sharpshooter bodyguard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zaillian's strength as a writer is his weakness as a director...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"All the King's Men" won a Pulitzer in 1947, and the film won Oscars for best motion picture, best actor and best supporting actress in 1949. Oscar-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List) does a remake directing a stellar cast, further fortifying your reasons for viewing this flick, but it was panned by critics in the US.I reckon my lack of knowledge of US political history allowed me to enjoy it (ignorance can be bliss!). But from a film-making perspective, it does have several hitches.Zaillian's strength as a writer is his weakness as a director: he is too reliant on the narrator. He exposes the story not by showing but by telling, which is contrary to the medium.Sean Penn arrests you with his Gov. Starks monologues but I felt no emotional connection. Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins, Kathy Baker, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo: great actors all, but they barely get to strut their stuff. They seem removed from their characters, no motivation for each character's development (or lack of it); you just accept what is said.Mainly told from Law's character Jack Burden (even the name is in-your-face symbolic), a closet idealist reporter-turned-right hand guy of Starks, Penn blatantly steals everyone's thunder. But Law is satisfactorily compelling, possessing privilege and opportunities that he masochistically shirks; why that is so remains a mystery. But he exudes it from the way he wears his clothes to the way he downs his liquor.Zaillian's textbook cinematography was also manipulative and not seamless. Too many flashbacks, too many cutaways to the lion engraving on the chair in Judge Irwin's (Hopkins) house to symbolize 'taking down the lion'. There was also the continuity goof with the much discussed orange soda pop which Starks insists on drinking with two straws. Most laughable was the merging of the bloodlines near the end of the movie.This is a thespians' showboat but there is no chemistry between any of them.</fullReview>

Sean Penn made a great Willie Stark, not what you would expect if you had seen the earlier versions, but he brought his usual passion and emotion to the role. Jude Law did a very good job, torn between two worlds with his reserved demeanor, you could almost see him cry out from the torture. All of the other characters were simply props and support for the two main characters of Willie Stark and Jack Burden. Even though the movie is not fact based it captures the time it represents very well. Huey Long (whom Willie Stark) is based on, was what some called a madman and some called a great leader of the common man. It is now out on video and worth watching</fullReview>

To see the similarities in the fictional and actual stories please check Wikipedia under "Huey Long", part of which states the following...One of (Huey Long's) famous speeches was, "Your will is my strength and your need is my justice. They want to ruin me so they can ruin you, and I won't let them!" This quote was used verbatim in the movie.Sean Penn dominates every scene in which he appears - a fantastic performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes top 2 movies of 2006 - Must See for Anyone Who Appreciates a Good Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie ties with "The Prestige" for the best movie put out in 2006. It is definitely a drama, but with a captivating story propelled by strong character development it keeps you paying attention with no notice to it being slightly over 2 hours long.Sean Penn, who is not a personal favorite as an actor, compares with Johnny Depp in his ability to completely captivate the audience with his entertaining and expert acting - totally taking on the character as his own, drawing in your attention with each word and expression and scene.One thing I really enjoyed in watching All the King's Men was the repetition of scenes: they started off several scenes just showing partials of what happened, and then two or three times throughout the movie they went back to that same scene to build on it. Not only did this peak my interest at each point, but it really developed the characters and the audiences emotional involvement with their plights and circumstances. It served as a gentle reminder of what happened previous to enhance the important parts of the movie so that the audience was continually drawn back to what the director wanted to communicate.I finished this movie wanting to read the book, watch the movie again, and learn more about politics and Louisiana history. It is a must see for 2006.One thing I will add - the part-time workers at the video rental store where we rented it said the movie was boring and had recommended other brainless movies as superior alternatives. At first I followed their advice, but after watching their recommendations, I am very happy to report that we did rent and watch All the King's Men. Although it may not appeal to those wanting mindless comedy, for anyone who enjoys a real story this movie should prove rewarding, as it did for us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Penn Warren's 1946 Pulitzer Prize winning novel ALL THE KING'S MEN comes to the big screen courtesy of the author and writer/director Steven Zaillian and a dream cast that should make any script blaze across the screen. All of the ingredients of a brilliant film are here, yet areas of fuzzy focus and diluting the ever-present power of the main character so admirably brought to life by Sean Penn miss the mark to a degree. How this happened is unclear as all of the individual aspects of the movie would be hard to improve.The story is so well known that repeating a plot outline is superfluous. It is enough to remind the potential viewers that this is the 'quasi-biography' of Huey Long (here called Willie Stark), the hick from Louisana who gained the governorship of the state by empowering the poor and neglected citizenry led by a corrupt government with promises of reform and education, health and jobs for the disenfranchised. It is his rise to power and eventual decline and assassination that provides the playing field for a varied cast of characters, men and women of varying digress of honesty on both sides of the political arena. The story is narrated by reporter cum employee Jack Burden (Jude Law) who is first to show Willie Stark (Sean Penn) that he is a puppet for the corrupt wealthy gentry of Louisiana. The histories of the powers that be include the judge (Anthony Hopkins), the children of the controlling Stantons (Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo), the woman who would become mistress and informer (Patricia Clarkson) and the mother of Jack Burden (Kathy Baker) who holds the final secret that drives the downfall of Stark and 'all the king's men'. And in the end it feels as though Jack Burden's role as written for the screenplay seems the more important, a factor that diminishes the magnitude of the fall of Willie Stark.But this is a fine line of criticism. All of the actors give superb performances: the only problem lies in the too authentic adapted Southern accents that tend to cover the dialogue to the point of disrupting the access to the story being told. The mood produced by the lighting director, the cinematographer, and the musical scoring are incredibly fine. And in the end this is a superb film despite its few shortcomings. Advice: refresh the mind with reading the novel to enhance the understanding of all of the fine points of the story. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello everyone. When I saw the trailer for this movie (having seen Sean Penn in I am Sam, which is a great movie) I was in awe of his ability to assume character. Everything from his accent, to his movements to the color of the screen (which seemed to fit the time the movie was representing) intrigued me. I finally saw the movie and liked it. I didn't love it but it was really good. I expected it to be a bit different. In the preview it showed Penn's character being very strong for the people. It then shows him turning corrupt, but then again shows him supporting the people. So I thought that he would slowly turn corrupt but then things would happen that would bring his focus back to the people. It didn't quite go that way. In the preview, they took some scenes from the earlier part in the movie (where he was good willed and compassionate) and placed them at the end of the preview. This made it look like he turned back to being a "good guy" at the end. However, I was quite surprised by how it actually turned out. I was able to get into the performances, but wasn't as into the story as I thought I would be. The story, however, was still very well done and did make me think a lot, I just didn't love it as much as I thought I would. I must say though, that it was a very powerful movie and I did get a bit into the story. Especially the powerful ending. Sean Penn is truly an amazing character actor. I enjoy acting and often portray his character Sam from I am Sam (which I think I do pretty well), however I must say that I have a lot of trouble portraying this one. I can't do the accent nearly as well as he did and when I do the arm movements I look very fake as if I am really forcing it. He made it all come out so naturally, which is why I loved his performance. Jude Law did really good. I did not like his performance as much as I like Penn's for Law's performance seemed a bit more plain. However, that may have just been his character. I thought the guy from The Sopranos was pretty good, but I think he plays his character in The Sopranos a bit better than he did in this movie. He was still good though. Of course Anthony Hopkins did a great job, even though he did not have a large role in this film. I couldn't really get into his character very much, but he still portrayed him to the t. Kate Winslet was great. I did like the small love story between Jude Law's character and her's. I really wanted them to end up getting together in the end, but I was a bit saddened by how they never truly seemed to connect emotionally. The children who played their younger selves were great. Overall I really liked this movie, found the acting to be great and the story (eventhough I didn't love it) to be quite powerful. Having had a tragic ending I did leave the theater feeling a bit depressed and thinking very hard about the movie. It was brilliant in the performances and definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Penn Warren wrote a GREAT book... I have his desk, his typewriter, his library at my museum. I also lived in Baton Rouge for some years and know the colorful story of Huey Long, whose life Warren based his novel on. Long was a very colorful man...lived in the 1930s not the '50s. The whole business of "every man a king" went along with 'a chicken in every pot'...this was the depression...the poverty stricken people needed hope of any kind...which is what gave Long the edge.Anyway, ...besides the mistake of setting this movie in the 1950s....which doesn't make any sense at all.....this was one of the slowest, most boring movies I've ever watched (on DVD at home). I took the dogs out for a walk and came back and didn't miss anything...nothing much happened. I'm not sure how anyone could take Warren's great book, and the life of one of the most colorful governors this country has ever seen, and make such a horrible, boring movie out of it.I agree with the comment on the accents...Vivian Leigh, an Enlgish actress, did a much better job faking a southern accent in Gone With the Wind, than Kate or Jude Law did here...they were terrible. Sean Penn kept slipping out of his Looosiana accent...and others didn't even make an effort...The one nice thing was the scenes.. filming in the Louisiana state capitol, filming in New Orleans, was nice...they could have done a much, much better job of setting the scenes...they might have filmed in the Gov.'s mansion that Huey built....they might have tried shooting some of the scenes in the day light...since the scenery was the highlight of the film...they might have tried to do a better job of it.All four thumbs down on this.....</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong - it's perfectly OK at what it does - but it just fails to ignite any emotion in the viewer.What a waste of fantastic resources - all the pieces are there and the whole is an unappetizing mess. As a Hallamrk drama it just about toes the mark - with this cast, this director, and this money a shameful waste.Felt like sitting outside in winter watching paint dry: cold and bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Penn, brilliant once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I began reading the book just prior to the Sept. 22 release. While I have not finished the book, I was pleased to see that what I had read was depicted well in the movie. Sean Penn was brilliant. His ability to "become" his character once again, made this movie that much more enjoyable and believable. His well played speeches were fabulous. Very well done with emotion and believability. All acting and direction in this movie was well done, although, Mr. Penn was a standout. This movie was well done from every aspect. Wardrobe to hues to lighting to obvious direction and brilliant acting. Don't miss this one! I saw it twice and was glad that I did, because a very good point became much clearer when I saw it again. Grab your popcorn ahead of time, you won't want to miss a minute. .....Wendy M.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The critics hated it. The public stayed home. But I liked this. A lot. Its cinematic. Powerful cinema.And I am telling you I liked this with a bit of surprise on my part. That's because it has two actors who often play this introspective game, where they let you know they are playing a role. Penn does this throughout because his character is playing a part. There's even a scene where Jude Law's character asks if Penn's winked at him at the first meeting, and Penn's character demurs. So that's all fulfilling, but we also have the remarkable Kate Winslet who is more powerful than Penn in this ability. And she plays the southern woman, which means she is a decoration only ? and the important part: without knowing it. A waste two ways, which may have been the point.The story ? which hardly matters ? is about the nature of the environment. High school teachers will say something like power corrupts. Sophomore college teachers will talk about "deep" philosophical Greek questions, both of which are true I suppose. But I like to think about the environment seeping into and controlling lives. Its what Penn Warren said of it. And it is smack in the tradition of southern literature, indeed Southern Life.There are spores of self-decoration in the context of defeatism that penetrate every element of southern life, even today. Even a MacDonald's or Starbucks in the south has it. Look and see.Now I don't know this man as a filmmaker, but I do know his writing. He's intelligent. He's intelligent enough to know the limits for instance of Spielberg as a filmmaker and to write around those glaring deficiencies. He's intelligent enough to pick extraordinarily good talent. And he's intelligent enough to place the cosmic forces behind this in the place. Its almost as if Terence Malick were his location scout. The places are so characteristically affecting, so full of storytelling tendrils, so rich with the honey of sex that you cannot avoid what the filmmaker intends. The camera's embrace of place sets us in a film where context is the driver, not men.The great irony in the story is that the central figure pretends to be in control. He "makes up" the laws of the world with the intent of sprinkling enough good out of the shaker. But though he struts and puffs, he's a puppet, and no more an agent in the world than the ice skating stripper we see.Much has been made of the arm flailing. Also of the fakey Louisiana accent. That's "Lucy-ne'" But the whole point is that the character is what the critics thought Penn was: overblown. And the whole point of a deep southern accent? Its made up as performance, even by the natives.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the King's Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello!!! HELLO!!! Come on, wake up now...Are you back with us?..Now be honest, it was rubbish wasn't it? Were you blinded by the glowing cast list like I was? Were you drawn in by the seductive 30's Louisiana setting? Yea, me too. Were you hypnotised by the dreamy score and the soft-focus delights of a dripping Kate and/or a sweating Jude almost getting it on? Me too, me too! But it WAS crap we just watched right?. I mean, I don't want to think that I am alone and that I was the only one to walk out of the cinema looking like Elijah Woods' wide-eyed brother on bad hair day. Please tell me that there are others out there in IMDb land who were also bamboozled for those two hours, or I'll run mad.I expected a lot. A classic novel of depth and meaning, oodles of my favourite actors, an equally impressive off-screen team and 2 days off work. What more could one ask for? Suitably popcorned-up, I slid low in my seat as the lights dimmed ready for the giant hand of cinema magic to sweep me up and take me for a memorable ride. Unfortunately I think the hand swept me up and took me for a mug.Strip away the glitz, the schmaltz and everything else ending in 'tz' and what a bad movie it really was. I mean, really...What happened to Penn? In one frame he was an idealistic man of the people, in the next he made Nixon look like Mother Teresa. Where was the transition? Where was the depth? Why did he do the backstroke every time he made a speech? Why did Kate (looking good babe!) take this part? Her character was about as superficial and fluffy as...well, a superficial fluffy thing. It seems she was only there to add sexual promise and act as a bridge for one element of Penn's corruption to cross-over. Kate, if you read this, I still love you though and I really would marry you if you asked me. Honestly! And Jude. Yep, you look good too (not in any kind of sexual way Kate) but for how much longer will that be enough? Jude was the entire framework, the hub of the story and its narrator. Big job for little Jude I think. For an actor to carry this kind of role with conviction, he needs very strong on-screen presence...one thinks of Brando, Caine, Wells, Sandler (I put the last one in to see if you were still paying attention). Jude falls a long way short in this respect and consequently the foundation of believability was weakened as a result.Tony, Tony, Tony, what can I say. You were one of my favourite actors once....what has happened to you? Remember Howard's End? Remains of the Day? I would watch a movie without reading the cover just because you were in it. Now, you seem only to choose smaller cameo roles where you seem constantly to try your best to look like Colonel Sanders. What a waste! Hopkin's character, Judge Irwin, was crucial to the climax of the movie, but it was ruined for me by the ease and convenient simplicity in which his corrupt past was unearthed. What rot! And finally, the big guy who looks like he should be in Goodfellas or The Sopranos...can't remember his name, sorry. What happened to him?? He transformed in the blink of an eye from a threatening, manipulative goon to a fawning lap-dog. Astonishingly disorienting.I'm not entirely sure what I am trying to say with all of the above criticism about the movie as a whole, maybe because I am still dazed and confused by it's outward glamour. The best I can do to summarise is to say that this movie is lovely to look at, beguiling even, but underneath it is superficial, confusing and ultimately unfulfilling....not like you though, Kate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is about Jack Burden, not about Willie Stark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed in this movie. Even Sean Penn's performance was not good enough to redeem its flaws. I went to the movie thinking that it was about a politician who became corrupt after he was in power. It could have been my mistake to have that expectation. This movie is definitely not about Willie Stark character (Sean Penn) who becomes corrupt once he becomes governor. I was curious as to why and how he becomes corrupt but there was no analysis of that. Instead, it was about Jack Burden (Jude Law) who is initially a journalist covering Willie Stark's political ambitions and then later becomes his employee, working for him. Willie asks Jack to go dig up some dirty laundry of judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins) who is after Willie for his dirty business. The entire 2nd act is about Jack trying to find some dirty business of Judge Irwin, in return. There is a relation between Jack and judge Irwin which we find out in the end. Jack also has some romantic feelings for Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet) who is the sister of his old friend Adam Stanton (Mark Ruffalo). Everything is pretty much Jack's relation to all other characters. He is the one who is narrating the story. It's his/Jack's story. We hardly see Willie Stark. This still would have been OK but the movie almost has no pace. It doesn't ignite any kind of emotion in the audience. It is just too plain and fails to go in any specific direction. The only good thing about the movie was Jude Law's performance. He really does a great job. All the other performances are good but lack depth due to the screenplay's shortcomings. Sean Penn (the best actor, in my opinion) does a great job as usual, but his character too lacks a certain dimension. Overall, this is a poor movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the King's MEH, with a rolling subtitle that screams: "We want Oscars!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer-prize winning same-titled political novel and remade from the Oscar-grabbing 1949 version, 'All the King's Men' presents itself like a self-indulgent, self-serving "epic" Hollywood product, peppered with swelly climactic moments, poignant speeches and meaningful metaphors in Jude Law's monotone narration, all coated in a bloated James Horner music score. This is big, bigger, epic it tells us through every step of the way, even when it suffers embarrassing pratfalls.The story rotates around populist Southerner Willie Stark (Sean Penn) circa 1950. He is a self-declared "hick among the hicks," who makes promises of schools and roads which he cannot keep to the common folk. The slick Duffy (James Gandolfini) coerces Stark to run for governor, but upon finding out that he plans to split the rural votes in a corrupt game of power, Stark decides that he is strong enough to stand on his own platform and pursues the title alone. He wins by a landslide. Soon corruption once again surfaces, seeping into the political scene and the central transformation of Willie Stark from a dirt-poor do-gooder into a power-hungry politician is a craggy, choppy and even abrupt transition in the film.Director Steven Zaillian opens with the dutiful, swelly James Horner score and proceeds to introduce a star-studded, eye-opening cast that includes Sean Penn, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson, Anthony Hopkins, James Gandolfini, Kathy Baker and Jackie Earle Haley in token Southern roles. The film is shot in pre-Katrina New Orleans (yes, unsurprisingly it's been shelved for quite a while) which invests the setting in a lushly damp, brassy Southern atmosphere. Set in the 1950's Louisiana, the cars, clothes and all other windowdressing are nothing short of lovely, something that the cinematography aptly captures. Just looking at the film, keeping at the surface, it is quite remarkable.But its accolades end there and one of the key shortcomings is attributing Willie Stark's adviser/errand boy Jack Burden (Jude Law) the narration in 'All the King's Men'. It is thus told from his perspective, but Jude Law is much too frail, beautiful and delicate to handle a bold, brassy and boisterous Southern tale like this. The juxtaposition is curious and it becomes glaringly clear that he is only one of the many miscast actors in the spectacle. His southern accent is also frightfully uneven. Burden's task is to dig up dirt on Stark's opponent judge Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins), a close family friend of his. All the King's Men plays and navigates around its moral compass for a while, until Burden decides to go for it.If I have not yet made it perfectly clear: this is an unengaging and unsuccessful film, which is cemented in its cast. Sean Penn fledges his character with powerful weight, crafting a brassy politician with a thick southern drawl, which coupled with his grandiose, raving speeches, makes him sound like he suffers from down's syndrome. Worse still, had it not been for James Horner's appreciative, puffy score cuing us in to sympathize, he would have sounded like one of those street-prophets who rave about god and the end of the world. The result is unintentionally hilarious and I'm utterly embarrassed for Sean Penn, who sings tunes I have heard him sing before. His over-the-top performance as Willie Stark elevates the film so far above exaggerated formula that it has soon escalated to a big, sweltering status that plays on for at least fifty minutes longer than it should.Recreating political stories seems to be on the agenda lately (Good Night, and Good Luck), but Steven Zaillian fails with 'All the King's Men', a big film that seemed primed to pick up awards throughout the year. Unsurprisingly, it has not collected any. The only thing even worth mentioning in a remotely positive context is its setting/costume work and Jackie Earle Haley in a small supporting role that is regrettably almost quenched by Penn's bloated performance.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What went wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great cast, a landmark novel, even a superb film to use as a guide and still Steven Zaillian managed to mangle "All the King's Men." Agonizingly slow, confusingly told and putridly paced, Zaillian's "All the King's Men" might very well have my vote for the worst film of the year. Yes, there were and will be worse movies, but none that had such potential and wasted it.The first question that popped to mind after seeing this film was why would someone cast Kate Winslet, Patricia Clarkson and Mark Ruffalo and then utterly waste them in a movie? You've got three of the best actors working today and you give them nothing to do? Kathy Baker and Frederic Forrest fare even worse. Forrest's appearance lasts just a few seconds.Moving the time frame from the Depression to post-World War II makes no sense whatsoever and strips the story of any real resonance. What's surprising about this mess is that Zaillian actually is a good filmmaker and screenwriter. I loved "Searching for Bobby Fischer" (1993). But he seems completely confused by Robert Penn Warren's story of the corruption of the idealistic young politician.The problem begins with the casting. Sean Penn is a terrific actor. He very well might be the best of his generation. He certainly is among the top three. But I'm not convinced he was the ideal Willie Stark. It might be unfair to compare Penn's turn to Broderick Crawford's Oscar-winning performance in 1949. But whereas Crawford's Willie was bombastic and belligerent - let's face it, Willie Stark was one of Crawford's two best performances - and the transformation from idealistic populist to corrupt politician believable, Penn's more petulant and enraged.Penn lacks the physicality of Willie. Zaillian has Penn waving his arms around like a marionette and I realize Zaillian was going for arty with the shadow shots on the steps, but it's as as if he were boasting he'd once seen Carol Reed's "The Third Man" (1949).James Gandolfini would have made a better Willie. However, given how much he struggles with his accent in this film, that might not be all that good an idea, anyway. As Tiny Duffy, Gandolfini seems to be channeling Tony Soprano via Louisiana. And Jude Law is utterly miscast as Jack Burden.Willie's transformation is the crux of "All the King's Men." Yet, Zaillian barely acknowledges it. And doesn't bother showing it. One moment, Willie is rousing the rabble with his impassioned oratory, the next he's a sleazy politician up to his eyeballs in corruption.Scuttlebut is that Zaillian spent the last year editing this film. It's a confused mess. He has no idea how to manage the film's two parallel stories. The storytelling is choppy at best, incompetent at worst. And knowing he never once finds the emotional tone for his film, Zaillian compensates by pounding James Horner's musical score as if each and every scene depicts something momentous.Some of "All the King's Men" comes off as rankly amateurish. Zaillian treats his audience as if they're idiots, bludgeoning us with symbolism - the lion's head carving on the judge's chairs, or Tiny in pig dirt, for instance - and never trusting us to be smart enough to figure out the plot. Zaillian feels the need to constantly point out what a character means. Zaillian apparently doesn't believe in show, don't tell.The accents are all over the place. Winslet sticks to standard midwestern and gets away with it. But this gloriously talented woman has little to nothing to do as Anne Stanton and Zaillian even shies away from giving us a good romp between Willie and Anne. If another character had not brought up their affair, you'd be hard pressed to know. Law struggles with a southern tone and Anthony Hopkins doesn't even bother with one. It's hard to believe these characters grew up in Bayou country.I read a critic who said this might be one of the better films in theaters now. Then again, your competition is "Jackass: Number Two." And still that film did better than "All The King's Men." What does *that* say about Zaillian's film?I didn't think it was possible to make a boring film out of Willie Stark's story. Zaillian proved me wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'All the King's Men' can't put this plot back together again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it's a choice between watching the original film, or viewing the remake, odds are you're better off watching the first one. That advice held true with recent re-hashes such as "Around the World in 80 Days," "Bad News Bears," "Poseiden," "The Omen," "Manchurian Candidate," "The Hills Have Eyes," "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," "The Fog" and many, many others.I mean, is it our modern-day arrogance that makes us think ANYTHING we do is better than our predecessors? That if WE re-make a classic movie, we HAVE to do a better job, right? Now, granted, many of the above-mentioned efforts are horror/thriller pictures, so when I heard about the remake of the 1949 political drama, directed by Robert Rossen ("Body &amp; Soul," "The Hustler"), a film which won Oscars for Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge (and a nomination for John Ireland), I thought this may equal or even surpass the original; just like 2003's "The Alamo" did.Adapting the Robert Penn Warren novel into a thinly-disguised biography of Louisiana's sincere but corrupt governor (and later U.S. senator) Huey P. Long (the "Kingfish"), this new one has Sean Penn (Oscar winner for "Mystic River"); who, let's face it, is a much better actor than Crawford (whose only other decent work was as the villain in Judy Holiday's "Born Yesterday").Plus, with a cast that included Anthony Hopkins, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, James Gandolfini, Kathy Baker and Mark Ruffalo, among others, one would figure this new edition would race right past the '49 model. Well, it just ain't so.The film even starts out on a bad note, with a flashback (or flash forward, actually) of Gov. Willie Stark (Penn), his demented henchman, Sugar (Jackie Earle Haley, whom many will remember as the home run-hitting Kelly Leech in the 1976 version of "Bad News Bears") and press secretary, John Burden (Law) driving to a lonely house on the bayou, obviously to rough someone up.Then we go back five years to find a bumbling but honest Stark running for some kind of local office. During that campaign, he crusades against the corrupt government which cuts costs on a school project, only to see three children die in an accident caused by shoddy construction.Motivated by this tragedy, and coerced by some big city politicians to split the rural vote and give the incumbent governor the victory, Stark blindly runs for governor, giving speech after dull speech, until Burden and another campaign worker, Sadie Burke (Patrica Clarkson) wise him up.After that, Stark throws away his prepared speeches; takes to the stump and tells it like it really is. He calls the voters "hicks" and "rednecks," but also tells them that if they vote for him, he'll build roads, bridges, schools and hospitals for them ? free of charge.It's these scenes which really bring out the best in Penn; and while he goes a little bit over the top with his angry cracker accent and corn pone invective, they will probably earn him another Academy Award nomination.We don't see much of the campaign, but if you were paying attention to the first scene, you'll realize that Stark DOES become governor. As soon as he does, however, he begins to get tainted, and seems to grow a lecherous side, as well, especially for women who ice skate in night clubs.He also begins to push his welfare projects through a reluctant state legislature, which brings up a bill of impeachment against him. It's here where the film comes to a dead stop, however, so director Steve Zaillian ("Searching For Bobby Fisher," "A Civil Action") can concentrate on the unconsummated lover affair between Law and Winslet, as well as background explanations of their inbred families and such.These interminable sequences go on and on, making even the most patient Sean Penn fan cry, "Enough, already! Let's get back to Willie Stark!" I never thought someone could actually make the intrigue of Cajun politics DULL.And while the 1949 film probably cannot approach most of the acting heights of the new movie; at least the story is coherently and succinctly told, leaving little ambiguity and even less confusion for the audience to muddle through.The sad part is, though, most of the people reading this right now will have never seen (or perhaps even heard of) the original "All the King's Men," and will look upon this more recent edition (like "The Manchurian Candidate") as the end all, be all of modern film-making. Take my advice, rent the original and compare the two.They say, "Absolute power corrupts absolutely," well, that goes for directors, as well. And it goes double for Steve Zaillian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwrought plodding political melodrama wears thin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Burden (Jude Law) is a Louisiana newspaper reporter. Willie Stark (Sean Penn) is the parish treasurer for the small town of Mason City. He is tired of the rampant corruption and isn't running again. Then a schoolhouse collapse brings Stark back but this time to run as governor with the help of political operator Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini). Burden knows that Stark is only there to split the poor crackers' votes. After political strategist Sadie Burke (Patricia Clarkson) let the cat out of the bag, Stark goes populist hick against Duffy and the upper class. Stark wins by a landslide and he is confronted by the elite. Stark hires Burden as an adviser after he quit the newspaper. Duffy now works as the lieutenant governor. Sugar Boy (Jackie Earle Haley) is his scary driver. Burden's godfather Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins) is very influential and joins the effort to impeach Stark. Stark assigns Jack to find some dirt on Irwin. Brother and sister Adam (Mark Ruffalo) and Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet) are Burden's childhood friends and the upper class children of a former governor. Stark's womanizing ways starts with Sadie Burke, everyone wearing a skirt, and eventually Burden's first love Anne Stanton.This movie is all style but no energy. Everybody is putting in a heavy effort. The direction is weighted down. The movie sinks under all that heaviness. The dialog is tedious and spoken as if the world depends on it. There is no life in either Steven Zaillian's directions or script. The story moves so slowly that Zaillian may have been lost in the grandness of the attempt. Sean Penn and James Gandolfini are all mannerisms and impersonations. I guess Sean Penn's overacting can be excused because of the character. It doesn't make it any more appealing. Jude Law is surprisingly lifeless. It's just all so tired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Remake, but a Great "Kingfish"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When he was President FDR said the two most dangerous men in America were Douglas MacArthur and Huey Long, implying that any native-born fascism would likely originate from those sources to his right and left. The Willie Stark of Robert Penn Warren's "All the King's Men" is off course molded from Huey Long, the "Kingfish" himself, the very epitome of southern populists. The 1949 film version, directed by Robert Rossen and starring Broderick Crawford, is a classic and one of my favorite films on politics. The courthouse rings, the electoral populism, and the back-room deals are effectively depicted in the 1949 film while this current version (although produced by James Carville, the notable Democratic political strategist) seems to stress the politics less while emphasizing the emotional predicaments of Jack Burden (an ex-journalist and now Stark's associate) and his well-off family friends. The film does indeed depict Willie Stark's rise to political power, and shows how this intertwines with the emotional vulnerabilities of Burden's folks, but I believe the 1949 film had a better balance between the politics and Burden's connections.Not having read the novel, I can't say whether Sean Penn is a better Willie Stark than Broderick Crawford, but I'm convinced he's a better southern / agrarian populist (a better Huey Long) than Crawford. Crawford's characterization always struck me as too angry for a populist politician, while Penn's depiction seems to have the right blend of mocking humor and impish rascality to move the masses toward the voting booth. One weakness in this film (and also prevalent in the 1949 film, but less so) is the startlingly fast transition Stark makes from honest political reformer to power-hungry dictator. This film calls out for an intelligent discussion of issues related to human nature and political power but we don't really get it in a satisfying way. Does power corrupt and absolute power corrupt absolutely, and are there personalities more immune or less immune to its temptations? Do the ends justify the means (when the "ends" refer to building schools, roads and hospitals) or do corrupt or evil "means" sully virtuous "ends"? The producers of this film, in the special interviews, seem to emphasize the accomplishments of the "Kingfish"; perhaps they're "channeling" Lenin who famously, and ominously, said: "you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just can't imagine how this film did not generate more money at the box office. Look at the star-studded cast: Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins, Jude Law, Mark Ruffalo, James Gandolfini, just to name a few. You have three Oscar winners in that crop of stars. I mean on name recognition alone more people should have gone to see it. Penn did a great job in his role as Willie Stark. Penn is an avid political activist and it was great to see him play a politician in one of his films. His role as Harvey Milk was better than this but still the Willie Stark character was one that no one else would have played better. I had to read the book for an English class back in high school and I have to say that while the book was better, the film was great as well. The film has an interesting storyline just like the book and each character in the film plays the one that they should have played. Anthony Hopkins was great as Judge Irwin but it was quite different to see Hopkins play someone other than a villain. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone has an interest in politics and is a fan of Penn's because he really played this part incredibly well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly horrendous alleged adaptation of the brilliant book, "All the King's Men," it begs the question - did Zaillian even read the Cliff Note's version? Apparently not, as his hack job misses the true subject matter - do the means justify the ends and the corrupting influence of power - by a mile.There are too many flaws in this movie to enumerate, not the least of which is the zombie-like performance of the entire cast, which includes some fine actors; I like Sean Penn, but his wild arm-waving portrayal of Willie Stark was phony and distracting - actually almost laughable.But I'll just list the most obvious flaw: Probably the key moment in the book, which eventually leads to Willie's assassination - the tragic end to Tom Stark's football career which sends Willie back to his wife and infuriates Sadie Burke(horribly miscast by Patricia Clarkson) - isn't even addressed in the film! Don't waste your time watching this travesty - read the book instead; this movie is an insult to it's memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film features some of my favorite actors, but the entire thing doesn't work. I suggest reading Todd McCarthy's review in Variety. It sums up all of the film's numerous weaknesses and accurately describes the questionable Southern accents of the leads. I love Sean Penn, but somehow, even the mighty Penn cannot make this film work.Like Variety said, something about it wasn't real. There are several distinct scenes where you can sense you are on the set and the director has yelled "Action!"... and the actor goes through with his scene because he knows his lines and his marks... but that's it. It's really a tragedy; it should have been a great movie.The other thing is... you'll get lost with the plethora of characters and you will spend 2/3 of the movie trying to figure out what the relationships are... and then you'll forget half of them, which is too bad, because some of them will come back and you'll have to recognize them all over again. Overall, a big mistake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Historical inaccuracies aside, "All the Kings men" is worth watching, if only for watching Sean Penn and Jude Law chew up the screen. Sean Penn is predictably good in his role as congressmen "Willie Stark" but is it Jude Law that surprises, with an engaging performance and a pitch perfect accent. He carries the film, with able support from fellow Brits Kate Winslet and Sir Anthony Hopkins. James Gandolfini and Mark Ruffalo rounds up the stateside contingent in what is a very intelligent, albeit slow paced film. The cinetography is excellent, the film is beautifully shot. The script is highly intelligent so it's probably not suitable for teenage boys and men looking for an action flick. Everybody else should be able to be thoroughly mesmerised by the story and performances. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie that falls slightly short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By no means am I going with the critic stance by saying this movie is terrible. It was good, but wouldn't fall into the category of the greats. After first seeing the film, I was captured by the story, and although there could have been a few scenes replaced to help clarify the story of Willie Stark(Sean Penn), the Novel to Movie translation was probably one of the best I have watched.The acting throughout the movie was great. Sean Penn's performance as a fiery Rags to Riches politician was fantastic in my opinion. I also feel that the other actors could have given a bit more room to shine if their characters were more developed. For example, contrary to the movie, the novel is based more around Jack Burden's(Jude Law) narration of the events not only surround Willie Stark, but his own struggles through life that lead him to his place at Willie's side.Finally, if you're looking for an action packed violent movie, you won't find it here. This movie is a great political thriller and Southern soap opera. I would suggest watching the movie and then checking out the book after wards in your spare time. It will help connect some of the parts of the movie that you may not see the first time you watch it through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow moving but intelligent political drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should admit that when I watched All The King's Men, I knew nothing of the original film nor of the story itself. Indeed, the only thing I knew about this movie when I started watching it is that it has an absolutely brilliant cast. I've never seen Jude Law give an unimpressive performance, Sean Penn and Anthony Hopkins are consistently brilliant, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, James Gandolfini - I figured that if this many top quality actors were interested in the story it had to be good.There were times when I felt like it was moving a little too slow for my taste (and my attention span) and it seemed to take quite a while to get going, but the more I watched the more I realized how intelligent and well-made the film is. In preparing what to write for my review, I browsed a couple of other reviews, and was amazed that one reviewer, movie_man2006, claimed that the "dialogue was bad," and " there are scenes that are nothing but useless." Maybe there are some unimportant scenes, but this is sort of a blanket remark used to criticize a film when you can't come up with anything specific. How many full length films can you think of where you can describe the significance of every single shot from beginning to end?But the dialogue is bad? Did this guy watch the movie? I thought throughout the film that Penn's wild, flailing gestures while speaking were a little too much, but I imagine this is patterned after Governor Huey Long, on whom the character is "loosely" based. But the dialogue is great, if not brilliant. Jack Burden (Jude Law), of course has a way with words, since he is the writer in the story.I noticed in particular one sentence he said when he was asked about what happened with his failed relationship - "A lot of tangled bedclothes and unspoken loathing that spoke in loathing and no tangled bedclothes." Maybe a little over-rehearsed, but he's a writer and I reckon writers tend to come up with certain clever phrases about things that they run over and over and over in their minds.Stark was a simple man who came into political power by appealing to the masses, a group with whom he associated himself as having come from the same background. He basically just wanted to take the rich fat cats in government down a peg or two, but soon he allowed his power to go to his head and swung for the fences, stepping on the toes of too many people in too many high places. There is a point in the movie where Stark says, "Time brings all things to light." I have always hoped this is true, because I am genuinely curious to see what kind of things will have been revealed, for example, about what is happening in the American government right now that the people don't know about that is being covered up right now. I'm sure there is enough to fill volumes, and I hope one day it will all be revealed and the real truth will be known about the people in power. There are a lot of people that claim that All The King's Men is basically a failure. Obviously that's not at all true, although it could be argued that more could be expected from such a brilliant cast. The criticisms of Penn's performance seem to me to just be a lack of understanding of how politicians spoke in the south in the early 20th century. I wasn't there of course, but from what I've learned and seen, I don't think he was too far off. Remember the incumbent governor in O Brother, Where Art Thou (Is you, or is you ain't, my con-STITCH-ents?!?")? It's not a Best Picture, but failure is a hell of an overstatement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was able to view this version and the 1949 version on the same day, thanks to TCM on satellite. This remake is nearly 18 minutes longer and seems to have much less of the story. Sean Penn simply is not believable as a back-country hick with the charisma to become governor. Broderick Crawford had it perfect in the original version, but then he did get an Oscar. Perhaps it was editing, but this version simply seemed disjointed and incomplete compared to the 1949 version. The best I can say about the remake is that, unlike the original, it did not try to pass off California as Louisiana. (Being a native Californian who lived in the Deep South for four years, I know the difference.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous work of artistic film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not certain why the critics panned this film. I have studied the book for several years and read most of Warren's other novels and a lot of his poems (Blackbirds Goodby was amazing). I'm sort of surprised that others have not been adapted for the screen...World Enough and Time, and The Wilderness come to mind as likely candidates. I found the movie to be very close to the book although I agree there wasn't time for much character development. Too much on Tiny, not enough on Sadie. Blood flow on the ending might have turned off critics, nice symbolism but too drawn out. I liked the fact that this version was told from Jack's viewpoint, unlike the first movie attempt. I don't care that Hopkins accent was suspect... I am a great fan of his.... even his unheralded movies such as this one and Hearts in Atlantis. The movie was definitely Academy Award material and should be studied as an excellent example of the "Art of Filmaking". I agree that Sean Penn has suffered from past roles, political positions and general attitude. But, he gives a stand-up performance here. I was very glad to see that one commenter uses the novel in her AP English class. I graduated from High School/University in the 1960's and had never been taught about Robert Penn Warren. A sad commentary on public school's/universities from that time period. Hell, he was still alive then!!!</fullReview>

Perhaps it was a mistake to cast 3 British actors.. not being American I don't want to comment on the accents but they did seem a little over-emphasised to my liking... Perhaps by having so many characters the movie did not allow itself the time to develop each of these leaving me to wonder what was the motive behind some of the key actions in the movie.Is it worth seeing... yes.. the standard of acting is far above the story with Sean Penn being brilliant. Some of the cinematography is excellent and finally it would be an interesting study as to why even when you have all of the ingredients that sometimes the cake doesn't quite come out right.</fullReview>

I would recommend this movie to young adults and adults due to some of the content, but it is based on a real man's life, so it is depicted accurately. Penn does an excellent job in getting across the idiosyncrasy's of the "Hicks" in the state of Louisianna, which by the way is not derogatory. It is simply stating that the average people of Louisianna are hard working, simple folks, that are honest and fair. Life is not all about how much money you can obtain, but that it be earned honestly and used wisely.</fullReview>

For me, this is a masterpiece, in which I happen to agree with Rex Reed. However, Leonard Maltin finds this movie boring and gives it an average rating. So who could say who's right?I follow my instinct, and I found All the King's Men entertaining and enjoyable. And the score is fabulous! Now to the performance of the actors: Sean Penn is great, even if he is too bombastic:but maybe this is the real nature of the role. The other stars are no less convincing.And I love James Gandolfini!As for Anthony Hopkins, he's as peerless as usual. Now maybe the critics are comparing this version to the original 1949 version, an Oscar winner and a masterpiece for Maltin.Or maybe they are thinking about the book.I have neither seen the original version, nor read the book, but I love this movie!

Do we have a set of moral rules to live our lives or do we do what is practical and change the morals to suit the situation?From the start of the film our perceptions are played with in a challenging way. We are introduced to group of obvious bullies in a car on a night time mission of no good. We have little regard for their virtue. We are transported back quickly some five years and see two of the same same characters in a more 'acceptable' way.Is the main character of the film 'Mr Stark' a force for good, or a figure that becomes increasingly corrupt?

But then all of a sudden everything comes to a grinding halt and the story seemed to have gotten in a loop. From this moment every minute I thought by myself "Why am I watching this? What happened the last past minutes that should have been interesting?". So the second the screen went black, I said "What was this about?" and both of them looked at me and said "I have NO idea!".So, I think this is the most lengthy and boring movie I have ever seen.

		<shortDescription>"If They Don't Deliver, Give Me The Hammer And I'll Do It!" --- Willie Stark (Sean Penn)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"All the King's Men" (2006) Directed By: Steven Zaillian Starring: Sean Penn, Jude Law, Anthony Hopkins, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson, James Gandolfini, &amp; Jackie Earle Haley MPAA Rating: "PG-13" (for an intense sequence of violence, sexual content and partial nudity) When I went to see "Hollywoodland" in theaters, the trailer for "All the King's Men" was attached. When it ended, I looked at my mother and said, "That is going to be an amazing movie!" Everything about the trailer screamed success, especially the all-star cast, which was filled with Academy Award nominees. I saw no way for this movie to fail?and then the first string of screenings occurred and I experienced the most shocking disappointment of the year. Critics deemed the movie boring, pretentious, and bland, bland, bland. How could it be? How could the movie that I thought would surely gain a slot in the "Best Pictures" nominations be nothing short of horrible? My reasoning was, very simply, that it could not be?that this was just another example of how critics sometimes get things wrong. So, I sat down to watch the movie, expecting to disagree with all of the negative reviews. Thirty minutes into the film, I came to a horrible, horrible realization. This time, the critics were right.In this remake of the 1949 classic of the same title and this adaptation of the Robert Penn Warren novel, Sean Penn takes on the role of Willie Stark, a popular southern politician. At first an innocent man of the people, Stark slowly transforms into a corrupt politician--the same type of political figure he once condemned. But, as Stark is sure to discover, time brings all things to light and it is only a matter of time until Stark's career and life begin to unravel around him. With a plot like this, "All the King's Men" should have been a trailblazing drama that drew the audience into the corruption of Stark. It should have made an impact, not just on cinema, but on audiences and on politics as well. Instead of intrigue and drama, "All the King's Men" is packed with tedious scenes, dull dialog, and a shockingly pretentious execution.With a cast like this, the performances should have been the highlight and, I suppose, they are. However, one performance doesn't work and, I must admit, that this surprised me. Sean Penn is an Oscar-winning actor who has delivered some of the best performances of our time, but his take on Willie Stark in "All the King's Men" is not one of them. Penn obviously thought that putting on a southern accent and shouting would win him another Oscar. Unsurprisingly, it comes off as one of the most predictable, dull performances of the year. He makes the character annoying, not charismatic, and fails to understand what his character should have been. The movie, given that its script is so miserable, was mostly dependant on him and he fails to help it at all. The rest of the cast does fine and everyone else, though not giving any Oscar-worthy performances, works well enough."Rest Stop" was a bad movie. "Mortuary" was even worse. However, I expected them to be horrible. They were low-budget, independent horror movies with lackluster plots and unknown casts. Never did I expect "All the King's Men" to be lumped up with them in 2006's worst movies list, but it is. It is a bleak, boring movie that fails miserably in any attempt to keep the audience interested. It is not completely horrible, though. It does sport decent performances from its supporting cast and Steven Zaillian's direction is well-done and gives the movie a nice atmosphere. The initial plot is amazing, though is almost completely wasted on an ineffectual script. There is no emotion here and no heart. The filmmakers clearly thought that a plot and a cast would win them an Oscar?but not even the most amazing cast can save a script that is heavier and less exciting or interesting than a slab of concrete.Final Thought: When I think of this remake, one word comes to mind: BORING! Overall Rating: 2/10 (C-)</fullReview>

It's a shame that one of them (Jude Law) obviously thinks that "us Southerners" all sound like Forest Gump. I really got tired of him trying to speak with a Southern draw, and just wished he would speak w/ his own accent-- Sort of like how watching "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in English doesn't really bother you, even when you know that wouldn't be possible-- Hopkins didn't even try the "draw", and so he was more realistic.Even so, great film and Penn was magnificent.

		<fullReview>I was prepared to hate this film, since I am not a Sean Penn fan. He has a disagreeable, unattractive face and I was not looking forward to watching his mug for two hours. I have to admit though that, with the exception of James Horner's annoying score, which hearkens back to the days of big films like Doctor Zhivago, this film is of the first order. Much credit is of course due to Pawel Edelman's excellence behind the camera. He has accomplished a commendable feat in capturing visually, not only the feeling of an era, but that very feeling in a down-trodden, dirty-politicking Louisiana of yore. There are some carefully-crafted and memorable cinematographic moments, such as the shot of Tiny with the ferris-wheel as backdrop, that are artistic in the truest sense of the word. Steven Zallian's direction is tightly and expertly woven, and his screenplay must have been a delight for the actor's to read for its sheer literary excellence. Marit Allen gets huge points for costumes, and whoever did hair and makeup should be commended as well. The actors in this film have risen to the challenge of besting Robert Rosen's 1949 adaption of Rober Penn Warren's novel. I was especially impressed by Kate Winslet's subdued portrayal of the southern aristocrat who falls under the spell of the shady Governor, and Jude Law and Anthony Hopkins both give especially convincing performances of southern aristocrats caught in the pincer-grip of unshakable moral dilemmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody Depressing, but good as well...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw this film because Kate Winslet was in it. I usually steer clear of political dramas and the likes, stuff like that not only depresses me, they bore me as well. This one however, was both well acted, and increasingly engaging, I honestly don't know why it flopped. Perhaps because it was a re-make and people prefer the classic. I do not know.The film opens with Jude Law's character Jack Burden in reflective mode, he is laying on a bed as his voice-over talks in riddles that hint at what the viewer is about to witness. In a nutshell, his character meets Sean Penn's Willie Stark at a pivotal time in both their lives and nothing is ever the same after that. Jack Burden is a newspaper columnist who really has no stand on anything, while Willie Stark is a politician who stands for almost everything. Together they balance each other out. As their friendship begins, Stark is approached by a sweet-talking P.R. guy named Tiny Duffy(played by James Gandolfini) who ignites in Stark the fire to run of the governor office again. A fiery Sadie Burke(played deliciously by Patricia Clarkson), the main mistress of Stark is also through into the mix but before long Stark comes to know about a scheme involving Duffy and quickly turns the table on him and takes total control of the election race. Naturally, Stark wins by landslide as he pitches the State of Louisiana an offer they can't refuse -- he stands up for the poor. This does not sit well with the folks at the senate who quickly see Starks election and stance as both a threat on the rich as well as an attack against their own personal interests. It isn't long before the cook up a story to try and impeach him. Fearing that the impeachment would pass, Stark employs his new best friend Burden to try and persuade his godfather Judge Irwin (played by Anthony Hopkins) to sway the vote. This conundrum sets off a chain of domino like events that as you can imagine can only lead to disaster in every way imaginable.As I mentioned earlier, I only chose to see this film because my favourite actress Kate Winslet is in it, and so you can imagine my utter shock and disappointment when just like in Titanic neither sight nor sound of Kate is seen for the first 90 minutes of the film. And when she does show up, it's almost like blink and you'll miss. Her character Anne Stanton, the sister of Burden's best friend Adam (played by Mark Ruffalo) ties a lot of things together towards the end of the film, and for her part Winslet did her best possible to at least look alive while playing the mostly dreary Anne. The film belongs to Sean Penn whose combination of both screen presence and incredible speeches are a must see. Jackie Earle Haley is also great as (the 'do-not-cross' chauffeur/bodyguard of the governor) Sugar Boy. The director's decision not to show us the love-scene between Kate Winslet and Sean Penn was a good one IMHO (sorry if this a major spoiler to you) because I for one would have hurled. I could barely stand the sight of Penn taking in a burlesque show featuring a woman half his age and getting rise out of it, not to come and talk about seeing him in bed with Winslet. Ugh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This 'All the King's Men' and Happy Days Aren't Here Again **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very disappointing remake of the 1949 Oscar winner for best picture.Steve Zallian, who wrote the screenplay for the memorable "Schindler's List," (1993) seems to be way out of his league in this one. In fact, there is one scene where Gov. Willie Stark ( a screaming hysterical Sean Penn) is watching a dancer do the tango to the same music that was played in the early part of "Schindler's List."Penn is so hysterical in his approach that he lacks the Broderick Crawford intensity that led the latter to his best actor Oscar. Same may be said for Patricia Clarkson, the writer who works for the corrupt Stark. As Sadie Burke, she only briefly shows that she can be a loose cannon. In the original, Mercedes McCambridge got a supporting Oscar for playing Burke as a demented woman who worked tirelessly for the kingpin though he through her over as well for another woman.The wife, Lucy, is briefly scene and that's a loss here. Anne Seymour, in the original, showed her disgust as Willie turned from honest politician to nothing more than a corrupted one. In this version, it becomes difficult to understand what Starke has done that merits possible impeachment. Remember how the money flowed in the original? That's missing here.The one good link to this film is the performance of Jude Law as the wealthy reporter who goes to work for Stark. In destroying the judge, who could bring down Stark, Law (Burden) soon learns a very surprising think about the man that he respected more than his father. Kathy Bates briefly appears as a washed up chain smoking mother. Her role is wasted.Kate Winslet as Anne Stanton has her moments but she is not a Joanne Dru here. The usually capable Mark Ruffalo is totally miscast as Dr. Adam Stanton. Anthony Hopkins, as the judge, seems to be all over the place and why he kills himself remains a mystery. What exactly was that scandal with the power company.There is something terribly amiss in the writing here. Remember the John Derek part as the adopted son? That has been totally eradicated here. Better to let the original stand alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And it is through this notion that an American phenomenon was born during a time of great need in our nation. And in All The King's Men, the needs of America during and after the Great Depression is the backdrop for this political tale. And like the Greek tragedy that has played over many times throughout history, the director once again shows us that absolute power corrupts absolutely.This tale of a flawed man with good intentions giving way to hubris is one the Greeks identified thousands of years ago. And like our Greek predecessors, this real-to-life political climate of Louisiana is our Athenian tale of ambition, achievement and ultimately destruction by the very forces that brought it to power.As Willy Stark, Sean Penn gives us all a compelling look, as a fictional character who is unique and powerful master communicator. Willy comes to power by giving 'the common folk' their slice of the American dream--education, prosperity and dignity, even though it all comes by way of back-door deals and personal aggrandizement. In the character of Willy, Sean Penn again shows us why he is one of an elite handful of our greatest actors of this generation.As with all great actors, he transforms his physicality, speech, and manner into this charismatic leader. Through his energy and understanding into the motivation of Willy Stark, the viewer is provided a glimpse into this complex individual driven by achievement and a need for attention that ultimately consumes him by his own ambition.When there is a cast that boasts the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Jude Law, Cate Winslett, Patricia Clarkson and James Gandolfini, a mosaic of grand proportion has been assembled. With egos aside, each actor gives a masterful performance and exhibits a selflessness for the sake of the each character portrayed. This tale of politics in the South pulls us into each scene as each actor takes each word and gesture and turns them into an invitation to the viewer to become part of the scene.The direction and photography of this period film about the birth of 20th Century American political flamboyance provide a canvas on which this master piece is painted.To some, this film is slow moving. However one only has to look at the subtle relationships being built and revealed during periods of dialog-only scenes to understand the director's purpose. This director has composed his story like a visual symphony with each instrument defined and lending its unique presentation to the film's crescendo.If the film goer watches this version of All The King's Men for action or some new twist on an old story, they will surely leave the experience empty and unsatisfied. However if one comes to view this film for the re-telling of a timeless story by an extraordinary cast being masterfully directed, then he or she will revel in the experience of film making at its very best. In the land where everyman is a king but no man a ruler, Willy Stark is a throwback to the old Kingfish -- the likes of which we have not seen in a very long time.</fullReview>

There were times when jude law (the main character) paled in comparison with Penn. He lit it up! I've always thought of Sean Penn as a mediocre actor, but now I see him in different light.Though the accents in the movie are under some skepticism I still enjoyed it after 5 minutes of getting used to it. Thats all I have to say but this damn site wants more lines from me. xxxxxxxx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Major Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when a production manages to assemble an ensemble cast of some of the best in commercial cinema, you would expect the end result to be something special. The only thing special about the remake of "All the King's Men," is how bad it is. The movie is flat out boring reflecting a script from director/screenwriter Steven Zaillian ("A Civil Action") that fails to recapture the flare of a great American novel and the wit of an earlier great American movie."All The King's Men" is essentially the same story as the original film followed from Robert Penn Warren's novel. Politician Willie Stark (Sean Penn), who starts out as a honest man seeking a seat as county treasurer is quickly encouraged to run for governor after a school house catastrophe he warned the public about. However, Stark soon realizes that he is the fall-guy for another candidate and his campaign for governor swings into all out sensation. His speeches are loud, boisterous and truthful reminding the simple country folk that greedy city politicians will ruin them by "stealing every nickel out of your pocket saying thank you, please!" With the help of local reporter, Jack Burden (Jude Law), Stark soon becomes corrupt by using the power given to him by the people. He funds colleges, roads, bridges and hospitals?but he takes plenty for himself along the way. When his exploits come to the attention of family friend to Burden and public figure Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins), Stark seeks to quiet the judge through methods of intimidation. A spiraling affect takes place on all figures involved as Stark comes under investigation by the state courts. Burden sees his past ties to loved ones and friends diminished by the greed of power he now helps Stark keep, all ending in the finality of innocent lives. By all rights, this remake should have worked well. The plot holds up by today's standards and could even have been updated somewhat to reflect the current political climate. What is more, the production had the capacity to do so with a great cast?especially by Penn. Penn's performance as Stark is not an emulation of the fantastic role played by Broderick Crawford in 1949, but one of his own. Penn's image of Stark is a hybrid of a minister and potential nutcase. When Penn starts swinging his arms yelling at voters, "You give me the hammer and I'll nail them up," I could feel the blood begin to flow to my brain again after the first dull 15 minutes. The screenplay is the real problem; it simply does not allow the characters to come to life because it is underdeveloped. The dialogue is simple and the actors do the best with what they have to work with. But it is crucial to note that the original film brought more elements to its plot in a shorter running time than this film and managed to pull it off successfully. Even though I could not help but approach this remake with a sense of bias, it does not change the fact that the original is a much better film. There is also the subplot of Burden's past?his love for a woman who becomes Stark's mistress, Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet). The movie flashes back to a point where Stanton and Burden are about to make love for the first time. While Stanton lies on the bed waiting for Burden to make his move, he simply looks at her with want, where he proceeds to tell her it is not the right time. As Burden narrates the scene, he explains that an innocence was about to be lost that he could not accept yet? Well?that makes sense considering that is what the loss of virginity is: the acceptance of adulthood and moving forward to another element of life. I could almost see the parallel between innocence and corruption that the film was trying to make, but then I came to my senses and realized that I was just trying to rationalize a subplot that does not work. Instead we are left with a scene where a central character gives up on what could have been an amazing love. But I did not feel sympathy or pity for Burden?I felt he was pathetic. In the original film, we never see Burden and Stanton in any sexual situations, but it is implied that it has probably happened. Moreover, we can identify with the Burden character in the original movie, but not here. The scene is miserably misused and does not coincide with the rest of the film nor does it justify the point it wants to make about innocence."All the King's Men" is one of the most disappointing movies I have seen this year. Even if I had seen this film without high hopes, it would not change the fact that the very foundations of the screenplay were severely flawed and would ultimately make for a weak movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopeless Remake Lacks Attractive plotting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The pedigree for this remake of a previous Best Picture winner looked impeccable with multiple Oscar winners in the cast headed by one of our greatest actor's--Sean Penn. But it is never a good sign when a film has eight producers and too many Executive Producers to fit on one frame. Throw is Tony Soprano doing a southern accent and you have the makings for a big disappointment.And just about every thing here is below par but it could have been salvaged with an interesting story. How this film manages to take such an exciting premise and make it so, so boring is quite an achievement. Every time that Penn's performance starts to jell we are whisked of another dull subplot that envelopes the story with a level of inscrutability. The film's final frames are exciting and tragic but by this point it is too little, too late to matter.The 1949 film succeeded by being simple and riveting. Not that Broderick Crawford's portrayal was not complex, it just wasn't surrounded by the un-cinematic labyrinth that litters this adaptation. It would seem, for now at least, that The Best Actor category is still wide open.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't put a 1 because I have seen much worse, but this movie was a let-down. I had great hopes because it was based on a true story and had talented actors. The story was interesting in the first 20-30 minutes. Not much happened after that. In an effort to seem less lame and puny, the characters spoke in riddles. I couldn't believe that I was watching a finished product. Seriously nothing ever really happened in this movie. There was no plot development; but there was a lot of mumble jumbo in the characters' lines in an attempt to fool you into thinking that the movie was decent. It was like the writer didn't have a lot of time to spend on this project and rushed through, hoping that big names and Louisiana accents would disguise his laziness. To be positive, the actors did a great job with what they were handed. I hope this review helps and saves you from wasting your money. If you love any of the cast members or Louisiana history and you must see it, rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good acting, but terribly misguided directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite myself (I am one of many who thinks Sean Penn is full of himself and need a break from the screen), I do think the man gave a startlingly good performance as governor Willie Starks. James Gandolfini, Anthony Hopkins, Mark Ruffalo, and Jude Law all gave deft performances as well. Kate Winslet was unusually weak in this movie, but what really ruined the film for me was the odd, almost strange directing. There are camera shots that will make you cringe (at least a two second pause on a shaking chandelier after Hopkins raises his voice); the symbolism is very, very obvious and so it loses its credibility; and finally, the film tries to be too dramatic. Dramatic music plays while Sean Penn delivers speeches, there are dramatically loud chords signaling a shift in mood characteristic of 80's horror movies. I rated this movie a 7, because it is powerful, and because it is important, but its fatal flaw lies in that it attempts to be far grander and far larger than it really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Sean Penn's defense, if you're playing a character based on the larger-than-life Huey Long, maybe going over the top is the way to do it, but going over the top, climbing back up and then going over again and again is a bit much. Sean Penn was miscast in the role of Willie Stark--big time. Great actor, but it was like watching Pamela Anderson play Mother Theresa. In fact, the entire movie was miscast! I'd like to know which Hollywood genius said, "Okay, we're doing 'All The King's Men' set in Louisiana. Let's get a California-born Irishman, that New Jersey Italian guy from the Sopranos, and an Englishman--any Englishman except Hugh Grant--and we'll put this thing on film!" The dialog coach should be strung up by his thumbs. Every male character in this film ended up sounding like a cross between Jethro Bodine, Larry the Cable Guy, and, for some reason, John Cleese. I was born in the Northeast and moved to the South when I was 17--news flash, Hollywood--that's not the way Southerners sound. All I could hear was Moe Howard saying, "Mah deah, this cake is light as a featha." Are there not enough actual Southern-born actors out there that you had to get Tony Soprano, Jeff Spicoli, and Alfie? What? Sylvester Stallone was busy that month? Aside from the poor casting and ridiculously phony accents, the film was, at least, watchable. I managed to finish it but it was neither uplifting, depressing, or interesting. What I felt at the end was a profound feeling of relief...as in "Man, I'm glad that's over."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original "All the King's Men" in the fifties and I thought it was a brilliant masterpiece. I was very excited when I read that it was coming-out as a new movie, so you can appreciate my feelings when I saw the disaster starring Sean Penn.The new version contains most of the elements of both the original film and the book (I also read that), thankfully leaving out the John Derek character, but the high tension later version, containing the god-awful overacting by Sean Penn left me cold.Broderick Crawford was a very good character actor, not a star, but he fit the part of Willie Stark perfectly. He was calm and intent as the situation called for, but was vicious and wrathful when aroused. Just as in the book, he could be generous and even lovable, but he could also be just as maniacal as Jekyl &amp; Hyde.The present movie's Willie Stark is not the same caliber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly it was a mediocre film. At best. Sean Penn as the bombastic Willie Stark was somewhat interesting to watch for about the first 20 minutes or so, but it got old. Fast. Jude Law played Jack Burden in a truly wooden fashion and his waxing on about things as a segue device was simply awful. I've never seen Jude Law act before, but if this is his typical performance, well, I hope he has another line of work he can go into when his looks fade. Patricia Clarkson's performance as Sadie Burke was virtually non-existent - one of two central characters that were virtually chopped out of this haphazard remake.I wanted to see a LOT more of Talia Balsam, who played Lucy Stark. In the original movie this character got a lot more screen time, and well, I like Talia Balsam. Anthony Hopkins had no business whatsoever being cast in this film, and I cringed every time I saw him on screen. He's about as believable as a Louisiana judge as I am a transvestite hooker from Brooklyn.The entire Tommy Stark plot line was wiped out of the remake, which creates a gigantic hole in the logic... and yet they managed to kill roughly two hours with drivel. I have no bones to pick about Sean Penn's politics as has been accused of others here... but I know a lousy movie when I see one, and in this case I regret seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Penn should be doing Death of a Salsman, not this......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked forward to this film with great expectations. I should have realized that there was a reason a film with Sean Penn, Jude Law and James Gandolfini took almost 2 years to see the theater.Tne minutes into the film, I understood why. Penn, who was so marvelous in The Assassination of Richard Nixon, is a catfish out of water.He blusters like the Wizard of Oz or Don King, his movements look like he has Parkison's Disease, and his accent is unintelligible for the first half of the film. My wife and I kept looking at each other asking "what'd he say?" Well, at least he attempted an accent, unlike Anthony Hoplkins who didn't at all. Jude Law and Kate Winslet are terribly miscast as two southerners (with come and go accents also), Gandolfini still sounds like he's from Joisey, and looks generally foolish.One minute Penn is a crusading liberal, yelling "nail em up" about his crooked opponents,he doesn't drink, and is Mr. Virtuous.With practically no exposition, his entire personality changes. He becomes corrupt, cynical, a heavy drinker and a genuine bastard of a governor.There is too much nonsense about unrequited teenage love, and Mark Ruffalo's lines could be contained on an index card, reducing an important part of the story to not much more than a side mention.This film flows like cement, and it's a good thing Sean Penn isn't Jewish, with the ham he is in this film-unusual for him.If this film isn't the quintessential argument to stop making remakes of great films (go ahead and remake Frances the Mule-who cares?) I don't what else can be said.Go rent the original and watch Broderick Crawford make the screen sizzle with a brilliant performance-probably the performance of his lifetime. He followed this with a succession of minor films, and the early TV Cop SHow, Highway Patrol, in which he played Det. Dan Matthews. 10-4!! One good point- I got in for free. That's about the best thing I can say about this film, except it will be here and gone before you know it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't hate this movie, I just don't really understand why they bothered if they were going to make such a bland film. Its not bad but, actually far from it, the trouble is that its not really compelling. Forty minutes into this film I was wondering why on earth I was still watching it. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, it was more the sort of thing that you come across while channel surfing on TV and watch it for a commercial break or two before moving on. You don't hate what you're seeing you just have a need to find something better. After forty minutes I was wondering where the commercial was and why I couldn't find my remote.Well made and mostly well acted (there are a few people who should not be allowed near an accent) this is the story of Willie Stark who rose quickly in Southern politics before what he did to get on top came back to haunt him. Modeled on Huey Long the story has been a cautionary tale for politicians for the better part of a century now, and its warnings are still relevant today. However the film makers have made a film that never really grabs you.Perhaps part of the problem is Sean Penn's Willie Stark. Stark should be the sort of person who sucks you into believing him even when you know you shouldn't. He needs to be larger than life. While Penn turns in a wonderful performance, he is never charismatic enough that we buy that people will flock to him as an all powerful savior. Stark the demigod is just a man. I don't blame Penn, I blame the writer/director who chose to portray him that way.Its an okay movie. Its worth a shot at some point, but I'd leave it for cable or sometime like a long plane flight when you really won't be able to go anywhere for a while.</fullReview>

Sorry, but as we move ahead to the "Bush years" and perhaps the cynicism of American politics today, this film hit me in the face with Penn and his false promises, scenes with "fat political cats" set against the gentility of the old south.Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins and Kathy Baker were simply terrific in their roles in this dark and very dreary drama. For some reason I kept thinking about Law's role in THE ROAD TO PERDITION and yet In KING'S MEN he's really a sap.Locations, costumes and lighting were wonderful and watching the black Cadillacs and Packards on screen roar down country roads and highways added an element of interest to a simply boring film. And, as for the ending, well, can anything be more "Hollywood studio" than this film? I think not.</fullReview>

It's photographed film noir style in color, which never works. The scriptwriter had read the novel, but was at a loss how to translate it to the screen. With one exception, the casting was reasonable. (James Gandolfini was particularly good.) The exception was Anne Stanton.

		<fullReview>First of all I will say that if you must see this film, stay for the last five minutes. For only in the last moments of the film does Zaillian show any skill or style as a director. He may have written the film closer to the novel, but his narrative is never-the-less jumbled and splotchy. The man randomly throws flashbacks in at places and does not indicate they are flashbacks. The film is poorly edited and the random use of Jude Law's voice-over narration is offensive. These problems are compounded by lack-luster performances. Sure Sean Penn acts, but he is about the only one, and his performance certainly isn't noteworthy. He brings nothing more to the character of Stark than you would demand as minimum requirements. Nothing can be said for Jude Law, who more or less sits back and watches the film with the rest of us. Winslet and Ruffalo were wasted, and their casting was arbitrary to say the least. Surprsingly, Gandolfini puts in a noteworthy turn. All said this movie falls flat, it drags, it loses focus, and it feels half-hearted at best. This movie did not need a remake, and certainly not a half-ass one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't lose any sleep over the low rating of this film on IMDb. Most would be critics on this site are incapable of recognizing motion picture art.This remake of "ATKM" is one of this viewers favorite movies though it misses the mark of a would be masterpiece. Steven Zaillian and his crew did a wonderful job recreating the ambiance of Depression Era Louisiana. He was less successful in transforming the Pulitzer Prize winning novel of Robert Penn Warren into a screenplay but that is a herculean task.Although the novel is more about the life of Jack Burden, even he states that he is unable to separate his existence from Willie Stark's. Make no mistake, Warren based Stark on Huey "The Kingfish" Long, the smartest most capable as well as the most flamboyant politician of his time and that includes FDR. Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant and spellbinding as Stark and for those that say his performance is over-the-top, that is an oxymoron. The Kingfish's style was over-the-top which was a component of his brilliance as a politician. Jude Law inhabits the character of Jack Burden. Having read the novel, JL brings the character to life as he is portrayed by Warren. He should have been nominated for Best Supporting. The other over-sized presence in the picture is that of Anthony Hopkins as the judge. Another spot-on portrayal of the character if one is able to forgo the Louisiana drawl. In supporting roles, kudos to Patricia Clarkson as Sadie Burke who tears up the screen with her scenes as well as the underused talent of Sugar Boy as played by Jackie Earle Haley. Although Jackie's Sugar Boy is somewhat of a radical departure from the novel, he successfully creates his own persona. Warren's Sugar Boy would not be a character one would wish to watch on screen.Now for the casting disaster and one of the major flaws of the script. Kate Winslet is a wonderful actress. The project she worked on just prior to "ATKM' was a picture called "Little Children" for which she won an Academy Award as Best Actress. The film itself is thought-provoking and utilizes the talent of Jackie Earle Haley to a much greater degree which won him an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. However, she cannot credibly play Anne Stanton because she is not beautiful. Warren portrays Anne Stanton as a goddess, the penultimate female from the genes of Louisianan aristocracy. Caroline Renee Christmann was perfect for the look of Anne Stanton at age 9 (unfortunately she did not grow up to be that angelic looking). She was the love of Jack Burden's life who did marry another beautiful woman but since it was based purely on physical attraction, it did not last. Winslet was the right age but not a proper fit for the role.Many that should know say Mark Ruffalo is a good actor. After all he has been nominated for three Oscars. The problem with his character in this movie is that the screenplay does not provide enough character development. He is transformed as one of the best doctors in the state to an assassin by virtue of one phone call. The picture as edited is a little over two hours long. Another 20 minutes of character development would have helped immensely.Then there is the "Chinatown" ending. Dramatic, yes, rewarding no. Does anyone remember the story is about Jack Burden but since when would Jude Law receive top-billing over Sean Penn. Warren's resolution is more rewarding and not nearly as bleak.As is stated earlier, excellent picture with outstanding photography and acting with a plot based on one of America's greatest novels. There was a masterpiece to be made but unfortunately it was not realized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth brings all mediocrity to light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a remake of the 1949 film, but a more faithful adaptation of Robert Warren Penn's iconic novel, Steve Zaillian's (Schindler's List, Searching For Bobby Fischer, The Interpreter) take tells the story of politician Willie Stark (Sean Penn). Set in 50s Louisiana, the film documents Stark's humble beginnings, rise to power as governor, and final downfall, from the perspective of journalist Jack Burden (Jude Law), who gets drawn into Stark's ever murkier world.Crucified by critics on release, I found this to be a very 'split' film. The good first: It's photographed and scored beautifully, and despite accents, the all-star cast are predictably effective, with Penn delivering the needed bombast and passion of the corrupted governor. Law is good too as a disillusioned journalist fighting his own demons, especially an old flame and her brother, played by Winslet and Ruffalo respectively, also solid. We even get Hopkins and the late Gandolfini in supporting roles as a powerful judge and Stark's first ally, though both don't get much to do and feel more like novelties.Now, its narrative is where things get really hazy: Drifting between political corruption with Stark, and Burden's own personal story of manipulation and loss, the shift is not handled very smoothly at all. The story seems meandering and unfocused most of the time, with Burden's tale taking a little more precedence over Stark's. Not only does this cut away from some great potential allegory and parallels with modern politics, but it feels like the shades of grey are where Zaillian should be most at home. In 'Schindler's List', he handled that extremely well, but here, once he gets into office, he pretty much right away becomes a two faced weasel, which regardless of accuracy to the novel, doesn't make for terribly dramatic or smooth screen storytelling.As for Burden's story in and of itself, it's okay, but again, it feels like its detracting from where the story should be focused on. Yes, there is some parallel between how both men let down people, and they are tied together because they factor into Stark's political schemes, but it just drags and, again, doesn't feel like that's where the heart of this story should be. What works in a book doesn't always translate to screen, and this type of sprawling, laid-back narrative feels better consumed over the course of chapters.In the end, the film isn't boring or lazy, and I don't think it's the abomination the critics branded it as, but it just feels like Zaillian is juggling too many things. Had he focused the story on Stark and really gone into examining the backstabbing nature of politics, we could've gotten something, while not incredibly original, much more effective and gripping. As it is, it just amounts to a whole bunch of 'okay', and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I didn't expect that," Kristl said. She blinked at the lights of their garage-turned-movie-theater that had just turned on. It was always too sudden, even if you prepared for it. The projector had switched off, leaving for them in front of black screen. "What?" Henry said."I thought it would be a kind of gangster movie, but it wasn't. Also the title made me think it would be an English based movie. Considering two of the main characters are played by non-Americans: Sean Penn and Jude Law," Kristl said."It felt a bit like a gangster movie at times, that is true. It felt almost like it. With that guy that acted as a body guard to Sean Penn. He had the look of a gangster. Just like that fat guy that was one of his sidekicks," Henry nodded."But it wasn't. Well, at least not a gangster movie as such, but a movie about dirty practices in that world of dirty practices: politics""Yus.. same old song," Henry said, "Coffee?""Yes...Well, not too same. It's actually a bit different in a way, in that there is no really bad guy. Unlike those movies with 'evil' people, who are clearly evil, this is a movie that actually keep things normal and plausible in a way. There seems to be even a genuine attempt by Sean Penn's character, Willie Stark to do good for the people, but I never quite could figure out how much was just getting the people to vote for him or how much he truly meant to do.""It is probably part of the charm...I prefer movies that make it clear who to root for. I never quite get to like either of them: Sean Penn or Jude law, eh make that Willie Stark and Jack Burden.""Hmm, I can understand that. I never can see Jude Law as a likable guy. I think he is better off playing a creepy dark guy, like in Road to Perdition or The wisdom of crocodiles," Kristl said, "On the other hand, he is okay. Not to bad in this role. So what do you think?""I am not sure.. it's entertaining enough.. but not really gets you on the edge," Henry said slowly."Are you getting old?""I hope not. I would get all cranky. Like you.""Right. Anyway, let's get back on topic: the movie.""I do not know what more to say. It's an okay movie. The acting is good, but somehow it never quite gets to the level that I feel drawn in. Don't know why. It is like it's a bit by the numbers movie. I am already forgetting what is was about. It didn't leave much of an impression." "Maybe you aren't getting old, but cynical. Oh my. Henry, what is with you.""Maybe these serious movies makes me a bit depressed." "There is something. Isn't that what people maybe dislike about some movies?""Yeah. Movies that don't end well or are basically telling you that life sucks." "I see. I never see it like that. I mean I see it as something part of the human condition, some things end well, others end bad." "Well, we all know that, but is that what you want to be told all the time. I rather have a movie with a good ending, even if it means the main guy or girl dies. Giving his or her life for the good cause.""Oh. I see.""You start to understand these studio people. They want a good ending. Cause we want one. And we don't want to pay for bad endings.""I see. It seems different in European countries. Seems to be less concern about making a profit, more about art. No judgment. It seems that both ways produce good and bad movies alike.""Yeah.""This movie is okay.. don't you think.""But not very uplifting."Kristl nodded.www.meritcoba.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've had the advantage of seeing this for the first time (March 2014) well after the hype. Having watched the 1949 version a couple of year's ago I naturally found myself comparing the two films. As good as the original was considered in its day, when it was far closer in time to the both the book published in 1946 and the real life events the book was based on, it feels overblown and overacted. (Unfortunately I find this to be true of most English-language films made prior to the late 60s.) By contrast I found the 2006 film fresh, naturalistic and believable. Sadly I believe this is one film quite unfairly killed by its critics. It deserved far better, and I hope all those involved in bringing it to the screen have enough good judgement to value their participation. Understandably not the financial backers! If you haven't seen it, treat yourself. For a more enlightened experience check out the Wikipedia entry on Governor Huey Long (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Long) first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Direction And Poor Acting = A Poor Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Steven Zallian appears NOT to have got the best out of his stars, Sean Penn, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo and James Gandolfini. They all give us below par performances. Sean Penn (an excellent actor) is terrible in this. He is in the lead role and is so bad...he is almost funny. When a movies lead actor is not functioning, the movie is in dire straights...before the cue ball has been touched. Its very possible that the other principle actors were so surprised by Penns inadequacies, that they just switched off. After the first scene, Zalliain should have had a long chat with Penn, and told him to play the character he was supposed to be playing (maybe he did !!). Whatever..this is a very poor motion picture. In the D.V.D. extras one of the actors said he felt he had such a great time...and the parties were amazing (or words like that). Under another director this could have been a pretty good movie. As it is, this is messy and not worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the King's Men Is Still Watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the King's Men is a new film adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize- winning novel,All the King's Men by Robert Penn Warren. The story is about the life of populist Southerner Willie Stark, a political character loosely based on Governor Huey Long of Louisiana.Sean Penn stars playing Stark. It also has an ensemble all-star cast that includes Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley after thirteen years.It was directed by Steven Zaillian.The story starts when Louisiana newspaper reporter Jack Burden takes a personal interest in Willie Stark, an idealistic small-town lawyer. Circumstances develop that result in Stark's being urged to run for governor by a local political leader, Tiny Duffy. Burden has been raised around politics. He is the former lover of Anne Stanton, whose father was once governor. Also,he was raised by Judge Irwin, his stepfather.In time, Jack and political strategist Sadie Burke reveal to Stark that he is actually a dupe in the governor's race, expected to split the vote, spout the party line and lose. This opens his eyes to the realities of politics, and how it led him to a tragic life in the end.Inspite if its ensemble cast of talented superstars,the film fails due to a lack of political insight and an overall lack of cohesion in telling the story.Also,the film was tedious and the accents spoken by the characters could have been bothersome to the viewer.Aside from that,it suffers from too much conversation that made the film boring.But nevertheless,one cannot deny the great performances especially that of Penn,who played Stark magnificently. It is still a watchable film from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame political drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointing I'm afraid to say! Although political movies always draw me in, this one did not have what it takes to work its magic on me. I know it has a great ensemble cast and a good story based on a quite popular novel, but I just found it lacking in everything. The movie horribly lacked a focus; all plot lines were blurred that you cannot help asking yourself is the movie about the corrupting power of politics? Is it about Willie Stark (Penn)? Or Jack Burden (Law)? I did not enjoy the performance either. Sean Penn was overacting, and the rest were just lame. I do not want to sound judgmental here but I would certainly like to read the novel to know exactly what/whom to blame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's long and it's convoluted, but for this viewer at least, it works. Yes, I have my reservations, but I don't understand why when All The Kings Men was first released, it apparently got an almost universal thumbs-down from the critics. I have just read what the New York Times had to say about it, and I agree with many points the writer made, but this film is by no means the near-disaster it seems to have been made out to be. (A relevant point is that although I had heard of the original 1949 film of Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel) living here in Britain, I had never heard of Steve Zaillian's version. Even a search for reviews by our British newspapers turned up nothing, and I doubt it was even released here). Nor is it, as generally seems to be assumed, about Huey Long, the controversial Thirties Louisiana governor who was gunned down in the State legislature (or whatever the building is called). It is interesting to note having only heard what was generally said of what kind of a man Long was, I had believed him to be a monstrous demagogic crook who got his just deserts. Well, they say history is written by the victors and that piece of utterly biased received wisdom is a case in point. Yes, Long handed out jobs to his supporters and their relatives and he wheeled and dealed with the best of them, yes his terms as a governor and senator were tainted with corruption, and yes he bullied to achieve what he wanted done, but then so did and do a great many other state and federal politicians. It's not as though the term 'pork barrel politics' is no longer used in the U.S. ? ask yourself why not. It went on then and it's going on now ? well, my, where exactly was George Dubya's 'bridge to nowhere' supposed to take the good folk who use it? Long wasn't the exception, he was pretty mainstream in his tactics and behaviour, but what cooked his goose and ensured that received wisdom accepts he was nothing but a lowdown crook was that he was, in all but name, a socialist in a country which generally loathes socialists and all they stand for. Long was brave enough to take on big business and the money-men in order to improve the lives of the 'hicks' of his state ? be built roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, instituted free education and healthcare ? and big business and the money-men did not take kindly to being made to fund these schemes through taxes and to see their hegemony challenged. Zaillian's film ? and it's NOT a remake of the 1949 version as is all too often unkindly claimed ? and Penn Warren's novel base the central character of Willie Stark on Long, but this is not an account of Long's life as is so often assumed. In fact, it isn't really about Stark (Sean Penn) at all. Halfway through the film the focus shifts to Jack Burden, the former newspaperman and incipient alcoholic, who witnesses Stark's rise to prominence and becomes his fixer. Burden is a mess, doing, a man from 'good stock' who does Long's bidding almost without question even though he doesn't like what he is asked to do. Penn Warren's novel and these two film versions of it are about corruption, but it is the corruption which permeates Jack Burden rather than the corruption of the governor. This second version of All The Kings Men is a major slice of Southern Gothic which examines the corruptibility of everyone, not just Long and Burden. There's Anne Stanton, the daughter of a former governor and the childhood friend of Burden's with whom he is in love, who has an affair with Long in order to get funding for a social project with which she is involved. There's Adam Stanton, her idealistic brother who loathes Long and his politics, but who is seduced into running a major medical centre built by Long despite that loathing. Zaillian's film of Penn Warren's novel is far better than many critics would have you believe. My reservations are that characters and their motivation could have been fleshed out more, especially the central character of Jack Burden. What is it in his make-up which ensures that he does Long's dirty work, eventually even being responsible for his own father's death as he tries to get Long of the hook. That is never explained, and I should have liked it to have been. It's not for everyone. If you have a soft spot for films such as Independence Day or Dinner With Smucks, you will quite likely hate it. If, though, you like great acting, a good story and excellent cinematography, and don't mind the tale being told at length, this is for you. Don't believe the critics. They aren't always right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on DVD, and I still am not 100% sure of what happened! LOL There was absolutely NOTHING wrong with the acting. Sean Penn, Jude Law, Anthony Hopkins, Kate Winslet, Patricia Clarkson, Mark Ruffalo, and all the others did a fine job, but I do not know how they understood what they were doing! Much of the plot is very ambiguous. At the end of the movie, SPOILER ALERT, Judge Irwin commits suicide. After that, Jack's mother blames him for killing his FATHER. This seems to imply that the judge was his father, but what does that mean for Anne? Are they siblings? Was the Judge only looking out for her? In addition to that, I do not know if Willie Stark was cheating on his wife with Sadie Burke or not. Someone please explain it to me because I have no clue. I am about to try to find a plot synopsis and, hopefully, that will help. If this movie had won for best screenplay, I would have been appalled. So, due to its terrible ability at explanation of storyline, I give this movie a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oversimplifying? Perhaps. But I frankly don't see an awful lot of reason to dislike this. Just to get it out of the way, I didn't know about the other two film versions, nor the novel, before I watched this. I don't know the actual real-life Governor that the book, and from that, the movies, was based upon, so I cannot comment on anything relating to that. The plot is excellent, I was hooked all the way through. Ditto story-telling, if the narration, which I understand is quite true to the original text, was used a tad more frequently than necessary. The pacing is great, this never gets downright boring. This ought to surprise you a couple of times, as the mystery is gradually unraveled. The acting is phenomenal, Penn disappears into the role for the entire two hour duration, Law and Hopkins shine as always, and really, everyone is spot-on in their performance. While I get if some Southerners are frustrated that most of the cast is not actually from that part of America(indeed, a couple of them not even from the US), I still say they do good. The accents are pretty well-done, though you do need to pay close attention, and maybe also have subtitles, to pick up everything that is said. This is well-edited and has solid cinematography. The score is well-composed. There is a little sexual content, partial nudity and violence. I recommend this to any fan of anyone who helped make it, and/or drama-thrillers. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard-drinking reporter Jude Law (as Jack Burden) begins by covering corrupt politician Sean Penn (as Willie Stark), and ends up on the Louisiana Governor's payroll. As time passes, Mr. Penn comes develops interests in Mr. Law's childhood friends: beautiful Kate Winslet (as Anne Stanton), and her noble brother Mark Ruffalo (as Adam Stanton). Fatherly Anthony Hopkins (as Judge Irwin) adds to the cast's impressive list of Academy Award nominations, which are enumerated in the film's promotional material - but, none were for this version of "All the King's Men".Director Steve Zaillian, along with his cast and crew are, evidently, very skillful. But, the film doesn't work. First of all, the highly accomplished cast of performers don't seem at all natural. The men look like actors given fedora hats to look like they are 1930s characters - or, it could be the 1950s; it seems, sometimes, like the setting was changed during production. Not that Mr. Zaillian and cinematographer Pawel Edelman don't make the sets and locations look very beautiful, however. The characters seem too remote, and it is difficult to maintain interest in their lives and relationships.***** All the King's Men (9/10/06) Steve Zaillian ~ Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant believe the bad critics on these film. Im not that fluent in English, but understand these please: this is a terrific movie, with terrific actors about the modern tragedy of being reluctant to change. Sometimes culturally we suffer internal and external coercions that impede our path to a more equal, livable, paradise workers world. It is not boring, because you want to know what will come next, and how is going to end. It gives you a philosophical insight in themes such as family, meaning of life, money, vocation, politics. Besides: it has Kate Winslet in it. Do you really know a bad movie with her in it? I challenge you. Come on enjoy it, don't listen the critics, in my opinion they didn't get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a very quick note. Saw it last night. Accents, yes, everyone picks this up and rightly so. If you cannot do a proper deep southern accent then don't cast the actor. Period. Jude Law can portray a southern accent; he did very well in "Cold Mountain", so why his accent was so very flat, I can't understand. And then there is Gandolfini, who as soon as he opens that mouth you just expect him to ask you if you have some problem and let's step out into the back alley to discuss the matter. The poor guy is so Bronx he cannot possibly do any other accent so why bother? Other than that he's terrific, if you just ignore what he's trying to sound like. Kate Winslett is a complete waste in this film. Even worse as far as terrific actors is the non-speaking role for Frederic Forrest. Why did they bother getting such a great actor to just stand there for one scene and wave, all lasting about 30 seconds or less? What a waste.I actually liked Jude Law's performance, as I usually do. He's one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to convey good if not great acting. His delivery is very flat throughout the film but I am of the mind to think that he was directed to act this way by the director. Law is very versatile and so this seemed more the directors vision than his. Anthony Hopkins was wasted in his small role. He had little material to work with. His accent was not British as some have said. It was about as flattened as he can make his accent sound. Certainly NOT a southern gentleman but some sort of amalgam of other American sounds. He looks thoroughly bored in his role and given the little he had to work with, I can't fault him.Mr. Penn's characterization works for me completely. He has the rather rare talent of being able to eat up the scenery; Nicholson, Pacino, Russel Crowe, Hoffman, can do this. Penn's portrayal was effective and bordering on creepy. I do not know much about Hughey Long (is that how it's spelled) as a person so I don't know where all the arm swirling like a bird trying to take off came from.The film is very good to look at but does not lift off. Seems to me that the plot had much potential but not enough fuel to ignite where it counted. A good but not great drama. Perhaps in the hands of another writer and director this could have been a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie very interesting in its adaptation of the novel, choosing another topic to enlighten than the one chosen in the 1949 movie. First of all, unlike what is said by several people, I did not feel the "rise and fall" of a politician in this movie. I did not sense a truly hearted and people loving politician becoming corrupted by exercising power. I rather felt a complex character, being both deeply against the upper class and ambitious for itself. The core soul of this story seems to be the moment he discovers that he has been manipulated by the lobbyists in this campaign, not aiming not win, and when he made this marvelous speech denouncing the manipulation. He definitely ran into a populist style which he might have believed in somehow, but was mainly a political strategy. He is human, dual and complex. Corruption might have been always in his veins, even before becoming governor. But the main character is not Willie, it is that young upper class journalist who believes in his mentor and throw out its bounds to his family and class, in order to get free and denounces a dying southern aristocratic society. Just a further word: the last shot of the movie is wonderful. I do not say more as it would be a spoiler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not find this movie to be very entertaining. It was mostly about politics and the sound was so poor, I could not follow what was said. Sean Penn as well as most of the actors used such a thick southern accent it was unintelligible at times. As for James Gandolfini, I am not sure why he was cast in a movie that takes place in the deep south. I wasn't sure if he was trying to pull of a southern accent or not; however, he still sounded like he was from New York. This movie was supposed to follow the corruption of Governor Willie Starks once he gets elected by playing to the concerns of the poor in the state. He builds a hospital for the poor in order to generate cash for himself. I'm not sure how he made money from that. Plus he keeps a mistress, but she has little to do in the film.FINAL VERDICT: I don't find politics very appealing, so I didn't like this movie. But, I'm sure there are some that would think this is pretty good. If I had subtitles to read, maybe I would have liked it more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't point to many things particularly wrong with this movie, but it just had an overall feeling of leadenness and lifelessness. The few areas where there are specific criticisms are (1) the numerous directorial choices that seemed ponderous, predictable, and straight out of film school (e.g., the death montage) and (2) Sean Penn's physical choices in his characterization of Willie Stark. I realize he was trying to channel Huey Long, but he looked more like he was doing Joe Cocker as a southern pol.I can't really give it a positive review.

		<fullReview>I like Sean Penn and I feel that he really did a great job in this film. However, I feel that the film failed miserably when the focus was not on him.There is a reasonable tendency to compare the film to the 1950 version with Broderick Crawford. That version was far superior in every respect. The characters came alive and were real, while her I could feel nothing towards them.I could not feel the anguish that Jack (Jude Law) was going through as he was forced to choose between his people and his employer. This is one of the most important aspects of the story and it just wasn't there in this film.Jackie Earle Haley (Little Children) was a scary presence on the screen at all times. Every time you saw him, you couldn't help but wonder what might be coming. He played his part well.This film was full of stars - Kate Winslet, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson, and Anthony Hopkins - that just weren't used effectively.Get the 1950 version to see this powerful story told the way it should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of the American classic by Robert Penn Warren, you will be amazed at how accurate this movie stays to this Pulitzer wining novel. This movie not only takes on the dark side of politics aspect of the movie, it also leaves the edge that Warren put into the story, chocked full of poetic lines and deep philosophy. Warren, who was most known as a poet, his lines are visible throughout the film, giving a deeper insight into the life of Willie Stark, who closey resembles Huey Long, the "Kingfish". The movie escalates from humble beginnings with a people orinated Willie Stark, and a handshake with the devil, corruption grows, until Adam Stanton shoots Willie in the Capitol. The only thing brining this film from a ten down to an eight, it's the fact that some of the actor's don't play the time period well, such as Kate Winslet, who seems to be a woman in the 21st century rather than the 30's. Overall, this is a very excellent film to go hand in hand with a very excellent novel. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the reviews suggested</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing a few posters for this film, i thought it would be amazing - with the all-star cast and all. But after reading the bad reviews, i thought i'd probably give it a miss on the cinema.Anyway, last night i eventually got round to seeing it, and was surprised - sure it wasn't great, but it was better than the reviews led me to believe.To be honest i haven't read the book or know anything about the real Huey Long, but i am aware that the film is set in the 1950's not in the early 30's era of the great depression, which is when Huey Long was senator. Already this seems like a massive mistake for a film in which Willie Stark (based on Huey Long) played by Sean Penn relies so much on the support of the impoverished common 'hick' folks. Surely this would be far better represented during the years of the depression? But despite this, i thought Sean Penn was good. He is a quality actor after all. However, in All The King's Men he does have a slight tendency to over-act and some of the scenes with him preaching to the hicks on the back of a truck do get ridiculously cheesy. In fact the whole film is a little on the over-dramatic side, with lots of thunder-storms, shouting, alcoholism, crying etc. If this film is aimed at adults then perhaps it didn't need to be so overtly melodramatic, i really think a little bit more subtlety would have added to the film and would not have been lost on the audience.Another major problem i had with the film was the use of English actors! I am English, so (i'm sure American's will agree) when i see Jude Law and Kate Winslet trying to sound like deep-south Americans it just seems a bit unbelievable. Sure their accents weren't that bad, but they are too familiar and English to play the parts, why weren't American actors cast in their place? Its not as if Jude Law was especially good anyway. As for Anthony Hopkins' character, was he supposed to be English? I hope so because otherwise his accent was a complete failure! Apart from these criticisms, the film was well shot and relatively engaging (although it went on a bit too long). The story is also very interesting and Willie Stark is a brilliantly complex character. I know this review isn't particularly positive, but i expected this film to be completely unwatchable, which it wasn't. Its just a pity the film wasn't as good as the all-star cast would suggest. I think i might read the book now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a biography about Huey P Long. It's a movie based loosely on his person, about a populist political figure who becomes a victim to powers that he does not foresee. He was never tried or convicted of an impeachable offense, nor was he removed from office. The movie takes from "implied" and "understood" southern political tradition of corruption and graft from leadership; because of this "understanding", no back story is needed or given. We assume, because we have been told, that this is an accurate and factual portrayal of Gov. Long. IT WAS NOT. Gov. Long was nobody's patsy. To this day, he remains much hated or much loved, depending on what side of the socio-eco class you are. In this movie, a good bit of liberty is taken on truth and actual events, but, then again, that's why it's called fiction and not a biography. God Bless Huey Pierce Long, our beloved "Kingfish"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All The Kings Men is about LA Governor Stark mid last century who rose to power and was just as corrupt as the people he replaced. Stark talked a good game and probably did some good for the people, but the politics and scams were too much for some of those that were use to power at the time. Stark seemed to be the people's governor, promising good things for the people and promising to nail up the bad people that were in power before. Much of the film revolved around a reporter that worked for Stark and dug up dirt on those that opposed him. He gladly did that until he was forced to dig up dirt on his adopted parents and found out some interesting things. Jude Law wasn't quite as emotional as I expected him to be, a little numb throughout the movie. Technically a good film with good acting and good period scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I enjoyed the movie, I think that more than two hours is a little bit long, specially when some parts are innecessiarily repeated, like the conversation while driving in the beginning and the beach one. Another thing that is not as good as I expected is Sean Penn's acting... overacts too much.So please, try the original, directed by Robert Rossen and with Broderick Crawford as Willie Stark (he truly plays Willie without overacting).

		<shortDescription>Looks beautiful, some good performances, but something lacking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stellar cast,interesting subject, great backdrop, a writer responsible for some great work such as Schindler's List - and as such had "Academy Awards" written all over it. Not to be I'm afraid, the result of the above is a beautiful mess.Sean Penn play's the impassioned Willie Stark, and his slow demise, up to his assassination. Everyone knows what Penn is capable of, he is a powerhouse actor, he never holds back his punches, and nor does he in this film. It is a good performance by him, and yet, I did not feel it does enough to save the film.Jude Law is likewise very good, quite a comment considering the awful "Sky Captain". However, he does himself proud. In fact, no one puts a foot wrong in terms of performance. So, where has it all gone wrong?My first assumption would have to be the direction. Yes, Zaillian is a good writer, however, he is inexperienced as a director - The average to OK "Civil Action" being his only previous attempt. One feels, that a project the size of All The King's Men should perhaps have been left to a more seasoned director. The film loses its way at times, jumping from monologue to monologue, without any explanation of the story. Jude Law's character (despite his good performance) is very underdeveloped, despite his and the screenwriters best efforts.The film does look absolutely stunning, catching the feel of the era in the southern states perfectly. And paradoxically, this is one of it's downfalls. Everyone seems so caught up in capturing Louisiana of old, that the story seems to play second fiddle.The film is over 2 hours, and it simply feels like there is a large chunk missing! So much promise, but ultimately, a great cast and a great looking movie, cannot save this from the critics hammers. The film just doesn't feel quite right! Apologies Mr.Penn, I'm still a big fan! 5/10</fullReview>

This is probably his best performance of his ever.Wish that more American actors were cast in this film, the Brits just don't get the accent right, no matter how hard they try. Jude Lowe had done a great job, if only he could remember that he's in the South in the fifties. Anthony Hopkins doesn't even try any more. I also felt the the film was a bit too long.

		<fullReview>The movie is, from the outset, confusing in its development of the story. One is constantly battling to ensure that one understands exactly what is happening. Much of the time, this battle is a losing struggle. The dialogue is extremely difficult to hear, as only Anthony Hopkins speaks clearly. Anyone with the slightest hearing impairment is not going to hear a large portion of the shouted or mumbled dialogue. The less said about Sean Penn's performance, the better; he was not the man for the part. Had I seen the original Broderick Crawford version, or read the book, it might have helped. As it was I cannot say that I derived much enjoyment from this movie, other than the sparkling performance by Anthony Hopkins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huey Pierce Long, Jr. was the governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932. His story became a novel, which became a movie, which became a remake. And so begins All the King's Men.Sean Penn plays Willie Stark, a small town man who is told by a corrupt sort-of spin doctor that he can win the race for governor. Jude Law portrays a journalist named Jack Burden covering the campaign, who soon becomes a friend to Stark. Early in the movie, Stark discovers he is being used, and takes things into his own hands. After wining the election, and promising to represent the "hicks" of Louisiana, trouble arises for Willie. A judge wants to hold a vote for his impeachment. Stark instructs Burden to find a story about the judge to silence him, which is what the movie chooses to focus on for quite a long time.Too long, in fact. We become wrapped up in "How does Burden know the judge?" and "How does Burden know the beautiful heir-is?" which are things that we shouldn't really care about. What we should have seen was Willie's rise to the capitol. Granted, we do get one, lovely montage about voting hicks from Penn during the campaign. After that, he just comes in and out to remind Burden of his job, and to beg the question "Exactly who is Govener Stark cheating with?" I had no problem with the casting, I loved it all, except for the three lead roles. Sean Penn is just a little over-dramatic, the opposite of his role in Mystic River, which he won an Oscar for. I also must pick at a less-than-perfect southern accent. Jude Law is hardly believable as a tough journalist, and governor's pet. The worst casting decision was probably Kate Winslet as Law's love interest. She is is no way a convincing southern bell.All in all, it wasn't a horrible movie, and even though Law and Winslet bring the move down, it was worth the price of admission, and I recommend it to anyone without a short attention span.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite up to Par, but Still Watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1946 Pulitzer Prize winning book written by Robert Penn Warren and a re-make of the 1949 film of the same title, 'All the King's Men' tells the story of southern politician Willie Stark (Sean Penn). Jack Burden (Jude Law) is a newspaper columnist in New Orleans who after a deadly school tragedy convinces Stark to take his, at the time small following, and attempt to become governor. It's not long though until Stark realizes his running is but a ploy to "split the cracker" vote so the current governor can be re-elected. He then holds no punches as he takes his own path and wins over every person considered to be a hick. He accomplishes this by repeatedly enforcing the fact that he too is a hick and if elected will do his mightiest to serve them well. This in the end gets him his seat in the governor's mansion. As time passes though, Stark himself begins to travel down the road those he initially spoke against when he starts to take what are thought to be means that are inappropriate to get his way.Zaillian's reconstruction of 'All the King's Men' starts out decidedly strong with it's nicely written script and marvelous acting by Penn. Shortly after the election of Stark as governor though the film quickly loses it's drive and becomes a bit glum with only, sparse but nonetheless sharp moments. No one except for Penn is able to pull of a believable Louisiana accent. (Hopkins, who plays Judge Irwin, doesn't even try.) It's too bad they aren't able to because the script is actually really good. Of course what else could we expect from Zaillian? He is after all the same person who wrote the screenplays for 'Gangs of New York' and 'Schindler's List'.Its not entirely the actor's fault that the movie isn't up to par. Where Zaillian's brilliant writing ends, his mediocre directing begins. When a movie is only two hours of length, yet feels to be three, you know something went wrong. The most awful moment would have to be just before the closing scenes, that being the assassination of Stark and death of his killer. It was horribly long, and painfully boring. Once they're dead, they're dead. There's no need for five minutes of aerial spinning around two dead bodies with close-ups here and there of their blood flowing into one stream.'All the King's Men' isn't totally bad though. As I stated, Penn is great. The screen lights up with intensity and passion when he's speaking to the people. And although the other actors weren't capable of delivering stunning performances, the well written script makes the film good enough to sit and watch. The bottom line is, yes there was much more that could've been done to improve the film, but despite the weak direction and overall acting, 'All the King's Men' is highly underrated and is worth viewing at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I live in a small town from south America so we can't see all the movies US produces, I've seen this movie just a couple of days and really it captivated me. Political corruption, lies, false promises, power, rich people, poor people... It seems to be talking about my country. I've read some comments that explain how power corrupt people. I thought Stark was a martyr, that was killed because threatened the bureaucracy. Really I don't know if I got it, moreover, I haven't read the book nor known about the true story, but I think that it represents how the power can determinate the destiny of some people, I mean, always Evil wins against good if there are money in the middle. In my land there have been good men, with great ideas for poor people but something occur and split it. When they are on the top of the mountain, their ideas just disappear or they are disappeared from the earth.I rented the movie because it had a great cast, Sean Penn, Kate Wistley, Anthony Hopkins, Mark Ruffalo. I like all the characters they performance. I don't understand if they were miscast or was a big disappointment, furthermore, I saw the film subtitled so that, I didn't notice the accent of the actors. Anyway I enjoyed the whole movie, the plot was great and the end was amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accents Distracting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Penn Warren, one of the most underrated American writers of the 20th century, won a Pulitzer Prize for All the King's Men. Sadly, this film pays pitiful homage to that fact. The film was ill cast, seeming to reflect a growing trend towards the mindset that all that's needed for making a successful film adaptation is a stable of superstar actors despite their suitability for the necessary roles. Mr Penn, who is a phenomenal actor, was horribly unconvincing as Gov Stark. To begin with, many actors, including Mr Penn, appear utterly incapable of "getting" Southern characters, failing to recognize the nuances of class in the South (for example there is no such thing as A Southern accent--there are many Southern accents that break down largely along class and geographical lines). Mr Penn's accent and mannerisms were totally off for his character. He completely misses the mechanics of "Cracker" speech and gestures. He was so ill at ease in his "Southern skin" that I found it a complete distraction throughout the film. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, Englishman Jude Law was much more adept at playing Jack, the Southern aristocrat.Overall, the screenplay adaptation and editing was so bungled it clipped along with all the awkward progression of a three-legged cat with its whiskers shaved off. This movie is a good example of how you can't buy a happy result in film making by simply throwing money at it and assembling a high-priced cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine movie, much better than its rating would indicate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The prize winning book that the movie is based on was written in the 1940s. It is fiction, but gets its inspiration strongly from Huey P Long, Louisiana governor in the late 1920s and early 1930s. But the movie is actually set in the 1950s. I was born and raised in 1940s and 1950s Louisiana, much of what I experienced in school was influenced by Governor Long. And how many times have I driven over the New Orleans bridge named after him? Maybe being a native has colored my response to the movie, but I found it completely enjoyable. As I also found scenes shot in Audubon Park among the oaks, and the little bridge crossing over to the golf course.Sean Penn carries the movie as Willie Stark, a blue collar man from North Louisiana who is encouraged to run for governor, only as a ruse to split votes. But Willie was smart, and when he realized that, he rallied all the "hicks" like him and won by a landslide.Jude Law is newspaper man Jack Burden, fascinated by Willie, and who eventually works for him during his tenure as governor.Anthony Hopkins has a small, but important, role as Judge Irwin, a family friend of Burden's, and who supports Willie's eventual impeachment attempt.Kate Winslet is Burden's friend from childhood, Anne Stanton. Mark Ruffalo is her brother, Doctor Adam Stanton, and who Willie eventually asks to head the big, new charity hospital he is building. (A side note, my mother's life was saved in the 1950s in the real Charity Hospital.) Even though the story and characters are fictional, anyone who understands Louisiana and its politics will also understand how realistic they are. It is the age old question, does the good justify the corruption? SPOILERS. Just as the real governor, Long, was shot and killed at the Capital in 1935, the governor Willie Stark, as he was beginning a campaign for president, was shot by Doctor Stanton. Both died, and the shooting was set up by the Lt Governor, as a way for his getting into the Governor's mansion.</fullReview>

The novel seems to be so great that was even filmed in the Soviet Union. The director of the new one Steven Zaillian is very proud he didn't saw the first movie but I guess he saw the Soviet one because he made it by the Russian rules - if there is a gun it should fire till the end. That made the story too predictable. Other similarity to the Soviet cinema - slow and boring. Also I didn't see the great fall of Stark brought by his power that was described in the reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"All the King's Men" was way too slow and tedious. The movie could have been 90 minutes and been much better. Too many scenes drug on and on and I found myself saying "OK, I get the point.". I saw this movie in the afternoon at a local megaplex and I was the only one in the theater. I fell asleep in the middle of the movie it was so slow. There were some good performances from Jude Law, Anthony Hopkins and Patricia Clarkson. Mark Ruffalo was wasted. Kate Winslet was good but it seemed she was very restrained. She did do a quick nude scene but she often does nude scenes. She must think she has a wonderful body. I do. Anyway, the movie, yes, it was slow and there was Sean Penn. There was a Sean Penn to chew up the scenery and dominate every frame he was in. I think he is a good actor but he seems to need to overact and fill the screen. Jude Law did much more with his quiet glances and stares. Sean Penn was too much for the role. True the role of Willie Stark calls for a larger than life figure but Sean Penn was large all of the time even in scenes where less would have been more. He was too much too often. I didn't care for him in his role and felt nothing for his fate. Speaking of his fate, the end of the movie was excruciatingly slow and ponderous. I saw the original version and I knew what was about to happen and I just wished they would get it over with. And the blood rivulets, cut me a break, get to the point! I was standing and straining to leave the theater at this point. To be fair I'll mention the good points. Kate Winslet did a quick nude scene. The movie was nicely atmospheric and well photographed. Some scenes worked well and, as mentioned, some performances were good. The actor who played Sugar Boy, Willie Stark's bodyguard, was played, well, by Jackie Earle Haley who was Moocher in "Breaking Away".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, i'm going to make this quick. First off, I see no reason to discredit the actors. Penn made a very believable politician, indeed several times I felt like jumping up and clapping with the "hicks" from the film. Jude did a good job, I see no reason why people dislike his acting, he created your standard journalist, and his reactions were just like a detached persons would be. Kate Winslet, one of my favourite actresses, did a good job, not at all her best but for most others this would have been their masterpiece. Secondly, this movie really made me feel as if I was in the south. All the accents were extravagantly put on, and the scenery and setting all made you believe. On a closing note, go see this movie and don't believe the buggers telling you it sucked.</fullReview>

The story is interesting, but doesn't know what to focus on and all in and all it is a preposterous movie that should have been better conceived. The film is also a perfect example as to why a faithful adaptation rarely means a good film as they're two different mediums that work in different ways. That said,the cinematography is fine. Penn is still fun to watch. His character is complex enough. However, the film almost forgets about him. Though Hopkins is great, too. This is another bad flick in which he has some amazing scenes. And another great idea for that simply doesn't carry out. Though due to the political stuff and various characters this film is probably one of the more interesting ones out there, but I would rather shoot my foot than see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie didn't have budget enough to do justice to Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men.The writer-director is new at the game and it shows.Sean Penn either weighs 240 pounds in the movie or is padded to appear as though he weighs that much. Penn gives a scenery-chewing performance that is so overwrought it unbalances the film. His hairdo puts me in mind of the one Eric Blair AKA George Orwell wore in his heyday.Trouble is, the hairdo features white sidewalls around the edge. So when Penn as Willie Stark puts on a fedora, as he often does in the film, he is not recognizable as the same Willie Stark sans hat. Its a major gaffe. A more seasoned Director would have found a way around this.Penn indulges himself in wild gestures even when talking to the person right next to him.Stark blows his stack throughout the film. The other performances are more low key, so the Willie speeches jar the audience and undo the quieter moments in the film. The accents. Sean Penn's Willie is impossible to understand for the first third of the film. Jude Law's Jack Burden the reporter, is only a shade off his usual British accent. Not really American. Willie is romancing his woman aide Virginia Clarkson, in addition to his wife, a skater-stripper, and the Judge's daughter. The judge's daughter is played by Kate Winslet. She's an Aussie. The Judge is played by Anthony Hopkins. Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) has a thankless role as a political handler. Both Winslet and Hopkins are totally understandable but not particularly Louisiana accented. Patricia Clarkson is FROM New Orleans, but doesn't particularly have an accent.The screenplay is a mess. There is no time for Willie to actually have the romances with the women. They are only alluded to. What is really missing though is a sense of the crowd, the base of any political film. Willie is never down among them, always above them talking over their heads. You have to hear something representative from the crowd to know what they're thinking. Apart from some sour looks, the film never gives a sense of who the voters are. The film needs to be opened up in the way stage-locked plays often are when converted to movies. Instead of being a movie about a gargoyle in Louisiana politics, this film instead becomes a story about an insular group of political people infighting and romancing one another. The film lacks the necessary sense of the crowd that brings politics alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Penn Warren's "All The King's Men" is an enormously compelling novel, but the film is not. With a stellar cast of Sean Penn, Anthony Hopkins, James Gandolfini, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Patricia Clarkson, and Mark Ruffalo, one expects to see brilliance on screen. Instead, this tale of seedy avarice and back water bayou political intrigue is frankly, boring. I enjoy a complex story told well and with everything seeming to go for it, this film just could not keep my attention. I tried watching it on six separate occasions but found myself being put to sleep or become distracted by feeding the cat.With such a strong acting talent and compelling story of politician Huey Long disguised as Warren's anti-hero, Willie Stark, it would seem the right actor was cast in Sean Penn. However, his is a poor man's Snidley Whiplash performance. Jude Law as Jack Burden, a reporter, seems to be miscast as the innocent "sweet talker" for the pushy Stark, but in every scene, his physical resemblance to the child actor, Dakota Fanning becomes so distracting that one begins to imagine she must surely be his love child with the number of close ups of Mr. Law's attractive face. Even Sir Antony Hopkins doesn't seem comfortable in the role of the judge with a past to be discovered by Law and this is odd given his considerable reputation. In fact, none of the cast have much credibility in their roles outside the beautiful character actress, Patricia Clarkson as Stark's right-hand gal Friday, and Saturday night, and Sunday morning assistant. Kate Winslet is nude to show she's not "that fat" and so where is the big love scene between she and Willie Stark. This is an adult film with what amounts to a PG rating, very odd given this time period and the amount of salaciousness provided by Willie Stark's mistresses. Good production values and locations provide a sampler tour of Louisiana, with excellent dowdy costumes and old Cadillac cars aplenty. Perhaps the fault ultimately must lie with the director who simply let the story get away from him. Perhaps he was too in awe of his cast or the bigness of the story by Penn Warren. Whatever the cause, All The Kings Men is sadly, gone with the windy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Zaillian read the novel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ** Spoilers I'll be honest. I love the Robert Penn Warren so much any film version is bound to disappoint. All The Kings Men is the best American political novel. But it is almost impossible to develop the complex themes in the novel into a two hour movie. It's a lot easier to make it a story about the rise and fall of a corrupt politician. Maybe the only way to film ATKM is as a TV miniseries over numerous episodes like Roots or Centennial. But I know that ain't going to happen.There are two good things about this movie. One is the wonderful cinematography. This movie looks good and captures the feel of Louisiana. Second, the movie makes this Jack's story as much as Willie's. Stark's rise and death is the vehicle for Jack to accept the truth of the past so he can accept the future.Now the bad. First is a problem with every movie set in Louisiana that uses non-native actors ? the accents. They would have been better off doing what Warren did, don't identify the state as Louisiana. At least that way the actors would only have had bad southern accents instead of horrible Louisiana accents. There are a lot of accents in Louisiana beyond the Creole and Cajun accents most actors attempt. Yet no actor ever manages to hit on one authentic accent.Second, Sean Penn does not have the physical build to play Stark. Gandolfini would have been a better Willie (if he didn't have to speak) just as John Wayne would have looked the part in 1949. They tried to pad Penn to look bigger than he is but you never get the feeling Willie is someone you don't want to cross because he can crush you.Third, why did they move the setting from the Depression era to the 1950's? Stark (and Huey Long) were products of the Depression and could not have risen to power the way they did in the 1950s. Post-war America was hardly the breeding ground for a fascist politician like Long I guess they couldn't find enough cars from the early 30's.Fourth, Willie's rise from a dumb hick to Governor is too quick. Better to have followed the novel and have Stark lose that first election. Here he goes from country bumpkin to gold throated orator in a blink. Next thing you know he's the governor, cheating on his wife and running a corrupt political machine. Gee, that was easy.My biggest problem is with Jack's character. He's not the amoral slug as portrayed by Jude Law. If Zaillian wanted to be more faithful to the novel, Jack would have been a willing participant in Willie's plan. Jack hated all those people from Burden's Landing that were friends of his mother and the judge and those were the people Stark was going after. Jack was more than willing to help. Law just seems to work for Willie because he's got some time on his hands. The importance of discovering the judge was his real father and how it changed his life after Willie's death is completely ignored Zaillian has written some great screenplays but unless you've read the book this movie will leave you scratching your head. Like the novel, it uses flashbacks but they only serve to disrupt the story. Jack and Anne's relationship, vital to so many subplots, is told in incomplete and useless flashbacks. Their relationship is important to Adam's actions at the end. And while I have no problem with a film using voice-overs, Law's voice-overs are as useless as the flashbacks. They seemed to be tacked on in post production in an attempt to have the movie make some sense. They failed.I guess the fault for this mess belongs to Zaillian since he directed and wrote the screenplay. But when I saw all the associate producers and producers it was clear there were way too many cooks making this soup. It probably would have been better to have one strong producer and a bunch of directors (think Gone With The Wind).If Zaillian read the novel he must have had trouble with comprehension. The heart of the novel is missing. Willie and Jack's redemption are ignored so the movie just ends in a bloody shootout. And even that wasn't the way Warren wrote it.For a movie that had a lot of Oscar buzz early on, this is a major disappointment. It's not as bad as some of the drek the studios put out but then again it was aiming a little higher than Jackass 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King's Men: Fake accents and no featured Blacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I write from south of the Mason-Dixon Line. Look it up - it's the American South, which starts "all the way up" at the Maryland-Pennsylvania border. I find All the King's Men rather laughable, maybe to keep from crying. Its major cast line-up touts Anthony Hopkins, who is English, and Sean Penn, in a film "loosely based" on the life of major southern populist politician Huey Long of Louisiana. Yet among the film's top eight or so cast whose photos I see featured online, none are Black American actresses or actors. Then there's the film's northern U.S. cultural imperialism and regional colonialism with its assumed "superiority". With generation after generation of poor-to-mediocre media portrayals of the U.S. South, aren't filmmakers (in Hollywood and elsewhere) and viewers as TIRED as some of us of movie-making that casts persons obviously FAKING Southern speech in the roles of Southern characters? During casting, WHO IS IT who apparently considers Southerners "not good enough" to portray themselves?? Spare all of us - for once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie just doesn't make it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sound track is awful and the movie's time frame is all wrong. This movie is set in the early 1950's but contains no historical landmarks to connect it with that period of time. By the early 1950s the populist politician who was part rabble rouser, part priest and part charlatan stomping across the countryside was already a thing of the past. It's post World War Two, it's the Cold War, the "hicks" are leaving the country for the city, the civil rights movement is already beginning to pick up momentum and television is already on the scene. None of this is mentioned in this movie. Also, the movie's main character, Willie Stark, is so utterly unlikeable that his exit from the movie brings relief, not from the fact that he is deceased because, despite his demagoguery Willie really didn't deserve what he got, but because it meant that it was just a matter of time before this ponderous, overblown movie would be rambling to its inevitable and inglorious end. If you want to watch this movie, do so, but don't expect a classic movie because this movie just doesn't make it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film I was primed to see. Based on the fabled populist Huey Long, great writer, cast etc I was ready to be wowed.The movie starts a little mysteriously - so far so good - and soon introduces us to a small town politician- Sean Penn playing Willie Stark - the Long character. Loads of atmosphere of Louisiana in the 50's - or is it the 30's? - only the cars set the era for us.Tony Soprano with a strange accent persuades Stark to run for governor - tho his true motive is disguised from us for a while.Jude Law plays an effete journalist (Jack Burden) who becomes ensnared in Stark's campaign - and he's so above the fray his expression barely changes - and he's probably the most convincing actor in the film.Penn chews the scenery with mighty abandon, but we never see him connect with the "Hicks" whom he claims as his own,and, once he comes to power, the movie fails to let us know if he's a good man who uses graft for the good of the people, or if he's a simple man corrupted by power who rapes the coffers for his own benefit whilst spouting arm-waving rhetoric to keep "the people" riled up and on his side.In addition, it's unclear whether the protagonist is the Penn character or the Jude Law character - who is also seduced by his proximity to power. Law's character is also tangled in a familial and social web that conflicts with his cynical loyalty to Stark that leads to the betrayal of his father figure - played by Anthony Hopkins - who makes the wise choice of not even attempting a Louisiana accent. There's a plot strand about Burden's teenage sweetheart (Kate Winslet) that's just daffy - which you know the editor kept urging director Zaillian to cut - but there it sits eliciting groans.And then the ending (which we all see coming for 5 minutes) - metaphor piled on symbolism layered with clich. It's not a spoiler to say that after the Mississippi runs with blood, the movie still doesn't know when to stop.There's a great movie in this material - and it won an Oscar in 1949. And I see every reason to remake it for a contemporary audience. My guess is that director Zaillian fell in love with writer Zaillian's words and failed to find the essence of each scene and the heart of the story.I wanted to love it, and hung in for about an hour, then just gave in to the leaden directing and the hammy acting. Save 10 bucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Can't help but be disappointed in what was to be the first of this year's Oscar contenders. Director and usually great screenwriter Steven Zaillian takes on a quasi-remake of the 1949 classic based on Robert Penn Warren's novel. Loosely based on Huey Long and Louisiana politics, this version is placed in a different era altogether, and because of that, loses some of its powerful message.An incredible cast is assembled, though, most had me scratching my head by the mid-point. Rarely do you find so many Brits and Jersey boys faking a bayou accent. At least Sir Anthony Hopkins just muffles his normal speech pattern rather than go full out southern. Jude Law, on the other hand, just seems totally out of place in most every scene save those with Kate Winslet (who herself seems misplaced). The great Patricia Clarkson (actually from Louisiana) is totally underutilized as compared to Mercedes McCambridge's stellar performance in the original. The reduction of the role is evidently what led Meryl Streep to drop out. Mark Ruffalo, James Gandolfini and Kathy Baker are also given little to do, but don't miss Eileen Ryan (Sean Penn's real life mom) as Lily Littlepaugh and Jackie Earle Haley ("Bad News Bears") as Penn's bodyguard. Haley will also be seen in an upcoming fall release "Little Children". Nice to see him back on screen after 13 years! Of course, as with the original, the movie belongs to Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford in the 1949 version). Sean Penn, one of the top 3 American actors, dives full body and soul into this role, but it is not quite enough to save the film. His performance did keep me interested enough, but the change in era and lack of focus on Stark's grass roots efforts took some of the edge from the film. Penn's performance is over the top, but it must be in order to capture the fascination that is Willie Stark.My guess is much of the film was left in the editing room as much of the story line regarding Winslet and Ruffalo made little sense and there was a tremendous amount of Clarkson's character that was reduced to a facial expression or knowing glance.The sets and costumes are excellent and the score (James Horner) and music (TBone Burnett) are wonderful compliments, but the script and direction falls short and does not capture the power of the original and really is a bit of a mess as far as the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife wanted to go see this movie. She has great patience. So, I was very surprised when she suggested we leave the theatre, which we did. I think there was only a few minutes left in the film, if that is any indication of how this movie is weary and drawn out. We're the type to stay and watch the very last of the credits of even the most mediocre movie. I can't recall having left a movie in years.What's interesting is that I have to leave 10 lines of text for a review here on IMDb. This is much like the movie. The movie suffers from lack of editing or the failure of anyone to yell 'cut!' on the set. Someone must have told the producers it had to fill 4 reels or it wouldn't be quality. This paragraph isn't really needed to aid in this review is just seems required.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, despite no promising reviews, I did kind of want to see All the King's Men, it had a great cast and over all a good looking story. I figured though to wait for the rent, none of my friends really wanted to see this and I didn't want to see it alone, so I just watched it with my mom this afternoon and I kept dozing off, and it's not because I didn't get a good night's sleep, I tell you! Because my mom even agreed with me that she had a hard time keeping up with the story and wasn't really too interested.Well, it's about this guy, didn't catch his name nore do I think I wanted to, but he is displeased with the way things are being run in his southern state despite some really bad accents. Well, he does get elected and makes incredible promises to the "hick" people, I didn't appreciate getting "hick" screamed at me five million times. But he makes those promises and finds them hard to keep after he is elected and becomes greedy, what a bad bad man.Well, at least that's what I gathered, I swear I made it through 98% of the movie, because a couple times I slightly dozed off. I really don't blame the actors that much, but it was the screen play, the direction, and the story just couldn't keep my interest and I can see why it doesn't have a decent rating on IMDb, the viewers were right, and honestly, I cannot see anyone really loving this film 100%, just trust me on it.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the 17 September comment and found several others that mimic the same mantra. "Movie-goers who didn't like the film hate Sean Penn."First we have to make the assumption that these Penn-haters have decided to spend at least twelve dollars to watch someone they hate for two hours.Don't you think you might be a bit presumptuous to play political strategist here? Certainly some enjoyed the film that Penn has poured millions into - much of which went to pay the salaries of the star power that might have outclassed his own performance, but that doesn't translate to the tastes of the rest of the world.I happen to think that the film was a pretentious and self-absorbed showcase for himself and the amazing star power he surrounded himself with was insulation or, insurance if you will, that frankly wasn't enough to salvage his awful characterization.I happen to be from Louisiana (which is precisely where the story is based on) and his characterization of a Southern gentleman was comical. Even an over-the-top politician in the South still carried himself with style back then as now. The accent... well, that's just embarrassing.For technical achievement and supporting roles, I didn't think the film rated any less than a three but I certainly wouldn't presume to alert the film-going public that there is some sort of IMDb anti-Penn conspiracy. It's more likely a bunch of people who just came home from paying thirteen dollars for an over-hyped movie that didn't deliver -- and that my friend is why it fizzled and we have very little about the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"All the King's Men" is a decent film geared towards adults who are willing to give this film their undivided attention. This is not a popcorn flick! I'm surprised this film got such poor reviews. This film takes a lot more effort than most. It is very verbose; everybody talks in a Southern drawl; and the dialog is spewed as prose. Watching this film is more like watching a play than most films.The acting is the best reason to see this film. The supporting roles are done by actors that are usually in starring roles. Sean Penn really hams it up as the politician. Kate Winslet probably gives the best performance in the film. Everyone in this film is good.Compared with other films out in the theaters right now, "All the King's Men" is not as entertaining as "Little Miss Sunshine" or "The Illusionist." It's better than the period films I've seen the past 2 weeks, "The Black Dahlia" and "Hollywoodland." If you are willing to put forth the effort to listen to the dialog, "All the King's Men" is a decent alternative to the usual type of film that has been coming out recently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Must see movie: All The King's Men wherein Sean Penn and the company create Louisiana politics a la Huey Long is a spell-binder. Sets, script and performances are superb. Jude Law is the obverse of the coin; the witness, the roused writer. Cinema photography skill evident, breathtakingly accurate rendition of the times; the nature of man where struggle for power defines politics is a game like no other. Stark's stating who the greedy are as oil companies and others is timely for today's corporate leaching. Familiar, that. Penn plays Stark as fearless and susceptible to females who cause his eyes to spin. Penn has an insight into this character and his take is true, spot on. I needs purchase the DVD because despite breath holding, I missed minutia and must see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not pay money to see this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to receive tickets to the screening of this movie at the Toronto Film Festival. Needless to say, the red carpet was amazing...it is, after all, an Oscar-winning cast. Obviously, I stayed to see the film. I should have left.All The King's Men is a well-rehearsed, well-rounded story. Unfortunately, it takes only fifteen minutes of the movie's painfully long running time to tell said story. A wagon load of fluff and pointless narrative was what filled in the rest. Again and again, I pondered the casting director's reasoning that the sheer number of British actors was necessary to tell this Louisianna story, especially when Jude Law hadn't yet seemed to master the accent. The man next to me was chin-to-chest asleep, and I found I could keep my eyes closed for long periods of time without missing anything.SPOILER COMING.At the very end of the movie, Mark Ruffalo's character shoots Sean Penn's character repeatedly before getting shot himself. Every time a shot rang out, my smile grew. I couldn't have been happier that the movie was ending.For those who don't know, at the end of TIFF movies there is a standing ovation. Then, the lights in the VIP balcony are turned on, so the cast, director and producer can stand up and receive the applause. This is normally met with emotional tears and lots of flashbulbs. That night, there was a light smattering of applause (which I refused to partake in) before a mad rush for the exits. The lights in the box never went on. My theory is that the cast and director bolted when they realized everyone in the room wanted to kill themselves out of sheer boredom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply....dreadful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others have mentioned, the characters are miscast. Sean Penn fails miserably in this role. His gesticulating and god awful accent renders him incoherent through most of the movie. It makes me wonder why they didn't slap a wig on Gandolfini and have him play Willie Stark. Penn's mangled utterances of Willie Stark's dialog, direct from the novel, fails so miserably that by the end of the movie it's darned near painful to watch. Why didn't director Zaillian consider Patton Oswalt in the role of Stark? I know many of you are thinking whaaaa? But Oswalt could have excelled in this role and he looks the part. He could have brought equal parts drama (see "Big Fan") and comedy to the Stark character. And that's one thing the film suffered from is a lack of humor, which the novel has plenty of.As for Jude Law as Jack Burden? What the heck? Mark Ruffalo, a fine actor, should have got the lead (and Jack Burden is the lead character). Instead, we see Law sleepwalking through the film. Patricia Clarkson should have been Lucy Stark instead of Sadie Burke. And why was there only one scene with Lucy Stark in the movie? She's an integral aspect to the novel, yet Zaillian couldn't really fit her in at all. I believe Helena Bonham Carter could have provided the spunk and gravity for Sadie Burke.Zaillian cherry-picked the novel to adapt for the big screen. And this was a monumental feat because Robert Penn Warren's classic proves difficult to adapt. In 2hrs no one could possibly get to the meat of the novel. Lacking in the film is Burden's previous experience as a grad student studying history. History is elemental to the novel's main theme, which Zaillian butchered. It's almost as if the director didn't even read the novel or skipped over many, many fine portions.One of the most disappointing scenes is the film's opening. Penn Warren provided the classic hook in the first 40 pages of the novel that could easily have been adapted to film. Picture the tires of a black Cadillac cruising over the white lines of a black top highway, the roar of the engine, and just about the time you figure out what's happening, you see Sugar Boy's .38 nestled under his left armpit, followed by his stuttering of the word "B-b-b-b-bas-tud!" just about the time he weaves the caddy between two automobiles (the only spot on casting was for the role of Sugar Boy). From that point the film should have showed a Governor Stark arriving in his hometown, Mason City, as if it were the second coming of Christ. In Zaillian's re-telling of the tale, we get no sense of how popular the populist Stark is, but Penn Warren captured it beautifully in that first chapter. We also get a sense of how paranoid he is and how he's fighting to hold on to the political machine he has built. We get no sense of this in the movie...Zaillian instead misinterprets Stark as a second-rate dictator.Zaillian's time span is way, way off. His Stark dies in 1954, whereas the novel's dies in 1935. That's crucial to the rise of a populist--that Great Depression time frame. For this there is no forgiving Zaillian. Perhaps the movie producers had a hard time recreating the 1920s and 1930s South for the film and thus relied on a later time line, but that makes the film ahistorical because there's no discussion of World War II and it's legacy on the South--and how the Second World War invigorated the nascent black freedom struggle in addition to galvanizing white resistance. Any political leader South of DC had better hate blacks in this era or else there'd be no public office, and Zaillian's lack of basic U.S. history is evident in his retelling of this classic novel.More idiotic pieces of the film reveal how stupid the director was, i.e. the funeral for the three kids from "hick-town" indicates their Catholicism, yet in the novel there'd be few Catholic funerals. Only South Louisiana is Catholic. Fictional Mason City is in the heart of Protestant South. Moreover, only South Louisiana has graveyard tombs above ground, not the northern fictional town of Mason City.One scene rendered Zaillian's idiocy in his vision of the film--when Stark sings "Every Man A King" at the radio station. First of all, it's not in it's proper historical context, coming after World War II rather than the depression. Zaillian's retelling discounts the nascent Cold War when few politicos could have attained public office with a share-the-wealth kind of platform. Just look at what happened to Henry Wallace. In addition, Penn Warren's Stark is not Huey Long, but modeled after a Huey Long kind of figure, and the South had many of them, namely Theodore Bilbo in Mississippi, Eugene Talmadge in Georgia. Stark sang no "Every Man A King" in the novel, and so why does Zaillian include this in the film. Or, why on earth did Zaillian overtly set the film in Louisiana when the novel is ambiguous about it's setting, even calling Mason City the "county-seat" of Mason COUNTY (Louisiana has parishes).Zaillian's splicing together of certain scenes is mind-bogglingly bad. Aside from dreadful casting and shoddy organization, this film should have claimed a Razzy. The audience gets no sense of the stakes, of what Stark is up against, of why they hate him so much. Stark's admirers come off as impoverished dupes of a dictatorial madman played by Sean Penn. We don't even get an idea of how a Willie Stark could go from bumbling and idiotic country do-gooder to raving madman in six short years from Zaillian's retelling.Please, Hollywood, find a director who can make it a mini-series--which would be the only way it could be adapted with some coherence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few films if any, fortified with a Pulitzer Prize, Academy Award story and a multi award winning all star line-up for a cast has fallen flat on it's face as this remake of All the King's Men. The 49 upset best picture winner featuring a limited minor actor in the lead lacked pedigree and budget and seemed ripe for a glossy makeover that would give this tale of political demagoguery, tightly based on the rise and fall of Louisiana Senator Huey Long, the lavish stage it long deserved. They should never had raised the curtain. From box to wire this torpid, bombastic, poorly paced, badly acted piece of tripe can't get out of it's own way as it slogs through its own self importance.Let's start with the ensemble amateur night performances by the cast. Sean Penn as Willie sounding a bit like Randy Newman and moving like Joe Cocker shifts between incomprehensible and incoherency dropping syllables along the way. As Penn slurs on its evident he couldn't get his dog to fetch never mind motivate the citizenry. To compensate for Penn's grunts director Steven Zaillian ham handedly employs a pompous music score to underscore Willie's charisma as well as the nobility of the project.Jude Law's career nosedive continues as the protagonist narrator. He turns Warren's poetic prose into mere prattle with meandering inflection and is so weak in presence he threatens to become the first actor in film history to vaporize before your eyes. James Gandolfini as corrupt aide is all Southern fried Soprano, Kate Winslet sleepwalks through her role and bloated Anthony Hopkins does his contemplative man of wisdom with a slight accent nuance for the tenth film in a row.In addition to bad acting and a lumbering pace Director Zaillian also gets low marks for pedestrian camera angles and a couple of moronic plot devices such as Willie's changing hair style to denote his education and rise and the film's mawkish climactic scene where blood is enjoined between antagonists. It evokes D.W. Griffith from 90 years back. Stale and out of touch.Over half a century later I'll vote for the the grubby Broderick Crawford's Willie over the far more gifted Penn's. It all comes down to believability and soul not gloss and histrionics which in this case old "10-4, 10-4" wins by a landslide. An unmitigated disaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not work for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this film did not work for two main reasons: The first was that the screen play and script did not transpose from novel to film. They were fuzzy and clichd and completely un-life like. The script was like a series of motherhood statements from the book rather than what people would really say. The actors certainly did their best and the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Robert Penn Warren (which I have not read) no doubt was very well written but it was to no avail.The second was the complete miscasting of Sean Penn as Willie Stark in the lead role. I must admit that I am not a real Penn fan and on the contrary to what his co-actors said I believe his repertoire is very limited. I watched this film on DVD and enjoyed the bonus material much more than the film itself. The piece on Governor Huey Long upon which the book was based was totally absorbing and just watching Long for a few minutes was far more gripping than the 128 minutes of Penn's swaggering overacting.One thing that did attract my attention with Long was his uncanny resemblance to actor John C Reilly and I am sure that this actor would have been far more effective in Penn's role. What a shame, this had all the makings of a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Jude Law gave the best performance in the movie. He was genuinely good and I thought an interesting character. Hopkins was also good. There is a scene where Burden bring Stark to Hopkins' house and Hopkins gives Law this look that in very memorable. It was kind of like "How or why could you bring him here." I agree with a lot of the criticisms. Was it really necessary to have Kate Winslet shot like an angel or something? There is nothing bad about her performance though. The idea of representing Stark's political corruption through his personal life and not by signing any dirty deals was not the right thing to do. The movie doesn't let you go into how Stark got corrupt. You are told that he is going to put the fall on Ruffalo but you are never shown that.What I also thought was good was the scene where the hospital opens and Stark gives a really gung ho speech. That score was excellent as was Sean Penn. I liked when he brought Ruffalo out to raise his hand. I can see why they would break that up and make it a pivotal scene because it was great.In the original ATKM the scene where Stark is shot is very shocking and there is a scream that makes the scene feel very real, in this version the color is drained from the scene and its in slo-mo and it's all very studied and calculated lacking the originals shock value.I think I would give this like a C+ or B- mostly C+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 5-hour story pushed into 2 hours of film: a recipe for tragic failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to admit, Steve Zaillian probably tried the best he could. But why exactly did it fail? Several reasons. For one, the film was stuffed with big names. Big names that all want a part. Which means that, unless you make a 4 or 5 hour film, their characters will get little to nothing background. As I read earlier somewhere around here: I didn't care a single bit for the characters. Only two of them were really developed: Willie and Jack.The others? They just hung there, as an ornament. Patricia Clarkson? I still haven't got a clue what she actually did. Kate Winslet? Ornament, in a side storyline of Jack's youth, and who all of a sudden got dragged in as well and was all of a sudden paid by the governor and slept with him. Why? We are left in the dark. Mark Ruffalo? Ornament. Why did Willie Stark wanted Ruffalo? We are left in the dark once again. Oh yes, he was the son of the great governor Stanton. That's it? That's all? And, to top it all off, isn't it just a great coincidence that both of them are characters from Jack's youth, so we have ourselves another storyline that distracts us from the main story line. Ruffalo, Winslet and Hopkins for that matter: perfectly good actors, who were wasted in a movie that wanted to do to much. Too much pretty pictures, too much dramatic music, too much smart lines of dialogue, too much quasi-poetic voice-over monologue, and tell a story of an up-and-coming politician turning corrupt along the way. And all that within two hours. No wonder that this film holds together just as well as that poor Mason City school.The only thing I could think of, is that Mr. Zailian was under severe pressure of the studio to cut an hour of footage from his film. Which is why I would, one day, like to see the Director's Cut of this attempt of a great film to be released. Might just change my rating of 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the King's Men is a misfire on an epic scale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the King's Men is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Robert Penn Warren, which is a novel that mirrors the life of Huey Long. The movie takes place in the 1950s and is about an honest man named Willie Stark (Sean Penn) who runs for governor of Louisiana presenting himself as a man of the people. His assistant supporter Jack Burden (Jude Law) is a downbeat young journalist who was raised by the trusted Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins). After being elected governor Willie becomes corrupted by the inner powers of politics, the exact thing he was against in the very beginning. Soon Willie is only in it for the fame and glory, and in order to stay in power he orders Jack to dig up dirty details on Judge Irwin's past to gain him as a supporter. When Jack goes back to talk things over with Irwin, he finds the girl he has loved since a child named Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet). Jack also finds his old best friend Adam (Mark Ruffalo) who is going through a very tough time and is getting very depressed. During all of this Willie Stark only gets more and more corrupt in his power and authority.All the King's Men was made with high production values which shows up in the beautiful cinematography, set pieces, and a big name cast. But despite all this the movie is a complete flop and an epic misfire. The film is not only boring and uninvolving, but is also miscast and overlong and other problems. Jude Law is very boring as Jack Burden, as is Kate Winslet who barely even becomes a developed character. The underdevelopment in the characters also shows up in Judge Irwin, Adam, Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini), and Sadie Burke (Patricia Clarkson). The movie was obviously cast with big name actors so it would be recognized come Oscar season. Among these miscast actors the only one that really shines is Sean Penn who gives a remarkable performance. It was really fun to watch a guy like Sean Penn stand up on a podium and shout how his political views. All the King's Men was written by Steve Zaillian who has written great films such as Schindler's List, Gangs of New York, and American Gangster. But here he fails greatly because the movie just does not work.The script also makes a gigantic error. It was the whole point of the original story that it take place during the Great Depression. The people of Louisiana needed a strong leader to get them out of crisis, so when a politician like Willie Stark came along they really rallied around him and supported him. But this movie is set in the 1950s so there is very little reason for the election of Willie Stark because the citizens are not in crisis. The time line should never have been changed since it now fails to ring true. The characters are boring and I didn't care about a single one of them, save for Willie Stark. The movie also deals with the flat, boring Jack Burden far too much when we I wanted to see more of Sean Penn's performance. Another problem is that the script keeps flashing back to different time line, and not explaining things thoroughly enough to the point where it's confusing and very hard to understand what's going on.All the King's Men is the biggest misfire in a long, long time. The all star cast fails, the script fails, the story fails. The movie also made about 7 million at the box office so obviously people knew to stay away from it. The movie takes a wonderful classic story and drowns it with flatness and zero interest. I give All the King's Men a 1.5 out of 4. I would rather have watched Sean Penn shout about politics and his need to help the people for 2 1/2 hours instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast, lame overblown script, heavy-handed direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn did an excellent job entering the life and mind of Willie Stark, and Jude Law was also very good. The women actors - Kate Winslet, Talia Balsam and especially Patricia Clarkson -- were also great. Gandolfini was Gandolfini. Anthony Hopkins was Anthony Hopkins, not his best work. But the script was over the top, the direction was heavy-handed and mired in bathos. The Louisiana settings were effective, but did they really have to have it rain so portentiously? Lingering shots, stupid montages meant to be heartfelt, and high-school quality profundity at every turn. Yecch to the writer-director. He might want to make a little movie to get down to who he really is. This was phony baloney and pseudo symbolic from the get-go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The storyteller becomes the story down on the Delta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film flopped at the box office in 2006 and it is easy to see why. Despite a fine cast, excellent cinematography, splendid locations, and plenty of money, it simply fails to tell its story. Robert Penn Warren wrote the novel in the 1940s of the rise and fall of the populist politician "Willy Stark", a thinly disguised portrait of Huey "Kingfish" Long, Governor of Louisiana 1928-1932, who fathered a long running political dynasty there ? his son Russell B Long served in the US Senate until 1987. The book provided the story for the academy award winning movie of 1949, written and directed by Robert Rossen. Rossen shifted the focus of the story from the narrator, southern gentleman journalist Jack Burden, towards the demagogic Stark.Here, Stephen Zaillian has put the focus back on Burden and his family, but in doing so has obscured the story of Willie Stark. No satisfactory explanation is given as to how a teetotal political reformer so quickly became a corrupt politician. (Scenes detailing this were cut from the movie and appear on the DVD). For no apparent reason (maybe it was the cars available), this movie is set not in the grim early thirties, but the much more prosperous early fifties.Part of the blame must fall on Sean Penn as Willie. His abysmal diction can be explained by his character being, or pretending to be, one of the common herd (he is meant to have been a lawyer), but only about one word in three comes across clearly. He goes through the film with one fixed grin (and the same suit) ? he might as well have been dead from the start. The other actors were OK ? Jude Law made a suitably cynical Jack and Kate Winslett was good as a crushed southern belle, despite their English origins. Yet another Pom Anthony Hopkins is at his most genial as Judge Irwin. Patricia Clarkson is actually quite good as Sadie, Starke's secretary and lover, and Jackie Earl Hailey ("Little Children") is just brilliant as Stark's loyal bodyguard. James Gandofini, of "The Sopranos" was born to play sleazy characters, and had no trouble as Stark's offsider Duffy.The Deep South locations, especially the antebellum river mansions in the canefields just south of New Orleans, oozed atmosphere (and humidity), as did Huey's vast folly of a State Capitol in Baton Rouge (which still dominates the town). The 1949 film, incidentally, was made in California.Initially the pace is rather slow and too much time is spent is establishing Stark as the honest politician and great declaimer, addressing sundry audiences of working-class stiffs all over the state. Then as the story involving Jack, his ex-girlfriend, her brother and Judge Irwin is cranked up, Stark, having gone crooked without any explanation, becomes merely a supporting character. Jack has started out the storyteller, "but he rises above his principles" as Willy puts it, and finishes up the story.The DVD contains a 10 minute clip of an alternate ending. This is interesting viewing because it completely changes the feel of the movie. A political tragedy becomes a rather misconceived Agatha Christie type mystery. Zaillian did at least get the ending right.In a film of this kind there is always a tension between the personal and the wider political canvas. Robert Penn Warren managed to strike a balance in the novel, but here neither rings true. A lush failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More sophisticated makeover.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Rossen's original black-and-white version was short, sour, and clearly developed. You knew who was who, and where they were and why. The observer was the character of a reporter and later high-end flunky, Jack Burden, played by John Ireland, he of the crowded eyes. The center of the story was the initially innocent Willie Stark, latterly corrupted by power, greedy, selfish, and uncaring, played by the hulking dilapidated Broderick Crawford. No doubt about who was who.This version is MUCH longer, far splashier, more expensive, more nuanced and harder to follow, and the drama seems to have less to do with the kind of power that sends out concentric ripples of malevolence than it does with abrasions caused by personal clashes. It's much more detailed than the sinewy, sometimes overdrawn, original, though I prefer the original.This is more sophisticated too, and I don't mean it cynically. A lot of effort has gone into the script and it doesn't take easy shots or reduce its characters to cartoons. Take the figure of the judge who is at odds with Willie Stark. In the original, he LOOKS like a silver-haired judge -- friendly but a little pompous, marinated in his own rectitude. When a very old bit of misbehavior is uncovered by Jack Burden, the judge collapses like a souffl, goes into his office, and BANG. In this version, the judge is played by Sir Anthony ("Call me Tony") Hopkins, who's never given a stereotyped performance in his life, however dismal the role. Hopkins gives every line an individualized and unexpected lilt. And he's a human being as well as a judge, given to staying up late and fiddling with sinews and wood and making toy ancient weapons like ballista. (They're put to good use in the script.) The judge's suicide, like so many other important incidents, takes place off screen and Burden (Jude Law), whose specialty seems to be brooding and boozing, hears about it second-hand from his devastated mother. And -- here's REAL artistic restraint for you -- Kate Winslet is Jack's girl friend, seduced later by the magnetic Willie Stark (Sean Penn). The youthful and inexperienced Jack and his girl love one another and at one point she leads him into her parents' empty house, undresses and climbs into the bed, waiting for him, a little frightened. (The movie is set in post-war America and premarital sex was not taken for granted.) And what does Jack do? He watches wordlessly, then backs out of the room, the purity of his love, the knowledge that if they share their bodies they lose the innocence that's held them together, preventing him from doing what any second-tier screenplay would have him do. In any other movie he'd jump her bones and there would follow sixty seconds of writhing flesh, lips meeting, fingertips caressing unidentified body parts, she gets on top and then underneath, and maybe a few incoherent moans of ecstasy -- one notch above a whining. "Oh, BABY!" Instead the script remains true to Jack Burden's character. The scene and the script reflect Burden's youthful idealism without having to tell us anything out loud.Working against it -- well, the movie IS rather long and dark and there are some longueurs when we find it hard to follow just whose conniving with whom, especially when so much of the conniving is not spelled out for us. Sean Penn's character of Willie disappoints too. There aren't enough scenes of the young, stupid Willie. And Sean Penn, through his mannerisms and his sly glances, suggests that Willie is pretty slimy from the very beginning, which at least Broderick Crawford did not. And even after his corruption, Sean Penn doesn't come across as a charismatic redneck politician. And his Southern accent at times is almost indecipherable. Broderick Crawford made his first rabble-rousing peroration after a bit of the hair of the dog during an unfamiliar but horrible go-to-hell hangover. In the original Burden slips Willie a few gulps of whiskey that cuts through his suffering and blows his safety valve. It's understandable that he should then for the first time explode in a rabble-rousing speech that grabs his low-brow audience. But here, Willie simply seems to decide to change his style strictly based on some half-voiced hints given him the night before. It's far less dramatic and, worse, it turns the dynamics confusing. It seems like Willie has made a cool strategic decision rather than letting loose a salvo of half-drunken rage. (The musical score tells us that this speech is supposed to flatten us. The score is triumphant with heavenly overtones, as if Willie were about to KO an opponent in the boxing ring.) The location shooting is evocative. Poverty is never fun to look at but can sometimes be picturesque. New Orleans may have the most picturesque poverty in any city this side of Europe. Everything seems to be melting while it rots. In the Bronx, poverty has an abrasive texture, as of brick and slivers of broken glass.All the weaknesses aside -- the muddiness, the sometimes faulty casting, the clumsy editing -- it's a movie made for adults rather than kids looking for thrills and needs to be recommended for that alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolute garbage. I had to go to blockbuster for five straight days to get a copy, so I figured it must be decent. However, this film reminded me of an important lesson: don't be misled by an all-star cast.In regards to the writing...I'm not sure how to put it. The dialog was good - subtle but to the point - and the speeches (given by Penn) were very interesting. However...another aspect to writing is the ability to write a good story. The twists in this film were dull and expected. There was very little explanation of the relationship between the lead character (Jude) and the Judge (Hopkins), or at least not enough scenes to create the illusion of a credible adopted father/son relationship.Also...Jude's character plays the accidental/amateur detective in this story under the employment of Penn. However that aspect of the story was poorly done (even though it had a lot of potential).As I mentioned...this film did have some merit (thus...the 3). Sean Penn was magnificent (and I don't really know his politics). It was interesting to see his transition from this honest man running for office to a corrupt official. That is what the director should have focused on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The novel is an American classic. It could well be considered the American 'MacBeth'. In the hands of this production, it becomes a hollow adaptation, floundering in a cine noir palette with an overly operatic score. I think the direction is terrible. The long pauses are ineffectual and boring. The cinematography is labored. Sean Penn is a good Willie Stark. However, Jude Law's Jack is flat beyond belief. Kate Winslet is wasted. Mark Ruffalo is unbelievable as an aristocrat with more than a high school education. Patricia Clarkson shines as always. James Gandolfini does a good devious simpleton. The movie has no heart, despite the mammoth talent. Even Anthony Hopkins couldn't lift this one above the mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long, long time ago back when I was in high school, a teacher, not one of mine, gave me a copy of All the King's Men to read. From page one with a car moving down a highway I was hooked. Over the years, the book has been a favorite. I saw the Broderick Crawford film on TV and always loved the scene early where Crawford is having dinner and eating like a pig foreshadowing the pig he was to become. Now we have the Sean Penn remake and Penn is brilliant, and Jude Law is exceptional as Jack Burdon. So what happened? If you know the novel well, the film is almost flawless. Gandolfini, Hopkins, and Clarkson do some great here. It's the screenplay. It is disjointed: it lacks coherence which is too bad. The actors turn in some of the best performances I have seen. The cinematography is wonderful. Read the book, twice; then watch a fine film. How is it Penn didn't get an Oscar?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authentic immersion into Depression era Populism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pandering populist demagogues will always be with us. Many gain some notoriety. Many remain obscure and out of their time. Marx. an unsanitary, hirsute, disheveled crank in his own time, adopted a hodge-podge of revolutionary theories and gave them a name that lived into the 20th century. We have seen similar characters come and go, with a few who attained power for good or ill. Napoleon the originator of the modern police state, Adolf Hitler, who went mad and ruined Europe. Lenin-Stalin-Trostky destroyers of Russia, PolPot, death of Cambodia. Then there are the ineffectual, the shallow, the drunkards, the canards. Sometimes these real life characters attain some notable success if only regional in nature.Take Willie Stark the literary alter ego of the populist leveler Huey Long. Willie Stark is a study in good intentions and transformation into abusive hubris. The story gives us authenticated glimpses into the curious, repulsive side of southern Demo machine politics, populist corruption, demagogic pandering. Special features on the DVD are a valuable lesson in modern poli-sci. Sean Penn is able to stanch his personal political intensity and give a believable performance. I think the supporting cast, especially Jude law as the narrator.The screenplay is subtle and invites the viewer to think through the experience with the principle characters. I disagree with negative reviews. I was anticipating the story line at every juncture. I thought the narrator Burden's moral decline and the revelation of his relation to Irwin an especially interesting southern twist. Visit the south and see for yourself - there is a distinct culture of corruption and hypocrisy. The place is still brimming over with clan hatreds and populist demagogy like no other American region. Louisiana is a great place to be FROM.This is a tightly scripted, beautifully filmed vignette based on W.P. Warren's great novel. I like the look of the film, the deliberate Cinema Noir qualities are on the whole successful. The authentic scenes and sets are well worth the experience. Yes it is abbreviated as must be all movies from books. Not historically accurate but a well told tale.</fullReview>

Yes I know, he's a sensational actor Mystic River (7.5 out of 10, Assassination of Richard Nixon 5 out of 10)but his liberal point of views always annoy me and no I'm not a democrat or republican. Back to the review: Sean Penn was good but should not of been casted. We always see him get interviewed on T.V about the war and quite frankly this movie gave him an excuse to express his point of views. He got his 2 hours of being the big man.Now it wasn't just Penn that didn't do it for me. Hopkins and Winslett also gave only mediocre performances. That leaves Jude Law with the only well-done performance in the movie.The movie is powerful (especially the ending) and kept me interested for the full length. I won't give you the storyline because it was probably spelled out for you in other post. The movie was pretty good but nothing else.Acting - 6 storyline - 7, editing - 6, directing - 7,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The impediment to this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ALL THE KING'S MEN uses an unfortunate plot device. Instead of showing us the story itself, we have to see the story through the eyes of one of the characters. As usual in these kinds of stories, that character is preachy and not very interesting. The story we thought the movie was going to be about actually only comes in little glimpsesIn this case, that character is Jack Burden, played by Jude Law. Burden is a stereotype of the "man of integrity" who accompanies Penn's Willie Stark on his rise to the top, more to document the dynamics thereof than out of friendship for Stark or out of any sympathy to his goals. He stands by in useless disapproval. We've seen this character many times before; he is John Cusack from CITY HALL and MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, or Adrian Lester in PRIMARY COLORS, Ron Silver in REVERSAL OF FORTUNE, even Matthew McConaughey in TWO FOR THE MONEY.These characters tend to be the result of screenplays written by reporters or written with heavy involvement from consultants who had played minor roles in the actual events depicted. You can always tell this because their character is always cynical and disapproving, and though they hold some lowly post they are considered by their Captain Ahabs to be invaluable....supposedly. They should be minor characters if they are included at all.Although these characters are never the draw, they tend to dominate the stories. They tend to be the protagonists, making the movies about them and their little journeys, rather then being the movies as advertised. Did you think you were seeing a movie about an unusual politician's rise and fall? Surprise, it's about a reporter who hung around and didn't like any of it.They watch the plans and actions of their charismatic masters/father figures with doubt and distaste, though never lifting a finger to affect the situations, until some final impassioned denunciation in the end where they turn their backs and walk away, in some "emotional" scene the author or consultant probably wishes he'd had the guts to actually carry out.If people walked out of this movie, it was because it wasn't the movie they'd went to see. Rather then being about Penn or his interesting rise and fall, it was about a boring, self involved reporter who was in the background. The death knell for the plot happens when Burden attracts a love interest (Kate Winslet). Who cares? The movie derails and goes sailing down a hillside of boredom, as movies driven by these stereotype yawns always do.I give the film a higher rating than expected for the acting and the cinematography. It is a well made film, it just has a dull, boring lead and a distant perspective of the more interesting story that was advertised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story was re-plotted for unfathomable reasons and becomes very hard to follow. With all Sean Penn's power it is amazing that the relationship between Kate Winslet, playing Anne Stanton and Mark Ruffalo, as Adam Stanton, and Jude Law, who played Jack Burden, who somehow was brought up in Judge Irwin's home, and may have been the son of Judge Irwin and Mrs Burdin, but the film leaves that unclear.Judge, Jude and Law confuse matters more, but the writers really messed this great story up. Had they really done their homework, and followed Huey Long's story more closely, they might have made use of Sean Penn's amazing talent at making characters his own.What was the object of the writers? To impose a trifling love story on a great American Tale? Next time, perhaps, they will tell us what George Washington's mistress was doing during the battle of Brooklyn Heights.How do films like this get made? What a waste of talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sorry redo of the 1949 Academy Award Winning film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1940's ROBERT PENN WARREN wrote &amp; won a Pulitzer Prize for writing ALL THE KINGS MEN. It was a fictionalized version of the career of the controversial Governor &amp; then US Senator of Louisiana who was brutally murdered in the forecourt of the capital building in Baton Rouge.(Visitors can still see the bullet holes) That is how much the people of this state loved this man.In 1949 Columbia Pictures filmed the novel &amp; it was nominated for many Oscars &amp; won a few Academy awards. It deserved every one of them.Now we come to this version, granted we have all the same character as the original version, BUT apparently the writer /directot Steve Zallian did not make the same film.The original film was directed &amp; written by Robert Rossen a skilled and careful craftsmen which Mr Zallian is not.Sean Penn attempts the lead role of Willie Stark, Broderick Crawford WAS Willie Stark, Jude Law attempts to do Jack Burdin, He is OK, as usual But JOHN IRELAND was Jack Burden. The same applies for the rest of the cast.There are 2 others I need to mention. James Gandolfino &amp; Anthony Hopkins, there roles are beefed up here,in the original film they are Minor characters as they should be. Sean Penn overacts all over the place, the rest do same or underact. NOW to the major &amp; I mean MAJOR=-----the time frameThis story took place between 1925 &amp; 1935. The writer/director in his ineptness brings this tale to the 1950's. As Mammy in Gone With The Wind said,a few times "taint fittin'---taint fittin'"This is a film of a time period from the jazz age to the mid depression &amp; not a post WW2 story, no how, no way.The film was filmed in Louisiana &amp; does have a southern feel to it to a small degree.The original was filmed in the studio on Gower St. in Los Angeles, &amp; had a southern style(Hollywood version).I doubt that this film will be nominated for any award except the RAZZIES.Rating **1/2 (out of 4) 66 points (out of 100) IMDb 6 (out of 10)note 21/2 star rating is at bottom grade, it has some merit I was just vastly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cliff Notes version of the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a decent attempt to transfer Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer-Prize winning novel to the screen, but I don't see how anyone who had not read the book could have possibly gleaned more than a skeleton of the complex plots of the novel, most of which were introduced but not well developed, from the movie. This rendition would have been much better as a six- or eight-hour made-for-TV mini-series. There are simply too many intertwining stories here to try to cram into a 128-minute film. Acting was excellent, casting was OK, but to have three British actors play leads with mumbled, and sometimes undecipherable, southern accents certainly raises questions about what the producers were thinking! I was also perplexed as to why the time frame was shifted from the 1930's to the 1950's without explanation. Arguably the most brilliant politician of the twentieth century, the real Huey Long's rise to power was based on the discontent of the disenfranchised poor, black and white, in Louisiana during the Great Depression. This same mood was not present after World War II. Sean Penn's portrayal offers the intensity, but not the charisma nor the genius, of the original Governor/Senator Huey Long. Despite other comparisons to the contrary, I think this 2006 translation is far superior to the multiple-Oscar-winning 1949 version, which used only portions of the novel. In sum, I would recommend to anyone who is genuinely interested in this incredible tale of fictionalized actual events that they read Warren's novel, or, even better, T. Harry Williams' outstanding, and also Pulitzer-Prize winning, biography of Huey Long, which, like most true stories, is far more fascinating than any fictionalized version.</fullReview>

How could a film on one of the most colorful politicians in history be so boring? Sean Penn completely fails in capturing the personality and charisma of Huey Long. The fault lies with director Steven Zaillian. His direction is cold and pretentious, he is so wrapped up in visual imagery he completely forgot to add personality to the characters and life to the film. It is disjointed, too many subplots. It is a mess, and a big one. Technically it is good however, the sets, costumes etc. Other than that, a waste.If you want to see a good filmization of All the King's Men, watch the superb 1949 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>?couldn't put this movie together again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least Sean Penn doesn't use *All the King's Men* as another vehicle to showcase his talents for crying on cue.With a down-home accent that needs subtitles more desperately than Mel Gibson's ocker in *Mad Max* needed overdubbing, Penn plays Louisiana politician Willie Stark, a rambunctious gadfly who attempts to usurp power from government corporations and place it back in the hands of the people.Written and directed by Steven Zaillian, *All the King's Men* is not exactly a remake of the 1949 Oscar-winning Robert Rossen-directed film of the same name (starring Broderick Crawford), for Zaillian consulted only Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning source book to craft this film. But that's neither here nor there. I suspect that the original film, book, and real life person whom Willie Stark is modeled after ? Southern populist politician, Huey P. Long ? would mean next to nothing to moviegoers of this generation.Which is why this film is so exhaustingly dull, despite its quality film-making, stupendous performances and sober messages. Cinematography is lush, soundtrack is overbearing and manipulative, and the period evocation (somewhere between the 1930s and 1950s) is ambitious, yet the film's attempts to inveigle relevancy with the political climate of today and coerce a compelling drama from the power struggles of a man none of us particularly care about comes off as futile.In reaching for the stars, the movie lands somewhere in pseudo-Louisiana by way of Britain. Three of the A-Listers - Jude Law, Anthony Hopkins and Kate Winslet - are too ingrown British to convey a sense of Southern ancestry? and let's not even speak of James Gandolfini's New-Orleans-by-way-of-New-Jersey accent? Stark is a small-time politician, pawned into running for Louisiana Governor by Tiny Duffy (Gandolfini, playing some kind of political ? er, gangster) to split votes between the real runners. When Stark realizes this, he goes from apologetic podium patsy to Joe Cocker Gone Wild, appealing enough to the hick demographic with his scared hair and mad dog gesticulations to actually win the gubernatorial seat in a landslide.Stark's "promises to the poor were a declaration of war on the rich" (which is echoed in Michael Moore's *Fahrenheit 9-11*, when he delineates the opposing sides in the "war on terror" as the wealthy leaders of both countries and their own poor), but instead of pursuing this thread, the movie unaccountably shifts focus to Jack Burden (Jude Law, as Stark's unprincipled right-hand man).Law's character did indeed open the film, narrating voice-over, questioning the worth of exposed secrets, so though he is subsumed in the film's first half by Penn's overwhelming charisma, in eventually focusing on him, the film was, in fact, taking the direction it originally foreshadowed.But by then, we're more interested in that politician we're not really interested in.The junkets tell us that Stark becomes the type of elected official he rails against, self-serving and fascist; maybe it was the fact that the movie leaned on us to ally with Stark initially (as James Horner's manipulative score informed us that his early speeches were inspirational rather than raving bonkers) that confuses us into not seeing the change in the man, for suddenly ? he is up for impeachment. Besides the political reasons of funneling too much money out of corporate coffers towards public works (which is not a crime, and only lands Stark in trouble by annoying the politicians whose hedonism has been breached), there seems to be nothing criminal about Stark, except his overtly-gun-wielding bodyguard named Sugar.By the time the movie has ignored Stark out of the leading man role, the eternal war between the enabled and downtrodden has been replaced by the eternal conflict between relevant and inane, as we find ourselves battling through tar to extract any kind of visceral enjoyment from what seem like extraneous sub-plots (Jack Burden blackmailing his own godfather (Hopkins); Patricia Clarkson as Stark's jealous mistress, puling over Stark's other affairs; Burden's unconsummated love affair with Winslet's character, Mark Ruffalo as some kind of meager-living, mourning-faced medical supervisor who allies with Stark against his will). Though all these characters are kept in motion by Stark's megalomania, Stark himself is off somewhere practicing crying on cue.Also distracting were soundtrack impact noises inserted so gratuitously (to accompany passing cars or simple scene changes) that they were a dead giveaway that Zaillian lacked confidence in his story alone keeping audiences awake."Politician" has become shorthand for "bad guy," but I found myself wondering whether the actual Huey Long started out as such an inspirational hurricane, openly decrying his opposition's lies against himself and the public, as Stark does, whilst swearing and calling them sons of bitches. I found it hard to believe that American politics EVER retained that much honesty in its leaders, as modern American politics has become synonymous with duplicity. Does Stark naively discover that in order to do any kind of good, he must dirty his hands? "Ain't nothing a man can do and keep his dignity. The human frame just ain't built that way." Or does he actively seize unwarranted power and exploit people to "rise above their principles" because he is inherently evil? I didn't seem to care either way, my credo always being, Politicians Be Damned. And never trust anyone who can cry on cue.This movie may not "suck" in the conventional sense of the word (*Johnson Family Vacation, House of The Dead, The Parent Trap, et al)*. It is just not everyone's cup of tea. Unfortunately for Zaillian and Penn, I don't drink tea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anthony Hopkins in All the King's Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed with the film for a number of reasons, notably the lack of character development of the main characters and the thunderous music which seemed more suitable to the World at War television series.However, this comment is on one specific actor. Anthony Hopkins is an icon if not a demigod in the world film and we are used to him playing exactly the same character with exactly the same South-of-England accent regardless of whatever film he is in. However, could the Director of this film not induce him to make some linguistic effort to sound as if the character came even generally from the Southern United States if not specifically from Louisiana? Given the excellent accent assumed by Jude Law and the good try by Sean Penn, surely the grand old man could make that small effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely powerful drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had consulted IMDb before watching this movie and I did not know exactly what to expect. I am SO glad I gave this film a chance. To me, it's one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time. The script is remarkably literate and intelligent, the acting is top notch, cinematography, costumes and set design leave nothing to be desired and the direction is as subtle as one could dream of.The story starts as a political drama, but ends up as much more; one could see the entire movie, for example, as a meditation on how life unfolds. It's very poetic, as tragic as human condition, but it is never melodramatic. I am French, so I am certainly not the best of judges as far as local American accents are concerned. Let me just say that I felt Jude Law's accent was perhaps a little too British and that the accent of some other actors (including Sean Penn) was so strong that I was glad I had activated the (english) subtitles on the BD disc.I cannot recommend this movie too much; really! I wish more of what is offered to us on the big screen were of the same quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife had not seen the original of All The Kings Men with Broderick Crawford from way back, so we went to see this 2006 version with Sean Penn and an all star cast. My opinion of this movie was not to good, as it was hard to understand the southern accents, and I think that Sean Penn overacted the part. The part of Judge Irwin was definitely miscast with Anthony Hopkis who is a great actor, but the lack of a New Oleans judge who lived in the south having no southern accent was definitely lacking though the whole picture. It is a shame that the young people of today could not see the outstanding performance by Broderick Crawford. My recommendation is to pass this one by and save yourself the price of a ticket</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was about 2 hours longer then it needed to be. The most interesting points where made during the first thirty minutes of the film and after that it was a like a long drawn out death. This movie was a huge waste of talent. Wtih actors like Penn, Hopkins and Law, to name a few you would think it would definitely be worth seeing. Its as though they had this crap script but has loads of money and thought that by getting a bunch of great actors it would magically be great. sometimes it has known to work but definitely not this time. Even the boom operator seemed to have fallen asleep because the microphone kept coming into shot. I mean, I know Jude Law's tall but Jesus surely not that tall.</fullReview>

The casting - Great actors doesn't mean they're always great for the part. Would it have killed them to find a few actors who could be convincing as Southerners? So much miscast talent. Jude Law, who can be good as the really handsome guy or whatever he does, is totally lost in this role. Loved that Jackie Early Haley.The pace - Deadly. So slow. Such little tension.

		<fullReview>Sean Penn may easily be one of the greatest actors of our times. We thoroughly enjoyed this. This seems to be a life imitates art in reverse (art imitates life). Considering the politics of today, this is a must see. I'd see it again at the theater and will definitely buy it on DVD. It was interesting and poignant to see the Louisiana setting. The accent work done by the actors in the film were very authentic. We have family in Louisiana and can attest to this first hand. Although from time to time I kept having a deja vu with Jude Law, thinking of the character in the film Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (similar tone of voice). Don't miss it - this is a wonderfully engrossing film, it makes you think. How rare is that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I would rate this movie a 'C'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was really slow at certain points and I suspected the director deleted too many scenes from this movie because there were a lot of un-explained questions that left me dissatisfied. First the actors: Sean Penn was good, but he overacted in several scenes (particularly his political campaign scenes). The rest of the British casts delivered the worst Southern accent I've ever heard. James Gandolfini is generally a good author, that's why I couldn't fathom why he chose to use his Soprano voice and accent in this movie.And then the story: The previous reviewer from Canada got it right. We were never shown why Willie Stark changed from good to bad. It was also never shown or explained fully about the nature of Jake Burden's and Anna's relationship, why they didn't end up a couple, and why Anna decided to sleep with Stark. Adam and Jake were supposed to be best friends, or used to be, but it was never explained why or how their friendship turned sour.All in all, I think this movie tried too hard to become as good or even better than the original, it became too self conscious and therefore failed miserably. In the end, this movie became yet another statistic of 'bad remakes'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the story is off track</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a very well acted bad script. The script does not even focus on what I thought was going to be the main character -- Sean Penn. Sean Penn may get a supporting actor Oscar, but unfortunately in a deeply flawed movie.The symbolism is heavy handed and clumsy.I walked out of the movie very disappointed, and a little angry. I was upset because I felt tricked. The movie was supposed to be like the book -- about political corruption, the rise, corruption, and fall of a man. But, the focus was not on Governor Stark. He was only a backdrop to the "real" story. A minor pedestrian story of unrequited love. Give me a break. I kept waiting for the "real" story to start. The only reason I give it as high of a mark as I do is that it is well produced, acted, and shot. It works well at what it tries to do. As an adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's book, it is an abject failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve Zaillian did a masterful job of direction. Each frame of the film looks like a classical painting with the use of light and shadow.This is a real Oscar candidate for Best Director, Best Actor, and Cinematography. I was blown away by the overall look and feel of the film.There are so many themes at work that it will take a second and third viewing for me to completely grasp the interplay between good people who do nothing and bad people who accomplish their greedy motives by building hospitals and roads and schools while at the same time lining their pockets.Its a film about morality, temptation and God. It's also about the "Burden" that comes from losing one's self little by little as you slip deeper and deeper into the pot of boiling water.The film is a primer on what not to do with one's life. Everyone should see it if only for that reason alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Sean Penn Hadn't Decided To Save Katrina Refugees By Piling Them All Into His Dinky Rowboat, I Would Vote For Him in a Lousiana Gubernatorial Race.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the original movie or read the book. I'm sure they're both very good. The only thing that I had some idea about going into this movie was that it was based on the life of Huey Long, the corrupt Louisiana governor from earlier in the last century. Idealistic populists who slowly but surely sink into the pits of political corruption are fascinating characters, and the fictionalized version of Long in the guise of Willy Stark is no exception. I heart Sean Penn. I think he just secured himself another nomination and possible win with this. The only review I've read of this was a scathing, nasty critique by the New York Post, but I have no doubt that they won't be the last publication to claim Penn was "hamming it." It's an absolutely unfair dig to make, especially since the entire character is over the top and practically combusting with energy - hell, it's the qualities that get the guy elected in the first place. Even in scenes where Stark is quietly fuming at the world, glaring at potential detractors and becoming increasingly eccentric and paranoid, it's the same energy he's delivering the stump speeches with all over again. However, Sean Penn is the only good thing in this movie. There really is nothing else to go see this for. The fatal flaw in this movie (and I could probably point to several) is that they decided to tell this story from the point of view of Jude Law's character, a wholly unimpressive beat reporter with a one-dimensional personality. Jude Law's character gets entangled with Willie Stark while he's covering the story of his political ascent for the local newspaper. Through his eyes, we watch Stark rise from a complete unknown in a small town to a corrupt governor on the take. There is absolutely no need whatsoever to have Jude Law's character in this movie. None. You don't need him to tell this story. Stark's sheer presence automatically eliminates the need to have his rise and fall dictated by another character that's not as strong. To make matters worse, there's a ridiculous, needless subplot with Kate Winslet. Now, I love Kate. I can't think of anyone with a better fake American accent on the planet besides Hugh Laurie. But this is (or at least SHOULD) be a story about Willy Stark, not some ridiculous love interest that Jude Law had years before that does nothing but divert attention away from the plot at hand. Anthony Hopkins also made his way into this movie. The entire production is teaming with British actors playing Southerners. Unlike Kate and Jude, who has a sucky American accent but at least puts forth some semblance of effort, Hopkins apparently decided that he's such a Welsh badass that he doesn't even NEED the Southern accent. I suppose in the long run, accents in a movie aren't as important as the other elements, but come ON. You're playing the former governor of Louisiana. He doesn't have an English accent, regardless of whether you live in a stately mansion along the bayou. The only other character besides Willy Stark that was mildly interesting was Mark Ruffalo's character, the son of the former governor who's brought into some pseudo, for-the-public-good hospital operation so that Willy Stark can be associated with his famous father. It would have been yet another pointless extension of an already long movie, but at least with this guy, you can see a) a direct contrast to what Willy has become and that idealism that he left behind and b) an actual, personal victim of what Stark inflicts on the state. Do they follow up on that? Not really. He's barely in the movie, submerged by the needlessness that is Jude Law and a slew of actors who didn't need to be in this.The bottom line is that this movie suffers when it doesn't have Sean Penn. Because of the infinite number of subplots that have no real bearing on his character, the audience doesn't get a real sense of HOW Willy Stark morphed into the cynical, influential bureaucrat. We see a few scenes of him as the idealistic, naive country hick who's taken advantage of by more experienced politicos, but then it just shoots ahead a few years and doesn't show us what happened. One suspects that Stark actually tried to accomplish something positive and noble when he first came into office, but we never see that. We never see what happens when Stark's first efforts as governor are stifled and he has to turn to nefarious schemes to get what he wants accomplished - we just hear second-person accounts by Jude Law, who almost literally was taking a fork and knife, cutting the scenery into little pieces and chewing on it. The world would benefit greatly if they ignored everything in this movie except what it should have been about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed the mark!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film just plain missed the mark. With such an expensive cast, the film should have been much better. Instead, it is a boring dialogue fest. Boring conversations that tend to quickly put the audience on a mind trip.Being from Louisiana I must say these actors did not come across as real, believable residents. It would have made more sense to cast more believable actors in the roles from the beginning. There are many actors who have trouble with Southern accents, and Southern Louisiana accents are even harder to master. When the entire movie revolves around endless dialogue then accents become more important.With an endless stream of remakes streaming out of Hollywood it would seem that they could get one right. This film is like many other remakes; little or no creative effort was put into it. Instead the standard "formulas" are applied and another lackluster remake for masses is the result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be one of the biggest disappointments ever. With such an incredible cast, the film should have worked. Instead, the film goes on and on and on, with nothing remarkable happening along the way. There is just a series of very boring conversations that induce sleep and the desire to run out of the theater.It must also be mentioned that the entire picture is miscast, and that only adds the feeling of frustration that overcome the audience. There are some fine English performers who appear lost and have severe problems handling their Southern accents, and at times it appears as if they have no direction at all.What should have been a crackling and rousing, and maybe even inspirational film falls flat and never recovers. This film is a prime example of what straight to video or... somewhere else is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was the point of re-making this film? It is nowhere as subtle or as well-casted as the original. Especially Sean Penn, he gives his usual over-the-top performance. He is ham-fisted in this role as he is in most. he needs to be taught how to act - he is forever giving Brando's "Stella" speech.Even normally good actors have not tried very hard for this movie. Sir Anthony could not be bothered developing a Southern Accent. I think that may reflect his insights that this edition was going to be a waste of time for all involved. I did enjoy Law's performance. He came to work; his dialect was right-on. It was convincing.You do have to wonder what the producers and director were trying to do. With the budget they had, with the cast they did have (and could have had) with all those resources at their command this is what they choose to do??? They could have gone anywhere and done any story and this is what they do???I hear that James Carvalle - the political guru is an Executive Producer on this dreck! There may be one answer. This film is what you get when you let amateurs influence decisions. Carvalle, love him or hate him, is the top of his political profession, but when it comes to movies perhaps he should be behind the counter selling popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie did contain a startling amount bad film clichs, including a "dark man in the shadows" bit, I think that the actors were about the only thing that made this film watchable. Penn was a bit over the top as Willie Stark, but it felt somewhat fitting, especially because he went more over the top as the character's mania increased. Jude Law, while exceedingly pretty, fit the character of the struggling debutante fairly well. Patricia Clarkson as Saide Burke far out shown the rest of the cast, and was really the only one that pulled off convincingly a Louisiana accent. Mark Ruffalo was underused and far out shown his traditional romantic comedy characters. They're were parts of the movie that were distracting to the plot. The movie was overly melodramatic along with most of the music, which was at times distracting. James Gandolfini acted well but his accent was terrible. Kate Winslet was the least convincing of all cast members and often looked out of place. Worst of all, perhaps, is that the "morals" of the movie were so obvious and yet with the heaviness of the movie you felt empty for not achieving some deeper level of understanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if ocean's 11 taught us anything, it is that remakes should be done of original failures. All The King's Men, the original, is quiet good. This remake, with an excellent cast of the under-used Kate Winslet and Patricia Clarkson along with the annoyingly spastic Sean Penn and Jude Law, who seems to think that acting solely consists of glaring and pouting, could have also been good. However, the script wavers from the main plot. I haven't read the book, but I can tell you that because of extraneous scenes and a lack of closure to the story, that it probably relied heavily on the book for material. In general, it could have just been an example of how a first time director can screw things up (Zallian is a fantastic screenwriter, but maybe not so good when it comes to directing) with a negligent editor. I don't recommend this movie. it wasn't very well done and it's level of taste was pretty low. To top it all off, Patricia Clarkson was the only one who had a good Southern accent, of course she is from New Orleans, but Jude Law couldn't shake his posh English accent, nor could James Gandolfini leave his gravelly Hoboken accent behind.Even then, who thinks to cast Mark Ruffalo outside of comedy. This is an example of why he should stick to roles as the non-threatening good guy in romantic comedies.</fullReview>
