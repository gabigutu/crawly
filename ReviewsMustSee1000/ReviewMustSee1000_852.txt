		<shortDescription>Disturbing &amp; Important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all the praise film-noir is lavished with (quite a lot of it valid), the majority of it relies on convention as much as the standard white-picket-fence, happy-ending 'family' film does: just invert thecliches and bathe them in deep-focus shadows. While this movie, on its surface, resembles the classic-style film noir of DOUBLE INDEMNITY, it's a whole different animal. No calculating evil females or tough guys masking hearts of gold populate IN A LONELY PLACE. It's a much more wrenching and powerfully disturbing film because the murder that draws the protagonists together turns out to be of peripheral importance, while the love story between Humphrey Bogart's troubled screenwriter and Gloria Grahame's B-actress spins inexorably towards damnation completely on its own power. The basic story has him a suspect in a killing and her in love with him yet unsure of his innocence, but director Nicholas Ray stages the proceedings so that WE see it's not the murder that disturbs her but her own conviction that his self-destructive and volatile nature will destroy them both. Yet, Ray never takes the easy way out of having Bogart turn monster on her. You care deeply about these people, hoping desperately (as Bogart's agent does in the film) that some transforming moment will come that will spare these people and allow their deeply felt love to flourish and heal them both, even as the evidence before your own eyes tells you there ain't no way. For 1950 -hell, for any year- such an unsentimental and uncompromising treatment of a tragic adult relationship is a terrible wonder to behold. The shadows suffusing this excellent film come not from UFA-influenced lighting but from moral and spiritual desolation, the death throes of old Hollywood, the coming of McCarthyism and the Black Dahlia murder of 1947. But most of all, they're projected from within the characters themselves. The finest work of Bogart, Grahame and Ray. Special note should be taken of Ray and Grahame, whose own deteriorating relationship formed the template for the doomed lovers; for them, this film is an act of great courage. Bogart himself has taken elements of all his previous romantic loners and blended them with the sour pigments of Fred C Dobbs; as the star and executive producer, his performance is unflinching in its honesty, and as fearless as Grahame and Ray. See this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Bogart, classic script, classic noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favourite films, and (alongside the obvious - Casablanca, Maltese Falcon etc) my favourite Bogart.The script is smart, witty and cynical, just like a typical Bogart character. But in this film Bogart plays probably his darkest character.In some of the scenes with Gloria Graeme he's at his smooth, wisecracking, slightly irritable best, but in the moments where the anger and the fog of despair descends he is a more threatening character than in any of his other leading man roles.The cynical, darker aspects of this film just go to highlight how few contemporary films are prepared to be so bleak.Despite the fact that the plot is ostensibly a 'did he do it?' crime story, this is largely inconsequential to the psychological character and relationship study that is the central concern of the film.If you like a cracking script with sharp performances, with all kinds of deep psychological observations on love and loneliness to be read into it, in the best noir tradition, this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Nicholas Ray's best movies with brilliant performances from Bogart and Grahame.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholas Ray is a director who has almost been forgotten these days, despite making brilliant movies like 'They Live By Night', 'On Dangerous Ground', 'Johnny Guitar' and 'Rebel Without A Cause', and numbering Martin Scorsese and Wim Wenders among his fans (the latter even gave him a small role in his 'The American Friend'). 'In A Lonely Place' could be Ray's best. It's a fascinating movie that mixes drama, suspense and romance in a very interesting way. You could call it Noir I suppose, but it's a very difficult movie to tie down. Humphrey Bogart plays a bitter, hard drinking and frequently violent screen writer who becomes a murder suspect when a young girl (Martha Stewart) is killed. Gloria Grahame ('Crossfire', 'The Big Set Up') is a neighbour who supplies him with an alibi. This odd way of meeting leads into a romance. At first everything is wonderful, and Bogart is even writing again, but bit by bit Grahame starts to see his dark side and begins to fear him, even suspecting that he may have been involved in the murder after all. I don't think I've ever seen Bogart better. It's a terrific performance, and while his character can be charming at times he's also surprisingly unlikeable and intense (we are told he broke an old girlfriend's nose, for example. Imagine Mel Gibson or Brad Pitt doing that in a movie today and still being the romantic lead!). Grahame pulls off a difficult role too, being torn between love and terror. They both make a great team. Such a pity they never worked together after this. I also liked Frank Lovejoy ('House Of Wax', 'The Hitch-Hiker') who plays Bogart's cop buddy. 'In A Lonely Place' is a movie not to be overlooked. I thought it was superb entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart's Vulnerability Is A Revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart stretches his acting muscles and allows his vulnerability to be on display in this realistic gut-wrenching love story. Gloria Grahame, one of the underrated great US actresses of the 40's and 50's, has an electrifying chemistry with Bogie, touching a side that we'd never seen -- not even with Lauren Bacall, laced with an odd kind of violent tenderness. Frank Lovejoy heads a fantastic supporting cast, heavy on three-dimensional characterisations. This unknown classic is Bogie's most complete performance ever. I give it 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart and Grahame Are Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very adult film about a surly Hollywood writer, a would be actress, and a murder. Among the very best Bogart performances, yet this film is practically unknown. Top notch acting across the board. Bogart and Grahame are a terrific team (she is the designing actress), but also good are Frank Lovejoy, Jeff Donnell (as his wife), Martha Stewart (no not that one) as the murder victim, Art Smith as the agent, and Robert Warwick (just wonderful) as the washed-up actor. Everything in the story revolves around Hollywood and movie making, but this is NOT really a film about Hollywood; it's a murder mystery. Great script is full of memorable lines, and all the supporting actors are sharp. Ruth Warren is funny as the maid, and Ruth Gillette is really spooky as the masseuse. Carl Benton Reid is the Lieutenant, and William Ching another officer. But the center is Bogart's harsh, unrelenting character. His Dixon Steele must rank with his best characters. And we never get to know him, nor is there any apology for his toughness. He seems almost psychotic--very rare for the hero of the 1950s movie. This also rates as one of Grahame's best performances. A truly unique Hollywood movie all round. In a Lonely Place still rates as an undiscovered gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogey's best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scorching performance from Bogey makes this film a real classic, his Dixon Steele one of the great screen characters. In this more biting version of the plot of Hitchcock's suspense/comedy Suspicion, Bogart is a kind and loving screenwriter with a violent streak of temper waiting to break out and a taste for a drink or two, wooing Gloria Grahame's pretty young actress next door. The death of a young girlfriend of his hangs over him throughout the movie, as Graham at first believes him to be innocent, then later, having fallen for his charms, begins to suspect he may have had something to do with the girl's death after all, as his temper becomes more and more uncontrolled and frightening. The police circle around, making his nervous anger worse; the relationship begins to crumble into a mess of fear, lies and misunderstanding. Through all this Dixon Steele emerges as a great and brilliant creation, a highlight even in a career as illustrious as that of Bogart, a charming and witty man when happy, a black and vengeful man when roused to anger, a man of contradictions that only seems the more real, heroic, and ultimately tragic. Bogart's performance is brilliant, but the setting works well too, Grahame is great as the sassy girl he falls for, then frightens, the story chugs along at a fair lick, but allowing plenty of time for the many fun minor characters to develop well, and the script is a corker - wonderful stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential Bogie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart is at his uncompromisingly dark best as the Hollywood writer whose temper leads to accusations of murder and conflicted relationships. By turns charming, cold, romantic and remorseful, Dix Steele is as unpredictable a character as Bogie has ever played.He shows no emotion on learning that Mildred - the innocent he has just met - has been killed, and those who know him accept his violent nature as simply part of the Steele package. But thanks to the skill of Bogie and director Ray, the audience never entirely loses sympathy for him. The moments of tenderness he shows to his alibi-turned-lover Laurel (an ethereal Gloria Grahame; imagine Hope Davis glammed-up for the 50s) alternate with fits of anger to turn their relationship into that of a tragic poem.In A Lonely Place is film noir that focuses on romance rather than crime. The reasons for Mildred's murder are never satisfactorily made clear, but it doesn't really matter. The movie asks whether love and trust are earned by what a person says or what they do. And in the end, actions speak louder than words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brave and smart twist to the "man alone" theme...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a brave and smart twist to the 'man alone' theme in an unusually literate thriller which isolated its ambivalent hero having conflicting feelings inside his own negative personality... This man was not physically isolated as Robert Ryan ('Inferno') had been: he was an embittered Hollywood screenwriter who needed self-discipline and trust? The lonely place in which he was trapped was his own mind...Perhaps some people thought Bogart over-acted, played the writer like a criminal aggressively apt to be easily offended... but he played his role well. No gangster this time, or cop, or private eye... He was a Hollywood screenwriter?strong, easily annoyed, depressed; his nerve-ends constantly steaming; living alone with his talent, his reputation and his typewriter; impulsive rather than strengthened by a diet of alcohol and nicotine? His savage temper was uncontrollable: anything, it seemed, could explode it; and his violence was more than merely verbal? Bogart found himself capable of murder... He might have been anti-social... But the stress within him, reacting to the pressures without, built up so strongly that his rages, always near boiling point, became explosive... He hit people without good reason...One watched the reactions of his dream girl, the beautiful blonde Gloria Grahame, and his two close friends... With them, one came to wonder if he was not really a murderer after all...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic film with Bogart at his very best. Gloria Grahame also gives one of her best performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story concerns a Hollywood screenwriter (Bogart) who is suspected of being a murderer. Grahame, a neighbor, steps in to defend him ? she saw the murdered woman leave his apartment alone. Afterwards, they begin a relationship. But Bogart's nature is a violent one, and that violence keeps pushing forward. It makes Grahame rethink her earlier testimony, as well as fear for her own safety. It's quite a unique film for the time, one that actually deals with the possibility of an abusive man. Everything is perfectly done, and the script is wonderful. The film's tagline was 'The Bogart suspense picture with a surprise ending!' What is surprising about the ending is just how much weight it carries. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Anger Management" is nothing new...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and this movie proves it. Watch out Adam Sandler because Bogie beat you to the punch (literally). This is not one of Bogart's more famous works, but for fans of his romantic works, it's a must. There are some great snappy one-liners. The bittersweet ending comes as a surprise. The tense final few minutes are theatrical directing genius, but it also works pretty well for film. The only thing missing was a motivation/explanation for Dix's short fuse, but juxtaposition of Bogart's fury and Gloria Grahame's gentle, faithful love is spell binding. Gloria Grahame is a perfect leading lady for Bogart. It's a pity this combination wasn't repeated, because their chemistry rivals Bogart/Bacall, and Bogart/Hepburn for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart gives his most compelling performance in Nick Ray's classic and generates more on-screen heat with co-star Gloria Grahame than in any of his other justly famous cinematic couplings. The fact that it also manages to make a statement about Hollywood ? and, by extension, the very concept of the "macho loner" glorified by Bogart in so many of his films ? just makes it all that much more unforgettable.The very first thing you hear in this film is a passing character calling out to Bogart ? "Dix Steele!". Right way I find this amusing because of the connotations of his name and the fact that it's such a perfect "Hollywood" name from the period. Dix is a guy who takes a hat check girl home so that she can tell him the story of a book he's supposed to adapt and ends up the prime suspect for her murder. His alibi is provided by a lovely new neighbor, Laurel Gray (Grahame, director Ray's wife at the time). The scene where they flirt with each other in the midst of police interrogation is sexy, intelligent, and surprising. It also engages some of the major themes in the film ? early on in the scene Bogart wonders aloud whether the investigation is supposed to determine if he's guilty of murder or of being insensitive. "I didn't say I was a gentleman, I said I was tired". Steele's attitude here is basically his classic screen persona ? tough, cynical, and defiant of authority. One of the cops, Brub (Frank Lovejoy) is Steele's old war buddy and one of the film's strongest scenes is the one where Steele encourages Brub and his wife Sylvia to act out the murder scenario. Jeff says "he's a sick man" but Brub demurs, basically describing the Bogart persona's appeal ? "he's just exciting, that's all! He's different from other men." The really impressive thing that the film does is that it actually brings us at least closer to Sylvia's perspective by the end, deconstructing the appeal of Bogart's macho noir persona while at the same time maintaining his humanity to the extent that we really feel awful for him because we know this is his last chance in life and that every twist of the story is pushing him that much closer to the bitter loneliness that will occupy the remainder of his life (in this respect it differs greatly from films like "Kiss Me Deadly" which merely satirize the macho persona without humanizing it). And there's no melodramatic outside cause for the tragedy; it's all internal to Dixon Steele's character ? his inability to internalize stress and his tendency to act out with violence against anyone who happens to be in his way when he gets angry.The love story between Grahame and Bogart's characters is extremely convincing. I like how after Laurel "confesses" to finding Bogart's face "interesting" in the interrogation scene, he invites her to come see him and initially thinks she might accompany him on his date with his cop friend's family. It's the first sign of the character's vulnerability, and for the remainder of the film Ray brilliantly uses Grahame's female prerogative to undermine Bogart's arrogant style. Even the scenes that could become maudlin are handled in a convincing way. When Dixon's agent Mel Lippman (Art Smith) comes by and is amazed to see Dixon working on a script feverishly, Grahame's performance carries the necessary feminine affection to make us believe in their brief idyll. Grahame is the whole package, and it's remarkable how she comes off the screen as a flesh and blood woman instead of the kind of "dolls" and "molls" that usually inhabit suspense films from the period. And likewise Bogart's character feels truly real to me in a way that none of his other characters do. I'm not talking about the style of acting, it's really in the writing and the fact that Bogart is able to take advantage of the writing by fully inhabiting this character (which some say was the closest to his own personality he ever played). It's not one of those films where you're supposed to guess whether he's really "good" or "bad", even though superficially that seems the case; I think this story is too sad and the character too pathetic to deserve either epithet. And ultimately even the question of "did he, or didn't he, murder her?" becomes irrelevant because Laurel and the audience become convinced that he COULD have killed her, and this destroys the possibility of trust in their relationship.Nick Ray made at least two other timeless masterpieces, "Johnny Guitar" and "Rebel Without a Cause". All 3 deal with loneliness and the stress placed on relationships by the conflict between traditional concepts of "manliness" and personal concepts of love and belonging. And all 3 show Ray's ability to work with a small ensemble of actors and approach potentially conventional dramatic situations in ways that are not only new but also startlingly intimate and personal. I don't usually issue recommendations, but anyone who hasn't seen all 3 owes it to themselves to seek them out, because speaking from my own heart these are movies that have the potential to enrich our own lives ? without moralizing, Ray has created at least through a handful of personal films a body of work that affirms life in all its beautiful weirdness. Only he could have created a film like "In a Lonely Place" that brings out so many emotions without being manipulative. He knows how to let us come to the characters instead of forcing the characters on us, and he does not allow even one scene to be a "throw-away" ? absolutely every scene in this movie enhances the quality of the film and the experience of watching it is enhanced with each repeat viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie's Loner meets an emotional dead end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rarely shown - and more's the pity for that. IN A LONELY PLACE is the forgotten great performance of Humphrey Bogart, as screenwriter and psychotic Dix Steele. Bogie had played his loner against the world in many varieties before - but his film characters had an edge to them. This was due to their cynicism (usually due to watching the realities of the world, or of actually experiencing them). At the worst he had been Fred C. Dobbs, whose gold fever greed destroys him, and almost his partner Curtin in THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRES. Yet aside from Dobbs most of his best performances were ones where the audience did sympathize with him.IN A LONELY PLACE gives him a role that is almost as dark as Dobbsie was. Dix is one of two men who have been suspected of a brutal murder of a woman whom Dix dated. At the start of the film we are made aware that Dix is really bad tempered - he gets into a mild fender bender and almost ends up beating up the other driver. Throughout the film, the screen writer and Nicholas Ray remind us of Dix's temper - it flares up repeatedly. It even turns on his friends - Mel Lippman (his agent and friend - Art Smith) says the wrong thing, and almost gets throttled. This makes us aware of Dix possibly being the killer of the woman.Dix meets Laurel Gray (Gloria Graham), and a hot romance develops. And we watch the film show the slow growth of fears and suspicions in Laurel regarding Dix's temper and his actual innocence, and Dix's realization that Laurel trusts him less and less. The film spirals to their final painful confrontation - and it's ironic conclusions of shattered hopes. Fred C. Dobbs may have ended up dead, but only in IN A LONELY PLACE did a Bogie character end up shattered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb psychological noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart gives a real actors performance in his production company Santana's first picture In a Lonely Place. The title describes the mental state of the lead character Dixon Steele - played by our favourite Humphrey Bogart.He seems to be more himself in this movie, than in any other role he played before or since. Dixon Steele is a famous Hollywood writer going through a low patch for a few years now. He is also a very violent man with a short fuse. He is suspected of the murder of a hat check girl early on in the movie but is provided an alibi by neighbour Gloria Grahame. They both fall in love and Steele actually seems to be cured and starts writing again. But....I won't delve further into the plot, but this is Bogie's most personal performance and worth a detailed viewing. You'll begin to understand the talents of this actor much more by watching this film. There are several memorable scenes and some great dialogue but this film is more realistic and less stylish than classic noir's like Big Sleep, Double Indemnity, Maltese Falcon or Out of the Past.The end is great....a true noir ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Film With Possibly Bogart's Greatest Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was sold on release as 'The Bogart Suspense Picture With The Surprise Finish'. It's plot does revolve around the highly tense 'Did he really do it?' premise of a murder mystery, yet 'In A Lonely Place' is really more focused on psychology and human behaviour than anything else. The 'Who killed Mildred Atkinson- was it Dixon Steele?' angle is more of a MacGuffin in the way that it moves the plot along and gives purpose, but ultimately is of little concern to the viewer. We are more concerned with the Dixon Steele (Bogart) and Laurel Gray (Grahame) relationship, and how it has been affected.Bogart's performance is mesmerizing; there is very little trace of acting here, it is real and he seems to drawing from demons within. It's not 'The Method', it's just sheer brilliance by an amazing film actor. Steele appears to be always on the brink, ready to boil over. Bogart conveys this expertly with his actions and mannerisms. Gloria Grahame, a truly underrated actress, is also wonderful as Laurel Gray, the woman who falls in love with Steele, but finds she can no longer trust in the course of the film's events. I will make the perhaps startling suggestion that Bogart and Grahame actually share better on-screen chemistry than Bogart and Bacall. There, I said it. It's true. It's a simmering, tender yet dangerous romance that Steele and Gray (note the surnames- an interesting likeness) experience, and Bogart and Grahame are absolutely believable in their roles.This film is about trust, and what happens when trust is lost in a relationship. It's also about the loneliness that everyone inevitably experiences; particularly the artist, the writer, that Bogart's character is. It's about Steele's loneliness before Laurel came into his life, and how his situation will be hopeless if she leaves him or doubts him ever. Very powerful noir.It is one of the best noirs I have ever seen, and very underrated. I notice that the TIME Magazine has included it on it's list of 100 greatest films of all time. Finally, some recognition! Ray's direction is amazing, the atmosphere is brilliantly maintained and the performances are perfect, so it puzzles me why this film is not better known (especially with Bogart's name and all). It's considered by many a Bogart fan to be the film in which he gives his best performance, so it's a must-see for all film goers. A frightening noir because of it's emphasis on human drama, 'In a Lonely Place' is right up there with 'Out Of The Past' and 'Double Indemnity'.It's also a powerful satire and critique of show business and it's false values. Steele, the screenwriter, is the bitter outsider to the game, caustically observing the trappings of his position. One feels Bogart is drawing upon his own early struggling experiences in Hollywood when capturing the essence of Steele. Dix's dry comments to hat-check girl Mildred and his amazing bitterly earnest replies to critical film producers speak of a noir with a higher purpose than just the usual murder plot with style. This is a noir with wit, and outlook.See It! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the star with two sides, with a sad tinge to it all, in one of Ray's great films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart's part in In a Lonely Place perfectly makes such an interesting case as to what is capable in his skills as an actor, and as a star. Nicholas Ray's film doesn't so much challenge as it does confront a certain style of POV in how the character(s) may be seen in the film, and it very much has a lasting impact to this day. Early on in the film we're seeing it all through Dixon Steele's perspective, a down-on-his-luck type who in this case happens to be a screenwriter. After a woman he asked over to his place leaves, and gets killed later on, he's pulled in as the chief suspect. The investigation goes on, but in the meantime he falls for his alibi, a woman neighbor he glanced at that night (Gloria Grahame). Now so far we've gotten, more or less, the 'star' side of Bogie, where he's a decent enough person, even through the way that he says the lines is his style of gruff, low-key. So far we're on his side with this, and the director too goes to lengths to make the police-side moments to be as they are in any given number of noirs where there's always the overly suspicious head detective.But then suddenly, the perspective changes really from Bogart's character to Grahame's. Suddenly, as her character types up his new, 'inspired' script in a matter or weeks, the relationship for her- at first with a firm tongue-in-cheek and kind adoration in part to the writing- starts to take a turn. Here's where the character of Bogart's starts to get interesting, as the past record of violent outbursts starts to add doubt not just for his girl, but for the audience as well. As he was much as at home playing tense, on-edge gangsters and the like in the 30's as he was in star turns in the 40s, here's a role where he gets to both, but in line with the director's dramatic requirements. Here he creates this film just on structure with a keen apt for the suspense of it all. It isn't even a 'whodunit' as much as it is a look at the environment of how 'loneliness' is often most crushing when it incurs loss and pushing others away. And the climax that is reached is meant as an emotional one, as the real peak is revealed. In a Lonely Place is great for what it gives its actor(s) to do with the material, and along with an accompanying, varying style, it's exemplary of subverting expectations. You may get the rough side of Bogie as well as the side that's near charming. But this time the implications of connecting and feeling for one another are just as strong, if not stronger, than the mystery portion that pushes further on them. Saying all this, of course, doesn't mean that the film isn't quite the entertainer, too; moments of humor are pecked in with a side character and with some of the (typical for a Bogart star role) finely tuned bits of dialog. It's a film that tells a love story and has the mix of very touching moments with the uglier ones, has some grit on the edges that adds to the subversion of the material, and puts conflicts where elsewhere would be shuffled around by others. In short, it's a highlight in both of the careers of the director and star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film noir is a part of cinema that has been sorely missed since it's decline in the sixties, but it's always nice to view a classic from the era; and this film is one of the best of the genre that I've seen. While many film noir's focus on crime only, this one fuses crime with romance and the result is a film that is both thrilling and touching. The film also seems keen to give a commentary on Hollywood, with it's comments on the sort of people that live there along with criticisms of certain methods. The film is very pessimistic, which is a part of the film noir tradition and the pessimistic outlook of the movie blends excellently with the stylish black and white cinematography. This film marks a different sort of role for the great Humphrey Bogart as well, as it shows him in a more vulnerable, and more importantly darker, role than what we are used to seeing him portray. The plot includes mystery and suspense, and it follows Bogart as the girl that he invited to his apartment is found dead.The story of In a Lonely Place really picks up when Bogart comes into contact with his neighbour, a mysterious young woman whom he promptly falls in love with. This romance forms the backbone of this dark movie, but even though the romance is usually a positive thing; director Nicholas Ray even manages to keep this aspect of the story firmly in the shadows. The film is a great example of professionalism throughout, with the direction, screenplay and acting all being flawless. It's nice to see an actor of Bogart's immense talent in this sort of role, as it really allows him to put his back into it and the result is a fine performance from one of the greatest actor's of all time, which is a treat to watch. The plot is full of criticisms of Hollywood in the 50's, and this will be of interest to film fans as this was an important period of time for movies. On the whole, this movie is a fascinating piece of cinema. It is captivating from the moment it starts and you will be drawn to it all the way though. My only slight criticism is that it could have spent a little more time on the mystery side of it's plot, and a little less on the romance; but that's a small criticism. Otherwise, this is an excellent piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent Movie About Trusting In and Suspicion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) is a successful screenwriter who has not present anything worthwhile for a long time. He is a very violent man, with a bad temper. His agent asks him to read a book and prepare the screenplay, and he invites the receptionist of the restaurant where he is habitué, who had read the foregoing book, to go to his home and present a summary of the book. The girl had a date, but she decides to go with Dix. After midnight, he gives her some money for the cab and she leaves his apartment alone. On the next day, the girl is found dead and Dix becomes the main suspect. He goes to the police station, with his neighbor Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame), and she provides his alibi. Then they fall in love for each other, but Gloria can not trust in him completely. With the support of Gloria, Dix starts working as never, and prepares an outstanding screenplay for his agent. Meanwhile he proposes her to get married with him, and although Gloria is in love with him, she can not rely on him. This movie is magnificent, having Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame in an outstanding performance. The story is wonderful, and the direction and actors are magnificent. The restored black and white photography is overwhelming. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `No Sil?ncio da Noite' (?In the Silence of the Night')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Bogart's most complex roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very interesting role for Humphrey Bogart, and was a bit of a production code buster on several levels.Bogart plays Hollywood screenwriter Dixon Steele, who is in somewhat of a writing rut. He also has a quick temper and a paranoia complex. He picks fights with people over the most routine matters and these fights commonly come to blows. He is indeed "in a lonely place" of his own making. Steele has a chance to write a screenplay based on a book, but the author wants him to read the book and give him his opinion in just a matter of a few days. At the restaurant where Steele has talked with the author, the hat check girl says she has just read the book and loves it. Steele invites her to come over to his apartment and tell him about the book to save him the trouble of reading it. This is all very innocent in what Steele intends and in what actually happens. In fact, Steele's reaction, unseen and unheard by the hat check girl, to her semi-literate oral book report is wickedly funny. This shows us Steele's charming and funny side. After the girl tells her story, she leaves. Neighbor Laurel Grey (Gloria Grahame) sees her leave. However, the next day, the girl's strangled body is found next to a road. The police quickly find their way back to Steele's place where, due to his violent past and nonchalant reaction to the murder, he is under immediate suspicion. He finds an alibi in his neighbor Laurel, and this is how they formally meet.Almost immediately the two begin a relationship that gets serious fast. Laurel finds Steele attentive and interesting. Thus at first Laurel thinks Steele is innocent of the murder, but one by one her doubts grow. Steele explodes over little things, even eventually punching out his own agent over nothing. In fact, Steele's agent is his only real friend and actually is a bit of an enabler for his bad behavior. You always see Steele show his idea of remorse for his actions, even anonymously sending money to a guy he has beaten up over a traffic accident. However, the question that is left to be answered is - exactly what is going on with this guy? Could he have stalked and killed the girl over his anger at something else or someone else entirely? And if he didn't kill the hat check girl, will he eventually kill someone else? Laurel is asking these same questions as she begins to wonder - is it more dangerous to try and run away from Steele, or is it more dangerous to stay? One should never consider saying "yes" to a marriage proposal if it comes down to what is less dangerous.Laurel is not exactly a finished book herself. Apparently she had a serious relationship with a well-off man just prior to this, and ended it for really no tangible reason. Then there is a kind of gay subtext going on between herself and her masseuse, Martha. They only have one scene together but it certainly throws out more questions than answers, just like the rest of this film.If you like noir, if you like Bogart, if you like being challenged, watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Engaging Minor Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a Lonely Place straddles two genres just as the timing of its release straddles two decades. It has the elements of the classic 40s film noir tradition and it also anticipates the revival of the melodrama genre which would become so popular in the fifties in the hands of directors like Ray and Sirk.It also contains one of the most schizophrenic of screen performances by Humphrey Bogart. He alternates between the classic Sam Spade persona that defined his screen image and the insecure, psychotic character he played so well in films like The Treasure of Sierra Madre and The Caine Mutiny. A must watch for Bogart fans and also for its skillful fusion of film noir and melodrama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screenwriter Dixon Steele is very very talented, he also drinks too much and is prone to outbreaks of shocking violence. Thus the studios are reluctant to hire him, but thru sheer determination, his agent manages to get him a coveted writing assignment to adapt a popular novel. The main players in the proposed picture meet up at a restaurant to talk things out, but with Dixon being Dixon it all goes wrong and violence curtails the evening. Tho not really keen to read the novel he is to adapt, Dixon accepts an invitation from the hatcheck girl to read for him as it's her favourite book, they both go to Dixon's home and nothing untoward happens between the pair, he bids her farewell and puts out for her cab fare home. The next day the police show up at the door requesting Dixon accompany them down to the station, turns out that the poor hatcheck girl was murdered and dumped on the roadside, Dixon of course is the chief suspect. But a glint of light appears in the form of Dixon's beautiful neighbour, Laurel Gray, who provides Dixon with a solid alibi, this sets in motion a relationship between the pair that might break or make either one of them.In A Lonely Place is a fabulous picture, not nominated for any academy awards (incredible in light of Bogart's stunning portrayal as Steele), and tagged on its release as being too bleak to be a winner, it's now rightly considered one of the best films of its type and contains some of the best work from those involved. What always amazes me with the film is how its two halves are so very riveting for different reasons, the first half we are trying to understand Steele's conflict with himself (a wonderfully complex character), he is our sole focus of attention. Then the second half as Laurel and Dixon enter into a full blown relationship, we find ourselves in Laurel's place, as Dixon grows ever more erratic, we join Laurel in her unease, it feels like a coiled spring waiting to unleash itself. It's quite an achievement that director Nicholas Ray molds the pictures halves together and dabs them with darkly affecting visuals, whilst all the time taking us up and down as to how we feel about Dixon Steele and the girl he has clearly fallen in love with.This is not just about the actors (Gloria Grahame as Laurel is also as fabulous as Bogart is) and its director tho, a tip of the hat has to go to the source material by Dorothy Hughes and Edmund H North and the adaptation by Andrew Holt, the ending here is different to the one in the book, but personally I think this one works better because it has a quandary cloud hanging over it, not in a short changed way, but in a deeply unnerving way, the kind that sets you pondering over a cold glass of beer. Terrific stuff here for those willing to invest undivided time with it, a film that is now rightly revered as a classic, so just as Dixon Steele is up on that old knife edge, the makers are asking you to hop up on that edge alongside him, do it and you wont be disappointed. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, I have seen literally hundreds of Noir movies and this one REALLY took me by surprise! Superficially, it does not really appear overall to be a Noir in look or in atmosphere; as a matter of fact that is exactly what I found really unique about this film compared to all the other Noirs that I have seen. It has an almost schizophrenic quality to it; all I can think of is that Nicholas Ray showed an utterly brilliant perceptive touch to lead us along in most of the film with a ***seeming*** appearance of fun, wit, and such but always with a strong underlying but very subtle tension and unease. WOW! I'm not saying that I know everything about movies but this one really did catch me off guard, especially for a film made in 1950!!! I mean today we see all kinds of convoluted psychology in film, but back then, especially with Bogart's character. He played that role so perfectly with every expression and abrupt change of mood, etc. From a film from the Noir period, especially one that presents itself deceptively as perhaps a light hearted romance / murder mystery, to have such subtlety and complexity and SERIOUSLY to keep you so off balance right up to the end, is very unique and impressive indeed. You won't walk away from this film like you do from most 'tough' Noirs or clearly 'Dark' Noirs where you pretty much expected and knew what was happening from the beginning where the 'doomed' mood is pretty obvious, even with one as deftly handled as 'OUT OF THE PAST'. This one strikes very deeply, almost subconsciously at your core making you feel this sense of unease but you don't quite know why... With most 'heavy' Noirs you bl00dy well KNOW this from the start.You walk away from this one rather unsettled. But, one thing is for sure: You KNOW that you have just seen a GREAT and beautifully crafted film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Featuring his future wife in Gloria Grahame, In a Lonely Place is Nicholas Ray's fourth and finest picture, and Humphrey Bogart's most dynamic performance. Bogart plays Dixon Steele, a slumping alcoholic screenwriter suspected of murder. Grahame, in a role that showcases her brooding sexuality and honey-dripped delivery, plays Bogart's sensual neighbor, Laurel Gray. They quickly fall in love after she provides him with a slick alibi, then begins to think different after he shows some of his more unfortunate cards.Ray is best known for Rebel Without a Cause, Grahame for her Oklahoma role of Ado Annie, and Bogart for Casablanca and others. This film, a truly sordid look at Hollywood and its inhabitants, is arguably the greatest effort put forth by all and the greatest example why Europeans dig Nicholas Ray. Period. Spooky photography and superior dialog from Edmund North who helped pen Patton of all things. Top Ten material...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Boldest Films In History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the AFI decides to manage a list of the 100 Boldest Movies, films that take great risks and make choices that make them the powerful little gems that they are, it will be a crime if they don't acknowledge In a Lonely Place. This film was made in 1950, and the first thing it does is make a frustrated, complicated screenwriter out of Humphrey Bogart, the leading action and thriller star of the time, always a cop or a crook in some respect. Then, it does something truly brave for a film in 1950: It sets up all the trappings of a murder mystery and uses those plot points to create a purposefully ambiguous undertone for the story to state something very profound about people judging people. The film's scenes of violence are very sad instances of a character's personal drawbacks and emotional pain. We understand why Bogart loses his temper, and in a silently vindictive way, we enjoy what he's doing, but unlike a tough gangster movie or a cop drama, we hope against it, because we learn to know and like the characters so well that we just know what this uncontrolled rage will lead to.Everything in the movie is natural. That's its irresistible charm. It lets everything happen the way it truly would. Bogart and Grahame give performances that feel so contemporary, because they transcend the classical stagelike bombast of old film acting. They look, talk and walk like real people, and they are perhaps some of the greatest work by any actors in the 1940s and '50s.The script comes straight from the heart and draws characters that many, including myself, can relate to, perhaps shamefully, perhaps encouragingly. It's one of the most affecting love stories I've ever seen, and one that's not afraid to take the tough way out of anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional and very Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Bogart's better films but is rarely seen or discussed. I really can't understand why as it's a wonderful Film Noir-style movie with exceptionally exciting dialog and some very clever writing.Bogart plays a strange and complex character--a man who writes screenplays. At times, he's affable and decent, and at other times he's violent and cruel--getting into fights at the drop of a hat. But regardless, he was always cynical and spouted great dialog in whichever mood struck him.Towards the beginning of the film a young lady is murdered and the evidence points mainly to Bogart. Now the writers and director COULD have chosen to make it very clear to the audience what actually occurred, but there is definitely plenty of reason for the audience to suspect Bogart DID kill her and it isn't spelled out for you. Oddly, through much of the film it seemed like Bogart's character was doing everything he could to prove he might have done it! The only witness who could throw doubt on Bogart's guilt is a neighbor played wonderfully by Gloria Graham. Interestingly enough, Ms. Graham often played "trashy dames" in films but this time, she sported a more conservative style of hair and makeup. She was still a bit of a Noir "dame", but definitely smart and with a lot of class.After providing Bogart with an alibi, the two oddly fall in love. She is firmly convinced of his innocence, though it is STILL possible that Bogart did kill the girl. And, as the film unfolds and Bogey shows an amazingly volatile temper, Graham becomes afraid of him--setting up a wonderful conclusion to the film.The best aspects of the film were the great dialog (it just sounded so gritty and cool--like a Noir flick), interesting and unique script as well as the building tension--almost like a Hitchcock film. I also liked that, for once, the film kept me guessing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I lived a few weeks while you loved me."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart's characterization of Dixon Steele, an erratic and violent screenwriter, builds on a role seen three years earlier in "The Two Mrs. Carroll's". In that one he was a scheming husband with a penchant for disposing of used up wives. Here however, Bogey is driven to maniacal excess that roils to a raging white heat best exemplified when he stops short of smashing a man's head in with a rock in a 1950's fit of road rage. It may be the proverbial straw that destroys the romance between Steele and Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame), a would be actress who insinuates herself into the writer's life by virtue of an alibi in the death of a young woman.The film keeps one guessing as to Steele's guilt or innocence, but his re-creation of the murder for a detective friend and his wife only adds to the intrigue. Not to mention feigning guilt every time his agent Lippman (Art Smith) comes around. It's the bantering between the pair that keeps the film off balance in the early going and lightens the story with an air of dark comedy.It was hard for me to warm up to the Laurel Gray character. There was always a veneer of caution and distrust about her, made more ominous by the revelation that she was on the run from a former boyfriend. In turn, her own internal warning system slipped into high gear as the film progressed, becoming increasingly wary of Steele's hot temper and growing intrusion into her life.I'm always intrigued by the slightest of film nuances and this one offers a couple. For one, when the character of detective Brub Nicolai (Frank Lovejoy) is introduced for the first time to Laurel Gray at the police station, his boss calls him 'Nicholson'. And were you quick enough to catch Myron Healey as the uncredited postal clerk in the latter part of the movie? Humphrey Bogart was equally at home portraying both heroes and villains, but it seems that bad guys brought out more intensity in the actor. Though not nearly as strong or well known as Bogey's A-list of films, and we all know which ones they are, "In A Lonely Place" is a strong contender to head up his second tier along with "Conflict", "The Enforcer" and "Knock On Any Door". The latter film, as this one was directed by Nicholas Ray, who achieved his seminal career work in "Rebel Without a Cause".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gee, I'm glad I finally got around to giving this movie a complete viewing. Years ago I had seen some of it and thought it was boring but I had read too many good things about this to give up on it, so when I saw a DVD for just a few bucks earlier this bought, I bought it. I'm glad, but I have mixed feelings on the film. For much of it, I found it an interesting movie with some very cool dialog and some quirky characters. Besides, I like the genre (film noir), although I found this much more of a crime/drama/melodrama/comedy than a noir.Ever since "Casablanca" Humphrey Bogart seemed to get some of these "Rick" parts; you know, the wise-guy know-it-all with a smart answer for everything and a guy who is hard to figure (good guy or bad guy?). That's the main story in this film - is "Dix Steele" or killer or just a guy with a big temper problem? I won't say, but it will keep you guessing right up until the end.Gloria Grahame ("Laurel Gray") is at her sexiest and her role here not unfamiliar when you look at the history of films - the woman who is attracted to a bad man or possible bad man. The woman who has second thoughts all the time but also is desperate to fall in love. It's been overworked in the movies but Grahame is a feast for the eyes in this film.Overall, I thought the main part of the film was fun to watch. The opening 10-15 minutes was a little too corny with Martha Stewart's character, "Mildred Atkinson", and the last half hour turned a little too melodramatic in spots, yet the movie never dragged.The line in the film repeated several times - "I was born when you kissed me. I died when you left. I lived a few weeks while you loved me" - is cool, but demonstrates the big melodrama side to this film. Yet, it has a tense feel - which gives it the film noir label - as Bogart is mesmerizing in one of his more memorable roles late in his illness-shortened life.For most classic-movie buffs, this is a "must see," and I can understand that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear, Futility &amp; Shades Of Camus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In A Lonely Place" is a product of a period when Hollywood was at its most introspective and fearful. Having become the focus of the House Un-American Activities Committee's witch-hunt for communists, many careers were either destroyed or threatened and the introduction of the industry's blacklist was responsible for compounding the strong feelings of bitterness and persecution which were so prevalent at that time. This movie reflects the period in which it was made by being heavily infused with these emotions and also by being inherently morose and pessimistic.Humphrey Bogart, in one of his greatest performances, plays the part of a talented screenwriter (Dixon Steele) who's disillusioned with the industry in which he works and is also critical of the quality of many of the projects that he's invited to undertake. His bitterness and hostility often manifest themselves in violent outbursts of anger and drunken rages. This behaviour and his general inclination to be uncooperative with other people in the business, lead to him becoming alienated and out of work for long periods. He does, however, at times also display a more human side, for example with his kindness to an old, out of work, alcoholic actor with whom he is friendly.One evening Dix meets his loyal and long suffering agent, Mel Lippman (Art Smith), at a restaurant/bar to discuss a project to write a screenplay based on a new best selling novel. Dix feels typically sceptical about the merits of the book but nevertheless, agrees to read it. The hat check girl at the establishment has read the novel and is very enthusiastic about it, describing it as an "epic". Dix takes the opportunity to invite her back to his apartment, so that she can tell him the entire story thus relieving him of the tedium of having to read it himself. She agrees and after completing the task, Dix pays her and also gives her money to get a cab to return home.The next morning, after her dead body has been found, Dix is interviewed by the police who suspect him of murder. Fortunately, one of his neighbours, Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) saw the young lady leaving Dix's place and is able to support his account of what happened. Dix and Laurel get to know each other and soon fall in love. This experience transforms Dix from being unmotivated and unwilling to take on work that he thinks is unworthy of his talent and he rapidly becomes very industrious and works extremely hard on his new screenplay.Unfortunately, as their relationship develops, Laurel becomes increasingly aware of how bad tempered and jealous Dix can become and a combination of things that she's told by other people about his violent nature and also behaviour that she witnesses herself, make her start to fear him. Things get so bad that Laurel starts to use sleeping pills and when Dix proposes, she feels compelled to accept because she's so afraid of him. The means by which their relationship continues from that point leads to the movie's very unconventional denouement.In the scene where he's interviewed by the police, Dix's reactions to the information he's given and the charges made against him are not conventional and the fact that he reacts with petulance rather than shock, horror or sympathy lead to him being seen by them as someone who's more sinister than would have been the case had he responded in the way that they would have expected. This passage of the film is interesting both because of its similarity to the predicament experienced by the main protagonist in Albert Camus' "The Stranger" (aka "The Outsider") which was published in the early 1940s and also because it provides another illustration of Dix's complexity.Bogart is excellent in his particularly demanding role and Gloria Grahame gives a great performance in which she shows her changing feelings and increasing vulnerability in a very natural and believable manner."In A Lonely Place", rather like Dix himself, is less than straightforward as it initially appears to be a murder mystery but soon develops into a poignant, romantic melodrama. The complexities of its main characters and the feelings of hopelessness and futility that it conveys also make this movie very different from the mainstream dramas that audiences are more used to seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In a Lonely Place" starts with the classic Bogart character we all know: the cynical and world-weary tough guy. In this case he's a screenwriter, but it's the old Bogie we know despite the sophistication the profession may imply. The film moves quickly to a murder where Bogart's character is a suspect, but he hardly seems concerned about that, much less the death of the young victim.The murder investigation throws him into a romance with a neighbor (who vouches for him). The romance temporarily transforms his life from cynical torpor to giddy romance and productivity. We all know from Bogart films that this isn't going to last...But what ultimately happens is what distinguishes this film from the other classic Bogart films. What we see is not the cynicism of Sam Spade in the "Maltese Falcoln" or the lonely principles of Rick from Casablanca.Instead we're given the reality behind the devil-may-care Bogart character from the other films as his dark side emerges. The film is brutally realistic in its depiction of a the faults of the character, who is at heart a sociopath with his demons just barely held in check.Ultimately this is a great, tragic film, in the classical sense of tragedy as the fall of a character from his own faults. The nuanced writing, the wonderful acting, and the uncompromising depiction of a relationship gone terminally bad make this a unique and uniquely powerful film.It's probably not as well-known as some of the other Bogart films simply because its realism subverts the "Bogie" character we all love from the other films. Still, "In a Lonely Place" stands up against the best of film noir -- and the best of the Bogart films.</fullReview>

The man driving the car gets fresh with Bogart and Bogart(Dixon Steel, screenwriter in the movie) challenges him to a fight without batting an eye. He has reactionary temper that had gotten him in trouble in the past. For the rest of the movie you don't know what to expect from him. I wont get that much into the plot(its really secondary to the relationships that Dixon Steel has with every other character in the movie, esp. with Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame who gives a terrific performance), just see one of the great Hollywood movies about itself.

		<shortDescription>The Best Film Most People Have Never Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholas Ray's "In a Lonely Place" (1950) owes most of its suspense to the same gradual revelations that characterized Hitchcock's "Sabotage" and Lang's "Fury". All three films concern a woman's slow realization that her husband, fiancée, boyfriend is a monster. Shortly after moving into a new apartment, Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) discovers a mutual attraction between herself and neighbor Dixon "Dix" Steele (Humphrey Bogart). Their actual introduction is at police headquarters where successful screenwriter Dix is being questioned regarding his relationship with Mildred Atkinson (Martha Stewart), a "hat-check" girl who had visited Dix in his apartment a few hours before her murder. Laurel is able to supply an alibi, having spotted Mildred leaving the apartment alone. Dix is unmotivated but takes on a new project, adapting a novel for a producer who intends to make it into a movie. His romance with Laurel is a great tonic and he works hard on this screenplay. Early on the viewer learns that Dix is subject to fits of temper and rage, and needs little provocation to become completely unglued. But the viewer also sees his good qualities, he quickly comes to the defense of an older actor who has a drinking problem and does not take advantage of young Mildred during her late night visit to his apartment. Despite his alibi, the police continue to suspect Dix of Mildred's murder; mostly because of his past history of violence. Brub Nicolai (Frank Lovejoy), an old war buddy and now a police detective, defends him and even has him over for dinner; although Brub's wife thinks that Dix has serious psychological problems.The remainder of the story is told from Laurel's point-of-view. The two fall in love but as Dix's issues begin to manifest themselves she begins to wonder if he might actually be the murderer. He knows a little too much about the murder and rather oddly isn't angry about being a suspect, while his increasingly erratic behavior in other areas begins to terrify her. In both "Sabotage" and "Fury" the good girl role was played very effectively by Sylvia Sidney, whose considerable acting for the camera skills allowed her to nonverbally convey her character's growing suspicion and eventual realization that a man she once trusted has a dangerous hidden side. Grahame's performance is not as nuanced but is still quite effective. Best remembered for her comedic role as Ado Annie in "Oklahoma", an airhead character (in the tradition of Una Merkel and Zasu Pitts) for which Grahame, with her somewhat dazed expression, was especially well suited. Yet she had considerable range as a serious actress, which she demonstrated here and again in "The Big Heat". Bogart's Dix is a precursor of his Captain Quig character in "The Caine Mutiny". But Dix has considerably more dimensions and Bogart alternates between his standard "tough but basically good" loner and the disturbed Quig. This multi-dimensionality makes him very real and ultimately sympathetic as the viewer comes to realize that the title's "lonely place" is inside Dix's mind."In a Lonely Place" is a bit different than classic film noir. It is considerably more powerful and disturbing because the standard film noir murder element is of minimal importance. Instead Ray concentrates on making the viewer really care about his characters, hoping that Laurel's love will transform Dix so that he can better cope with his inner demons.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unpredictable Pseudo-Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In a Lonely Place" is widely considered to be one of the best of the film noir genre, but I can't quite bring myself to give it noir status. It certainly has the ambiguity, sense of paranoia and seedy underworld setting of the standard noir, but it's also lacking in a few crucial elements that in my opinion give a film noir its noir: the femme fatale, the sense of underlying corruption. When Gloria Grahame first slinks her away across the screen, you think "Ah ha! Here's our femme fatale." But she's not, and this is only one instance of the way this film unpredictably turns the audience's expectations upside down. The film is very unusual in the way it tells its story. Bogart plays a struggling screen writer suspected of murdering a young, star-struck girl. We know he hasn't done it, and we expect the film to be about the unraveling of the mystery surrounding her death in Bogie's attempts to prove his innocence. But that's not at all what we get. The murder is forgotten, never very important to begin with, and the film settles into a character study of Bogie, not concerned so much with whether or not he committed a murder but rather with whether or not he has the CAPACITY to commit murder. The cool, unflappable persona that greets us at the beginning of the movie (the Bogie we're used to), deteriorates into a paranoid, jealous, nearly psychotic loner by the film's end, and Gloria Grahame (who we early on suspected of having some devious aims) becomes our chief object of concern. The movie is all over the place in a good way, truly surprising and fresh.The title of course refers to the lonely place of the interior psyche, and the demons that can haunt a man who has too much time with himself. Bogie spends so much time in the imaginary worlds he creates for his screenplays, that he can't seem to deal any longer with the reality of the material world around him, or maintain relationships that don't rely on his bullying his way into getting what he wants. And the saddest thing is that he knows this about himself. It's a great display of acting on Bogie's part and a neat deconstruction of the Bogie screen persona.Enjoy.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark side of genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a fascination in Hollywood and elsewhere with disturbed and distorted genius. Excuses are made for ugly behavior if the doer has talent, wealth or beauty. This is much the same case with women who love bad boys and repeatedly take their abuse for a few extraordinary moments of amorous connection. Such is the case with Bogart's character, Dix Steele, a talented screen writer who is a mixture of good and bad, but predisposed to an evil temper and violent disposition. Hollywood is the perfect setting for this distorted personality given its familiarity with cult worship and its tendency to excuse the ugly side of those it favors. The Frank Lovejoy's character states the proposition succinctly: `He's a genius?he's exciting?that's just the way he is.' Inevitably this love of genius hurts the beloved as well. The adoration amplifies their worst tendencies.Other movies have dealt with this subject, but in not so complex a manner as "In a Lonely Place." It is surprising that any group of filmmakers would have had the courage to invest in such a darkly honest and relentlessly negative film. I haven't seen anything out of Hollywood lately that approaches this level of truth. Kudos to all involved, especially Bogart and my very favorite Gloria Grahame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlikeable Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart plays Dixon Steele, a Hollywood writer burnt-out in more ways than one. A girl is murdered, and Steele is the last one who saw her alive. Did Steele kill her? If he didn't, who did? For most of the movie, Steele is the prime suspect, until his neighbor comes forward to fake an alibi. This neighbor happens to be beautiful, with no visible means of financial support, and attracted to Steele. While the murder investigation plays through their lives, Steele and his neighbor, Laurel Gray, played by Gloria Grahame in a bravura performance, fall in love. But, the two threads - the courtship and the murder - are inextricably tied. Steele has a violent past, and a disposition to violence. We are never told why - perhaps his military service - one of the film's few weak moments. As the thread of the murder is tied up with the confession of the boyfriend, the thread of the lovers continues to unravel, until in the film's climax, their relationship disintegrates before our eyes because of Steele's temper.It has been suggested elsewhere this movie is a profile of the artistic temperament, or a study of anger management. Both statements are true. It is also a case study of domestic violence, and how violent impulses undermine a relationship, even viable relationships. Steele's violence ultimately becomes the single dominant emotion in this film: the police suspect him of murder because of his history; he nearly beats a stranger to death on little provocation; he stalks and attempts to detain his lover when she threatens to leave. Bogart as the abuser and Grahame as the abused are excellent in their roles. Ultimately, it becomes unimportant whether Steele killed the hatcheck girl; he is violent, abusive, aggressive, inner-directed, and a source of almost constant fear. Bogart can make gangsters lovable, but the energy of his performance here is in making Steele *un*lovable. This is an excellent movie, a solid 8 out of 10. The dialog is crisp, especially in the early parts. Bogart and Grahame have real screen chemistry. The ending is wonderful, very sad, and very understandable given the events we've just witnessed. The last line of the film is unforgettable, and speaks volumes on the sadness of failed relationships.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Melo-Drama, Better than Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholas Ray's In a Lonely Place is one of those films you might catch late at night on cable, or have it recommended to you by a trusted friend. However you come across it, invest yourself in this remarkable entertainment, and by the final frame, it has you hard. In a lot of ways, this is what A Streetcar Named Desire should have been. It makes believable the relationship between a violent man and a sympathetic woman. Gloria Grahame isn't a victim, she isn't a fool, we really see the good and the bad in both characters, and the tender moments where they can almost transcend the circumstances surrounding their downfall. Humphrey Bogart never was so good, and Grahame brings a sexuality to the screen unmatched by her contemporaries, and probably never completely reproduced. An outstanding masterpiece, this film isn't to be missed.</fullReview>

The two soon become involved but Bogie's dark side leads Gloria to fear for her life. One of Bogie's best performances in one of his most challenging roles. I can't say that I prefer '50s Bogie to his '40s prime but he certainly was taking more chances as an actor. Gloria Grahame is terrific. I only knew her as Violet Bick growing up but over the years I've come to appreciate her talent in many grittier roles. This is one of the best of Bogie's later efforts. A suspenseful, edgy drama with noir touches. Really good script and fine direction. A must-see for Bogart fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . are "ticking time bombs," as unstable as nitroglycerin, liable to explode at any moment, is in full swing during IN A LONELY PLACE. Though some might view the American military as a "necessary evil," Bogart made a career of fleshing out what amounted to feature-length public service announcements informing the public that it must keep at least an arm's length away from any current or former servicemen, especially the officers. In CHAIN LIGHTNING, his ex-officer test pilot character is reckless, insubordinate, and unstable. In THE CAINE MUTINY, Bogart's "by the book" Captain Queeg places a higher value on a quart of strawberries than the lives of his entire war-time crew. And here IN A DARK PLACE, his ex-officer character comes within an inch of beating a younger man's brains out with a rock after the civilian youth calls him a "blind, knuckle-headed squirrel" for speeding through a stop sign, side-swiping the beating victim's "new paint job." No other iconic U.S. film star played psycho American military officers so many times. Who can picture Ronald Reagan, Charlton Heston, or John Wayne bringing "Captain Queeg" to life? The U.S. government STILL refuses to release the statistic of how many violent crimes in our country are perpetuated by the ex-military (such as Lee Harvey Oswald, Charles Whitman, and Timothy McVeigh). Is it 1%, 10%, or 95%? Taxpayers have to content themselves with Bogart's warning cries echoing IN A LONELY PLACE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a Closer Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart reportedly thought the movie a failure. Certainly box-office results were dismal and Bogie's production company, Santana, lost a bundle. Hard to believe anyone thought this disturbing film with its downbeat ending would actually make money. Bogart's Dix Steel (that name should have been reconsidered) is a borderline psychopath, a Jekyll and Hyde who can boil over in an instant. He's a walking volcano whose sensitive side simply cannot contain the inner turmoil. In that day, few Hollywood egos had the assurance to take on such an unflattering role, especially the shadowy later scenes where his creviced face approaches the grotesque. It's a fine and daring performance, and the last, I believe, where Bogart plays even a semi- romantic leading man.Good as Bogart is, this is a Gloria Graham showcase. Her droopy upper lip and pouty face never quite fit the Hollywood mold, and by decade's end, she was gone. Here, however, she's near perfect as the jaded starlet, with a questionable background and just a hint of 50's kink. Her Laurel Gray emerges as a vulnerable, yet street-wise toughie, drawing the eager Steel into a torrid affair, (only hinted at because of the production code of the day). But as his character unravels, so must hers, which it does in beautifully understated stages. Watch her quietly desperate reaction to Steel following the assault on the motorist, or her barely controlled panic at film's end. It's an award-level performance, all the better for refusing to go over the top, despite the many opportunities. Small wonder she remains an enduring noir favorite.The mystery angle may be a clever plot device, but it's director Nicholas Ray's powerful vision that makes the film gel. A poet of post-war alienation, he's the perfect overseer of such fare, combining the elements into a grimly compelling view of human estrangement and isolation. Perhaps no director other than Elia Kazan could work with a cast as effectively as Ray. Notice how distinctively each of the supporting players is drawn, from the Shakespearean drunk to the hard-bitten maid to the lounge lizards at Romanoff's. Only the cops in routine roles seem to fade into the background. Underrated in many of Ray's best films is the scoring, and this film is no exception. George Antheil's compositions are simple yet expertly conceived, highlighting the scenes without rivaling them and lending just the right emotional tone. My one complaint: I've never understood why an industry so close to the beach couldn't film at the beach, or at least couldn't have come up with a better process shot than the one here.Nonetheless Bogart was wrong. The film is anything but a failure. Coming from an era of happy endings, Dix and Laurel remain star-crossed lovers, doomed by their own sophistication and inner demons, for which there appears no cure. Expecting uplift, audiences of the day may not have responded, but viewers during the years between have, recognizing In a Lonely Place for the noir classic it is. This quietly disturbing portrayal of one man's inability to cope continues to resonate beyond the confines of today's slam-bang world. So whatever you do, don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Just couldn't wait to see this one on the big screen for the first time. It's a mystery why this film doesn't get the same love and respect as some of the others from this era. It is one of Humphrey Bogart's finest performances and one of director Nicholas Ray's first films. It also has a terrific performance by Gloria Grahame, who most will recognize as Violet from "It's a Wonderful Life".Andrew Solt wrote the screenplay based on the novel by Dorothy B. Huges. With numerous changes to the source material, we get Bogie in quite a unique role. He plays Dixon Steele, an aging writer accused of murder. His alibi is his beautiful new neighbor (Grahame) who may or may not be telling the truth to the police. Of course, Steele himself may or may not be telling the truth. In fact, he has such a history of flashing a violent temper, that after he punches a director, his friends just laugh it off saying "oh, that's just Dix".The scenes with Grahame and Bogart are tremendous and we certainly see that they both have secrets, as well as difficulty in accepting happiness. Support work is provided by Frank Lovejoy as Det Brub Nicolai. His wife Sylvia is played by Jeff Donnell, who went on to a long run on General Hospital. Martha Stewart (no not that one) plays Mildred, the perky murdered girl ... well, perky before the murder. Art Smith plays Steele's long suffering agent and only true friend.The film skirts film noir traits, but is equal parts murder mystery and tragic love story. The ending is quite different than the first one Ray filmed, but it is one of the most powerful, emotional endings we have ever received from Hollywood. Some of the behind the scenes scoop make this one even more fascinating. Ray and Grahame were still married during filming, but they no longer lived together. Their marriage ended formally soon after when Ray caught her in bed with his son. Her stepson! If you are a Bogart fan, you need to see this one for his performance. He goes much deeper than in his earlier roles, and watching him teeter between charmer and jerk is spellbinding. His demeanor leaves us doubting not whether he is capable of murder, but rather if he committed THIS one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a Lonely Place was a film I only saw recently, and I loved it. It is a very dark and gripping film, and for me one of the better dramas I've seen about the movie industry. It has a very clever and compelling plot complete with a purposefully bleak ending, helped by brisk pacing, superb direction and sophisticated dialogue and although the film is quite short I felt wholly satisfied at the end.The film also looks wonderful, the cinematography hasn't aged a jot and the scenery and costumes are top-notch as well. George Antheil's music is very atmospheric, and the acting is very good. Gloria Grahame is very well-cast despite the fact the part was specifically written for Lauren Bacall, but playing one of his most complex characters Humphrey Bogart holds the film together in a superb performance. One minute he is funny, somewhat ironic and sympathetic, the next minute especially in the second half he is powerful, dark and quite sinister, Bogart manages these traits wonderfully.Overall, a very gripping film and helped especially by Bogart's fine performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the dream place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great films for me are never just about the 'real' story with some visual beauty, they're about all the puzzling things that bubble up from the soul before the eyes as that story happens. This is one such film, and if you want to know movies and why they work deep in our soul you need to come to it at some point.Okay the story at face value is that a hard-nosed screenwriter on the rebound is prime suspect for the murder of a young girl he took to his apartment to do some reading for him. The woman living in the opposite apartment clears him off the charges before striking a love affair with him, yet somewhere in the back of her head, she can't shake off the nagging suspicion that he might indeed be a dangerous killer.Truth be told I never could quite warm up to the main portion of it. Each time I watch it I am nonplussed until late when it truly blooms. Is it Bogie's frameup, a 'wrong man' story? Is it her nightmare? We start with Bogie as our narrator and protagonist, then gradually move to her as the script he writes takes shape and changes into her hands. Is it about writing? Is it part send up part realistic love story? Who knows. I guess the writers and Ray didn't quite know either. There are at least three films vying for space here, one is the noir about being seen to fit a role in a story, Bogie is repeatedly rumored and later seen to be violent. Layered satire about the story of tinkering with what they see. And third the film I think Ray really poured himself into: all about real urges through the blinds, the dark room of soul where lovers part and some abstract violence in the air.You should know here that Ray was married to his leading lady in this, that during shooting the marriage was coming apart and he was living on the set, which he had built to mirror his own apartment complex. So he was essentially inhabiting a life he had lived, doing this film about love that grows distant with his own wife?a strange, almost metaphysical thing, his own Lady from Shanghai.The apartment complex is a marvelously cinematic space in the old LA style that I hear is now vanishing, with its pillared courtyard and staircases drowned by potted palms, where apartments pool their gaze to the same center. In the old days, they used to build these around Hollywood for studio staff to live and work nearby.It is a film about writing and movies of course, about a violence that is concealed in the story but continuously encountered ahead each time, the writer's violence all through the film disguised as murder. He a writer poring out the story of who he is, she a viewer willing to know.The film is about all those things that momentarily flash in that space between the two lovers, the emotions that rise before the eyes. It isn't all there; you have to work at it like a love affair has gone bad and you're swimming through the bits trying to remember the moment it slipped, the moment always slipping in mind so you swim to it recalling more of the story.I think it is this quality of something disguised and being slowly remembered that creeps into me every time I see this. It slowly builds like the Zen poem about walking to where the stream begins and there watching the clouds go by with an old man you met by chance.It's all in the last scene I think.The original ending was typical noir, lurid and clean like the book the film is based on. Ray felt it didn't work and at the last minute cleared the set and had Bogie and his wife improvise what we see. You need to watch it for just this. For me it is all a haze except this one bit, which anchors everything. Each time I watch it it takes my breath away.Lovers part, knowing it couldn't work, fooling themselves that it might have if only a phone had rung a few hours earlier. We see here a narrator who has not just concealed the crime in the story we see, a story inspired by her. He has committed the crime of course, and changes it in the story only too late. It's that he himself cannot recall. The crime being that in order to tell the story he had to take time away from loving her, inserted early as murder of a beautiful girl. It's all a moment of love that he wraps into paper, whispering into it all the things he didn't say, changing it?Words. There's just something about it, indefinable. I think what happens is that this one scene has a much more evocative air, pushing everything we have seen prior to a dreamlike distance. I think it worked this way by accident because Ray wanted this last goodbye in a film that was coming together quite differently. But it changed everything.I can see why Lynch used the same apartment complex (or similar) in Mulholland, implicitly knowing that it is all narrated from this moment. Noir Meter: 3/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly one of the great noirs, "In a Lonely Place" was directed by Nicholas Ray and stars Humphrey Bogart, Gloria Grahame, Frank Lovejoy, Jeff Donnell and Martha Stewart. Bogart plays Dix Steele, a well-known Hollywood screenwriter who is very choosy about what he writes. He's asked to adapt a book, and instead of reading it, he invites the coat-check girl (Stewart) to tell him the story, as she's just finished the book. She has a date; she cancels it for the opportunity. He takes her to his place, where she acts the book out long enough for him to decide it's a piece of junk. Exhausted, he gives her money for a cab and sends her to the stand around the corner. Several hours later, an old friend (Lovejoy) who is a police detective, appears at his door. The girl has been found dead in the canyon. Dix, known for his violent temper, becomes a suspect. A beautiful woman (Grahame) who lives across the courtyard from him saw the girl leave and becomes his witness - and his girlfriend. They're madly in love, but his sometimes dark moods, his quick temper and his predilection for fistfights makes her wonder if he isn't guilty of the murder after all.This is a fantastic film with a wonderful, biting script, great direction and superb performances. More than a murder mystery, it's a psychological drama about two scarred people who come together somewhat late in the game - but is it too late? Bogart plays a basically good man who has some demons but in loneliness is willing to open himself up to love. He's such a complete character - vulnerable, passionate, angry, generous - full of contradictions - this is one of Bogart's best roles, if not the best. The look on his face when he tells Laurel that he's been without someone for so long - incredible. Grahame's Laurel is sexy, mysterious, flirtatious and cautious - yet she finds herself totally engulfed in her love affair with Dix, though she fears he isn't quite right. "Why couldn't he be normal?" she asks, as if she would have been attracted to him if he had been. Dix's edginess comes with a price - the question is whether she's willing to pay it.The rest of the cast is excellent: Art Smith as Dix's long-suffering agent who loves the guy in spite of everything: Frank Lovejoy as his detective friend, who can't help liking him even if he is a suspect for murder: and Jeff Donnell, who plays Lovejoy's wife, a woman who knows real love when she sees it.What a movie - you really can't ask for more. "I was born when she kissed me. I died when she left me. I lived a few weeks while she loved me." When was the last time you heard a line like that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It was his story against mine, but of course, I told my story better."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1950, Billy Wilder released his latest masterpiece, 'Sunset Blvd.,' a scathing satire on the pitfalls of Hollywood celebrity, delicately drawing a contrast between the deluded and volatile has-been Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and the scheming wanna-be screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden). While Wilder's film deservedly received an overwhelming critical response, and its share of controversy, another impressive, similarly-themed film slipped beneath the radar that same year. For decades, director Nicholas Ray was overlooked and neglected by most film critics, before developing something of a cult following in the 1970s, and films such as 'Rebel Without a Cause (1955)' ? which I first watched just a week ago ? are now recognised as masterpieces. 'In a Lonely Place (1950)' has only now been lauded as one of the finest entries into the film-noir movement, and Humphrey Bogart's performance has emerged as among the most intense and profound in his distinguished repertoire. A brooding study of aggression, trust and success, Ray's film meticulously deconstructs the Hollywood myth, revealing a frightening world where the man you love could very well be a murderer.Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) is a down-on-his-luck screenwriter, an unsuccessful artist who resents being pressured into writing hackneyed, unoriginal scripts, which are guaranteed money-makers for the studios but possess zero artistic integrity. The morning after he brings home a bar hat-check girl (Martha Stewart) to recite the plot of the novel he is to adapt, Steele is hauled into the police department to explain why the girl was found murdered, her strangled body dumped from a moving vehicle. Appearing almost indifferent to the crime, Steele declines all knowledge of the homicide, and his story is shakily corroborated by a neighbour, Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame), with whom he forms an intimate relationship. As Steele begins to pen his latest screenplay, he uncovers an outlet for his pent-up aggression, however, when Laurel betrays a lingering suspicion that her love might possibly have perpetrated the horrific murder, he threatens to lash out in a fit of violence, only further cementing her misgivings. By the film's end, the tragedy of the couple's relationship is revealed: whether or not Steele actually did commit the murder is almost irrelevant; what ultimately dooms their romance is that he conceivably could have.In an obvious critique of the Hollywood studio system, Steele bitterly condemns the career of a successful producer, accusing him of remaking the same movie twenty times and of being a "popcorn salesman." The producer, apparently comfortable with his prosperous but creatively-deficient profession, snidely reminds Steele that everyone in Hollywood is inherently a "popcorn salesman," so why fight it? It's this notion of creativity ? or, rather, the lack of creativity in film-making ? that forms the heart of 'In a Lonely Place.' There's no doubt that Dixon Steele is a talented screenwriter, but his reluctance to allow his work to be influenced by popular opinion makes him feel trapped and alone, as though Hollywood is attempting to stamp out his genius. His frustration with the film-making business is allowed to accumulate steadily within, before being unleashed in adrenaline-charged explosions of aggression and violence. From here is born the dilemma of Laurel's relationship with him: it is Steele's creativity with which she most assuredly fell in love, but this gift is intrinsically linked with the hostility of which she is so frightened.</fullReview>

There is interest and intrigue all the way though as the masterful script somehow keeps things light as moods darken. Not a moment of the film escapes the brooding, fascinating presence of Boogie and I can't think of any other actor who could have carried off such a mesmeric performance....another feather fluttering off the cap of the Oscar folk for not rewarding such a performance.Bottom line....a gripping film, more watchable as the sky darkens.</fullReview>

A brilliant decision to resist the temptation of a 'twist' ending. But was it a spontaneous decision to chnage the ending If you look at the trailer on the DVD extras, there appears to be another ending with laurel getting the phone call and running to Dix and embracing him - does anyone know if this was a serious ending or was it just shot for the trailer to give the appearance of a more conventional romance ?

		<fullReview>"There's no sacrifice too great for a chance at immortality." ? Dixon SteeleNicholas Ray's "In A Lonely Place" stars Humphrey Bogart as Dixon Steele, a down-on-his-luck screenwriter who becomes the chief suspect in an ongoing murder investigation. As the police look into him further, Steele falls in love with his neighbour, a young actress called Laurel Gray. Gradually the strain of the murder investigation brings out Steele's more violent tendencies. He gets into fights with various characters, acts increasingly paranoid and begins to resent being a suspect. Unable to live with such a volatile man, the film ends with Laurel terminating her relationship with Steele on the very day the police prove him innocent.One of Ray's finest films, "In A Lonely Place" does well to undercut Humphrey Bogart's typical screen idol persona. Bogart's as sexy, cynical, world-weary, noble, witty and smart as he's always been, but Ray also wants us to focus on the bags under his eyes, his fragility and the tremendous, almost existential pain Steele seems to exude.The film's first hour moves like magic. Steele's constantly spewing caustic sound bites, the character preoccupied with asserting his own superiority over those around him. He has no tolerance for the dim, the deluded or the superficial, choosing instead to mingle with an "authentic" band of drunks and other humble characters. Afterall, he's an artist, dammit! He ain't human like "normal" folk! But as the film progresses, it gradually becomes a dissection of doomed romanticism, the suave tough guy peeled away to reveal something bitter and sometimes pathetic. Dixon Steele, in short, is a classic depressive. He's also dangerously amoral, insisting that a girl find her own cab, refusing to show empathy for a murdered woman, remorseless when shown graphic photos of a crime scene and strangely aroused when given the chance to re-enact a violent murder. His insensitivity's a shell, though, designed to protect what is really a sensitive soul. He feels, senses and cares more than those he deems oblivious, but must become cold to stave off his own suffering.Indeed, Dixon is remarkably similar to Jim Wilson in Nicholas Ray's own "On Dangerous Ground". Both characters seem to suffer from what Sartre called "existential nausea", or what modern psychologists are beginning to term "depressive realism"; the belief that certain overly sensitive people - often with self-destructive personalities - have a more accurate view of reality, a more realistic perception of their importance, abilities and context. Such people typically exercise excessive rational control in all situations, no matter how petty or insignificant these situations may seem. They possess a sort of super rationality, their lack of illusions generally associated with a personality oriented towards growth and learning. This is in contrast to "healthy human beings", who are more likely to erect various mental blocks, self-imposed delusions essentially keeping them anchored and "sane" (whereby sanity is really a form of mass, shared psychosis). It may be silly to psycho-analyse a film character to such an extent, but Ray, a bisexual, drug user and alcoholic who constantly battled depression, frequently populates his films with such characters. These are not only outsiders, they are aloof outsiders who resent themselves as much as they deem those around them abhorrent. These feelings tend to give rise to a toxic blend of self-destructiveness and self-obsession, the ego inflating only because the organism knows just how worthless it really is (see Ray's "Bigger Than Life", "Rebel Without a Cause"). Visually, "In A Lonely Place" is remarkable. Ray literalizes Dixon's alienation by placing his apartment below his lover's (as though he's not worthy of her), and has his apartment morph into a mass of prison bars, columned curtains and closed Venetian blinds. Elsewhere the film is awash with noirish, inky blacks, an aesthetic which suits Bogart perfectly.Incidentally, the film seems to reflect a certain fear that was prominent in Hollywood at the time. This was a period when Hollywood became the focus of the House Un-American Activities Committee, an investigative committee that tracked down "communists" and those affiliated with left-wing groups. During this time many careers were destroyed or threatened and numerous people within the film industry were blacklisted (Ray was himself a member of a left-wing, political theatre group). "In A Lonely Place" captures the paranoia of this era, perhaps unintentionally.Elsewhere the film makes several cynical jabs at the film-industry. This is not a satire, of course, but Ray is nevertheless constantly poking fun at what he deems a vacuous Hollywood. Despite this, Ray also manages to capture the romance of the movie industry. The aptly named "In A Lonely Place" exudes a sense of community, shared love and camaraderie, and offers a fine depiction of life on the fringes of Hollywood.10/10 ? Following a DVD release in 2003, "Place" has steadily grown in appreciation. It is now frequently ranked as one of the best noirs, is often cited as containing Humphrey Bogart's greatest performance and is touted by many as being Nicholas Ray's finest picture. Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a classic. I have just seen it for the fifth or sixth time and it never fades. Here we have director Nicholas Ray delivering one of his best. The film's relentless tension is greatly assisted by a highly superior musical score by George Antheil. Bogart's performance is one of his greatest. His ravaged face (which Ray said was 'a living reproach'), his conveying of a twisted interior struggle, suppressed rage erupting as violence against hapless people who cross his path at the wrong moment, his demons, his need for love and the near-impossibility of his accepting it, are all etched by the acid of tragic fate upon the celluloid. Ray cast his wife Gloria Grahame as the female lead, for which she was perfect. It was one of her calmest dramatic performances, and in it she was more normal than usual. A tremendous air of hidden doom pervades her, her sinister masseuse, her ambivalent past, the mystery of her having run off and hidden from her last lover, all of this cascades down upon her as the climax of the film's drama nears. This noir drama is more complex than most, as it deals more with the psychological limitations of the main characters than it does with the action of the story: 'I loved you for a few weeks'. The intensity of the need, the harrowing tussles with innate character flaws, the doubts, the highs, the lows, this is all shown with great power and force, as these two half-wrecked ships meet in the night. This film is also a sad lesson in the relentless and heavy hand of bureaucracy, and the havoc it wreaks in its thoughtlessness. The story has two damaged people clinging on to each other with the ferocity of drowning limpets. Art Smith is wonderful in a character part as an eager agent. In fact, there are many wonderful character parts in this rich and endlessly fascinating film. The whole thing is just what Nicholas Ray desperately wanted it to be: a work of art. The hopeless recklessness of his own personal character deeply suffuses this melancholy tale.</fullReview>

(Humphrey Bogart to Gloria Grahame) One of the most romantic, poignant and haunting lines ever spoken in film. Bogart and Grahame sizzle giving Oscar worthy performances in this heart ripping gutsy tale. A hot-tempered screenwriter (Bogart) is a suspect in the murder of a hat-check girl, his acquitting alibi a neighbor (Grahame). As romance between the pair grows so does her suspicion that he may well have committed the murder. Nicholas Ray's direction brings out the chemistry of not only Bogart and Grahame but also the excellent supporting roles of Frank Lovejoy and Carl Benton Reid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nicholas Ray Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could almost be a precursor to Antonioni's Blow Up" as this film deals with a character circumstantially caught up in a brutal murder, whose bouts of uncontrolled anger and depression make him immediately suspect because he was the last person to see the girl alive. However, the film rather than zoning in on the crime, the victim, the investigation revolves around an unlikely budding relationship between a good Samaritan `guardian angel' who appears in the nick of time to alibi Bogart's character and may stay on to rehabilitate him, but then maybe not ... This film gives us that rare view of the sometimes unglamorous business of making films and the individual tolls taken on some by the process. `Sunset Boulevard,' `The Player,' and `The Bad and the Beautiful' are three others among many excellent films on the subject.Nicholas Ray remains one of films least revered Directors, yet he gave us some of the greatest, including `Rebel Without a Cause.' </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicolas Ray vs Billy Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There must have been something in the air in the Hollywood of 1950, as two writer-directors independently made two movies that share some remarkable similarities. Observe: From Sunset Blvd.: Joe Gillis: "You'd have tuned down Gone with the Wind!" Studio exec: "No, that was me. I said, who wants to see a Civil War picture?" From In a Lonely Place:Studio exec: "What does it matter what I think? I'm the guy who tried to talk Selznick out of doing Gone with the Wind!" From Sunset Blvd.:Joe Gillis: "Audiences don't know somebody sits down and writes a picture. They think the actors make it up as they go along." From In a Lonely Place: Girl: "Before I started to go to work at Paul's, I used to think that actors made up their own lines." Both Sunset and Lonely Place contain a screenwriter on the skids rediscovering his inspiration by the grace of a woman, a cynical self-portrait of tinseltown, a love affair that blossoms at first but eventually disintegrates and a murder. In a Lonely Place also deals more overtly with what may well have been a hidden theme in Sunset Blvd.: the disillusionment and mal-adjustment of the men coming home from WWII.However, in Sunset Blvd. all these elements form a well-integrated unity, while in Lonely Place they remain disparate pieces that keep getting in the way of each other, as if fighting for screen time.Nicolas Ray tries to do too much: he attempts to make a film-noir thriller as well as a relationship-drama as well as a Hollywood satire, but ends up with a movie that is not very successful at any of those genres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting Humphrey Bogart crime-drama.Novel plot: man (Dixon Steele, played by Humphrey Bogart) with a history of violence is accused of murder, female neighbour (Laurele Gray, played by Gloria Grahame) helps clear his name, they fall in love but she comes to be wary of his violent temper and thinks he may well have committed the murder. Had the makings of a great psychological- and crime-drama. However, the plot is not perfect. The relationship between Steele and Gray seemed rushed, contrived and implausible. It just seemed very unlikely that she would rush into a relationship with such a man, and maintain it after seeing what he is capable of. Especially as her character was one of cool calculation and rationality. Good ending, but not as profound as what it could have been. It was the logical ending, and that's about it.Solid performance by Humphrey Bogart in the lead role. Good to see him play a fallible, vulnerable, far-from-perfect character. Certainly not the good guy or hero in the movie, unlike many of his roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He needs someone to trust him. She needs someone with a gentle hand. She desperately wants to trust him. He desperately wants to be gentle with her. But the small matter of a murder raises doubts about her trust and his gentleness.He is Dixon (Humphrey Bogart) and she is Laurel (Gloria Grahame). Before they know it, they are involved in a relationship. They give each other what they need, and love blossoms, but the specter of an unsolved murder won't be exorcised so easily.In a Lonely Place has been called film noir. I think it fits that genre because of its stylized photography, the background music, and the dialogue that is punctuated by clever quips and dramatic delivery. Unlike some other noir films, it is a psychological study of two people in a relationship.The overriding question of the film is not "who dunnit?" but "can love transform a person?" The murder mystery is driven by circumstantial evidence and supposition. But Laurel cannot gift her love solely because of these. She needs hard evidence, something only a witness could provide. In the end, she herself becomes the witness that must tell the truth of their relationship.I enjoyed this film, primarily because of the acting. But I did enjoy the writing; even though it was stylized, it felt true, allowing the characters to be more than caricatures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Journey into a troubled mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The artist's mind is a funny thing. Only the individual artist sometimes know where they are coming from, and in the case of the down-on-his-luck screenwriter Humphrey Bogart, it's from the darkest places of his soul. As volatile as a bear, Bogart gets violent on the flick of a cigarette, sometimes just-worthy (as with an egotistical bore bragging about his newest film) but usually unjustified as with a young UCLA football player he almost drove off the Sunset Strip. When a young girl who came over to Bogart's plush apartment (pretty nice considering he's a has-been) to explain a novel he has been asked to adapt into a film is murdered, it is his past history of violence that makes him a top suspect, even though he has a strong alibi. That comes from his equally dark new neighbor (Gloria Grahame) who happened to see him saying goodbye to the girl when she left his apartment. Grahame is a lusty femme fatal longing to escape from her brooding nature and disappointing past to lead a normal life. She takes over reading for him where the dead girl left off, but will come to regret it as the demon within Bogart's psyche is revealed and threatens to take her down with him.Anybody who has been in a volatile relationship can relate to Grahame's desire to work everything out, but it can't always be done. Bogart is damned by forces he can't control that make him violently brooding, and that is what takes him inside that lonely place which means that he will most likely always be alone, as long as the suckers for schizophrenic predators don't encounter him and get sucked into his downward spiral.The murder of the young girl is only the set-up for the revelation of this dark side of Bogart's nature. He has played many dark characters before, but never anyone as complex as this one. Today, he'd just go into anger management classes or take medication for bi-polar disorder, but in 1950, characters like this simply had to live with it, and the people who loved them suffered usually in silence. Grahame comes the closest she ever did to a leading lady part, giving a performance totally complex and riddled with conflict in her own psyche as well. A femme fatal in film noir is not necessarily a villainess, and Grahame proved they can, like "Gilda's" Rita Hayworth, sometimes be the victim. Darky written and directed (by the brilliant Nicholas Ray), this is one of those film noir gems deserving of being studied as to the darkness of the human soul we sometimes fight avoid looking into.</fullReview>

The ending of the movie is also good but what stands out in this movie is Bogarts portrayal of an egoistic, hotheaded screenwriter. There are a few loose ends in the movie. The reason why the murder was committed still remains a mystery. How the murder was committed has not been given enough importance.

		<fullReview>The skill of director Ray, script-writer Solt and stars Bogart and Grahame elevate what could have been a limp, lacklustre narrative into something worth the effort, though its impact might not be felt on the first viewing. Bogart plays an author of almost celebrity status who is inadvertently implicated in the murder of a young woman (Stewart) in his apartment complex. Beguiled by his new neighbour (Grahame), herself cautious of his deeply insecure behaviour, Bogart's vulnerable character and damaged ego proves too much for her to bear, as she must contest not only his erratic psychological state but also the prospect that he may be a murderer.Despite the obvious age difference, Bogart still manages to bring his sage charm to bear upon the glittering Grahame, herself more than equipped to compete with his mega-star profile. Jeff Donnell has a substantial supporting role as the wife of one of Bogart's policeman buddies (Lovejoy), but who is concerned for Grahame's welfare based on her assessment of Bogart's anxious and often jealous behaviour.It's s tense psychological drama with a strong narrative that in my opinion, improves with each viewing, revealing more layers each time. While it may not rate among Bogart's populist movies, if you can grasp a plot that's almost entirely an implied thriller, then "In a Lonely Place" should soon become one of his most enduring film legacies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Noir Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Nicholas Ray's characters always carried a vast amount of emotional weight, as demonstrated by films such as On Dangerous Ground (1952) or the landmark Rebel without a Cause (1956). Emotional complexity was no stranger to his 1950 film In a Lonely Place, a film which showed an uncommon depth for the period while also featuring some innovative commentary on domestic violence. The main character, played by Humphrey Bogart in one of his greatest performances, is the quick to anger, disgruntled screenwriter Dixon Steel.Steele possesses a temper so brutal that it forces the people around him to consider that he may be guilty of the brutal murder of Mildred Atkinson, a hat-check girl who was last seen with Steele. His temper is introduced to us in the film's opening scene, following a quick dispute with a man driving the car beside him. As the police begin to investigate the murder of Atkinson, previous reports involving a violent Steele arise. Later, Steele's violence is again shown on the screen. This building suspicion causes us to share the paranoia of Steele's girlfriend, Laurel. Though she loves Steele, she is perplexed as to whether it is safe to be with him.In the beginning, Steele doesn't see anything especially wrong with these fights. Rather, he feels he is usually in the right, and it is only when he begins to realize his violent moods can hurt those he loves that he reconsiders his actions. His eventual remorse makes it easy to sympathize with Dix as it gives the illusion that he isn't a bad person, but that he really can't help himself.The tone of the film is pure noir, with a very ominous mood that gets darker as the film goes on. There is an excellent and unpredictable climax. The cinematography is gorgeous, but it lacks the stark expression present in other noirs. However, if you're only watching this kind of film for its cinematography then you're missing the point. In a Lonely Place is a dark and suspenseful character study by one of classic Hollywood's greatest, and it still holds up well even after 60 years.</fullReview>

There is something askew in the on-screen relationship between Mr. Bogart and Ms. Grahame. Hidden between the carefully positioned paintings on Grahame's apartment wall and the arch of her eyebrow is a love story that does not quite convince; now, if they'd had mixed her romantic feelings with some ulterior motives, director Nicholas Ray might have had something that lined up perfectly...Otherwise, "In a Lonely Place" offers a superb Bogart performance and generally grand work by all...The characterizations surrounding Bogart's pornographically named "Dix Steele" - erstwhile agent Art Smith (as Mel Lippman), annoyingly chatty Martha Stewart (as Mildred Atkinson), and washed-up "silent movie" actor Robert Warwick - all help the film hit home. Interestingly, Grahame's rough-rubbing "Martha" (Ruth Gillette) needs exploration. Like two other famous 1950 films, we see some thespian bad dreams. In real life, the director caught one of his stars in bed with his 13-year-old son. Like this film's principals knew, Hollywood loneliness is often filled with drugs and younger sex partners.********* In a Lonely Place (5/17/50) Nicholas Ray ~ Humphrey Bogart, Gloria Grahame, Frank Lovejoy, Art Smith</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well its so lonely, Baby. Lonely...lead character, story line and atmosphere. In a Lonely Place finds Humphrey Bogart playing Dixon Steele, a Hollywood screenwriter in need of another big hit. Steele is moody, a bit lonely and potentially violent; there is a stored anger making him a strong suspect of murder, when a young hat-check girl(Martha Stewart)is found murdered. She was last seen at his apartment. Dixon sparks a romance with his neighbor Laurel(Gloria Graham), the only witness that can prove Steele's innocence. The police keep applying pressure on Dixon because his past makes him a perfect murder suspect. His frequent hot-tempered behavior can only make him look like he has something to hide. The romance turns iffy and Laurel suspects that the police may just be right in their assumptions. Bogart is so effortless in this role; part of his greatness. Other players: Frank Lovejoy, Carl Benton Reid and Art Smith. Kudos to director Nicholas Ray and screenwriter Andrew Solt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconventional noir where the character's demons don't pack heat and wear trenchcoats, they're inside him...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a story of Hollywood's forgotten people: forgotten writers "who haven't had a hit since before the war", unsuccessful actresses who "only starred in a few Bs", drunken actors who "haven't been able to remember their lines in ten years", the lazy directors who've "been remaking the same picture for the past twenty years" and clingy agents with ulcers "who tried to talk Selznick out of making Gone with the Wind". The 'lonely place(s)' of the title are quiet bars where these nobodies congregate; the seedy apartment complexes which they return to night after lonesome night; the police stations where they are hauled in for questioning regarding murders; or the places where such murders have no witnesses.Screenwriter Dixon Steele (Bogie) is a suspect in such a case, where the script reader he brought home to synopsise what turned out to be a trashy romantic novel was killed on her way home. His old war buddy Brub Nicholai thinks he's innocent but police Captain Lochner has different ideas. However, he is saved when lovely Laurel Gray from across the way provides him with an alibi, seemingly because she "liked his face". We, at this point, have no idea whether he's guilty of such crimes or not. However, it would seem possible, as his evident short fuse is lit by a thuggish motorist in the opening scene at the traffic lights. Steele's steely indifference to the crime scene photographs presented to him wouldn't exactly suggest otherwise either. But we also know him to be a WW2 veteran, and he's not exactly unused to bumping people off, in the movies that is. So he gets off scott free with us and them, because you can't arrest a man "on lack of emotion".Dixie's new love affair with Laurel reinvigorates his creativity, so much so that he even sets out to polish the turd that was the trashy romantic thriller the deceased gave him. This allows for a self-referential dialogue about writing a love scene between Humph and Swanson. It also reinvigorates his longtime friend and agent Mel Lippman who feels his ulcers clearing up when he hears the good news, along with the other hangers-on. Meanwhile, Lochner digs up Steele's records to find a violent past and Ms Gray discovers his dark side in a lonely place by the roadside when he beats a college football star to a bloody pulp for calling him something "REAL bad", but not really.In the end, Dixie announces his plans to marry Ms Gray in Vegas and his screenplay is picked up by almighty producer Brodie, whom we never see, but by that point he's alienated all his friends at a dinner where he showed a little too much of his dark side in a public place. At the police station, the script reader's boyfriend has confessed to her murder after an exchange of bullets and a relieved Nicholai calls up his pal to tell him the heat's off, just as he's strangling Laurel after finding her hand ringless and her suitcase packed on the bed. Dixon Steele walks out into the night, his loneliness consuming him once again. As Mel warned her, "he was dynamite. He has to explode sometimes!"'In a Lonely Place' doesn't follow the usual codes and conventions of film noir. The opening titles seen in the rearview mirror of Bogie's car may denote hardboiled pulp fiction, but after the initial murder of Mildred Atkinson, there is no blackmail or death threats or even gangsters to concern Dix. A more typical perspective for this noir to be told from would be that of Atkinson's lover Kesler, in a story about a guilty man trying to hide the truth from the police after killing his girlfriend in a 'Fit of Rage'. Like it? I've seen it too many times. Everybody in this movie is trying to help Dixie in some way, be it his agent Lipman or femme vivante Laurel or friend Brub in the police but it's his inner demons which hold him back from romantic relationships and a professional career. The working title for the picture was 'Behind the Mask', which happens to slip off Humph by the end of the film. And it says something about an actor who can make you like his character even when he's callously making jokes while flicking through photos of a dead young woman or smiling as he visualises the strangling of the young woman at his friend's dinner table. Some say this is the one role which came closest to the actor's actual persona. See for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Bogart . . . I'm a fan . . . however, (SPOILER ALERT!!! from here on out) the character he plays in this movie has got to be one of the biggest assholes ever! It isn't really explained WHY he is a supreme asshole -- he just is. And, if you "love" him, you are just supposed to tolerate it. An ex-Army buddy says, "He's dynamite and bound to explode once in a while -- ya gotta take the good with the bad." Maybe it wasn't the army buddy -- it may have been his "agent" (whom he socks around).Dix (Bogart) gets accused of murdering a young woman he'd been seen leaving a club with. He is a primary suspect for pretty much the entire movie. I (personally) never believed he killed her. I think the audience is "clued in" early on that he did not. So, there's no suspense there. It may have been a better film if the audience wasn't informed of this and we were all wondering, "Did he do it?" An attractive woman who lives in the same building complex eyes him and lets him know that she "Likes what she sees". So, pretty soon they are a "couple." But, as much as she likes/loves this guy, she also realizes he is not quite "normal". At one point she sees him lose control and almost beat a guy to death with his fists (and about to bash his head in with a rock) over a traffic incident!I did enjoy the locale, sets, and some of the scenery. The acting is pretty good. But I'm not sure anyone under 60 would enjoy this B&amp;W film, which is quite dated compared to the tastes and standards of 2015. The movie is mostly much ado about nothing. What is the point? The point is (I hope), if you EVER encounter a guy like Bogie, RUN (don't walk) the other way!There IS "something wrong with him" lady. You are right! This movie came out in 1950 and I hope that Bogie wasn't any kind of 'role model' for anyone with *this* film. He is the kind of guy that gives "guys" (in general) a bad name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film at times brilliantly goes out on a limb in the context of 1950. The seeming lesbian masseuse- why? Probably because it pushes the 1950 envelope.Throughout the film Bogart displays signs of anxiety with subtlety and believability. Bogart really inhabits the role. The empathy between Dix and the old alcoholic actor Charlie is a brotherhood of two less than perfect individuals. Empathy also seems to exist by all the women in this film for Dix who they find "interesting" or at least instinctively feel something for him.Independents in film in those days could fortunately hire talented iconoclasts such as director Nicholas Ray and the composer of this film's fine theme- the little known George Antheil. Bogart the producer is able to achieve such independent strong moves. Bogart's well-known brave (for the times) minority race stance is well represented by a talented woman singer/pianist and by Dix trusting the black working man on a sidewalk. 1950 Beverly Hills is beautifully evoked by those intimately familiar with the place and time.Angel on the verge of lurching from the abusive ex "Baker" to the brute (her words) Dix is a subplot for the female lead character- will she go out of the frying pan and into the fire? The visceral battlefield-like scene when Dix picks up a rock is clearly an instinctive survival flashback. There were tightly wound-up men after WWII just as there are after all recent wars. "In a Lonely Place" will make you think and will wrench a reaction from you in some way- you would have to be numb not to respond to this thoughtful masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dixon Steele is an on the skids screenwriter who has the chance of a comeback. He's a Hollywood veteran, full of rough, prickly edges that invariably rub everyone he brushes against the wrong way. Anger management problems, and a volatile temper are part of his resume. This is a part custom made for Humphrey Bogart and he excels at playing the character of this troubled man, one with vulnerabilities, loathing weakness or concession, and acting out his frustrations through explosive rages of smash out. Steele's been recruited to turn a thick soap opera of a book into a screen blockbuster. He feels his past Hollywood creds make this kind of popcorn melodrama beneath his talents. But he needs the career re-surge and the money so he takes it on. Too jaded to read the source book himself, acting on casual impulse, he enlists the assistance of a young, credulous hatcheck girl he knows from one of the watering holes he frequents. He takes the girl, Mildred Atkinson, to his place to give him a verbal summary of the book, and with this brief encounter, all his trouble begins. Enter his new neighbor whose apartment faces his across the patio of the court apartments where they both reside. They scope each other out warily, sensing mutual attraction, Laurel concluding, "She likes his face." Laurel Gray is a jaded blonde babe, a starlet who's been around Hollywood long enough to know the game and the ways to score. As their relationship develops, Dix sizes her up as one of the Hollywood dames "not so good with arithmetic, BUT ask them how many minks make a coat!" Gloria Grahame playing Laurel is the perfect pouty lipped, narrow-eyed, tough noir broad making her the ideal female counterpart for Bogart's domineering, demanding Dixon Steele. Two supporting cast members make for some eccentric characterizations, stereotypes right out of central casting who are right in tempo with the storyline. Mel Lippman plays Steele's, patient long suffering agent Art Smith. He's Steele's devoted supporter and uncomplaining lackey. Ruth Gillette is Martha, the masseuse. She's a heavyweight bruiser, Laurel's confidante, whispering poisonous sweet nothings in Laurel's ear as she "therapeutically" kneads her body. This is director Nicolas Ray at his best, just the kind of cynical, character driven material he excelled at putting on the screen. It's a bonafide classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Realistic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I'm a fan of Humphrey Bogart. Two of his movies (Casablanca and The Big Sleep) are in my all time top ten list. I had never seen this one, so was prepared to like it.But wow, I am really impressed. This ranks as one of the finest acting performances ever in any movie. Bogart is chillingly realistic. Having reached "a certain age" let me assure you there are people like this in the world. The little nuances of expression and motion that Bogart shows are stunning. Not just in the scenes where he smolders with anger, but for instance in the scene near the end in the bathroom where he tries to apologize to his agent.Gloria Grahame is excellent too. I am glad she was chosen to play this role instead of Lauren Bacall. I also loved the secondary characters: the agent, Sgt. Nicolai, and especially his wife Sylvia, played by "Jeff" (yes) Donnell.The DVD I rented has a very good commentary by someone whose name escapes me, but I highly recommend it. According to him, the ending was not the first one filmed. They first filmed the predictable ending, then changed to this one. I heartily approve! All in all, a superb adult movie. henry</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark side of Bogey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie turned out to be rather surprising, which was mostly due to the performance given by Humphrey Bogart. In this movie he plays a character like we have never seen him before doing so. Apparently the character in this movie also was the most close to Bogart real personality than other movie he has ever played throughout his career.In this movie Bogey plays a more dark, mysterious and temperamental character, that is unpredictable and dangerous to his surroundings with his behavior. It's almost a character like a psychotic killer in a good thriller.This movie can also perhaps foremost been seen as a thriller, though it also is often being listed as a film-noir. It does has some elements of it in it but foremost it's mostly just being a thriller/drama really. After all, film-noir had already been at its peak before the '50's and it already was a dying genre. Bogart however still managed though to pick out and play typical Bogart roles late in his career before his early death of cancer in 1957. In this movie he also plays a typical Bogart role, even though his character is something that he had never really played before in his career. Its over confident, always smoking, reckless, tough, laid back behavior still ensures that this is a real Bogey part you're watching here.It's a story that progresses nicely throughout and builds up to a nice ending. The main character of the movie slowly changes in the movie, which causes the movie to be for most part an unpredictable one. It provides the movie with some great moments and a suspenseful feeling at times.Director Nicholas Ray, who gained most fame for his work on "Rebel Without a Cause" was perhaps born 10 years too late. He would had made a great early and mid '40's movie director, he really had the right directing style and approach of the story and characters for this. At the time of this movie he was still married to the female lead of this movie Gloria Grahame but they already separated secretly during production. She would later marry Ray's son and therefore her ex-stepson. Only in Hollywood people.A surprisingly great movie with a surprising Humphrey Bogart in it.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a Lonely Place (1950) *** 1/2 (out of 4) An aging Hollywood screenwriter (Humphrey Bogart) is accused of killing a woman but that doesn't stop his neighbor (Gloria Grahame) from falling in love with him. This is a very hypnotic film noir type film from director Nicholas Ray that has a wonderful mystery and a pretty good love story, although it begins to drag a bit towards the end. The real highlight here is the incredible performance from Bogart, which certainly ranks among the best of his career. Bogart does a brilliant job at showing the characters depression and his ugliness but he also manages to show why the woman would love him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ostensibly billed as a film noir, this dark psychological drama is less of a thriller and more a study of bruised souls and the transitory nature of relationships. Humphrey Bogart is magnificent, (it may be his best performance), as Dixon Steele, a Hollywood scriptwriter whose violent outbursts makes him the prime suspect when a hat-check girl he had taken home is later murdered while Gloria Grahame is also superb as the neighbour who provides him with an alibi and subsequently falls in love with him.Bogart's guilt or innocence is not the issue here. What concerns us is his precarious mental state and how his relationship will pan out. (As he is the 'hero', and Bogart, we make the assumption that he is innocent but unlike conventional who-done-its the identity of who then might be the actual killer ceases to concern us). Nor is Steele's occupation of any real note, (his interest in murder could just as easily be explained if he were a policeman or a doctor). This is not a particularly convincing movie about the movie business; it seems almost irrelevant that it is set in Hollywood, but it fits perfectly into Ray's oeuvre as a study of men and women failing to cope, for whatever reason, with the pressures around them. In this respect it is a perfect companion piece to the likes of "Rebel Without a Cause" or "Bigger than Life" or "Bitter Victory". It is certainly one of his best films, darkly pessimistic and thoroughly engrossing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember that crazed, bitter expression on Rick's face when he first lays eyes on Ilsa in Casablanca? Now imagine that same expression stretched out over 90 minutes.That's "In A Lonely Place" to me, one of the great lost-soul movies ever made, and a testament to the depth of its lead actor, Humphrey Bogart. It's not his best film, just maybe his best performance.Bogart plays Dixon Steele, a once-hot screenwriter in Hollywood who has been running on empty since returning from the war. Then he becomes a suspect in the murder of a hat-check girl, a circumstance that oddly leads to Dixon finding the love of his life, a blonde neighbor named Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame). Will Dixon and Laurel find happiness, or will the murder case, and its window into Dixon's darker half, blow them apart?"In A Lonely Place" is set in Hollywood, but doesn't play by its conventions. It's a film noir, a crime drama from the 1950s featuring a loner and shot mostly at night, only it doesn't fit the noir formula. Laurel is pretty, cool, and mysterious, so she should be a femme fatale a la Barbara Stanwyck. Only she isn't. Dixon is suspected of murder, but there is little doubt he's not guilty. The murder itself is of minor consequence; it's the investigation that's fatal to Dixon, exposing the sociopath who lies beneath."Don't you like to talk anymore?" Dixon is asked near the beginning of the film by one old flame. "Not to people who have my number," is Dix's reply.What attracts Laurel to Dixon, his "interesting face" she points out to a police captain near the beginning of the film, turns out to be a mask. We see it slip, enough to concur with the one character in the film who sees Dixon straight, a policeman's wife played fetchingly by the improbably named Jeff Donnell. "He's a sick man, Brub," she tells her husband. He says Dix's just exciting. "He's exciting because he isn't moral," she replies.The brave thing about Bogart's performance and Nicholas Ray's direction is how it makes us agree with her. We see, as only she does, the look on Steele's face when he describes how he would have killed the hat-check girl if he was writing it into his screenplay. He's not completely blasé about her, he does send flowers to her house, but he still makes bad jokes about her demise, even to her boyfriend. Sensitive, he's not.In the early part of the film, we are inclined to take Steele's side anyway, because he's Bogart and because the official voice of disapproval, Capt. Lochner, is such a bluenosed bore. But the great thing about "In A Lonely Place" is how we are challenged from that view by his developing relationship with Laurel. It's a chick flick for guys that way, a romantic film that deals with male insecurities. What man can't identify with Bogie when he stands at Laurel's door, clenching his hands nervously as he waits for her to open it?Not everything about "In A Lonely Place" is great. It just misses the classic level for me on account of some trite dialogue, weak supporting work, and a lame score. But Bogart himself is great. His lisp never seemed so pronounced, nor the bags under his eyes so heavy. Here, he makes his star power fuel his art like few screen legends ever have, a performance on a par with that of Laurence Olivier in his greatest screen role, "Richard III." Just try not looking at that interesting face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no sacrifice too great at a chance at Immortality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>( Mild Spoilers) Released some four years earlier then the far more famous and successful "The Cain Mutiny" where Humphery Bogart played the role of the neurotic and mentally unstable Captain Philip Francis Queeg. The psychological suspense drama "In a Lonely Place" has Bogart in the lead role of Hollywood screenwriter Dixon Steel a forerunner to Queeg but a much more complicated man. Steel inability to control his hair-trigger temper is what makes him in the film the prime suspect in a murder case.Within the first ten minutes of the movie we see Steel involved in two fights over something an average person would walk away from and forget. First a road altercation and later at "Paluls" restaurant when Steels friend, 1920's romantic idol Charlie Waterman (Robert Warwick), was insulted and humiliated by the drunk and obnoxious Junior,Lewish Howard, Steel almost belted Juniors a** into one of the customers table.Not having a hit in years Steel is offered by his agent Mel Lippman, Art Smith,to write the screenplay for the movie "Alysia Bruce" a best selling novel. Tired and needing to go to sleep Steel offerers the restaurant hat-check girl Mildred Atkinson, Martha Stewart, who read the book cover-to-cover to spend the evening reading the book to him. The next day Steel is called to the police station by his good friend Det. Sgt. Nocolai, Frank Lovejoy, and told that he's a suspect in Mildred's murder! Mildred was found at the bottom of a canyon that morning with her neck broken by her killer and it was Steel, the last person who saw her alive, whom the police think is responsible for her death. It's also his getting involved in a number of fights hours before Mildreds murder, as well as Steels very extensive police record for violence, that points the finger at him.Steel is saved from being arrested when next door neighbor Laurel Gray, Gloria Graham, comes forward and tells the police that she saw him in his apartment late that evening after Mildred left and was later found murdered. Steel and Laural begin to have a more then neighborly relationship which leads to him becoming very possessive of her and to the point of almost forcing Laural into accepting his offer of marriage.Charming and witty when he want's to be Steel's uncontrollable temper, especially when he almost kills a young man whom he side-swiped with his car, has Laural who was genuinely very much in love with the talented but very intense screenwriter feel that maybe he was the man who did murdered Mildred. Was she in fact laying about seeing Steel that evening after Mildred left Steel's apartment! and may end up being murdered by him as well?Steel for his part doesn't let up with his violence and jealousy that leads to an volcano-like blow up later at "Pauls". Thats when he feels that Laural took and had his screenplay read by some of their friends. Steel also thinks that she's holding back on him in their future plans to go to Vegas to get married. Which in fact she did out of fear of being alone with the very erratic and temperamental Dixon Steel. Later he even punches out his agent Mel who was just trying to be the peace-maker in this wild affair.Rushing back to Laural's place Steels anger and fury now reaching a white hot fever-pitch breaks into her apartment and it looks like she's right about him being the one who murdered young Mildred Atkinson. But then a phone call from Det. Sgt. Nicolai puts that mystery to an end. But not Steel's psychological problems that he needs to have treated before someone really gets hurt or killed .Early film about mental-illness that may have been a bit too much for the public back then,in 1950. With Humphery Bogart giving one of his most penetrating performances ever as the talented but troubled Dixon Steel. You couldn't really dislike Steel since the way he was portrayed by Bogart and directed by Nicholas Ray, who directed Humphrey Bogart the year before in "Knock on any Door". You could see that he was really a sweet and decent person but at the same time wasn't fully in control of his actions as well as emotions. In Getting professional help, that his agent Mel suggested to Steel that almost had him killed, his temper may well have been kept in check and thus made his relationships with both his friends and associates, as well as perfect strangers, far less stressful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting to compare with book/ radio version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of my all-time favorites, and I don't suppose there's anything I can add to the comments about the movie itself. Except that the final scene leaves you with such a sense of tragedy that it darn near brings tears to your eyes.But I think that anyone interested in this movie might also be interested in its path to the screen -- the book by Dorothy B. Hughes was considerably different.In the book, there's no question about it -- Dix Steele is a crazed psycho-killer. It's a routine story that poses only one question -- how he'll be caught. There is nothing redeeming whatever about Steele. Yes, there's a romance with Laurel, but she's a minor character. She sees there's something wrong with him that can't be changed, and she gives up on him well before the conclusion.The book was rather faithfully adapted on the radio show Suspense in 1947.On the way to the screen, Nicholas Ray dumped about half the story and gave us a much more interesting, much more nuanced tale about a man tormented by his demons -- and who might or might not overcome them and succeed in an adult relationship with a beautiful and complex woman. Our hero has a network of sympathetic friends, all of whom hope he'll see his way out, and whose patience is tested by his violent behavior. They see the good qualities that balance the bad. And then, as sort of a subplot, we also have to wonder if he's a crazed psycho-killer.Man! What a difference! The book is the stuff of a thousand mystery plots, no more subtle or interesting than the ten thousand serial-killer stories that clutter the paperback racks and multiplexes these days. I don't even think there was anything new or interesting about the story in the forties. Seems like there were a jillion movies like it back then. Serial killers were big back in the black-and-white era, too.The book was so uninspiring that it's a wonder anyone in Hollywood bothered optioning it.What may have brought this one to Hollywood's attention is that Dorothy B. Hughes also wrote the splendid "Ride the Pink Horse," which was adapted faithfully for the screen and made a terrific movie.Anyway, if I was ever to compose a list of movies-that-were-better-than-the-book, this would be at the top of the list.Erik Smith Olympia, Wash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite superb! A real tough one this with Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame giving astoundingly believable and gut wrenchingly effective performances. The great dialogue never lets up as we get swept into what at first seems to be a simple murder story. But oh no, Mr Ray is not interested in some simple tale of who killed a hat check girl. He wants to expose the violence within us all for our scrutiny. As the exceedingly well presented romance blossoms between the two leads so we become less concerned for the dead girl and more for where this the violence will explode next or take us. I understand Ray and Grahame had a deteriorating romance at the time of filming and it is certainly tempting to suppose that some of the extreme passions we see on the screen have been stoked by that reality. Not many filmmakers take us so close to the edge with no shred of sentimentality. Great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a Lonely Place is one of the best film-noirs I've seen to date. With the perfect combination of action, mystery, intrigue, romance and dark humour, I believe it is not only one of Bogart's best, but definitely Gloria Grahame's. Performances are so well balanced and believable, it is hard not to be taken in by the story which asks the ultimate question: did he kill her, or not? Plot is as follows: famous screenwriter Dixon Steele, faced with the boring task of scripting a trashy bestseller, has hat-check girl Mildred Atkinson tell him the story in her own words. Later that night, he is told Mildred was murdered and Steele is a prime suspect; his record of violence and his dark sense of humor work against him. Fortunately, lovely neighbor Laurel Gray gives him an alibi. Laurel proves to be just what Steele needed, and their friendship develops into love. Will suspicion, doubt, and Steele's dark ways come between them? In a Lonely Place isn't just a dark murder mystery, it's so much more than that. It ropes you in and doesn't let you go until the movie has finished. It doesn't leave you after it's finished though.. it stays with you for a long time. This isn't one of Bogart's better known roles, which is very sad because it should be as his acting is superb - as is everyone's. A truly thrilling mystery - great for Bogart and Grahame fans and film noir lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a definitely fine movie with a great cast striking a strange note. It seems, that this is also some kind of self reflection of Humphrey Bogart, who, as other comments have remarked, blends together a lot of pieces and patches from other roles, the cultivated loner, the aggressive tough guy and the desperate and easily raging violent Cynic. It also has some reflections by other peoples roles, e.g. the old out-of-business actor mostly drunk and playing for restaurant audiences instead of a real auditorium and the agent tired of his business but not able to let go. And, no offense intended, it was lucky, that the role of the female counterpart was not casted with Lauren Bacall, but taken by the wonder- and beautiful Gloria Grahame. It always leaves me wondering, why she didn't come out a top billing Star in her own right. The actual murder plot : Just a thing events revolve around, not a real centerpiece of the story. If you're looking for crime, you're wrong here. All in all, a masterpiece unjustified relegated for 2nd line attention only. 8/10.</fullReview>

Dixon Steele is an artist whose contradictions resolve themselves only when he is writing and only when he is writing something he is interested in.

		<shortDescription>Memorable &amp; Convincing Performances From Bogart &amp; Grahame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In a Lonely Place" is a downbeat film noir, and not a comfortable film to watch, but it is unforgettable because of the excellent performances of Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame. They are completely convincing as a pair of lovers whose relationship begins by chance and then is threatened by their own character flaws.Bogart is Dixon Steele, a Hollywood screenwriter whose temper constantly undermines his better qualities. Grahame is Laurel, his new neighbor whose testimony is the only thing in his favor when a girl he had met turns up murdered. With Steele still suspected by the police, the two draw closer, but as Steele reveals the darker side of his nature, Laurel is increasingly frightened and begins to wonder whether he was really innocent after all. The whole picture relies on the stars' portrayal of their characters: Bogart fully succeeds in an atypical role, and Grahame gets our full sympathy as we see her inability to get out of a terrifying situation. The story itself is as unpredictable as the characters, maintaining tension all the way to the ending.Bogart's fans won't find this one as much fun as his more famous roles, but he gives quite a performance, and this is a movie that will certainly keep your attention.</fullReview>

I'm amazed how some actors can win Oscars for roles they didn't deserve, and that an actor like this didn't even get a nomination! Stupid...Gloria Grahame is lovely and beautiful, and I think she was perfect for this role. She was a really good actress, and played her role as a woman in love and scared really great.

		<shortDescription>Fear and (self) Loathing in Los Angeles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1950 was famously a great year for women and a terrible year for Hollywood with the releases of "Sunset Blvd." and "All About Eve," long-remembered as brilliant satires on the pitfalls of celebrity. But one film that should be included (and was released the same year as well) is "In a Lonely Place," a film so ahead of its time and so unbearably sad it never received the audience and fanfare it deserved. Indeed, the heartbreak doesn't lie in likable people being tortured by fate but rather a violent man further torturing himself and those around him. It's the most painful film about self-destruction, and one of the best American films ever made.Dixon Steele (Bogart), a washed-up screenwriter with a violent and self-destructing attitude is given the dull task of adapting a potboiler novel into a screenplay. Knowing that this is below him, he takes a hatcheck girl home to tell him the story rather than read it himself. The next morning she is found murdered and Dix is the prime suspect, given his violent past and his lack of an alibi. Luckily, his beautiful neighbor Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame, who was Nicholas Ray's wife at the time) gives him just that and more. In the process of giving his alibi, she lets it be known that she is attracted to Dix, and they begin a relationship. While most romances in film noirs are fueled by lust and physical attraction, Grahame and Bogart make you believe that the romance is tender and true, two bruised, damaged souls finally finding calm and stability in each other. Dix works hard on his screenplay, with fresh ideas and smart dialog, as Laurel has become his muse. But as the murder investigation goes on (surely an allegory for the Communist witch hunts) and Dix is still the prime suspect, the strain causes Dix's violent outbursts to occur more frequently, and even Laurel begins to doubt Dix's innocence, leading to a devastating climax brought upon by their own fears and insecurities. Bogart was famously short, but what he lacked in height he made up for in presence. He didn't need a gun to show his toughness, though it certainly did help. Nicholas Ray took the gun away during their first collaboration, "Knock on Any Door," which prepared him for the role of a lifetime here. Bogart's persona was that of a tough, cynical, world-weary man with a bruised heart underneath. His Dix Steele expands on it as much as it deepens it; never before or after would Bogart be more bitter or romantic, yet Dix is Bogart's most violent role, a man so filled with self-loathing it's almost a surprise to see that he finds love at all. And yet, he never loses his charm, his wit, his intelligence, his heart, even when he's violently confused at the world and himself. Dixon is not a monster, and Bogart certainly doesn't treat him as one. It's as though someone took Sam's self-loathing, Rick's bruised romanticism, Marlowe's intelligence, Dobb's paranoia and blended them all together to create Dix Steele. Many fans think that Dobbs of "Treasure..." is Bogart's best and most psychologically complex role, but I think that Dix should not be overlooked--after all, Bogart had to convey a fine balance of both gentle romanticism and quick-tempered violence, and he succeeded masterfully. I can't even feign objectivity when talking about his performance; I think it's his greatest accomplishment as an actor and I'll even go as far to say that his Oscar win for "The African Queen" was a consolidation prize for not being nominated for this film.Laurel Gray is a role clearly intended for someone like Lauren Bacall. Bogie naturally wanted his wife for the role but Warner Bros. refused to release her from her contract...so instead the director's wife got the role. But despite the questionable and usually wrong move of casting a spouse/family member, Gloria Grahame (best known as the town flirt in "It's a Wonderful Life" and the scarred moll of "The Big Heat") gives her most restrained performance as the cool but not cold, bruised and mysterious starlet. She brings a sense of maturity and an air of having been around the block a few times that Bacall couldn't have, given her off-screen marriage to Bogart and her blossoming career.Nicholas Ray would go on to make bigger projects, including the ultimate teen angst drama "Rebel Without a Cause," and likewise Bogart and Grahame would go off to win Oscars, but this black gem stands out as a professional high-point for all three. Never again would Ray be more self-confessional, Grahame be more cool, or Bogart be more vulnerable, surrendering to the internal demons even he does not understand. IN A LONELY PLACE is among the most personal and wise studio films to look at adult love in all its insecurities and fears, capturing not only the feel of the Red Scare of the early 50s but the sad realization that nobody can come out a free man in a world where we are all victims of our own fate and powerless in our control over it.The film's most iconic lines are of Dix in the car with Laurel driving, saying aloud lines he wants to put in his script but doesn't know quite where: "I was born when she kissed me, I died when she left me, I lived a few weeks while she loved me." These film lines not only sum up the speaker's desperate life of trapped loneliness and despair, being reborn in hope of a new relationship, thriving at the chance of love, then falling back into darkness at its failure; it is Dix's life in a single, poetic phrase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IN A LONELY PLACE offers Bogart an opportunity to do another one of his maniacal characterizations--a brute, a disturbed man who lashes out at all the people who seem to be crossing his path with bad intentions--or so he thinks. He's so out of control that after awhile, although he maintains he's innocent of the murder of a young woman last seen in his company, others around him begin to suspect that he might have been capable of the brutal crime.However, the story never does follow the path of a straight mystery. It soon becomes a character study of two troubled people when starlet GLORIA GRAHAME falls for him, then begins to change her mind about keeping company with a man who might be a killer. The distrust in their relationship is the factor that moves the story forward toward a downbeat ending "in a lonely place".It's a thinking man's film noir, but never reaches its full potential as a thriller even though Nicholas Ray does his best to give it the proper noir atmosphere. Bogart plays a character who is so alienating that the audience can have no sympathy for his plight--and that's the main weakness of the story. Nor is Gloria Grahame's character completely sympathetic when she decides she's had enough.Not likely to please all audiences looking for a good film noir, although there are some who think it is one of Humphrey Bogart's most complex and rewarding roles. In my opinion, it just misses the mark.On the plus side, there are some interesting jabs at the Hollywood scene and screenwriters, but none of it is as probing as SUNSET BLVD. What it does, most of all, is point up the fear factor when there's a great amount of distrust in a relationship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Really Wanted To Like It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start off by saying that I really wanted to like this movie. I gave it so many chances and, admittedly, really liked the first twenty or thirty minutes. The beginning establishes (albeit through unconvincing choreography in the fights, but still) our main character as complex and full of inner demons. He has violent tendencies and after the girl he brings home one night is murdered, it's only natural to think he might have had something to do with it. However, this all goes downhill once Gloria Grahame's character comes in. At first, her character seems strong, independent, and about as bored of life as Bogart's, but once Bogart "falls" for her (in ten seconds) she loses all those qualities. After this, we get to see just how bad her performance is. She reciprocates the "love" in an awful, cliché kissing scene that features typical 50s music rising to a "romantic crescendo" and then the movie shifts focus from the interesting, complex Bogart to the horribly uninteresting Grahame. The rest of the movie is just a huge combination of typical, cheesy romance with hints of "I'm having doubts" because of more horribly choreographed fight scenes from Bogart. Everything feels rushed and unimportant, which makes the entire base of the movie fall apart. The supposed "amazingly tragic" ending is undermined because we don't CARE about these characters. We learn nothing more about Bogart's character and Grahame's? well, what does she have? She must be interesting, right? If she's the main character? Well? she's been with a lot of guys? That's about it. Her character spends the whole movie partaking in romantic banter and worrying about the same thing over and over. Now, why is her acting so bad? Look at any of the reviews on this site, everyone says she is "as usual, amazing" so how could she be bad? Well, I'm not sure what everyone here is smoking, but take a look at her facial expressions. She's always having her right eyebrow up as if she's some kind of prude and her eyelids are always, ALWAYS lowered a bit to seem seducing, I guess? Her tone never changes and during her most emotional scenes all she does is have some fake tears poured on her (but not too much, because the audience needs to see her as "beautiful and perfect" no matter what human thing she does, including crying) and covers her face. Still with the eyebrow, still with the lowered eyelids. She does this throughout the entire movie. In It's A Wonderful Life, her style worked because she was playing a shallow, popular girl, but here she needs to be emotional and sensitive, but also strong, but she just looks bored all the time! Bogart's acting is somewhat admirable. Again, most reviewers say this is his best performance, which might be true. But Bogart was never a top-notch actor, he just played himself in every role, so this probably is his best on THAT scale. He's a lot like George Clooney. He's definitely the best actor in the movie, but I wish the movie focused more on him so we could see the tortured soul of the character and the acting chops on Bogart to bring those qualities out. But instead, we get brief glimpses into that (such as the "fake killing story" scene, which is the best scene of the movie, because of the shadows and vigor with which Bogart talks) and then go into typical romance territory ("I Hadn't Anyone Till You"? Really? As if the point that the characters are in love weren't more obvious?). I suppose these actors (being old) are revered simply for that reason. Bogart was in one of the most acclaimed movies of all time and Graham was another "beautiful face" and "classic" actress. I feel like most people are scared to see that these performances are underwhelming. Again, these performances aren't found in ALL old movies; 12 Angry Men has a great performance from Lee J. Cobb and Henry Fonda and James Stewart if amazing in It's A Wonderful Life. These types of movies seem to go for the "cool" type performances that aren't very human at all. And human is exactly what the character of this movie needs to be (if we only got to see more of him). These things aside, the cinematography is very nice. Dark areas and shadows everywhere adds to the feel of the movie (it reminds me a lot of Bigger Than Life, Ray's later movie, which had masterful use of shadows). The soundtrack is god-awful, like most old movies. It adds nothing but cheese. The supporting performances don't need to do much, but they aren't bad. Again, everything else is just okay. But the central parts of the movie are weak. Very weak. I looked up Ebert's four star review to see if I could understand the reasons why this movie is praised so much and only found a plot summery and typical performance praise for these veteran actors. The ending? is not that great, people. Spoilers, they break up because of the "turmoil" all the crime drama caused and Graham's character tearfully (but still beautifully, just in case you forgot she needed to be pretty all the time) spouts a line Bogart came up with that was so obviously going to come in later. Of course, Bogart didn't commit the murder, but he lost his, oh, god, ONE TRUE LOVE. Again, if you don't care about the characters or give time and thought to the relationship, nobody will care when it comes to an end. And if you're main lady looks at the audience with her eyebrow raised ALL THE FREAKING TIME then the audience might get a tad annoyed and possibly be glad when the relationship doesn't work out. A great plot that could have had potential, but was lost in tired tropes of the times. This is a 4 out of 10. Rock and roll, deal with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many hidden classics in the noir genre that are waiting to be rediscovered by modern audiences. In a Lonely Place is so contained and concise that it could almost be a stage play, while very nearly being a super-metafictional experience.Bogey plays Dixon Steele (yeah, Dick Steele) a Hollywood screenwriter with a very short temper in need of inspiration and a hit. His latest assignment is to adapt a popular novel but he can't be bothered reading it. Instead he pays a girl to recite the story to him until he gets the gist and can wings it from there. When he sends the girl home she is never seen alive again and Dix is the main suspect.His neighbor Laurel vouches for him, but secretly has doubts about his innocence. They begin a turbulent affair, which is just the inspiration Dix has been looking for and he fires out his script with many changes along the way, though the studio just wanted a straight adaptation. Laurel's suspicion of Dix builds as his rage reaches a critical mass and their relationship begins to buckle under the pressure. This is noir after all. Doom slowly permeates everyone's life and there are never happy endings.The themes of artistic aloneness and alienating Hollywood culture remain timeless to this day. Based on a novel by Dorothy B. Hughes the first writer of the movie was himself tasked with delivering a straight adaptation but a rewrite deviated from the material and came up with something new. Bogey loved the script and there are many who say that his own propensity for sudden rage made him the perfect actor for the role of Dixon Steele. The acting and connections between the characters give this film a lot of rewatch value. You really get pulled into their world and dark affair. There are a couple of weaknesses though. The score is often intrusive and tonally inappropriate and a few of the sets are disappointingly sparse. It doesn't spoil the atmosphere too much though.In a Lonely Place is most certainly one of my favorite film noirs and will never be lonely sitting on my shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A profound digging to the core of primitive emotional bog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Humphrey Bogart headlined suspense drama, directed by Nicholas Ray, his fourth feature, also co-starring Ray's then wife Gloria Grahame, IN A LONELY PLACE has enjoyed a steady augmentation of accolades through the years, Bogart's performance is praised as one of his finest, as Dixon Steele, a Hollywood screenwriter with a propensity for violence, who becomes a major suspect of the murder of Mildred Atkinson (Stewart), a hat-check girl whom he had brought home to read him the story of a book, which he has been required to adapt.A key witness is Dixon's new neighbour, Laurel Gray (Grahame), a young lady just gets out of an unfruitful relationship, who attests that Mildred left Dixon's place alone and unharmed. A mutual attraction burgeons rapidly between Laurel and Dixon, and Mel Lippman (Smith), Dixon's long-time agent, gladly finds Dixon is back on track in his works while nurtured by the new romance. But still, the murderer is at large, and Dixon's history of violence starts to take a heavy toll on Laurel, upset by Dixon's escalating outrageous behaviours to either strangers or those who are around him, Laurel begins to question his innocence and develops a deep fear for him, she decides to run away, but, will Dixon let her off the hook so easily and a more crucial question, who is the heartless killer?With the foreground of a plot about murder and the introduction of Laurel as an alluring pseudo- femme fatale, viewers might expect that the picture would be a taut whodunit or a scheming film- noir, however, the film actually dodges them both, Dixon has no motive to conduct the crime at the first place, although Captain Lochner (Reid) once hectors Laurel that the act might be executed by a psychopath, but it transpires that there is rationale behind the homicide in the end of the day. Instead, the remarkable thing Ray and his writers have done is to emphasis on the commoner but far more profound groundings, the two incongruous characteristics between man and woman, i.e. the latter is greatly threatened by man's inbred inclination towards physical violence whereas the former is forever frustrated and infuriated towards the latter's capricious paranoia (quite a dichotomous conclusion might not apply to today's climate of gender politics, but 65 years ago, it is as incisive as any filmmaker can get). So the unsolved murder case becomes a perfect hotbed for the ill-fated lovers to lash themselves into distrust, doubt, fear and anger, until the climax, a belated telephone ingeniously draws to a poignant close.The film is a small-scale production with a lucid narrative, but it is enormously engaging (both Bogart and Grahame are marvellous here), a telling proof that movies can be done in a very economic budget, as long as its story is brilliant enough. However, as the narrative goes on, audience is gradually predisposed to side with Laurel, since the method to externalise Dixon's innate defect is way too progressive, and it becomes rather tough to sympathise with Dixon although Bogart leavens him with astonishing pathos, how can you expect any sensible woman to indulge such a trigger-happy brute, eventually, we feel glad that the story ends that way, but that's not what we suppose to feel, in a perfect world, we should be sorry for both of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good noir, some lame irony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A volatile screenwriter avoids a murder charge on the alibi of his beautiful neighbour, and they fall in love. But the honeymoon gets complicated.Enjoyable noir, with two fascinating leads. Bogart is gruff and smart, sympathetic and overbearing. Grahame is haughty yet supine, and her eyebrows do their thing. Also some unexpected titillation.The plot has a lot of writer as misunderstood hero navel-gazing, plus lame showbiz humour (especially the agent and the drunk Shakespearean actor). Can't say any of the lines really struck home, but the actors work the chemistry. There's a lovely scene at the piano about halfway through that sparks off some confusion in the plot by adding even more to a cast of unnecessary characters, but in the end the emphasis is on the lead actors with a well judged outcome. If only people could get along when they're destined to - howl! Photography is OK, but some great close ups. And the music suits just right.Overall - good genre with great performances. And I just realised where Scarlett Johansson got her inspiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wacky noir with Bogart &amp; Grahame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly the wackiest film noir. Screenwriter Humphrey Bogart has serious anger management issues and finds himself accused of murder. Seemingly too-good-to-be-true neighbor Gloria Grahame helps him out until she begins to have her doubts. Bogart's performance is absolutely explosive and he's well matched with the off-kilter Grahame. Director Nicholas Ray wastes no time in establishing that this relationship is going to be decidedly outré and the film is full of bizarre touches (Grahame's unusual dependency on her masseuse is a real head scratcher). The chemistry between Bogart &amp; Grahame is dynamite and Ray moves this film along at a real brisk clip. It's oddly claustrophobic with it's apartment house/court yard setting but it's also never dark (as most noir films are). Burnett Guffey, who shot everything from GIDGET to BONNIE CLYDE, did the stunning cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screenwriter Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) brings hat-check girl Mildred Atkinson home to tell him a story. She is murdered on the same night. The police consider Dixon to be the prime suspect except that next door neighbor Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) provides him with an alibi. As Laurel gets more and more involved with the volatile Dixon, she starts to have doubts about his innocence.I watched simply for Bogart and he does not disappoint. He plays both sides with perfection. He is perfectly believable as an innocent man. In the next scene, he is perfectly menacing and unhinge. He is masterful in this movie. The only drawback is the ending. I much rather have a darker ending. It is a film noir, I presume. Even if he's not the killer, there are more exciting ways to end this. The ending is a letdown in an otherwise compelling movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Bogart Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typical post-WWII cinematic melodrama, this film oozes era style and expression. The script is talky but the dialogue is sometimes clever. It's a fairly simple story with Bogie playing a washed-up screenwriter named Dixon Steele, troubled and in need of love, who is suspected of murder. Did he do it, or not? Gloria Grahame plays neighbor Laurel Gray who gives Steele an alibi. But what's her angle?The murder mystery is largely secondary to the relationship that develops between Steele and Gray. The initial Act is relatively interesting and so too is the final Act. But the middle part of the plot drags, with what seems to me to be filler and repetitive character inquiry. Thematically, the story is not particularly kind to Hollywood.B&amp;W lighting from cinematographer Burnett Guffey is excellent. Production design and costumes scream 1940s. Women wear expensive furs; men wear suits and ties and those awful hats. Elevator background music is unobtrusive and nondescript. About midway through a piano player sings a dreary love song that's straight out of a cocktail lounge. Characters smoke incessantly because in that era it was the cool thing to do.Bogart gives a really nice performance. But I do not like Grahame in this film. With her raised right eyebrow, she doesn't act so much as ... pose. Her self-conscious facade doesn't vary much; about half the time she looks sullen and unhappy. I would have preferred a better actress.Of the Bogart films I have seen, this is one of his better performances. That, plus the fine cinematography, are the main reasons to watch. That said, I found "In A Lonely Place" to be a tad slow and slightly tedious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Dramatic Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts off with "Dixon Steele" (Humphrey Bogart) almost getting into a fight with the husband of a woman who was initiating conversation with him. Then he goes into a bar and punches a person for insulting one of his friends. Now, in both of these situations there is some justification for his actions. However, as the film progresses we see an extremely violent temperament that arises from almost nowhere in contrast to the witty and creative mind he displays at other times. So when a young female "Mildred Atkinson" (Martha Stewart) he was with is found dead the police suspect that he killed her in a moment of rage. His new girlfriend, "Laurel Gray" (Gloria Grahame) also begins to suspect him as well due to his increasingly possessive nature. Anyway, rather than disclosing any more details I will just say that both Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame performed very well together and gave their roles a great deal of believability. I recommend it to those who enjoy a good dramatic mystery.</fullReview>

He portrays one of his most interesting characters of film-noir cinema and was at a zenith of extraordinary acting.The story is about a screenwriter (Bogart) suspected of murdering a woman that is let off by an intrigued neighbour. However, as the neighbour falls in love with Bogey's character, she begins to suspect him of the murder more and more. The plot and characters develop marvellously. At first, Bogart's character is introduced as an average man, but as the film progresses, he becomes darker and more violent.In a Lonely Place is certainly one of Bogey's best and also one of the greatest noires of classic cinema. It's incredibly interesting and has a charming, dark aura - a thing I respect very highly of good noir(es) films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining, if minor, curiosity item: a combination Hollywood story and murder investigation concerning a hot-tempered screenwriter whose budding romance with a pouty starlet is left in question after the local police suspect him of killing a hat-check girl. Humphrey Bogart, alternately rubbing his forehead and affecting a self-disgusted scowl, can't really get a grip on this character, who is written and conceived on somewhat of a Jekyll &amp; Hyde level. He comes on like a bemused, seasoned veteran of the movie-making scene before suddenly lashing out at his loved ones in an unfocused rage...it's no wonder love-interest Gloria Grahame always looks on the verge of tears! Nicholas Ray directed in a plodding, pedestrian way; Bogart's meaty scenes come off very well, but the police business is sketchy and half-hearted at best. Grahame, married to Ray in real-life, was cast after Bogart's first choice--his wife, Lauren Bacall--couldn't be loaned out. The two stars don't really click together, though their final scene in her bungalow is vividly captured. Overall, a middling effort with some very smart dialogue in the opening reel and a sympathetic supporting performance from Art Smith as Bogart's long-suffering agent. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow I had never seen this film, and what a shame, because it's a really fine film. And, I think Bogart was brave to select this film...after all it was produced by his own company. I say that because, from my perspective, Bogart's screenwriter -- Dixon Steele -- is not a character most anyone would like. Constantly beating people up, forcing his views on others, and probably psychotic. And, Bogart plays the character so well.I have never been a fan of Gloria Grahame, but in this film she is superb. The cast is nicely rounded out by the very steady Frank Lovejoy.That's not to say there aren't problems with this film. For example, the scene with the clearly lesbian masseuse. What exactly was point of that scene? It was clear she was a lesbian, but I couldn't figure out why it was in the film at all. And the ending...no redemption on the part of Bogart's character...there he is, just left "in a lonely place". Seemed like the movie should have gone somewhere else. Love redeems him? Rage leads him to a murder, despite just being cleared of one he did not commit? Just something different.But this is a keeper, and recommended. Bogart's acting here is gritty to an extent I didn't always expect in those days, and the way he transitions from acting normally to rage is a sight to behold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a Lonely Place is based on a novel by Dorothy B. Hughes with the same title. The filmmakers probably went through a lot of trouble when thinking about following the book correctly. The story of this film is also slightly about that. A screenwriter should follow a book, but he's more of an unique artist. In a Lonely Place is a story about a screenwriter who is suspected from murder.Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) is a cynical, lonely Hollywood screenwriter, who wants a random girl to give a summary of a book he is supposed to write a screenplay of. The following day Dixon gets a call-up to the police station and finds out that the girl has been murdered. In the station Steele meets another witness, Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame). As these two loners meet they instantly fall in love. In a Lonely Place is a romantic film-noir thriller.This is one of Humphrey Bogart's greatest roles. It has something original for him (being selfish and cynical), but also something different. The soft and lovely side of Bogart, which can also be seen in Sabrina (1954) and Dark Passage (1947). The writer of In a Lonely Place has said that the role of Dixon Steele is incredibly close to Humphrey Bogart's real life personality. A lonely, selfish man who drinks once in a while. But who in the end is self-confident and a man who respects his own art.The film offers a nice view on Hollywood. In the beginning Dixon Steele talks with a producer who advices Dixon to take a job, a film is a film. But Steele doesn't think like that, he doesn't want to take a writing job he's not interested in. Films are art to him as they are to most of us, to us true film lovers. It's not just a product to sell with popcorn and if you think of the era this was made, the reference I'm talking about doesn't sound crazy. 1950's was the decade when Hollywood started to become more and more commercial.In a Lonely Place has everything a film-noir should have. The use of lights and shadows is marvelous. They create the atmosphere film-noirs should. There's an independent woman and even a music scene. And the tag line "With a surprise ending!" isn't just for making you more excited. The improvised it while filming. I found it great and satisfying.A great film-noir love story about commerciality, the true meaning of cinema, grief and loneliness.</fullReview>

Hughes.The way Humphrey Bogart plays his part as the edgy and cynical man is fantastic.No wonder it's recognized as one of his finest performances.It's really intense his acting, like in the restaurant scene where he loses his nerve.Gloria Grahame, who was married to the director at the time, plays her part as Laurel brilliantly.Lauren Bacall, Bogie's wife, was considered for the part, but Warner Bros. refused to loan her out.Frank Lovejoy does a great job as Det.Sgt.Brub Nicolai, Dix's old army buddy.Jeff Donnell is wonderful as his wife Sylvia.Carl Benton Reid is very good as Capt.Lochner.Art Smith is terrific as Dix's agent Mel Lippman.Martha Stewart plays the part of Mildred Atkinson and she's marvelous.In a Lonely Place is a terrific film-noir.This doesn't tell so much about the murder case than it tells about the love story between those two.There's a lot of great stuff in this movie.One memorable moment in the movie is when Dixon drives very fast and sideswipes another car and beats up the other driver.It shows us how practically anyone of us is capable of killing a fellow human being.The dialogue is brilliant.In the end I'd like to quote something Dixon Steele has written in his screenplay: "I was born when she kissed me.I died when she left me.I lived a few weeks while she loved me."</fullReview>

Dixon is a screen writer who has not written a story in years and has been hired to rewrite a script and he has to read the book. Dixon meets up with a hat check gal who has read this book and Dixon asks her to come to his apartment and tell him about the entire story. Dixon sends the girl home by taxi and then something happens to this young girl and Dixon becomes involved with a murder case and Det. Sgt. Brub Nicolac,(Frank Lovejoy) becomes very suspicious of Dixon and hounds him night and day for a confession. You will never be able to figure out just how this film will end and the film will hold your interest from beginning to the very end. Gloria Grahame looked very young and extremely sexy in this picture and Bogart and Grahame burned up the silver screen together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think the thing i like the most about humphrey bogart is his sense of danger. he's just got that weathered look of a tough guy. for me that's the key to his best movies like "casablanca" and "to have or have not". the tortured soul aspect of his persona makes him the ultimate film noir hero. and never is this more prevalent than in "in a lonely place". here bogart plays fast and loose with the law as a screenwriter accused of a brutal murder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame locked up in an abyss of suspicion - and released at too high a price.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could be Humphrey Bogart's best performance, as a totally unpredictable genius capable of anything with a hidden war record of unknown atrocities, and the many hints at his earlier life as a soldier provides the key to this very interesting character, a man of infinite resources both physically and mentally but not able to control himself. Although you must take for granted from the beginning that he didn't do it, you can't evade getting more suspicious all the time, since everything about him testifies to his capacity of doing something absolutely beyond his control and any motivation, and the scene where he almost kills a guy on the road he has a traffic incident with must raise total alarm. Although you disagree with Captain Lochner, the criminal inspector, for his obstinate and almost obsessive inclination to link Humphrey with the pointless unmotivated murder, you gradually realize he can't do otherwise. Also I have never seen Gloria Grahame more to her advantage, although, just like Humphrey, she is always outstanding. Here, above all, she is more beautiful than ever and the perfect ideal dream for a creative romantic savage like Humphrey's character. What especially adds to the magic, tension and suspense of the film, though, is George Antheil's deeply mesmerizing music, which fills the film with dark and spellbinding moods. It's actually a tragedy, it is gradually built up by no one's intention but only by circumstances of chance, and although everybody goes wrong no one can help it - it's like an inevitable web of destiny, and although it's well set for a happy end at last, everything turns out to the opposite, ending in a big awful question mark, which at best it could lead to a new beginning. The war is over, victory is there, but everything has been devastated in the process. And the tragedy is entirely that of the complex war veteran character so perfectly made real by Humphrey Bogart in all its unfathomable abyss of no return from the loneliest place in the world, the hopelessness of your own fate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My heart was excited when I started it, broken when it ended, and never ceased to pound while I watched it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a remote Hollywood residence, with apartments surrounding a bucolic Spanish courtyard, where loners, wannabe-this and has-been-that gather, in an underdog pound, Nicholas Ray's masterpiece takes place, a lonely place. But wouldn't that be too convenient from the director of "Johnny Guitar" and "Rebel Without a Cause"? Shouldn't there be more than walls, doors, and curtains to define isolation? Wouldn't the title refer to this fortress of misunderstanding, this state of mind that Dixon Steele, Bogart's most tormented character, poignantly embody?Dix, as what's left from friends call him, is a 'Stranger', like Camus' hero, Meursault, in the novel of the same name, a man who disobey the rules but never cheats, a man whose words and actions speak their own variable truth, regardless of society's opinion. His job might explain this apparent passivity; he's a screenwriter. In other words, he's writer, able to translate into understandable actions the subtleties and vicissitudes of people, except himself, and he works for Hollywood, where roaring egos, flatulent whiners, and greedy vultures form a grotesque brotherhood. And this social masquerade echoes the mediocrity of his condition, by adapting trashy novels to make money; he prostitutes his talent for his pimps, Hollywood. And the tone of his bitter personality is set right in the first ten minutes when he joins his friends for dinner, he yells at a disrespectful driver, he insults a director who make commercial movies and punches one who insulted a washed-up silent fallen star. Only Mel, his well-meaning agent tries to calm him, in vain. At least, Dix still has people caring about him, and he does care for some, worn-out, underdogs and loners, like him, in fact, like Bogart himself. This is, according to Louise Brooks, the closest role to Bogart's real-life persona, and if one thing, the film proves that Bogie is never as good as when he portrays hardened, isolated men with a complex personality.Dix is capable of friendliness though, he invites, Mildred Atkinson, a hat-check girl so she can summarize a book to him, but his mind is elsewhere, he thinks of that mysterious woman, they meet a few minutes earlier in the courtyard, Gloria Grahame as Laurel Gray, an actress with a very thin record. She has an eye-catching quality though and she's given a mystical aura in that courtyard, the film's visual trademark, which, from the converging point of tenant's lonely eyes, makes their heart converge this time. Mildred becomes an unnecessary presence, he dismisses her, gives her cab fare and wish her goodbye. Next day, she'll be found brutally murdered. Dix is called by the Police, as the most logical suspect, and his apathetic reaction triggers the Police suspicion, another nod to Camus' Meursault who'd sign his own death warrant by not weeping at his mother's funeral. Yet Laurel Gray provides the alibi, she saw Mildred leaving his home and during the interrogation, she finds Dix an interesting face, and Dix' expression is the closest to sentimental agreement he'll ever get, she's like him, she's alone, she doesn't care, she's an underdog, they're perfect for each other. And Dix, the hardened cynical, to his agent's much astonishment, start working on the project. Laurel became his muse and the romance progresses, until an idyllic beach picnic turns into disaster. Discovering that she was interrogated again and didn't inform him, he drives at high speed, later, he's accosted by a young driver he'd just sideswiped, and beat him unconscious, taking a huge rock to strike his face, before Laurel shouts him to stop. It could've been road rage, or Dix' quick temper, but in the context of a non-resolved murder, has a dangerous resonance in her heart. From that point, distrust and fear will govern their relationship.The genius of the film, is that it takes distance from the original novel, written by Dorothy B. Hughes, and we never know if Dix is the real killer. One scene seems to indicate his fascination for murder, but we're reminded that the man is a fiction writer. His agent Mel knows it's just part of his personality, and the bad must be accepted along with the good, while Effie, the maid advises Laurel to go away. And driven by an inextinguishable suspicion, the film escalates to its violent paroxysm, its existential dead-end where two persons, victims of their own insecurity, and lack of faith in happiness, destroy the unique light of hope that could've made them happy.Bogart is never as perfect as when he portrays tortured and flawed characters, ? la Fred C. Dobbs or Captain Queeg, and Grahame was well-cast, young enough to catch his eye, but old enough to be disillusioned and accept to be with a flawed man, and what a flawed man. I clearly identified with Dix, because I, myself, as an artist and wannabe screenwriter have a spontaneous approach to life, right or wrong, I have my qualities' defaults, so to speak. I have my temper but it's never aimed against anyone but fatality, and why I should censor my only mean of expression. Being misunderstood is the ultimate loneliness, this condition mind that characterizes people with a wonderful intuitive cognition that stops when it comes to their own. Dix was doomed and maybe the line he made up :"I was born when she loved, I died when she left me and I lived a few weeks while she loved me" was the premonition of his own fate. Sure there were more memorable comments on Hollywood's world in 1950, like "Sunset Blvd." and "All About Eve", but their ending will never haunt me as the melancholic and heart-breaking farewell at the end of "In a Lonely Place", one of the saddest ending I ever saw. Dix and Laurel would never be happy again, and while the title might have referred to their wounded past, or geographical present, it will also define their tragic future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"There are many signs of an abusive relationship. The most telling sign is fear of your partner. If you feel like you have to walk on eggshells around your partner?constantly watching what you say and do in order to avoid a blow-up?chances are your relationship is unhealthy and abusive." This is a very nuanced portrayal of an abusive relationship. Bogart/Dixon Steele almost has the classic profile of a chronic spouse abuser: loving one minute, insanely jealous the next. She is independent, he has masculine charm, they are both sophisticated and intelligent - they fall deeply in love. He wants Gloria Grahame to be an extension of his own desires and utterly without independence: he monitors her calls, he is furious when she does anything and does not let him know about it. He has finally resorted to assaulting her by the end of the movie. The difference between Bogart and the classic abuser is that he knows he is wrong and that he lets her go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tightly plotted romance mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a Lonely Place is about Dix Steele (no, seriously) a writer with an unusual personality. The film opens with a couple of episodes which give us tremendous insight into this character. First we see him driving his car. He pulls up next to a woman who knows he is. She explains that she was in a picture he wrote but he doesn't recognize her because, as he explains, "I make it a point never to see pictures I write." This quick barb shows us that Steele is not happy with his own work and perhaps not happy in general but he acts pretty flippant about it. Before the actress has much time to reflect on this comment her husband angrily demands that Steele leave his wife alone. Steele's angry reaction reveals his biggest flaw: a quick temper. Still, the husband is being rude so the viewer begins to feel sympathy for Steele.The next scene serves to emphasize Steele's temper and also increases our sympathy for him. In this bar scene Steele is meeting some of his business associates to talk about an upcoming project. Steele chooses a seat next to a former movie star who has become an out of work lush. Everyone makes this man the butt of jokes...everyone except for Dixon. Eventually he gets angry at an especially rude man and gets in a fight. With these two brilliantly economical scenes Steele has been established as a likable albeit flawed character.The next stage in the film's development of Steele as a character comes about as a result of a police interrogation. A woman he knew has been murdered and he is being questioned by police. However, Steele's demeanor hardly changes at all when he finds out his acquaintance is dead: instead he continues to callously make flip remarks throughout the interrogation.Steele is saved at this police interview by Laurel Gray, his new neighbor and alibi. In the early scenes in which she appears Gray is something of a surrogate for the viewer. First she appears in the third scene, a scene in which Steele is talking to the woman who is later murdered as Gray looks on. Then Gray is brought into this police interview (scene 4) where she provides the alibi.After the scene at the station Gray and Steele become involved romantically. In spite of her knowledge of his limited relationship with the murdered girl, Gray begins to suspect that he may have had something to do with it. After all he does have a quick temper and he theorizes about the murder with a familiarity that might just be attributed to his creative mind...or it may be due to a sinister first hand knowledge. Then there's the tense scene in which he drives recklessly, a scene which is essentially the same as he thinks the murder must have been. His anger finds an outlet in an angry motorist he assaults and nearly kills, but Gray clearly thinks that she might have been a victim if not for this distraction.There are other, more subtle clues that Steele may be involved in the murder. The day after the girl's death we see him sending a package to her family; the day after the beating we see him sending a package to the man he's beaten. The attentive viewer begins to see a pattern in these actions.With In a Lonely Place Nicholas Ray and screenwriter Andrew Solt create a very palpable sense of tension. The acting is first rate, particularly Humphrey Bogart who gives one of his finest performances as Dix Steele. That the film is well shot is almost a given in a film as tight as this. Indeed, all excesses have been trimmed away and even as minor a detail as the names of the characters is used to add meaning to the film. Dix Steele is indeed a very masculine character and he is as unbendable as his surname suggests while Ms. Gray's own Christian name proves to be an ironic comment on her inability to grasp his complexity; she sees everything around her as black or white but never gray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly not film noir...? (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before we get to the review, and the spoilers, I want to recommend this movie. It's exciting, dark and well-paced with excellent performances from both leads.Humphrey Bogart stars as a Hollywood screenwriter with a violent past who is wrongfully suspected of murdering a girl he picked up. Partly cleared by witness who saw her leave his place alone, As other users have commented, this seems to be a somewhat overlooked film in the Bogart canon, but although it's become one of my favourite films to star the old warhorse I can see why some people find it difficult to get along with.First up, there's the character of Dix. Probably better than most of Hollywood's stars of the time, Bogart brings him to life. But Dix isn't a particularly sympathetic character - more of a tragic hero in the classical sense (although he survives to the end): a larger-than-life figure with a fundamental flaw. He's a talented writer but emotionally he's either too detached or too intense... and then there's his temper.How deep this flaw runs is in many ways the theme of the movie, and as it progresses Dix becomes less and less likable - although never entirely - and like us, his lover Laurel (the excellent Gloria Grahame) gets to see him at his best and his very worst. By the end of the movie his emotional state is extremely vulnerable and thus very uncomfortable for the sympathetic viewer.Secondly, there's the uneasy mix of realism and the 1950s. The cops question a key witness in front of the prime suspect. People have relationships, but not sex.Often, too, there's some cognitive dissonance over the combination of messy, lifelike situation and the polished, stylized dialogue of the era's movies. Dialogue which would seem perfectly natural in a straightforward thriller of the era seems strange here because the plot is so atypical.Third we have Dix's dark side winning out and the unhappy ending. If, rather than the quiet defeat which takes place, the cops had burst in and Dix had been guilty after all... well, it'd suck, but it would be more exciting (in a superficial way) and more acceptable both to '50s audiences and to and extent to modern audiences too.But it's *not* exciting - in fact, it's the opposite. The last image of the film is Laurel (the most sympathetic character by a piece), tearful and heartbroken, watching Dix walk away into a bleak future...That's some serious harshness for a '50s flick.Finally, there's the whole "film noir" thing. People these days have a tendency to call and monochrome crime flick a film noir, but it ain't necessarily so.In this case, the movie was and still is marketed as if it's in the crime genre - and yeah, sure, there's a murder - but it's not *about* the murder, or the investigation. It's basically a character drama, dealing with real-life issues in a way rarely attempted by Hollywood movies of the era.Like some of Patricia Highsmith's best novels (Found in the Street being a fine example off the top of my head), this is a story about the effect of a murder on its characters' lives. The death itself, the investigation and even the solving of the case are entirely secondary to the impact these events have on the lives of the characters - which, as I understand it, isn't the textbook description of film noir.This is an excellent movie which nonetheless has a certain awkwardness to modern eyes - it's dated well in some places and badly in others, but it's definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unbelievably underrated and overlooked Bogey film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, this had an extremely unfortunate title for the year that it came out. Events of previous years left the public rather depressed and apprehensive of the future, and a phrase "In A Lonely Place" was so overwhelmingly depressing sounding that even Bogart fans stayed away from this one in droves. Nobody wanted to be "in a lonely place" that year, and they sure didn't want to watch a movie about somebody who was.Of course, the title was a misnomer and wouldn't affect people in this day and age who are hardened to such phrases.One quote says so very much about the movie and what to expect from it: "I was born when she kissed me.Â&nbsp; I died when she left me.Â&nbsp; I lived a few weeks while she loved me."Bogar's earlier roles such as Rick Blaine and Sam Spade were undeniably heroes, although with movie character flaws. Dixon Steele, by contrast, is a controlling, unstable man whose problems are fleshed out or alluded to without apology. Bogart was an actor who inhabited&nbsp;these flawed men he portrayed, men who often bordered on madness. It was so fitting that one of his last roles was in The Caine Mutiny as the captain who finally did more than border on madness.&nbsp; Anyway, Dix Steele is a&nbsp;much more complex, difficult character and Bogart makes you think he's not acting.&nbsp; Just watch the scene where he's describing how Mildred may have beenÂ&nbsp;killed as he insists Det. Nicolai and his wife re-create the killing (in their own home) to be convinced of Bogart's brilliance.The question in this film is not whether he committed the unspeakable act he's accused of, but only whether he was capable of it.The characters who Nicholas Ray and screenwriter Andrew Solt give us are terrifically flawed individuals doomed by their own fates.&nbsp; Steele is controlling, paranoid and unabashedly vicious, but Gloria Grahame's character somehow tames him for a brief period.In a Lonely Place works on many different levels. There's the romance between Dix and Laurel. &nbsp;We also get a&nbsp;scathing&nbsp;look at the superficiality of Hollywood, exemplified by Mildred's moth-like attraction to Steele's "fame" that directly leads to her murder.Â&nbsp; It's also frequently categorized as film noir, and the murder investigation, with Dix remaining a prime candidate despite Laurel's alibi, is constantly lingering in the background.&nbsp; Like other great&nbsp;noir protagonists, Dix Steele is unable to overcome his fatal flaw and adapt to the outside world.&nbsp; More atypical is that it's not death or imprisonment that Steele must face, but loneliness after knowing and feeling the happiness that a change of&nbsp;temperament could have yielded.This is a film I could go on and on and on about, but best that you just see it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting, provocative, maybe Bogart's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most fans of Humphrey Bogart have never heard of this film, much less seen it. Director Nicholas Ray seems much more appreciated in Europe, by film makers like Wim Wenders, than he is in this country. Few american directors captured livlier dialogue, had as much visual style and flair, and put as many surprises--like the Hadda Brooks scenes in In A Lonely Place--in their films. Gloria Graham surpasses all other roles, except for those in Fritz Lang's films, and her character grows and changes in response to the mercurial Dix Steele, perhaps the most creative and layered character Bogart ever portrayed. If you think american cinema has ever competed with european film, this movie is a place to start. See it today, and get hooked by the films of Nicholas Ray!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They should have changed the name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished reading the Dorothy Hughes' novel which this movie was named after and which it supposedly was based. I had not seen the movie so I rented it from iTunes right after putting down the book. I must say I enjoyed them both but also discovered they had almost nothing in common. Okay there was an LA apartment in both of them. The movie uses many of the names from the book but the personalities and roles are completely different. I knew the endings were quite different (i.e. the protagonist is guilty in one and innocent in the other) but I thought there might be one line of dialog taken from the book. No, not one line that I could tell. That aside, the movie should be judged on it's own merits and the acting and directing are excellent. I love seeing the old L.A. scenes. The plot is dated in that it is way more tolerant of male spousal abuse than you would ever see today. The ending in the movie seems to imply that the big breakup was all due to a misunderstanding over the false accusations against Bogie's character Dix. By today's standards leading lady Laurel had more than enough reason to give Dix his walking papers way earlier than she did. I think as a viewer I was supposed to be hoping they would patch things up and get together but I found myself yelling at Laurel, "Get the hell out. Now!!! You don't have to put up with that s***." And I'm a guy. Bottom line: although the book is a bit better, read it AND see the movie. They are two very different animals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dixon Steele is a violent man," Kristl said while she took a sip from her Rooibos tea. "Yeah," Henry nodded slowly. He was drinking hot coffee in a cup filled to the brim . He had made Kristl a tea as at the moment she had sworn off coffee. Just like she had sworn off sugar a few months ago. But Henry knew that this might change tomorrow. It had before. "That is they key to the story. It is what causes Laurel to doubt him, until it is too late.""It isn't a great leap to think that he might have killed that girl.""And this suspicion breaks the love affair. " Kristl nodded."He is pretty violent considering that he almost bashes a man's skull in with a rock. If Laurel hadn't stopped him, he might have. He gives me the creeps.""That is the thing and the sad thing is that he gets more violent when more frustrated and he gets more frustrated because Laurel grows distant and cold because she starts to doubt him.. And of course the police increase the pressure, believing him to be the most likely perpetrator.""Like a circle. The suspicion causes the violence and the violence increases the suspicion. And so on. And so on.""A sad story and a great one. It is an interesting take on a murder story. Not a regular whodunit because is not really important who committed the murder. What is is important is what it causes. It is a thriller, mixed with a drama and a crime story all wrapped into one movie.""So you liked it?""Did you? I mean, there isn't much action. So it might be boring.""Well, it was interesting. But I asked first...""Alright? I found the story interesting and the acting of Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame is good, but the movie loses big on cinematography. It is just so lackluster and by the book filming that it really brings down the whole movie. There are so many moments that could have been handled better. I would have been interested what a Robert Krasker, the director of photography of the third man, would have done. The only moment something remarkable is done is when Steele enacts with two other people what might have happened. The eager fascination and detailed description of him describing the murder coupled with his expression is unsettling and brought out by having his face light up from the darkness around him. It could have been done much better though. And there are a few moments throughout the movie that seem to mood enhanced, like the moment she talks through bars to a person.. which would have been greater later in the movie signifying her being captured in this love affair but I got the feeling this was just an accident. ""Gloria Grahame is pretty though," Henry smiled, "Even though she has this sad expression for most of the movie.""There is this one thing at the end that made me wonder. ""Which is?""I find it strange that she finds it more important whether Steele is the murderer or not, than the fact that she is about to marry a violent man.""Uhmm.""I mean.. he gets creepy under pressure, so he will get violent and one day she might be the target of his violence..Brr. A man to avoid at all cost.""Well?. I don't know what to say. Most of the people he was violent against seem to ask for it.. Not that is makes it any less of a no no.. but somehow I am somewhat more lenient when he hits a guy who taps ash off his cigar into Steeles friends glass of brandy. Or somehow who shouts at you not to talk to his wife, while his wife started to conversation.""Still violence is violence.""Yeah, it is..""Despite that last criticism I think it is a good movie. In fact I wonder why there has never been a remake. Maybe one with say George Clooney and? well.. " "Angelina Jolie?""Angelina Jolie?""Hmm.. maybe not a good idea, she probably hits back..""Maybe Cate Blanchett would be better.""Yeah. She has that kind of frailty that Gloria Grahame has.""Well, maybe someone will make that remake.""You never know." Henry said and rose to get him another serving of coffee. Halfway down the hall he turned and raised his empty cup indicating if she wanted any. Kristl nodded a yes. 'Addict', he thought. he had known she would change her mind.www.merit.coba.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>mild spoilers ahead Yes, I do agree with most positive comments :Gripping film, class acting, especially from Bogart as a violent man... and so on.Everything is right, in my opinion too...And this is a Noir classic, yes too, but frankly I didn't like it.Too desperate, the end just almost put me down ! Perharps because I don't see any hope, and whether or not B/W Noir movies do interest me, it seems this one is too realistic ; situations, underlying and real violence, I unfortunately believe that too many people in that world live under these conditions, and alike in this perfectly played very Noir movie, for real... And furthermore, a love story, because it's also and mainly one, is not my taste in that kind of spirit. We can really feel sorry for what's happening to both protagonists, naturally and desperately unable to go backward to love each other, after what happened to both of them.I am may be too romantic...Oh, before I forgot, the imagery is good, but on that point, I wouldn't say it is an over the top B/W movie.Nicolas Ray did a good job, but it's essentially the acting that brings it out and puts it above of the Noir average films.Nevertheless, nothing to compare to Laughton's Night of the Hunter, that I also didn't like (even if I agree that one is a real masterpiece !) Technically merits 8 or more, yes, but guess won't see it again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart is magnificent as a tough Hollywood screenwriter who is romantically involved with a gorgeous actress, Gloria Grahame,meanwhile he's under suspicion of killing of another woman.This is a fascinating psychological thriller which takes Bogey's screen persona and turn him to show the dangerous undertones which could destroy such a man.¨Bogie¨makes mythical stuff of the violent, volatile and two-fisted writer.Bogart's brooding ,male animal intensity brought him rave reviews for this film.Here he is an unlikeable,angry urban male with smooth-talking charmer who erupts into sudden violence.Bogart'd done it all and had it all done to him,he's the patron soul of film noir:High Sierra,Maltese Falcon,Big sleep,Key Largo, Knock on any door and of course, In a lonely place.Gloria Grahame was a female icon of 1950 film noir,Grahame custom mingled vulnerability,sensuality and emotional volatility to craft a remarkable string of flawed characters :Crossfire,Sudden fear,Big heat,Human desire ,Naked alibi, and specially ,In a lonely place. The picture is well directed by Nicholas Ray(at the time married with Grahame).The highlights of Ray include three pretty unusual films noir¨A woman's secret¨and two movies with Bogart ¨Knock on any door¨with a rebel young John Derek and this one. Excellent cinematography by Burnett Guffey,he along with John Alton and Nicholas Musuruka are the fundamental artificers of the special atmosphere of the films noir.This superb movie became itself one of the finest memorable and known entry of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible and brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third in that glorious trilogy of films released in 1950 that explore the dark underbelly of the entertainment industry (the others being Sunset Blvd. and All About Eve), this is in many ways the darkest and most gritty (which you might expect from Nicholas Ray, the director of Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and Johnny Guitar (1954)) Humphrey Bogart plays a troubled and violent screenwriter who is suspected of murder. His neighbour provides evidence that puts him in the clear and the two begin an unlikely romance but when his violent and controlling side starts to surface more and more she starts to have her doubts about the man she cleared.As a Bogart and Film Noir fan, I have to say I believe this is his best performance. He's at once likable, menacing, kind, cruel, charming and hateful, but always human. The "road rage" scene is really quite staggering - you will gasp at the screen, I guarantee it. Similarly to Sunset Blvd (1950) there are some fun and telling cameos by real life members of the Hollywood circle (including a really touching appearance by Robert Warwick: he had given Bogart a helping hand when the young actor was starting out in the 20&#x2032;s, but by 1950 he was struggling for work, and Bogart insisted the screenwriter write a character for him)Verdict: If you don't love this film, you don't love Bogart.

		<shortDescription>A great film noir that deserves to be better known</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screen writer Dixon Steele has been hired to turn a novel into the next big film but he has little interest in the project; he hasn't even got the desire to read the book. Instead he invites hat-check girl Mildred Atkinson, who has read the book, to tell him the story in her own words. This takes place in his apartment and when she has finished he gives her twenty dollars for her help and the cab ride home. The next morning he is woken by the police; Mildred has been found murdered and Dixon is the only suspect the police have. Luckily for Dixon his neighbour Laurel Gray saw Mildred leaving alone so he is released. It turns out Laurel is rather attracted to Dixon and a relationship soon starts but she soon learns that Dixon has a violent temper and must question whether he was innocent or not.I hadn't heard of this film till I bought it as part of a film noir box set so assumed it would be one of Humphrey Bogart's lesser films? how wrong I was; it is one of his best performances; dark, brooding and dangerous. Early on he makes Dixon seem likable, if a little short-tempered, but we soon see his character isn't so nice; he seems unconcerned when told of Mildred's murder and later demonstrates that he has a murderous temper leading us to question his innocence. Gloria Grahame puts in a solid performance as Laurel; a confident yet still vulnerable character whose relationship with Dixon is more important to the story than the police investigation. Director Nicholas Ray did a fine job bringing the story to the screen; the tension is kept high and the way the movie was filmed only serves to emphasise that? an example being when Dixon tells his friend, a policeman, and his wife his only theory about what happened; the lighting made Boggart look increasingly crazed as he went on. It isn't all dark and gloomy; in fact there are quite a few delightfully amusing moments such as when Boggart straightens Laurel's grapefruit knife not realising it is meant to be curved. Overall a really good film; a must see if you are a fan of Bogart or film noir in general but I'm sure it would be enjoyable even if you aren't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic, unfortunately</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many social and psychological problems were not taken seriously just a few decades ago because there were no words to describe them, at least none in common parlance. In 1950 people were familiar with the term "wife-beater" (ie, a man who regularly caused his wife serious injury), but no one spoke, as we do today, of a man who was very controlling or a control freak or abusive. Many women involved with such men wondered if they were being too sensitive or too critical if they disliked such treatment--a situation that, sadly, still exists today, as anyone can see by looking at an agony column. The difference is that now the words have made the facts familiar, and anyone who witnessed Humphrey Bogart's treatment of the woman he says he loves would tell Gloria Grahame to get out, quick. In this case the problem is exacerbated, as it often is in life, by the man being successful and famous, yet being in a career slump, thereby exercising a tremendous pull on the woman, who enjoys both the status of being with such a man and the satisfaction of helping him (and, therefore, feeling guilty about leaving him, because he "needs" her). The relationship we see is a classic one, psychologically, and the film's down-to-earth, gritty script and the characters' subtle, restrained performances make it all very ordinary and horribly believable.On the lighter side, there is Bogart's Jewish agent (and friend), who fusses over him like a mother hen and, anticipating that he and Grahame will get married and have children, asks, like any good Jewish mother, if he will be able to come over and play with them, with this priceless line: "I promise I'll teach them only NICE things!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a Lonely Place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The character of Dixon Steele is easily one of Bogie's darkest and most complicated roles. He's a Hollywood scriptwriter who hasn't penned a hit in a decade, and who finds himself the prime suspect in a murder case when he is the last person to see a hat check girl alive. Steele is given an alibi by Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame), the girl who lives in an upstairs apartment. A romance follows while the police continue to investigate Dixon, and soon Laurel, too, is having doubts?Bogart was one of those actors who pretty much played himself whatever the role. He knew he was a big enough star to get away with it, and audiences came to see Bogie as much as they did to see the story. Initially in this one he is quite a likable character, kind to a former heartthrob who has fallen on hard times through love of the bottle while everyone else offers only ridicule, and fatherly to the ill-fated hat-check girl whom he takes home so that she can fill him in on the plot of an 'epic' novel he has been commissioned to adapt. Like Bogart himself, Steele is ambivalent towards his output and is frustrated with the quality of the material he is given to work with. The film was released under Bogart's own Santana banner, and one can imagine the relish with which he would have embraced a role that not only offered a little more depth than usual but also took its share of crafty swipes at the hand that fed it.The storyline is a kind-of whodunnit, but this aspect largely takes a backseat to the examination of Steele, a deeply flawed man with a hair-trigger temper, a history of violence, and an inability to cope too well with pressure. While Bogart perhaps isn't the type of actor best suited to this kind of role, he does a reasonable job, and is hampered as much by the disparity between his and Grahame's ages as he is by his shortcomings as an actor. But then, Lauren Bacall, Bogie's real-life wife, was a year younger than Grahame?The curious thing about In a Lonely Place, and probably the only thing that grates, is the way that the focus switches about two-thirds of the way through the film. At some point we no longer follow the story through Steele's eyes but through Laurel Gray's. I can't remember seeing another film in which this happens, and the switch is a little jarring, as if two people discovered they were making the same film from different perspectives and decided to splice the two stories together. While this damages the film, it doesn't ruin it, and the ending is admirably downbeat for the era which is a major plus. When you think about it, no other conclusion would have been anywhere near as convincing?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold Steele</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogie's Dixon Steele suffers the same affliction as Gabin's Jacques Lantier in La Bete Humaine; both are prone to unexplained violent rages that may (in Steele's case) and do (in Lantier's) lead to murder. The flaw in both films is the failure by the writer and/or director to offer an explanation for the outbreaks - actually Emile Zola, author of the source work for La Bete Humaine, did offer an explanation but you had to read the nine-novel cycle to be aware of it and how many moviegoers are prepared to do that. Putting that aside this remains a terrific movie with Bogie right on top of his game - in some aspects it's a dress rehearsal for his Queeg a couple of years later in The Caine Mutiny - which means the best there is and there's even the odd 'inside' joke like the uncredited appearance by Mike Romanoff, proprietor of the Hollywood restaurant where Bogie was a habitue'. Indeed the Hollywood setting allows for metaphorical readings if you're so inclined and it is a masterstroke to have a director, agent, actress, actor-on-the-skids and screenright as prominent characters yet remain a million miles away from a studio. This is almost certainly the pick of the crop of Bogie's Columbia years which coincided with his last great period. Nine out of ten any day of the week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IN A LONELY PLACE is a brilliant little film but also one that's difficult to sit through because the central story is so damned depressing. This has to be one of the bleakest-ever film noirs to come out of Hollywood; it's a film so dark that it feels incredible it ever got made, with the central thrust of the tale building up to a powerhouse climax which is a near-perfect culmination of everything that's built up to that point.I'm amused to think of theatregoers heading off to see this film expecting a typical romance between big movie stars Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Graham. What a shock they must have been in for! Both actors act their socks off throughout, although it's Bogart who gets all the plaudits for playing such a complicated and unpleasant character.The central narrative is a murder mystery in which the authorities suspect Bogart of committing a crime but don't have the evidence to convict him of it. It doesn't help that Bogart plays a violent man given to violent acts throughout the movie. The screenplay keeps you guessing as to his guilt right until the end, and it's never less than well directed throughout. I thought the supporting cast were a little weak here, but when so much of the focus is on Bogart and Grahame, it doesn't really matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a self-described noir nut and 9 out of 10 is basically my highest rating. That is except for those rare few films that touch me emotionally in a permanent way. 'In a Lonely Place' I saw for the first time on the big screen at a revival house about twenty years ago. When the curtain closed I literally couldn't move from my seat for several minutes. Since then I have revisited it dozens of times and it still turns me into a blubbering mess every time. Lots has been written about the style, setting, performances, dialogue, I'm sure it's all brilliant, but I am always too involved in the story to be bothered with any of that. So I'm not really going to review it properly since I can't be objective. For normal folks, who won't feel like they got hit with a ton of bricks by the end, I'm sure you will still be greatly entertained.

		<fullReview>In a lonely place (1950) (Directed by Nicholas Ray) In my opinion the film had a weak substance because of how Nicholas Ray directed his picture. But on the other hand the moderate psychology was good. So as the result you could acknowledge some elements of the characters' natures. My eyes stared into the creative costume and production designing. The plot was poor because it was carried by a flat director. As a ramification I lost interest in the story that had rich themes. In a few scenes the cinematography was at it high standard. I couldn't dare resist looking at the Los Angeles landscape such as the 50s vehicles, palm trees, architecture and many more spicy ingredients. The physicality was impressive. I loved the calm camera fading. The main character had a quality role in the movie because of his body language and his aggression that would hurt people around him. The soundtrack wasn't suitable for the picture at all because It given the movie a cheesy mood when the film had serious themes for an example, Power, fame, emotions and Hollywood. I give the picture a 4 ? /10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In A Lonely Place(1950) is one of my favorite Humprey Bogart movies along with The Treasure of the Sierra Madre(1948), The Big Sleep(1945), and Beat The Devil(1953). It is about loneliness and despair and how these two qualities fill the souls of the two main characters. Bogart gives an aggressive performance as a writer in the twilight of his career. In a Lonely Place(1950) must have been an influence on Martin Scorsese as he would deal with similar themes seen in the film. Gloria Grahame gives an excellent performance as a woman who is torn between loving and fearing Bogart's character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is based loosely on the novel of the same name by Dorothy Hughes, which is brilliant (and contains a lot of sea-mist). In the book, Dix only poses as a writer, and is a bit of a Tom Ripley. Oh, and he did the murders. (Hughes became an agent, with one client - herself, writing under a man's name.) Anyway, back to the plot. I don't think this movie is so brilliant. It's heavy handed. The acting is either wooden (Grahame) or melodramatic (Bogart). The music track veers from corny to underlining non-jokes. I don't find any of the characters' one-liners "witty". Saying something ordinary with an arch expression does not a joke make. There's lots of padding, often revolving around cooking breakfast. The most appealing character is the hatcheck girl. It was a dreadful year for fashion - I kept wanting to rumple the female characters' hair. And Gloria Grahame's lipstick makes all her scenes ludicrous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I viewed "In a Lonely Place" It was a very interesting movie. I was very impressed with the way people expressed themselves back in 1950. It is an accurate demonstration, and it is very curious to notice the manner in which our society has evolved. We are not a romantic society anymore as we once were. I was also impressed with the fact that Humphrey Bogart was so much older than Gloria Grahame. He looked old enough to be her father, yet no one remarked about that. Everyone thought they were an appropriately matched couple. The disparity in their personalities was well portrayed. Had the lieutenant told them the good news one day earlier, the results would have been disastrous. They would have married, and Humphrey's character still would have been a violent, possessive person. Gloria's character would still have been afraid of him. I was certain that the woman who plays Sylvia Nikolai was Shelley Winters, yet the cast of characters lists her name as Jeff Donnell. Are they one and the same? person?</fullReview>

But somewhere along the way, the movie drops and nearly forgets the noir-ish murder mystery that got the whole story started and just becomes another '40s/'50s message picture about an out of control and abusive man (this time around a bad temper substitutes for alcoholism). However, Bogart and Graham are very good together, and I really enjoyed the apartment set for some reason. It reminded me vaguely of Jimmy Stewart's pad in "Rear Window."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this for only the second time in about 30 years, last night, and have been mulling it over. It bulges with noir icons, I know: Nick Ray, Bogart, Gloria Graham. It ought to work, but it doesn't. The murder story, which should be at the center of things, is of no consequence. Instead we have Bogart as a nasty and ill-tempered guy who doesn't know how to say "I love you," or "I'm sorry" (after he bashes his agent, one of his few friends). Graham is a dumb bimbo who likes his face but doesn't want to kiss it. There isn't a light moment in the movie, and Bogart is Captain Queeg without any sympathy. He hasn't learned anything at the end, and neither has Graham. She was right to leave him. Anybody would be right to quit his presence. It looks like noir but it's really rien.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as I've heard, this was one of the early films about the Hollywood film industry (the oldest one I know is probably Singin' in the Rain, about the transition into sound), and a bit of a weird one I have to say, well, it is film noir. Basically Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) is the heavy drinking Hollywood screenwriter faced with writing a trashy bestseller, and one night he is trying to have a good time with Mildred Atkinson (Martha Stewart). Later that night, Mildred is found murdered, and with his record of violent tendencies, macabre sense of humour, and emotionless reaction (coolness), Steele is the prime suspect. Fortunately, his neighbour Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame, originally the part was written for Bogart's wife, Lauren Bacall) gives him an alibi, and soon enough, and friendship turns into love. Later of course, with evidence or something like that popping up more, and Steele easily losing his temper and punching a driver, Laurel questions his innocence, and even when he is proved not guilty, there is no happy ending and he leaves. Also starring Frank Lovejoy as Det. Sgt. Brub Nicolai, Carl Benton Reid as Capt. Lochner, Art Smith as Agent Mel Lippman, Jeff Donnell as Sylvia Nicolai, Robert Warwick as Charlie Waterman, Morris Ankrum as Lloyd Barnes and William Ching as Ted Barton. Bogart is pretty convincing as an easily angered near maniac, a good dark film. Humpherey Bogart was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 27 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In a Lonely Place" has a couple of factors going for it: 1) I think it has a great script, and 2) Gloria Grahame in her prime. Bogart himself is always interesting to watch, but his character here is so unappealing that you don't feel much sympathy for him. This film could've been one of those ground breakers by dealing openly with a mental illness, but we get a "soft crash landing" instead. GG is one sexy lady as Laurel, and the supporting cast, except for the thespian friend, is in great form. As I said above, the writing seemed topnotch to me, and the film had more potential than it realized in the end. When Bogart was "on", as in "The Caine Mutiny" or "African Queen", he was a great actor, one of THE greatest, but this effort looks like something he almost did in his sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood screenwriter Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) is a bitter man. He hates his job and everybody in it--he also flies into violent rages. He is accused of killing a girl last seen leaving his apartment one night. A neighbor of his (Gloria Grahame) is positive he didn't do it--and immediately falls in love with him. But then she sees him lose control a few times and begins to think she may be wrong about his innocence.There's a lot wrong with this picture: The plot is familiar and the dialogue is pretty terrible. Also believing that beautiful Grahame would fall in love with a very ill-looking Bogart is pushing it. Bogart also is terrible--he looks old and tired and walks through his role (but he was sick with cancer at the time). Still this is worth catching. Bogart aside it's well-acted (Grahame is just great) and extremely well-directed by Nicholas Ray (a nighttime drive with Bogart and Grahame is especially well-done). It moves very quickly too (it's only about 96 minutes). A lot of people don't like this film because of it's cynical tone and downbeat ending--but don't let that scare u away. Again, it's worth seeing but not the classic it's been called. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but falls short of being great in the delivery of the material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screenwriter Dixon Steele is a surly womaniser but is well-known within his business. One night he takes a young woman back to his flat to "read him a story" to help him analyse it in regards the potential for it to become a film. Tiring of her energy and innocence, Steele sends her home with money for a taxi. The next morning he wakes to find the police at his door asking questions about the woman, who was found dead having been thrown from a car hours after she supposedly left Steele's apartment. Steele's neighbour Laurel provides his alibi as she saw the woman leave and this unusual introduction to one another sees her and Steele fall into a relationship. However as love blossoms, the finger of suspicion never moves from Steele and even Laurel starts to have her doubts.I will move swiftly past the fact that this is not a "noir" and it doesn't fit that genre no matter how many amateur reviews say it is one. However this is an aside because I would rather focus on what the film is rather than what it isn't. What the film is, is a sort of romantic mystery where we have a touch of the Hitchcocks as a young woman finds herself in a relationship with a man who may or may not be a killer. It is an interesting scenario but sadly the film doesn't totally make the most of it as it falls down in the area of consistency. Parts of it are brilliant in the way it kept me guessing and drew out stuff from within Steele, however too much of it is the flipside of this as Steele and Laurel fall in love. Now, I understand the need to have the "normal" to build the relationship and also give the edgier stuff come out from behind of, however for me this film operated like a light switch ? it was either dark or bright, there was little in-between.And it is in this regard that I found it a little disappointing, because it didn't manage to bring that edge into the day-to-day stuff in the way that Hitchcock would have done with the same material. Instead it is very much a matter of Steele either being a bit of a tw*t or beating a man half to death. It is a shame because Bogart does good work here, particularly playing well when he loses control and falls into rages. He is not as brilliant as some would have you believe because I didn't think he managed to bring out how much he hated this side of himself but he was still effective doing what he did. He works well with Grahame, who herself was good if not that great. Support from Lovejoy, Reid and Smith are all solid.Overall then, an enjoyable film but one that falls short of being "great" by failing to find the consistency and blend of characterisation. By flicking between extremes the film does produce impacting moments and a good lingering feeling but watch it while considering Hitchcock and I think you'll agree that it doesn't deliver everything that it could have despite the aspects it does well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not complaining about the acting or directing or clever bits in the script at the opening regarding how things work in Hollywood. The problem is, this film does not stand up to time. From the modern perspective, the Bogart character is a whiny, narcissistic woman-beating, drunken, controlling jerk with "poor impulse control" who only stays out of jail because he's white and has a cop pal. He's loathsome, the sort of evil man who talks like he's the victim, when indeed he's the criminal and abuser. We're supposed to believe his agent who says artistic people need to be like that, which of course we know is a load of crap. And so in the film a beautiful, loyal, hardworking woman falls for him, but we can't like her, either, because when he interrupts her to say "make my breakfast woman!" she drops everything and obeys his commands. When he controls her every movement, she lets him. When he's crazy angry, she apologizes though she's done nothing wrong. So from today's perspective, both main characters are 100% unsympathetic. The main dramatic question of the film is: will their love affair last? Who the heck cares? If she doesn't killed by this abuser, she'll likely pick another to kill her, and he'll find more victims to feel golden with for a few weeks before he starts hitting them too, and so this is just one brief affair among many dozens they'll both screw up from being idiots. Two generations ago, maybe audiences could buy this as tragic, but not today.</fullReview>

She started the movie as a tough, independent free-thinking woman but ended up listening to gossip and innuendo. It was like two different women. Especially as she starts off the movie with the knowledge that Bogart's Steele may have just murdered a girl. That's OK with Laurel, but after her masseuse has a few bitter words in her ear and the dumb wife of Steeles cop friend put their oars in she has doubts? I saw this as a classic 1950's womens movie, listen to your girl-friend's gossip and you'll lose your man. Sure I'm discounting Steeles aggression especially the over-the-top fight after the car smash. But really, that was over done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this drama, but I'm wondering whether to class it as a film noir or not. Perhaps the closing fade implies Dix' subsequent suicide, just as the subtle fade near the beginning implied the girl's subsequent murder. On the other hand, I personally concluded that Dix and Laurel would've soon sorted out their troubles. Laurel had seen him almost kill before, which would've been the time to have doubts and break the relationship, but she carried on dating him, and she seemed very attracted to his vulnerability, so it shouldn't have come as any unforgivable surprise when he momentarily lost the plot and tried to strangle her. Listen to me! I'm going on as if I'd read some more macabre Mills and Boon title. What we're dealing with here is class; not trash...and I think it had a happy ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspicion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In a Lonely place" hits me first as a Hitchcock like stylistic composition;but the further acquaintance says this:another top-notch Ray movie .Everytime he was exploring and opening new possibilities,he made them work (best examples being his extraordinary "wind across the Everglades" and " Bigger than life" ) every time he made them work.For Bogart's character is much more complex than he appears first.He is a misfit ,a distant relative of the teacher of "bigger than life" ,and Ray does not take the easy way out ,that is to say "that's war made of that man" .After all,the cop did also fight in the war,and that does not make him a psychotic for all that.Superlative performance by Bogart,excellent support by Grahame,cast against type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film Loire; weaker as a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a huge Loire fan, which accounts for the lower rating I gave this film than others on the site.GOOD THINGS: Bogart is stunning, riveting, squeezing every nuance out of every line and situation. This is the most complex character I've seen him play and he is utterly masterful. My one reservation is the lighting and the touch of "crazy" he gets in one scene (people who've seen it know what I'm referring to) -- it's too over the top. I suspect that was a directorial decision. With so much more known now about domestic violence and criminal abusers, it's tantalizing to think how Bogie would've played the role now. I don't think he'd need to change much! I also thought the use of the apartment complex was very effective. Constant shifts in point of view, twists and turns of physical paths, gates and window coverings -- it all adds to the general confusion as to the true nature of Bogart's character.The costumes were, of course, beautiful, and the man playing "Thespian" was a touching supporting role.THE BAD: Why didn't Bacall play the female lead?? While Gloria Grahame gave a good performance, there weren't sparks flying off the screen the way Bacall creates them with Bogie. Grahame was sympathetic and strong -- Bacall would've played it with a bit more chill so that when she does move into more vulnerable territory, it's that much more moving.The pacing was slow in places, and the "clean-cut" non-Hollywood characters lacked any depth. The script was weak in several spots and it was wonderful to see Bogart still somehow pull it off. As an indictment of Hollywood, the script starts on a path but doesn't really finish. Though I do have to say the ending is brilliantly done, much better than the book.Overall I think the film suffers from a weak script and some poor directorial decisions. It's definitely one to see, though, just for the experience, whether you love Loire or not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a Lonely Place, practically an unknown Bogart film, has lately undergone a reappraisal from certain corners, with one of the actor's many biographers even proclaiming that it's a masterpiece. (Note: this same gentleman thinks The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a dull and boring failure. Questions, anyone?) Granted, any Bogart film made in the actor's prime is worth consideration, especially one directed by Nicholas Ray and co-starring Gloria Grahame, but this one is such a loser that future film school students may study it as an example of a Really Bad Picture.Just to start with, it suffers pictorially from a surprising lack of craftsmanship, most particularly in its uninspired photography and set-ups, which give the entire film a distinctly cheesy look. This is a mere quibble, however, compared to one of the picture's more damaging problems: a dull, uninspired plot centering on a tedious murder mystery and populated by a host of two-dimensional characters, e.g., the loyal, long-suffering, good-hearted Hollywood agent, the dumb hat-check girl, the army buddy who believes in the put-upon and suspect main character (Dixon Steele, a screenwriter, played by Bogart), and the angry, overbearing masseuse (who was my guess as the real killer). The dialogue, which is humdrum, is at its worst when it wants to impress the audience with its sophistication, as when Steele expounds on "good" screenwriting to Grahame, a howler considering the caliber of the screenwriting that went into the film in which Bogart and Grahame themselves have actually found themselves!).There is also the matter of the picture supposedly being an "inside Hollywood" story, which it hardly is. In a Lonely Place is only superficially about Hollywood; other films from the same period have provided a much more penetrating and candid look at the motion picture industry, including the people who labor in it, the betrayals that are commonplace, and that magnificent monster, the general studio system that prevailed at the time. At its heart, the real story that the film intends-but which is muffled and obscured by nearly everything that surrounds it-is that of a lonely, sensitive, and gifted man who desperately needs a fulfilling relationship with a woman, but who frequently goes out of control, and who ultimately destroys the love that a good woman finally offers him. If this had been presented persuasively enough to move an audience, the film's other flaws probably would have been worth forgiving.One particular difficulty dwarfs all the others, and the film is effectively sunk by it. The casting of Humphrey Bogart must have seemed the perfect choice for the role of the tortured and insecure Dixon Steele, and in scenes that call for him to act violently, he's frighteningly effective. But elsewhere, such as in his love scenes with Gloria Grahame, or when he's simply trying to show the better side of Dixon Steele's personality, he appears stiff and unpersuasive. An actor who was capable of tremendous force and audience appeal, Bogart, like many Hollywood greats, had a narrow range and was usually smart enough to pick roles he could shine in. Perhaps with a better script the actor might have been able to demonstrate some of the underlying complexities of his character, which might have led to a riveting performance like the one he gave in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. (A few years later he had another chance to show what he could do with a role as a paranoid when he played Captain Queeg in producer Stanley Kramer's The Caine Mutiny: there he neatly stole the picture from his co-stars and walked away with it in his pocket.)In a Lonely Place features one of the worst performances that Humphrey Bogart ever gave. It's a crude impersonation, nearly a pantomime, of a certain type of human being whose motivations and inner workings have completely eluded the actor. So what he settles for, and what we the audience get, is a desperate series of crude external mannerisms-grimaces, hateful looks, infantile physicality-all meant to signal a psychic disturbance that is more obscured by these things than revealed by them. (By comparison, watch James Mason in a similar role-a nasty, out-of-control drunk-in the first scenes of A Star Is Born, where his anger is almost entirely masked, except in a few spare moments of sudden and truly frightening physical visciousness toward others.) Sadly, it's also hard to resist assuming that Bogart was never given less help by a director in any motion picture of his mature period than he got from Nicholas Ray during the filming of In a Lonely Place. He is simply at sea with the character he's struggling to connect with, and Ray, perhaps because of his own marital problems at the time (he was being divorced by Gloria Grahame), was apparently of little or no help to him.The picture does have one minor but nevertheless interesting distinction: it's not a "typical" Humphrey Bogart movie. This may have persuaded audiences and critics at that time, and some people now (mainly academics, who tend to have odd ideas about motion pictures) that In a Lonely Place is really a buried gem. It isn't.P.S. According to another biographer, and one of his best, A.M. Sperber, Bogart disliked the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`In a Lonely Place' is hardly a film noir. The only noirish aspect was Bogart's anger management issues. The movie was more of a romance than film noir. It featured one of those goofy Hollywood romances between Bogart and Gloria Grahame. It was not believable. Bogart and Gloria Grahame were good in their roles but I thought the pacing was slow and the story clumsily told. The ending wasn't shocking but was a relief. Don't believe the hype. This is no noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What An Ego</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another reviewer asks why don't people like this film. Very simply the character Humphrey Bogart plays is such a jerk no one can have any sympathy for him.In a Lonely Place finds Humphrey Bogart casts as a brilliant, but egotistical writer, who has a hair trigger temper and beats up on people when things don't go his way. Norman Mailer who as I remember back in the day was always involved in all kinds of scrapes must have been the model used for Bogey's character of Dixon Steele.Anyway a script girl played by Martha Stewart comes over one night and gives him the synopsis of a trashy novel that the movie studio which employs Bogart wants him to adapt. Later that night Stewart is murdered and Bogart is a natural suspect given his violent proclivities and the fact he was the last person to see her alive.A neighbor, Gloria Grahame, gives Bogart an alibi by stating to the police that she saw Stewart leave Bogart's apartment alive and healthy. The police aren't satisfied, but they cut Bogart loose. And Bogey and Gloria get to kanoodling.The rest of the film is their rough and rocky courtship punctuated by displays of a violent temper on Bogart's part. So bad that I lost interest in the character. I couldn't work up any sympathy or rooting interest in Bogart. Especially when he uses agent Art Smith as a punching bag and shows Grahame what he has in store for her.The only thing good out of this film depending on your point of view was that Gloria Grahame met and married director Nicholas Ray on the set. In a Lonely Place was a dreadful mistake all around. Bogart's character was impossible and Gloria Grahame wasn't as slinky and seductive as she normally is. Just a disappointment in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogies' "Wacko" bit is overdone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read so many good things about this film that I was prepared to watch and enjoy it. But, for me, it was a major disappointment. The whole premise of the story is based upon the fact that Bogies' character is a ticking time bomb who can, and does, go off at any time with virtually no warning. I can't speak for others but, for me, it makes for a most unpleasant viewing experience. I found myself rooting real hard for someone to put his lights out (so to speak).If you enjoy watching a guy act like a real first class wacko then this movie is for you. All others should skip it and find something that is more entertaining. As for the so-called surprise ending, I'm still waiting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-hashing tries to save this feeble exploit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this film 2 stars for the fact that it gainfully employed some Hollywood people during its production, but that's it. In summary, the film itself is a feeble postwar attempt to capitalize on Bogart's drawing power of the 1940's without the benefit of any passionate artful polish in its making; it is a weak film with a few strong moments. Trying to provide some gravitas to the film's overall low quality, our antihero is forced to occasionally deliver lines and character traits with the muscle developed in prior films but they do not fit. Check out To Have and Have Not, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, and The Big Sleep for the original moves. Each of those films had a complete magic. In a Lonely Place should itself be relegated to a lonely place of its own, on an archive shelf. The film has horrible editing, poor character development, hackneyed script elements that mimic Bogart's earlier years, and worst of all the superstar's forced re-delivery of his strong and proved dramatic tricks from his toolbag of the past. Those bits do not belong in this film, because the film in its weakness fails to otherwise support them. They stand out like mountain peaks of talented acting in a desert of careless writing, directing, and performing. The film is weak, corny, and poorly executed, so when Bogart delivers a strong moment within it, he ends up delivering foie gras into a stale hamburger bun. Terrible. There's a reason why this is not a well-known Bogart film. It's lousy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B-movie fodder.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING Contains Spoiler! Many postings on this website describe 'In a Lonely Place' as film noir. This particular film does not have any of the criteria that a film of this genre must meet. The plot needs to be intricate as in the Chandler classics 'The Big Sleep' and 'Farewell my Lovely' yet this movie has the simplest and oldest plot known to man - girlfriend sees another man, innocently as it turns out, boyfriend gets jealous and kills girlfriend; the stuff of B-movies. Apart from Bogart this is just a souped-up humdrum B-movie. Additionally some of the acting from the female players Martha Stewart, Jeff Donnell and Gloria Grahame is very poor and fails to convince; I've seen better from local 'rep' players. The producing company was Bogart's own Santana Productions and one wonders how well financed it was as some of the sets look minimalistic and cheap. The film has been described as one of the few giving a rare authentic look at what goes on in Hollywood. Although some scenes are set in a bar frequented by top screenwriter Dix Steele, Bogart, and other Hollywood bigwigs past and present they are merely window dressing. Bogart just plays Bogart. Take out Bogart and you have nothing left. A better casting would have been with B-movie stalwarts Lloyd Nolan and Lynn Bari as the leads. That, together with some adroit editing to reduce the running time, would have produced a better picture. One aspect of the movie that struck me as untypical of Hollywood was the complete absence of guns, even though there are scenes of violence, murder and suicide. An over rated bit of nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't Get It ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In fact, I fell asleep and when I woke there was Bogart's character still bashing in everyone's face from strangers to colleagues. Not the usual Bogart overacting on display, but something borderline annoying! The film starts off well up to the murder and then ... I fell asleep. What works is the sarcastic dialog written for Bogart's character who is this unsympathetic screenwriter caught in some Bette Davis-like emotional, dark-cycle whereby anytime his character's feelings are hurt he then becomes angry and ... well don't get in his way. The guy becomes a total jerk. Ms. Grahame's sympathetic character is never prepared for what comes her way!Keep in mind Bogart was just two roles away from the one in which he'd walk away w/ Oscar, but this film is really one notch above "awful."</fullReview>
