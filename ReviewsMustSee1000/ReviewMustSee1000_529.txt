		<shortDescription>People should really lighten up and just ENJOY this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why hardly anybody seems to appreciate this film anymore is without doubt one of the greatest mysteries of our time. I'm truly perplexed. Roger Ebert seems to be the only critic to at least half-realise how truly funny, entertaining and brilliant a film THE GOLDEN CHILD really is.Without doubt it's one of Eddie Murphy's finer films; it's impossible to not have a good time while watching this movie... his one-liners keep coming thick and fast, and if you can't find humour and fun in this movie, then surely your heart is made of stone. Visually, its cinematography is executed very well, the special effects are fantastic (except in one poorly executed shot where Charles Dance turns into a rat) and the theme tune has a strange kind of catchiness to it.Don't be prejudiced against this movie, just because everybody else is. People are so easily swayed by popular opinion these days that true cinematic gems like THE GOLDEN CHILD are forgotten. Four stars out of four. Long live 80s movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Film and so very underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I totally disagree with some (negative) critiques that I've read over the years. This was a great vehicle for Eddie Murphy! He appeared to have a great time with his part as Chandler Jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say, if he had fun doing it ? and most of his audience enjoyed it! And, it WAS fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with Mr. Murphy's great comedic style. You have to keep in mind that 'Golden Child' is a 'fantasy' film ? just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the 'real' world. During the time this film was released, I was working in a video rental store. This was one of the most popular with all our customers. Every single time, we put this one up on our monitor, ALL the copies we had went out fast with wait-list requests that kept it on the queue for months! Everyone who rented it loved it! I was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented ? this was one of my favorites and I knew the taste of my customers so I highly recommended this one to most of them. I really feel that this film is a Sleeper ? it may not have done too well at the box office ? due to very poor marketing ? but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later! (YES, I did buy this film for my own video library!). I adored the little boy who played the 'Golden Child' ? J. L. Reate - but after looking at his profile in IMDb, I noticed that he never did any more films. That is sad, because he definitely had an on-screen aura and could have continued with a film career. I also adored Victor Wong, who played the Old Man (I LOVED him in his part as 'Egg Shen' in 'Big Trouble in Little China' - 1986). At any rate, this was a great film. The only drawbacks that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more 'adult' in nature ? such as 'Chandler's rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette. It was funny, but it still was out of sync. OK, so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes ? those were put in for the mind-set of the day perhaps. This was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from Hollywood. Now that's Entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Fantasy Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise may seem goofy, but since Murphy's character doesn't take it seriously, it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modern-day hard-boiled child abduction. Excellent cast, particularly Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy is at the height of his 80's peak in comedy/action. There's also some great F/X, a very surreal dream sequence, and a fairly original plot. Often overlooked in the pantheon of Murphy flicks, but this one is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goofy, but fun comedy/adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Golden Child" was Eddie Murphy's first film since his megahit "Beverly Hills Cop". And even though it's not as good as "Cop", it's a fun comic adventure. Murphy stars as a finder of lost children who's assigned a most unusual case. His assignment: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. This movie could have been titled "Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Doom" since parts of this movie plays like a Spielbergian adventure, kinda like an Indiana Jones comedy. It's got comedy with laughs, and adventure with special effects. Lots of fun.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A knock-off it may be, but it's a good quality one, the lustre of which is untarnished.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I see most reviews it's called 'a misfire for Eddie Murphy'. These critics want to take a look at some of the stuff he's doing these days, and maybe soften their stance in retrospect... "The Golden Child" is not highbrow entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breathes new life into old clichés, and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I don't understand the pervading lack of 'love' for its efforts, at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout, thrill-a-minute adventures? Steven Spielberg started it with Indiana Jones; it's unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless. There's nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends.Yes it's silly, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that 'ridiculous' is where Hollywood's idea of mysticism begins and ends. What's more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable and amusing fantasy, well worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it. Charles Dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine. His sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero. I have never been much of an Eddie Murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner: a bit of "Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass". Charlotte Lewis is, to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable, luminously gorgeous. Some scenes are wonderfully created: the dream sequence, the bird, the silly fight scenes, and the climactic confrontation. Through it all Murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth, a stunned and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his oriental fantasy romp. Like that movie we have James Hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, however short, raise the quality even of Derek. Since 1955 Hong has defined the fine supporting actor, the "class act" of his profession. "The Golden Child" is silly; it is not perfect; but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy, well worth watching. After four years I have seen "The Golden Child" again; I enjoyed it even more! It truly is great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good as "Golden"....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, Eddie Murphy will surprise you.In a movie like "the Golden Child", especially. This is a movie you'd figure would star maybe Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone. But Eddie really does work; he's smart, he's funny, he's brave, kind, courteous, thrifty, clean and everything else a hero should be.Having been chosen to secure a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil (embodied perfectly by Dance), Eddie goes from California, to Nepal and back, all while the beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) wonders if he's all he says he is and a crazy old holy man (Wong, perfect as always) knows that he is.It's exciting, breathtaking in spots, shocking and, of course, funny. Eddie is the only action hero I know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart-aleck remarks about Ed McMahon.No problem with this "Child": it's a "Golden" find.Nine stars. Viva Nepal!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Offers A Good Mix, But Eddie Is Too Loud For Me Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people, I enjoyed Eddie Murphy in the 1980s with the humorous, wild movies he made. Many of the characters he played were similar: wisecracking, loud, funny and obnoxious. This is one of the wilder stories he was involved with with a very good mixture of action, romance, fantasy and comedy.The female lead in here was an attractive actress named Charlotte Lewis. With her looks and manner, I thought she might go places, but I think this was the only hit movie she's been in.Twenty years after "The Golden Child," I have found most of those Murphy films not the entertainment they used to be. Maybe it's just me getting older, but Eddie's constant shouting and abrasive boorishness is too much to take now. That includes this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not often mentioned with Murphy's classics, but a fun little flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the only truly pure being on Earth is taken by a Demon and his bizarre, circus freak troupe of minions from the holy place where he is being raised who you gonna call? In this case Chandler Jarrell (Eddie Murphy), a private investigator who focuses on locating missing children while wearing ridiculous hats.But Chandler sez "No" when initially asked by the exotic-hot Kee, who is working on behalf of the Tibetan forces of good - some business card that would be."No matter", she replies, "You are already on the case". So Na-Na to you Mr Jarrell.Jarrell is fast talking, hip, and irreverent but well meaning - in other words everything that summed up Eddie Murphy in his "relevant" phase, which ended around the release of Boomerang when Murphy got all serious and introspective and sh*t.Kee on the other hand is poised, deliberate, sombre and calm, but surprisingly well equipped at unexpected times - and I'm not just referring to the scene where she gets her white blouse soaked for no good reason... well two good reasons.After the two team up the trail takes them to the lair of a bikie gang, then Chinatown where they meet Kala the Oracle (of sorts) who informs Chandler of the magnitude of his quest - being that he is the Chosen One after all...Chandler also learns that the Golden Child is a once in a thousand generations birth, born specifically to rescue humanity, capable of restoring life with a touch, wise beyond reason and with the ability to make a Pepsi can dance to classic 1950s songs...So there's that.There is a cool oddball dream sequence and a trip to Tibet to obtain the sacred dagger that can free the imprisoned Golden Child, and a pretty hilarious scene where Chandler and Kee have to bluff the airport security to escape from Tibet.When finally meets his nemesis Sardo Numspaa (Charles Dance) formally to discuss the dagger for child swap things heat up, before a good quickie 80s finale in which everything builds to a crescendo, the figureheads of good and evil have a showdown and all is resolved in about 6 minutes.Perhaps The Golden Child doesn't move quite as fast as films do today and the FX - which were pretty cool in the 80s - don't hold up quite so well now, it is fun and enjoyable while it lasts and also has a few quotables, including "One of her ancestors was raped by a dragon", which is a line you don't hear every day.Final Rating - 6.5 / 10. Not often listed among Eddie Murphy's highlights, but The Golden Child is a very solid and worthwhile - if a little dated - relic from the 80s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film. It is well written and acted and has good cinematography. The story blends action, humor, mysticism, and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots. See it, buy it, show it to your friends.The acting is good and Murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant/unlikely hero. I enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions.I cared what happened to these people and, while the outcome was pretty predictable (the good guys win, the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives--who doesn't see that coming?), it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end. Thank God this film's dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel. Grab some popcorn, cuddle up on the couch, and watch this fun, happy and entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anyone else think this is one of Eddie Murphy's most underrated films?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By all means this is not Eddie Murphy's best film, like Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours and Trading Places, but he has also done worse, Norbit anyone? But it is one of his most underrated films, perhaps even THE most underrated. By all means it is not perfect, as the story does have its silly and predictable moments, one or two parts in the middle half sag a tad in the pacing and the effects do seem creaky by today's standards, but it is not flat and unfunny like critics make it out to be and although I make every effort not to take IMDb ratings to heart I do think the rating is a disgrace for this film. The Golden Child may be flawed, but it also has its strengths, such as Eddie Murphy's charming performance, funny and smart script(or so I think), a fun performance from Charles Dance, decent direction and agreeable soundtrack. So overall, while it mayn't be to everybody's tastes, I do suggest you at least give The Golden Child a fair chance before judging it so harshly. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantasy film with Eddie Murphy???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie available on Netflix and was interested in the premise. You have Eddie Murphy who plays a private detective that specializes in finding missing children. He is told he is the "chosen one" and must protect the "Golden Child" who was kidnapped by an evil sorcerer. I didn't know exactly what to expect. Eddie Murphy is known for doing a lot of action or comedy movies. This movie ends up being a mix of action, comedy and fantasy. Some people will mention this movie was a low point in his career. Well this movie earned close to 80 million dollars. Eddie Murphy has done some more recent movies that have done far worse. There are a lot of funny parts in this movie. I really enjoyed this movie. This was a fun movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eddie Murphy vs Chinese Mysticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be mixed reactions to the movie, one will say that it is garbage while another will say it is classic Eddie Murphy. This movie may not be typical of Eddie Murphy, being more a fantasy kung-fu romp like Big Trouble in Little China, but its special effects, and Murphy's charming character really makes this movie a treat. The first time I saw Golden Child, I wasn't really all that impressed, but now I have come to appreciate the charming wit that is Eddie Murphy, and the way that a man who is used to the mundane in thrown into the hidden fantasy world that the real world hides.This movie has little to think about. It is purely an adventure movie. A perfectly good child is kidnapped by an evil wizard who plans on killing him so that the world may be plunged into eternal darkness. Eddie Murphy is the chosen one who must come along and save the child. The way Eddie Murphy acts though doesn't make him seem to be a chosen one, and his attitude makes an interesting contrast to the typical destiny driven character.The good thing about this movie is the emphasis on the fact that the Golden Child has the power to raise somebody from the dead, so when the heroine dies we are not put off by the child coming along, touching her, and bringing her back. This does not constitute for a stupid Hollywood love must conquer all scene as is seen in Far and Away. We are shown the powers of the Child and thus our disbelief has been suspended.This movie is shrouded in Americanised Chinese Mysticism. There is a mystic feeling to the movie but a lot of it has been Americanised to make it more interesting and appealing to audiences. The classic scene is the Chinese wise man who is little more that a greedy slob of a con artist. Murphy's reaction to this wise man taking $100 off of him really falls into place in the movie, especially with the line, "I'm going to paddle his little ass". Murphy is cool and so is this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child. Sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey, one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa.Is The Golden Child a product of its time? By that I mean, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences? For I can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade, it's box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986, but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny Eddie Murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had. The Golden Child is not up with the more accepted 80s Murphy pictures like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but upon revisiting the film recently I personally found that it contains Murphy at his wisecracking, quipping and charming best! Seriously!Cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and templated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child hits all the required genre buttons. Pretty girl, daring reluctant hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain {Charles Dance so English I could kiss him myself}, wonderful colour, and a cute kid with mystical powers. The film only asks you to get involved in the fun, not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture. Yes the CGI demon looks creaky now, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious. Seriously. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than its rep suggests</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhat underrated Eddie Murphy movie with Eddie playing an American social worker recruited by a Tibetan woman to help rescue a kidnapped boy with special powers called the "Golden Child." I remember when this came out it wasn't met with a warm reception, from the critics or myself. In part I think because it wasn't a straight comedy like myself and others had come to expect from Eddie. But also because it wasn't as good as the similar Big Trouble in Little China, which came out the same year. Ironically, this was a bigger box office hit than Big Trouble but the latter has gone on to deservedly earn a cult fandom while Golden Child still has a mixed reputation at best.Eddie Murphy is pretty good here and seems to be having a fun time. Charlotte Lewis is fine, performance-wise and looks-wise. Charles Dance is an enjoyable villain. The scene stealer here is Victor Wong, who was also in Big Trouble in Little China. The special effects are charming in that special way '80s effects often were. Love the Pepsi can dance scene. Some cheesy stuff in this movie for sure but, for the most part, it's pretty entertaining. If you like '80s movies you should find something to like with this. It's got action, comedy, and a little bit of fantasy all mixed together. It's not what I would call a classic but it is fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eddie Murphy's Chinese Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A private detective specializing in missing children is charged with the task of finding a special child who dark forces want to eliminate.John Carpenter was originally scheduled to direct the film, but dropped out and would later direct "Big Trouble in Little China", a film with similar Chinese mysticism themes (Chinese American actors Victor Wong, James Hong, and Peter Kwong appear in both films). Starring Kurt Russell, Carpenter's project was reported to have been rushed through post-production to ensure a premiere date that preceded "The Golden Child".I love that the two films have this history because watching "Golden Child" instantly makes me think of "Big Trouble". For as much as they do not have in common, there just are not that many films with fantastic Chinese elements in them. At least not in American film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tibet, a young boy with mystical abilities, demonstrates his power by reviving a dead bird, which is to become a constant companion. However, a band of villains break into the hidden temple and takes the boy away. Some time afterwards, a young woman named Kee Nang watches a TV show in which Chandler Jarrell, a social worker looking for a missing child.She tells him that he is the chosen one, destined to save the child, and be the Saviour of all mankind. But Jarrell disbelieves the mysticism, but finds more and more evidence of demon worship as he starts investigating.....This was one of Murphys last films where he was classed untouchable. Every film he starred in before this was box office gold, and this film is basically Axel Foley in a silly hat. and it works for the most part, until you relate it to Big Trouble In Little China.The film goes down the same route as that one, melding Indiana Jines adventure, with constant homages to Asian movies of yesteryear.Murphy is as good as always, funny and with bags of improv, but the film has dated badly, and doesn't seem as good as when first saw in the late eighties.But it's all flashily made, another showcase for the star, which gets a little lost whenever he is not on screen, and quite a dark film for younger viewers.It's still watchable fluff though, but I feel if this were remade today, with another star, it wouldn't have the oomph factor it did back in the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy, Charles Dance, Charlotte Lewis and Victor Wong star in this 1986 fantasy-comedy. This begins in Tibet where a magical child (J.L. Reate) gets kidnapped by demonic man, Sardo Numspa (Dance) and his men. Soon, we meet wise-cracking, social worker, Chandler Jarrell (Murphy) who is chosen to rescue the child. Lewis plays Kee Nang, a woman who helps and becomes romantically involved with Chandler and the late, Wong (Big Trouble in Little China) plays her wise-man father. After Kee falls under a spell, Chandler tries to save her by rescuing the child and facing Sardo. Randall "Tex" Cobb (Raising Arizona) and Wong's "Big Trouble in Little China" co-star, James Hong are also featured. I grew up watching this, it's one of my favorites with Murphy that's underrated and Dance is a good villain as usual. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's really not that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least "The Golden Child" represented a real change of pace for comedy star Eddie Murphy, cast here as Chandler Jarrell, a tracker of missing children whom, it is determined, is the perfect individual to retrieve a powerful child (J.L. Reate) who's been stolen by some very bad men. Should they succeed in corrupting the child, they can kill him and thus allow for evil to take over the planet. Jarrell is reluctant to accept this task (among other things, he doesn't want to experience the cold of Nepal) but, ultimately, his better nature takes over. "The Golden Child", as directed by Michael Ritchie and written by Dennis Feldman, takes what is a rather traditional fantasy quest and melds it with a contemporary, wise acre sensibility. Murphy is good and very likable in this part, and livens some scenes with his quips. He doesn't do too bad in the hero department, either. The great Charles Dance, as his nemesis, is a hoot with his straight faced performance. Charlotte Lewis is lovely to look at but that's about it. Old pros Victor Wong and James Hong add to the movie with their presence; Wong is fun in one of his standard eccentric roles. One can also hear the legendary and ultra ubiquitous Frank Welker lending a voice to an unseen demon, a voice just like the one he provided for Dr. Claw on the 'Inspector Gadget' series. There's a certain oddness to a particular sequence in the movie - the dream sequence - that makes it a real curio, as Feldman and Ritchie have fun with the whole weirdness of dreams. Dance appears to try to make Murphy an offer, and in response to some of Murphy's one liners, there's a cut to a studio audience laughing away. One of the best lines has to be, "Would you get your monkey off my back?", as Murphy refers to a henchman of Dance's with a primate like face. Granted, when Murphy gets to Nepal, there could have been a better fantasy quotient. As it is, the sequence where he proves his worth as the rescuer of the child could have had a little more meat to it. Some scenes come off as fairly awkward, but the ones that work are quite funny. The special effects aren't the greatest, but they lend a cheesy charm to the various goings-on. Michel Colombier's music is lively and loud, and the location shooting in Nepal is excellent, lending some much appreciated atmosphere. All of this is reasonably entertaining, and interesting enough. Don't let the scathing reviews dissuade you from giving it a chance. It's a nice alternative to the other Murphy vehicles from the period. Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

It has some pretty good special effects, and exciting action scenes.As a finder of lost children, Murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl, which leads him on the path for which others believe he was "chosen" - - to protect the Golden Child. The young boy is born as an enlightened one, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose very life is in danger, if not for the help of Murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector.Also, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts. One such scene is where the Golden Child, that Murphy's character is solicited to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice.This is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware. As we accept this premise of the plot, we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality, and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away, and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us.This is an excellent movie, with a good plot, fine acting, and for the most part, pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of Martial Art fighting, and Eddie Murphy humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>trivia connection to "The Shadow"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the movie was pretty good, will add it to my "clasic collection" after all this time. I believe I saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie. Maybe some of the more esoteric points defy "logic", but a great many religious matters accepted "on faith" fail to pass the smell test. If you're going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie. Is it just me or has anyone else noticed the Aja-Yee Dagger is the same possessed knife Lamonte Cranston had so much trouble gaining control of in "The Shadow". No mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here (IMDB), but I would bet a dollar to a donut it's the same prop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Action/Fantasy /Comedy and Definitely Eddie's most Underrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There Was a time when Eddie Murphy was one seriously funny guy, and this film is a good example of that, released in the fall of 1986 THE GOLDEN CHILD was met with mixed to mostly negative reviews (Then again Roger Ebert liked it) I really don't see why people didn't like this film, and to some extent it still to this day is considered a low point in eddies career, for those of you who haven't seen this film before/since i suggest giving it another watch with an open mind knowing that its a fantasy comedy and not your usual Eddie Murphy film (Probably the reason why people just didn't get into it) The Plot concerns Eddie trying to find a kidnapped child who holds magical powers that can bring love and peace in the world or can bring chaos and destroy the world if the child were to be polluted with anything evil, and the people who kidnapped him want to sacrifice the child to gain and use his power for their own evil scheme.PROS: Eddie Murphy is hilarious just playing the average Joe who cannot believe the situation around him, as things get crazier Eddie just gets funnier, Charles Dance as the main Villain does a Decent job at playing a Super Serious villain who seems to constantly keep pronouncing his J's Silent Which leads to a lot amusement when Eddie Murphy shares scenes with him. The Art Directiom is Splendid and the Cinematography is stunning (Especially with the scenes in Tibet) The Musical Score by Michael Colobier is so 80s but infectiously catchy Funk influenced Pop Rock that just makes you feel like a Bad A%$ The Film has a great supporting Cast Half of which appear in another similarly themed movie Called BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA And there's a handful of creative set pieces that really stand out (I.E) The Cave which Eddie must retrieve a dagger and a Hilarious Dream Sequence with Eddie and the villain.CONS: The Final showdown with the Villain feels a little rushed and the Villain's final form isn't all that inspired And the Film's Visual FX don't hold up well in 2 or 3 scenes But aside from that the Film is a lot of Fun, Eddie needs to release a special edition DVD/Blu Ray for this one, but according to some sources he's not too fond of this film (Honestly I don't see why, maybe because it was made at the height of his career and it burned him inside that it didn't do as well as it should have)Overall: 7/10 "Not as good as Coming to America or Beverly Hills cop, but its not far behind and definitely better than anything Eddie made in the 90s onwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sassy African-American who finds missing children for a living is hired to locate and retrieve The Golden Child, who's really important to both sides in some ancient battle between good and evil(fortunately, the latter is easily identified by frequent use of black clothing and the music cues). Apparently his skepticism towards, and disrespect of the magic and all the culture and such was deemed the best material, because they sure don't waste a single opportunity for making fun of that. The plot is fine, and develops reasonably throughout. Pacing is OK. I can't claim this ever really excited or gripped me, though it did occasionally entertain me. The fights have their moments. Jokes and gags vary, but if you're into Murphy's schtick, as it were in the 80's, you'll probably enjoy it. With some of these, you almost have to wonder if all of it was in the script, or if they just let the camera run sometimes when it was on him, and didn't yell 'cut' until he seemed unable to think of more for that scene. The special effects are terribly dated, and you can tell exactly where they begin and end here, as well as where the budget forced them to take a shortcut. Design and creativity is fair, though this doesn't hold a candle to countless others in the genres. The acting is good. Charles Dance gets to ham it up more in Last Action Hero, but he's still a decent villain here. Editing and cinematography are standard. There is moderate to strong language in this, if it's somewhat infrequent. Violence is mild. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of Eddie. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mystic baddie Sardo Numspa, seeking to do away with The Golden Child, is challenged by missing child detective Chandler Jarrell when the action moves from Tibet to Los Angeles.After a straight faced set up, with Charles Dance quite chilling as Numspa the nature of the film changes at the same time as the location, with the arrival of Eddie Murphy as wisecracking Jarrell. The film then becomes a decent romp - lots of action, some special effects which are mostly a bit shoddy even by the standards of the time, a dash of improbable romance, and Eddie Murphy being even Eddie Murphier than usual. This latter point means that he's really irritating, of course, but the character is drawn warmly which defuses it somewhat. Charles Dance is good, Charlotte Lewis is attractive, James Hong is great (as usual) and Jasmine Reate is charming as the Golden Child himself.While not being great, this is still a fairly solidly entertaining movie pitched at family level.</fullReview>

The lightheadedness, silly sense of humor, adventure, magic, fantasy...from moves like Legend with Tom Cruise to Willow, Labyrynth, Krull, The Beast Master, The Dragonslayer, all the Conan movies with Schwarzenegger....they just don't make these awesome, majestic, escapist films anymore. Movies where you are taken to another world and time and magic is real. This is a great movie. It has everything from humor to adventure, romance, suspense, supernatural horror. It's just a great movie, very entertaining and an upbeat and uplifting ending. Watch with your kids, then watch the others or better yet, buy on DVD. I personally love having a physical copy of a movie with the cover art more than downloads which seem 'unsubstantial.'</fullReview>

A demon disguised as a man burns a mark in your arm with his fingernail... that's strange, but it is Los Angeles. That pretty much was the reaction of Jarell Chandler (Eddie Murphy). I'm not saying that that is the reason I didn't like the movie, but it was a big contributor. I understand that the movie was fantasy, but to Jarell, and the rest of the otherwise normal citizens of L.A., these events were admittedly not normal. So how in the world was his reaction so tame? Jarell Chandler's indifferent response summed up Eddie Murphy's performance. Eddie Murphy wasn't classic Eddie Murphy. He had a few good lines but this was easily one of his worst movies. I never saw Pluto Nash and Norbit was somewhat of a downer but this movie was in his heyday. The movie really depended on Eddie delivering, and I mean REALLY depended on him because the story was weak and the other actors were even weaker than the story. Of course we know that Eddie's career wasn't defined by this movie and thank God for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>enjoyable exotic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching the Golden Child when i was young and have fond memories of it during those periods. The story is well known about a remote area in Tibet when a magical child is abducted by an evil wizard and a mysterious beauty comes to an American (surprisingly) to rescue this magical child and the I am sure you can guess the rest of it by pure logic on how it unfolds. The story is action packed and allows us from a westerners view to respect eastern culture and be enchanted by all things different so it has a deep meaning although it follows the same legacy of old conservative films going out to the exotic this one bridges as during this period people had become accepting. Along with good action, fast adventure and a modern attitude without being reticent about Tibetan traditions enriching the film. The characters are well written and cast, the story is unique though follows a simplebut effective continuation along with good music and realistic action intriguing the audience. Charlotte Lewis is perfectly cast in this film. Eddie Murphy plays well and is entertaining with good humour but is miscast. I read on here IMDb that Mel Gibson was originally offered the role which would of suited the story and overall film better but perhaps for obvious (ideological) reasons he refused it which is the only critic i have of the film but overall its good, underrated but a good 80s classic with action and humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awfully written and shot, but thoroughly enjoyable film, "The Golden Child" is an example of 80's cheese that's mildly entertaining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, the 80's, how I love thee.There's just something about that decade. Whether it be for better or for worse, the 80's just had such a distinct style and character, and its one that I grew up with, despite being a 90's kid, as I watched my parents and older sister's favorite films of the 80's and experienced their love for the decade second-hand. I was born in '88, but I wish I had been born a few years prior, so I could have actually had memories of those years first-hand.And amongst those years, was Eddie Murphy. Now, I know that Murphy has been around since, with a slew of hit comedies in the 90's, and a few recent glimmers of hope at a career revival. But the 80's was the era of Eddie. It's where he reached his prime in classics like "Beverly Hills Cop", "Coming to America" and "Trading Places.""The Golden Child" is not one of Eddie's classics. It's arguably one of his worst films both plot and production wise, to be honest. It is, however, for all intents and purposes, a fun piece of fluff that literally oozes the 80's vibe, and has enough likability to actually function well as a brain-dead piece of dumb-fun.Murphy stars as our lead, Chandler Jarrell, a wise-cracking guy who works as... well, he works. I really didn't get what his character was supposed to be. At first, it's implied he's a cop or a detective, but then other scenes seem to suggest he's a social worker (which I've seen mentioned as his profession on other websites)... Yet he also is allowed onto the scene of a murder where he combs through evidence. Perhaps he's a cop who interns at a social work center?Anywho, Chandler is approached by a pretty young woman named Kee Nang, who informs him that he is the "chosen one", who must save the "Golden Child"- a child with magical powers, whom was kidnapped from Nepal by the villainous Sardo Numspa (Charles Dance), a demonic figure with magical powers of his own.Chandler, hesitant at first by Kee's bizarre claims, is eventually dragged into the fight to rescue the child when he realizes her claims are true. And so, a struggle to reclaim the magical boy and a mystical dagger begins from the clutches of Numspa begins.Before I start in on what's wrong with the film, first let me address what is right about it, and why I gave this film a few courtesy points. Eddie Murphy and the cast are enjoyable, and save the film. Murphy, though annoying, does illicit a lot (and I do mean a LOT) of giggles and chuckles throughout the film. Charlotte Lewis, who portrays Kee, is pretty and completely likable as Chandler's guide and potential love interest. Dance is a bit of fun as the villain. And supporting characters portrayed by the likes of Victor Wong, James Hong and J.L. Reate (the eponymous Golden Child, who is actually played by a girl) are a lot of fun. The cast is likable.Also, the effects in the film are fantastic for the 80's. A lot of stop-motion animation, miniatures and optical effects are utilized (and provided by Industrial Lights and Magic), and they are among the best of the decade. Particularly the stop motion in two sequences (the "dancing Pepsi can" and the big demon creatures who shows up), which are so well- done I completely forgot they were even effects, and thought they were somehow shot in-camera for real. Wonderful effects and animation work.Now, let's get started on what doesn't work. First, the script, by Dennis Feldman. It barely functions within a storytelling capacity. I already mentioned above the the film is barely able to establish what Chandler's profession is, and it doesn't stop there. The first few scenes are actually well-written, including a cool opening that establishes the Golden Child before he is kidnapped in a cool little heist, and a great comedic scene introducing Chandler. But from there, it falls apart. Almost no attention is given to character development. Chandler is the same character throughout the film- he doesn't grow or become more responsible. Nobody in the film at all has any sort of character arc. And the script seems unable to focus in on the story at all. Scene after scene is jumbled, and nothing is established properly. It's a very poorly written film.The direction by Michael Ritchie and the editing by Richard A. Harris (both established talents in film) are the other big problem. Ritchie, who is actually a decent filmmaker, seems lost with the material. Shots are very bland and boring, and a lot of them are poorly framed. It felt like his heart wasn't in it at all. And the editing is jarring, foul and creates an uneven pace that will practically give you whiplash. Not only that, but the jarring nature of the editing also creates a lot of continuity problems. It's a poorly crafted film from the directorial and editing perspective.Also, there are a lot of weird little problems within the film. From wonky costume design, to bizarre inconsistencies within the logic of the filmmaking (including the treatment of Kee, who is alternatingly sexualized and made to look "hot" before suddenly being dressed uber- conservatively and un-sexualized, which happens repeatedly)... It felt like the crew was unaware and unsure of what type of film to make, and kept second-guessing themselves."The Golden Child" is a bizarre little film. The performances and the imaginative effects make it worth checking out, but the storytelling and direction is offensively bad. I'd say give it a shot, you might like it, you might not. An average 5 out of 10 for the good which just slightly outweighs the bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murphy battles black magic in dated '80s offering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A magic-fuelled '80s comedy/adventure hybrid that occupies the same sub-genre as BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA and THE LAST DRAGON. THE GOLDEN CHILD is less spectacular than both of those films ? it has fewer special effects than the first and no martial arts like the second ? but it proves to be a likable enough film boasting a strong comic turn from Eddie Murphy before he stopped making films for adults.The story, as it reads, is exceptionally lightweight: Murphy is, for some inexplicable reason, the 'Chosen One' and his job is to rescue the 'Golden Child' from the clutches of evil, personified by Charles Dance in one of those stock British villain-type roles that Hollywood seem to love. There's a magic dagger, an interlude in Tibet and some magical adventures involving the cute shaven-headed kid, but for the most part this is a vehicle for Murphy to show off his comic abilities and he does that admirably.The movie boasts a rare performance from Charlotte Lewis, a poor actress but quite lovely to watch on screen. There are also two supporting roles for familiar Asian actors in Hollywood, James Hong and Victor Wong, the latter giving a particularly funny turn as a mad mystic. Watch out for Randall "Tex" Cobb, almost unrecognisable beneath Klingon makeup. The special effects have badly dated since the film's initial release, but in a good way: I admit I got a kick out of seeing the various magic bolts, mysterious creatures and climatic scenes involving a demon attack (the demon, incidentally, looks just like the one at the very end of EVIL DEAD 2). THE GOLDEN CHILD is no great shakes but fans of 1980s should nevertheless enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Golden Child is a quirky combination of action, martial arts, fantasy, comedy and romance. The film takes itself quite seriously, save for Eddie Murphy's character, which is sarcastic and disbelieving of his fish out of water experience. However, there are several excellent action sequences, and overall the film can hold the audiences attention well. The characters are fairly compelling, and the main villain and female lead both add the tone of seriousness to the plot.This movie is very similar to "Big Trouble In Little China" though it takes itself far more seriously, and is geared towards an older audience. Where Big Trouble was very cheesy, Golden Child is more dramatic.Overall, this is a fun romp, and an excellent way to spend a couple of hours for escape and entertainment.</fullReview>

Just don't expect to get as many laughs from this as you would have from Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places or 48 HRS.

Murphy in the'80s made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from 1986 up to now have changed. The atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period. A nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic Murphy, an actor who has recently disappeared. The final part is anthologies, the likable actor who plays the part of the Tibetan Monk.

		<fullReview>The jokes throughout The Golden Child have a high tendency of falling incredibly flat (seemingly to the point in which you fell absolutely embarrassed). The one-liners and comedic situations in general are either half-hearted or forced for the most part. For example, there's a scene in which somebody is laying in a dark alley after getting his entire face slashed with someone implying that he cut himself shaving. The special effects are passable but they somewhat feel more like exhibits rather than a plot devise. The action sequences that will occasionally pop up aren't particularly memorable. They play out more as routines than anything else. While the premise of The Golden Child is somewhat interesting, the material all around is lack-luster and lame. There's a too much of a feeling throughout that not much of an effort is being put into the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disoriented film with a weak Murphy role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy had two exceptionally good comedies in the first three years of his film career. But since "Trading Places" in 1983 and "Beverly Hills Cop" in 1984, only a few of his movies haven't fizzled. And those that didn't fizzle were just average. "The Golden Child" is in that group. In most of his films, Murphy plays with very few well-known actors. That's the case in this early film that came right on the heels of his two big hit movies. The lack of other name performers may say something about the material Murphy has to work with in most of his films. Either Murphy or his agent (or both) have a bad sense of judgment about what may be a good project for a hit movie. The plot of "The Golden Child" had some possibilities, but the story jumps all over the place. The script is weak, and the direction, filming and editing are poor. The most interesting and entertaining aspects of the film involve the young monk, the golden child, played by Jasmine Reate.In 2015, Eddie Murphy still has some years of acting ahead. One would hope he would land some good scripts and be able to entertain us again with some crisp, funny and engrossing comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too golden, but not too bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will get a few chuckles out of this action comedy starring Eddie Murphy, who plays a private detective specializing in missing persons. He has been chosen to help find a kidnapped Buddhist mystic called the Golden Child, who is the key to saving the world from a demon.The pacing of the movie is steady and slow at times, but it is straight and to the point of finding the missing child without much fillers. Murphy does play his character pretty well, with his sharp, somewhat comedic approach and quick action, blending in with the mixture of modern-day child abduction and ancient mysticism well. There is also some nice special effects, particular the Golden Child moving objects around with his mind.I would have like to see more action, though, between the good and bad guys as I thought the second half was rushed somewhat and scenes cut away from one and another too quickly. Murphy wasn't too funny in this one, but gave me a few chuckles here and there, particular in the scene where he tried to speak Cantonese. I would have have liked to see the Golden Child emphasized more as well.But, above all, it isn't too bad of an action comedy. It's watchable to spend the night with.Grade C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fairly original storyline coupled with Murphy's energy make this watchable but it may be a little bizarre for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chandler Jarrell (Eddie Murphy) is an expert at finding lost children. Jarrell learns of a case where a missing Tibetan child known as The Golden Child has been kidnapped and is asked to assist in rescuing the child. The Golden Child is no ordinary child and is the sole person responsible for ensuring peace will remain on Earth, but evil sorcerers lead by Sardo Numspa (Charles Dance) intend to use the child for their own evil purposes and in order to appease their evil god.I'm prepared to commend this film because despite some of its weaknesses it is a fairly original story and for that reason it is very easy to get involved with the film. This film of course has Eddie Murphy in it from a time back in the 1980's when he was very much still in his prime. Part of the reason that this film works is Murphy himself - he brings his usual energy to the table and the fact that he also plays a good guy who's fairly likable also helped to keep me invested in the film.This film is also pretty funny - I liked it at the start where Murphy is trying to make an appeal about his search for a lost kid and the talk show host is talking over him and tries to change the subject or discuss more trivial matters. It's funny because it's believable and I assume it meant to act as some sort of satire on arrogant and self-absorbed talk show hosts. What the writers were trying to say here didn't really matter to me (the fact that I found it funny was more important). The humour here was also surprisingly clean for a Murphy vehicle and it's even more surprising given the dark plot that the writers serve up here. All these aspects work well to create an entertaining and original film but....I've applauded the film for having a fairly original story, but sadly the development of the story is quite poor and is never really fleshed out enough to make this aspect work. There was also a random section where it's as though Murphy and the evil sorcerers are on a film set with a live audience which I never really understood. It kind of goes from interesting &amp; refreshing to bizarre and strange - the final sequence is ridiculous and mildly embarrassing. I also felt that because the bizarre story dominated so much of the second half of the film that it almost undid all the humour and intrigue that had been built up in the first half.This film is far from perfect, but Murphy's energy, the original story, and the reasonable number of laughs that you get here do make it watchable. Dance isn't given much to do, but he is effective in his scenes and actually makes a good villain (albeit his character is a little thin). Lewis is more than a pretty face and actually holds her own well here and the chemistry between her and Murphy isn't bad.This film has an IMDb rating of 5.8 and I think that the IMDb community have got it about right; it's not great enough to stack up against some of Murphy's better vehicles, but it isn't bad enough to render it unwatchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GOLDEN CHILDI like this movie.It has been a lot of years since I last watched this film, and even though it was still very good... it was not as good as I used to think it was.Eddie Murphy is a legend. I love his movies from the 80s. He was so funny. Don't get me wrong... he still is, but he is more family friendly now. I thought he was funnier when he was swearing etc... his stand up gigs (Delirious and Raw) were brilliant.The Golden Child was funny, but not as good as some of Eddies others.There were a lot of special effects in this. They were great at the time, but these days they look pretty weak. The story was good though. I liked the idea of the knife and the way Eddie has to get it. The bad guy, played by Charles Dance, was awesome. I loved the way he was so British and calm through the whole film. He played the part really deadpan. I also loved the creature he turned into near the end. The only thing I am slightly disappointed about, was they killed him off too quickly. They could have stretched the ending out a bit. It seemed to end very quickly.But I love a lot of 80s films... I honestly believe they were brilliant. The look of them, the stories, the effects and the soundtracks were great. You can almost always tell an 80s movie from the background score of a film.I will give this film 7 out of 10.A great movie, but not as good as Coming to America, Beverly Hills Cop, Trading places etc...For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

I also like to see Eddie the way he used to be before he got all Disney on us. He needs to drop an (F) bomb every now and then. And the Asian chick was smoking i love the seen when she kicks the biker through the wall and get her shirt wet, very hot.

		<fullReview>To watch this movie is to appreciate the great comedic talents of Eddie Murphy. Armed with a ridiculous story and a poorly written script, Murphy pulls off one of the great cinematic saves of the 20th Century.While most of the movie is fluff and fantasy, at best, it is worth watching just to see Eddie take us from beginning to end and make us laugh while doing it.This is the ultimate inside joke movie -- as his often knowing glances into the camera tell us: "yes, this movie is ridiculous, but since we're both stuck here let's enjoy the ride."No, this is not a comedy for the ages. But in today's world where horrific movies like "Summer Catch" get green-lighted and into cinemas, "Golden Child" reminds us of a time when really bad movies - and studios with very poor judgment -- could be saved by very talented individuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to most of the fantasy films that have been made over time whether it be Conan or Lord of the Rings , The Golden Child does seem like a rather poor attempt at it . However it could be worse , but the good points of the film is that it opens very quickly and ends quickly as well . There is not any big plot so if got up to go the toilet you have not really missed anything at all . Charles Dance does a cool job of playing the suave villain whilst Eddie Murphy just reminded me that he was just as annoying back in the 1980's as he is in present day . This film is a no Brain really , I would not really recommend it to rent , purchase or maybe even to watch it if its on TV but check it out if your an Eddie Murphy fan or if you are really bored out of your skull. On the whole could of been far more entertaining but just very average to keep you going till the end .THE GOLDEN CHILD - 5.6 OUT OF 10 FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN , WISHING YOU GOOD LUCK AND GOOD NIGHT !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally considered a low point in Eddie Murphy's career, "The Golden Child" is actually a mixed bag. It's at its best when it spoofs the solemnity and the cliches of most exotic epics, and when Murphy delivers some sarcastic, witty wisecracks. And it's at its worst when it resorts to violence (excessively graphic for such a film), special effects and too much "local color" to fill in the dead spots. (**)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right away, I'll say that the plot for this movie is downright asinine. A toddler could have typed the script up. But thankfully, Eddie Murphy is downright hilarious in this film, making jokes and acting goofy in every scene. This movie contains some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen. While most people may just consider them.....whatever they want....I crack up just thinking about them. For example, the scene where Chandler (Eddie) walks into the bar and starts harassing the customers to tell him where Tommy Tong (who works for Sardo the demon) makes me laugh hysterically every time I see it. And the first scene where Chandler is on a talk show trying to tell the public about a missing girl and the flakey host keeps interrupting him also tickles my crazy bone. Hmm, lemmie think of one more: AHA! The dream scene where Chandler meets Sardo and his henchmen is making me laugh right now as I think about it while typing. There are just too many other funny scenes that make me chuckle uncontrollably to list here.If you decide to rent this, you'll be in for some good laughs, even if you're not an Eddie Murphy fan.

		<shortDescription>Other Than A Gorgeous Charlotte Lewis, There is Nothing To See Here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you say Eddie Murphy is in a poor movie, it's not a surprise, it's the norm, now a days. But back in 1986 when this was released, it is a massive shock. Following on from a hot streak of good performances in funny movies like 48 Hrs, Trading Places, Best Defense and sandwiched in between Beverley Hills Cop and it's sequel. The Golden Child stands out for all the wrong reasons. confined by the restraints of a PG movie, this is a much watered down Eddie Murphy and a diluted Eddie Murphy of the 80's is not a funny one. Charles Dance is always a reliable actor, and he does his best, with what he is given. Sadly he is not given a great deal to do. The gorgeous Charlotte Lewis is the best thing in this awful movie. I would rather go see a firework display on a very rainy night, than watch this again. Don't watch it, pass it by, avoid it like the plague. Excluding Lewis and Dance, the acting is bad, bad, bad. Murphy included.I give this a generous 4/10. 1 point for Charles Dance, 1 point for The unbelievably sexy Charlotte Lewis, and two points for scenes featuring her in A, a wet shirt, and B, tied up in Murphy's dream sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not always golden to see Murphy in a film like this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Jackson would have claimed a spot for the top-billed character in THE GOLDEN CHILD, and because he loves kids. That didn't work (and why should it?), so instead we have Eddie Murphy out to save the world by rescuing "Kid Midas". I would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy - adventure - comedy that's a step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or does can be best liked, but don't get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent; he doesn't belong in this movie, and the same went for DR. DOLITTLE! The violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic, and that wouldn't have made any sense as Hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy. Speaking of visuals, they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential fame. Murphy is far better at COMING TO AMERICA and 48 HRS, but this stale movie isn't my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did this movie do so well?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am guessing the reason this movie did so well at the box office is of course Eddie Murphy. I think this was his first movie since "Beverly Hills Cop" so at the time he was hot. Considering that one made over two hundred million and it was R and this one made about 80 million and it was pg does say it was not all that popular. I have never been a big Eddie Murphy fan, so that is probably another reason I didn't care for it much at all. This one has Eddie as some sort of finder of lost kids. He must find the golden child or the world is in terrible peril. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is it does not compare to the special effects. I had seen better stuff done in the 70's than some of the stuff this one offers, Ray Harryhausen did better stuff. Still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of Eddie, unfortunately he is not very funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" type scenes. I guess they were hoping for a fish out of water effect, but to me it just did not work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misfire for Eddie Murphy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain, they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds peaked, then started making dreadful Hal Needham car chase flicks. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest property in Hollywood, only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling Last Action Hero. And here, loquacious Eddie Murphy erases memories of Trading Places and 48 Hours with this "family" adventure flick, which is an unbelievably tedious, childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see Charlotte Lewis's great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film.The story is pure humdrum. It concerns social worker Murphy, contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the Chosen One. Chosen for what, I hear you ask. His job is to rescue a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, classy actor Charles Dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents. Of all Murphy's films, this is easily the worst. I've read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see Murphy in an atypical role, in a non formulaic kind of film, and while both points are loosely true there's no forgiving the fact that the film - however atypical and non formulaic it might be - is an absolute load of garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very silly and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely one of funny man Eddie Murphy's lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child, three hundred year old dragons and a "Chosen One".Murphy is the "Chosen One" in question, and as the opening song suggests, he is "the best man in the world". A finder of lost and missing children, he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells him he is "The Chosen One", and that it is his destiny to find and rescue "The Golden Child". For if the child were to die, compassion would die with him, as he is the bearer of compassion.If all this hocus pocus rubbish hasn't ruined it for you now, it surely will once the movie begins. Suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film. Meant to be another vehicle for Murphy's egotistical brand of humour (the comedy isn't so great mind you), the movie fails on many levels. Even Charles Dance as the evil Sardo Numspa can't do much for proceedings. Very silly and disappointing.Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai", or "Big Trouble in Little China", or "Conan the Barbarian", which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self-deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations, The Golden Child is just plain bad.The premise itself is not unworkable, and there are some funny moments. But here the Eddy Murphy "flip attitude" just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story. And the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension. The "mystic secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel.Without a feeling that anything is at stake, or that the characters are faced by real danger, why should we care?Who should see this film:-- big fans of Eddy Murphy who can't help themselves-- I can't think of anyone elseI'll give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy is an excellent comic, good at writing, and most of his films have failed to really capture how good Murphy is at comedy - whereas his onstage antics really do.Unfortuently for murphy, this is yet another film full of potential that doesn't capture Murphy as good as he can be. In fact, its hard not to call this film boring and flat film without pointing to the fact that Murphy doesn't seem to try as hard later on in the film then he does in the early stages.The film surrounds Murphy who must rescue the golden child from demons who want to kill him and overthrow the earth. The demons, lead by Charles Dance seem nothing more than cartoon characters - whereas Dance isn't given enough to do, and although he looks great in a long overcoat and gives menancing looks he doesn't really have the same venom as say his character from Last Action Hero.Anyway, the film is kinda dogged down, its too slow - it takes forever to get going - and when it does it slow's down, yet again.Charlotte Lewis, although great to look at, is more wooden than a wooden ship and even her "bondage" scene doesn't even lift it up to any other levels.This is a pretty poor film. Avoid it.Overall 2/10</fullReview>

(Charles Dance) is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is doing a non-comic joking, and I heard that this sunk had already succeed, big time success??!! I'll never understand why or how ?! In one TV interview I've heard (Eddie Murphy) himself, when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, regretted it in a comic way !! One of the comments said (Hey...It's the 1980s !). Well, no my friend. It's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of RAZZIE movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s ! There are 2 reasons made me write about this movie. The first is that I'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of (Charlotte Lewis) especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house, wearing just a blue shirt and OH BOY the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be. But how odd ! As I've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again ?!! Anyhow the second reason is that I've found this movie's title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies ever!The bottom line: Bad movie, Greeeeeat legs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics , and I`m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of Eddie Murphy so I guess this movie has something going for itIt gets off to a bad start where Buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face . Bad guys enter the templeChild sits with blank expressionBad guys chop up the monksChild sits with blank expressionBad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with ... Go on guess ? You do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at Michael Jackson`s wonderland ranch he`d still give the same blank expression , this movie would be better titled THE WOODEN CHILDThe title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily . Obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated . Not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening . In fact that`s the main problem ( And boy it`s a serious one ) with this movie - The whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it`s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together . I blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too . Did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be ? It`s part fantasy , part martial arts , part buddy movie , part comedy and it`s all crap</fullReview>

There and in fragments of other movies he's proven (to me) to be the best of the crop of black comedic actors since Richard Prior blew his mind. But his ability as an actor is very narrow; usually he is reduced to impressions. It must be really hard for him to find vehicles. This one was a huge mistake. This character needs to be near the center of the reason for the story. He's a Jerry Lewis type actor, and needs the integration of his goofy character with a similar goofy story.
