		<shortDescription>A true original comedy that wouldn't get made today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very funny and entertaining movie that doesn't fit into any one category. It's about a slightly crazed movie director who is making a WW1 movie in Southern California who hires a fugitive to replace his top stuntman. Peter O'Toole gives perhaps his best performance ever as the egomaniacal filmmaker who will do anything, perhaps even murder someone, in order to protect his artistic vision. The underrated Steve Railsback is good also as the paranoid Vietnam vet turned fugitive from the law. The action scenes are very funny and well-done, especially the rooftop chase. The music score is appropriately clever and matches what's happening on screen. Real-life stunt man Chuck Bail has a good part as a stunt coordinator who shows Railsback the ropes. The editing techniques help blur the line between reality and make-believe. The film is a bit too long, though, and some key scenes go on longer than necessary. These are minor complaints, however, because a film like this doesn't get made very often anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The art and artifice of filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Revered as one of the greatest "cult" films of all time I recently saw it and most of my expectations were met. Steven Railsback plays a character named Cameron. A former Vietnam veteran and fugitive on the lam. At the begining of the film we see him being pursued by the police after he is spotted in a restaurant. Cameron while being chased accidentally stumbles onto a movie set where a World War I epic is being shot. After almost being killed by a stunt man on a bridge by a car Cameron picks up an object and throws it at the windshield of the vehicle causing it to swerve off the bridge and fall into a nearby river. A helicopter suddenly descends in front of Cameron. Inside it are the filmcrew documenting the bridge scene with it's director Eli Cross ( Peter O'Toole) starring at Cameron and what has happened. Cameron flees from the scene as the helicopter soars away. Eventually Eli Cross meets up with Cameron and convinces him to replace the stunt man or Cross will turn him into the police. Cameron has little choice. Thus begins the main characters harrowing journey. The Stunt Man is a complex and multilayered film. It requires multiple viewings in order to catch all of the subtleties and nuances. As the film progresses we see Cameron placed into various stunt scenes, each one more dangerous than the last. Is Eli Cross trying to kill him? The film is a fascinating battle of psychological mind games. Cameron's perception of reality becomes skewed with the fantasy world of filmmaking as he becomes less able to distinguish until the final frame. We the viewer are also constantly confused as the film makes many unpredictable twists and turns with it's convoluted plot. Peter O'Toole is perfect as the flamboyant, megalomanical filmmaker. No one else could to the role justice and bring that much class to the part. Barbara Hershey is also good as the lead actress of Eli Cross' film who becomes romantically involved with Cameron. I have many favorite scenes from the movie. Especially the crash course in stunt work Cameron is given by the lead stunt man played by Chuck Bail, a real life former stunt man. Director Rush has seamlessly balanced pathos with humor to create a unique film of epic proportions. It is a film that the viewer must discipline oneself in order to watch.....but what a payoff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's called 'subjective reality', children. The fact that the truth depends on the angle you happen to be watching from gives us all our unique, if skewed and unfair, perception on life. We're all puppets in someone else's dastardly play and we never know when that person, that entity, that divine being will cut our strings.This was director Richard Rush's dream project and it took him nine years to get it on the screen. And, of course, it would! It's multi-layered, original, funny and packed full of story and circumstance that makes you think. Why would any studio want to touch it? Fox even sat on it for two years before giving it a limited release. Even on its umpteenth viewing it delivers again and again, offering new angles and subtle clues.The viewpoint of this metafictional masterpiece is Cameron (Steve Railsback), a Vietnam vet on the run from the law. He stumbles onto the set of a WWI movie and accidentally kills a stunt driver. The director of the movie is the eccentric and megalomaniacal Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole, in one of his best ever performances), who takes Cameron under his wing and protects him from John Law, as long as he keeps his mouth shut about the accident.Cameron practices to be a stunt man and takes the place of the man he killed. But as the movie shoot becomes more elaborate and dangerous, he falls in love with the leading lady (Barbara Hershey) and starts to suspect that Eli is trying to capture his death on film.Although it seems nasty, the movie is wonderfully light-hearted and the outrageous stunt scenes are backed up by an awesome score by Dominic Frontiere. I've been humming that theme since I was 12-years-old when I taped it off Channel 4 in December 1992. I didn't quite get it back then, but I nearly wore out that VHS watching it over and over. A long scene with Cameron running over a rooftop, as biplanes attack and enemy soldiers give chase, is pure joy. There is a great comic sense of humor in watching them trip over each other, fall off, and get blown up.John Law do not back down on their suspicion of Eli and, through half-heard conversations and eavesdropping, Cameron's paranoia becomes increasingly justified. Because the movie is seen through his eyes we never quite know what is going on with Eli. Is he a madman, or just a crafty director? Would you believe that Peter O'Toole based his performance on his experiences with David Lean? Why he never won an Oscar (it went to Robert DeNiro for Raging Bull)- is beyond me. He truly gives the performance of his career, far exceeding even Laurence of Arabia. It also sucks that Rush never won for Director, or Adapted Screenplay. Had he been awarded the golden statuette, maybe he would have received more recognition. He's clearly a better filmmaker than most of today's hack artists.You simply have to see The Stunt Man. It's an overlooked gem and, despite the wide praise it received, it has never really reached a large audience. Now is definitely the time to rediscover this forgotten classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of the 1980's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was prepared to dislike this film when I heard that it was going to replace the incredible "Empire Strikes Back." What I got was shock. Here was something different, something innovative in style and technique, something amazing. Vader and his gang were soon forgotten as I got caught up in the suspense (Will Cameron survive?), the comedy, the incredible dialogue, and one of the best soundtracks ever put on film. I fell in love with Barbara Hershey all over again after too long an absence. O'Toole was Oscar-worthy, and robbed of one. Richard Rush pulled a one-of-a-kind out of his hat, ala "Citizen Kane." He has never been near this level before or since. This must be watched several times in order to see and hear everything. There are so many subtle touches that are brilliant that I still find them 20 years and 30+ viewings later. A must for anyone who wants to know good film great. No doubt about this one. A "10" out of "10." No film was better(or as good) in the 1980's (or 90's for that matter.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw THE STUNT MAN, I was very enthusiastic about the film and raved about it to anyone who might be interested. I've watched it twice with some friends since, but they weren't very enthusiastic about it, so I can imagine that for many people it won't pay off. It's an ingeniously constructed film that takes some patience and attention to watch. Made by the erratic Richard Rush, this was his pet project for nine years. Although the direction is fine, it's mostly a virtuoso piece of scripting (credited to Rush and Lawrence B. Marcus, based on Paul Brodeur's novel) that makes this such a special film. A short plot outline: Fugitive Cameron (Railsback) stumbles onto a movie set where megalomaniac director Eli Cross (O'Toole) promises to hide from the police if he replaces his ace stunt man, who got killed earlier on the set in a freak accident while filming a scene. Is Eli trying to capture Cameron's death on film while he is performing a stunt? Reality and imagination soon blur when Cameron grows increasingly paranoid because Eli Cross doesn't let anything or anybody get in the way of shooting his masterpiece the way he wants. He doesn't seem to care about human life, as long as his movie is shot in the way he wants it.Railsback is an odd choice for the main role but apparently the makers wanted a "low-key" actor for the main part. Barbara Hershey gives a great performance but without Peter O'Toole's tour-de-force performance, I doubt if the film would have worked as well as it did, especially with such a challenging and multi-layered script. He delivers his lines with such vigor that you cannot look away, a grand performance by perhaps my favorite actor off all time. Such a pity that his (later) career mainly consisted of mediocre films at best and some disastrous ones, sadly... I cannot imagine this kind of film being made in Hollywood today and even back then it might be called a small miracle it got made in the first place, let alone released (in fact, it sat on the shelf for two years before release). Perhaps it's all a little too ambitious at times but with a cast like this and such a dazzling script, it's definitely worth the effort. The DVD-release by Anchor Bay comes with an extra disc loaded with extra's. Lots of interviews, including one with O'Toole and a very peculiar - almost two-hour (!) - documentary about the making of the film, presented by Rush himself, almost worth seeing in itself.Camera Obscura - 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite movies of all time. Must admit that I'm a bit biased since Peter O'Toole's one of my favorite actors of all time. This movie has NEVER gotten the attention that it deserves. Maybe that's, in part, due to the difficulties involved in categorizing it. I don't even know in which section of the video store I'd start looking.Peter O'Toole is so swell in it. I love that enigmatic character, movie director Eli Cross! Like the movie (and O'Toole, for that matter), he's so hard to cubbyhole. You like him, but you don't trust him. Like Cameron/Lucky (Steve Railsback's escaped convict character) does, you NEED to know exactly where his motives lie ... all in good time. You know Cross'll do whatever's necessary to get "the shot", but he's still got a conscience ... right? Would Cameron have been better off (read safer) just staying in jail ... hmmm?All the action in the film circles around this question and while the viewer (and Cameron) decide what to make of Eli, it's a fun trip through the world of filmmaking (how realistic a trip, I've no idea). Great performances by O'Toole and Railsback, along with Barbara Hershey, Allen Garfield, Alex Rocco and Sharon Ferrell add so much to the suspense.See this movie. You can feel how much fun it was for the cast to make. Look at Eli's devilish grin as he tries to soothe Lucky's worries. Try to imagine how many other movies have you sympathizing for an escaped convict. And don't worry if you don't know what to make of mad genius filmmaker Eli Cross because nobody else does either, and if they do, they ain't talkin' ... that might spoil the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't carry on about the plot of this marvelous flick since it's already been adequately limned, but do let me emphasize a few points that have been kind of grayed out in other comments. The score by Frontiere is outstanding, from the up-tempo opening blast to the final credits. It's not only unnerving but vertigo inducing, so it supplements the plot perfectly. The photography is outstanding as well, the colors appallingly vivid, as in an MGM cartoon, which in this context is most apt. (It is a mystery/comedy/thriller/philosophical disquisition, after all.) The Hotel Coronado in San Diego has never looked quite so palatial, not even in "Some Like it Hot." Rush's direction boggles the mind, to coin a phrase. The film begins with a helicopter. A hand pops out of the helicopter and drops a half-eaten apple. The apple bounces on the hood of a parked car. We follow without comment the apple, the line of events, and it turns out to be what gets the story moving. There are multiple very strange touches throughout. As a movie star myself, having been a faceless extra in half a dozen films, I have to add that movies are simply not shot this way. An expensive and dangerous (and ultimately lethal) stunt is performed as we enter the actual narrative and there is only one camera rolling -- and that in a helicopter so far away that its engine can't be heard? But it doesn't really matter. The movie plays tricks all along with the difference between "reality" and "illusion," an old game into which it's difficult to inject more life, as this movie manages to do. At one point, Railsback is told to perform a short if dangerous stunt, leaping from one roof to another. He does so, but the stunt escalates. Not only escalates but goes on and on, with Railsback unexpectedly crashing through ceilings and floors in a shower of glass before winding up in the midst of drunken, partying enemies who shout at him and laughingly lift his body above their heads and pass him around the room. It will shock you almost as much as it shocked him. O'Toole asks him after this long gag what it is he wants. Says Railsback: "Not to think I'm going crazy." The smallest parts are done well. A very authentic-looking German soldier with a cheery old face and big white mustache is loading his rifle for a scene in which he and his comrades are going to fire at Railsback. "I hope those are blanks," Railsback tells him. "It doesn't say so on the box," replies the soldier with a friendly tone and a big smile. Let me mention Eli Cross, the director, played by O'Toole. At one level this movie is made, through his character, into an examination of God, and his whimsical sense of responsibility towards the human beings whose lives he controls. "Eli Cross"? I mean -- okay -- Elihu, the crucifixion -- the whole JudeoChristian tradition is embodied in that cognomen. Cross has a habit of riding around the sky in a giant crane whose seat drops unexpectedly out of space and into the middle of peoples' conversations. Before the shooting of the final stunt, Cross raises his hand, looking at the horizon, and says something like, "I hereby decree that no cloud shall pass before that sun." And while shooting another scene, the cameraman calls "Cut." Cross pauses, then asks, "WHO called cut?" The cameraman explains that there were only a few seconds of film left on the reel so they had to cut at that point. Cross, like the angry God of the Old Testament, shouts that, "NOBODY cuts a scene except ME!" After chewing the cameraman out thoroughly, he fires him on the spot. You see, if a movie is supposed to resemble life, then ending a scene suddenly ends the filmic exposure of the two human conversants and only -- well, you get the picture. A lot of this rather obvious theological stuff seems to have gotten by unrecognized or at any rate uncommented upon. It doesn't need to be dwelt on. There are already so many layers to this film that the viewer can afford to be only half aware of any one of them at a given moment. It stands by itself as a kind of very strange comedy. I didn't find Railsback's background as a Vietnam vet put on very thickly, by the way. It would be nice if God really were as accessible as Peter O'Toole is in this movie. All you would have to do to find salvation is jump through some well-defined hoops. As it is, though, I for one find myself muddling through from one day to the next simply hoping not to step on too many toes. Gimme a fiery hoop or a dive off a bridge any day. Just as long as my scene isn't cut too quickly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and entertaining all is not always what it seems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter O'Toole gives a marvellous performance as a film director in this film which looks (to an extent) behind the scenes of movie making. I originally saw this one Sunday afternoon at the cinema and I remember how enthralled I was. There were a few surprises when something turned out to be something else like a model maybe. But it wasn't until I got the DVD that I realised there were many layers to the film.The director had great difficulty with the studios in various stages of making the movie and although it was originally intended as an anti-Vietnam film, that had to be changed as production got further away from the war years. So although it may have lost something along the way it gained other things in the process. To my mind this makes it a stronger and more intriguing film.If you watch the documentary that accompanies the DVD a lot is explained which you don't actually realise whilst watching the movie. Watch the film again and you will probably have a renewed interest. You will probably see it a little differently. It's not an Academy Award winner (and I don't think it should have been). But it's a drama, a romance, a comedy and a lot more besides. It has its fans and friends as well as detractors. I liked it and still see it as good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a comedy with some ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a slightly surreal comedy about moviemaking. It's told with the perspective (if not always from the point of view) of a young fugitive who wanders onto the set and gets hired due to various complications. The movie people all seem larger than life to the fugitive, and since he's a little paranoid anyway, their motives seem complex and suspect. Peter O'Toole gives his usual performance, and he's perfect here as the flamboyant director (he must have had a great time sending up some blowhards of his past with this role). Steven Railsback does his usual disoriented guy on the edge, and he does it with a rather touchingly naive quality this time. Barbara Hershey is the leading lady love interest, delivers an intelligent and understated performance, and is appropriately bewitchingly beautiful.Roger Ebert didn't like this movie, but he got confused into thinking that it was something deeper than a comedy. It's about as deep as "Get Shorty", but with a completely different feel. The movie holds up pretty well, although the special effects look a little clunky sometimes, and I remember thinking they were pretty good when I saw the movie in its initial release. But the clunkiness isn't really distracting, and since the movie's attempts to "deceive" are all firmly tongue-in-cheek, it doesn't hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of "The Tempest"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!Though I saw this film--which I highly recommend--projected with its 'Making of?' documentary and enjoyed an in-person Q&amp;A with director Richard Rush (at San Diego's marvelous Museum of Photographic Arts in Balboa Park) a year or so ago, it didn't occur to me till last night that this brilliant entertainment bears striking resemblance to William Shakespeare's last great play, 'The Tempest'. Consider:Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole in a masterly memorable performance) is Prospero, the victimized yet himself rather cruel sorcerer who commands the spirits, fairies and pixies of a remote island, updated as a flamboyant, eccentric, royal-mannered movie director in charge of many cast and crew members, craftspeople, stuntmen, etc. as they shoot a film on and near Coronado Island. Whereas Prospero was embittered by betrayal and losing his Dukedom, Eli is embattled by studio investors who would squelch his artistic vision. Both Prospero and Eli can be tender or sadistic, by turns. Both can seem to appear from nowhere, Prospero using his magic to become invisible at will and Eli popping in and out on his ubiquitous crane chair (director Richard Rush's most fabulous contrivance).Nina Franklin (gorgeous Barbara Hershey in perhaps her best role) is Miranda, Prospero's innocent, wide-eyed daughter, updated as an up-and-coming movie actress who is Eli's protégé and former lover. Like Miranda to Prospero, Nina is torn in her relationship to the mercurial director as he vacillates between the behavior of a loving father and that of a treacherous tyrant.Cameron, the titular stunt man (Steve Railsback, whose performance one can't quite decide is canny underplaying or merely vacuous and weird), is Ferdinand to Nina's Miranda, the handsome mystery man who captivates her imagination, and Caliban to Eli's Prospero, the subhuman slave who is grateful for his master's protection and resentful of his abuse. Like Caliban, Cameron's past is haunted; but we later discover that he's actually much more an innocent like Ferdinand. As Caliban escaped a painful life to arrive at a less painful but more confusing scenario, so does the army deserter Cameron escape the authorities and probable imprisonment only to find himself in Eli's kaleidoscopic clutches.Chuck Barton, the stunt coordinator (Chuck Bail, an actual stunt coordinator), would seem to be Ariel, the foreperson of spirits and Prospero's right hand, updated as the 'go-to guy' who can arrange for Eli's every whim. As Ariel will be set free of service at the end of Prospero's scheme, Chuck will further his career elsewhere when this production wraps.Sam, the screenwriter (Allen Garfield as one of his signature sensitive 'everyman' roles) could, I suppose, be seen as Stephano, the comic-relief character who befriended Caliban in hopes of exploiting him, updated as an insecure fellow who knows his contribution is considered to be bottom-of-the-totem-pole by Hollywood tradition and yearns for greater income and respect. Yet, as a salient observer of human nature, he can be Gonzalo also, the wise and well intentioned but ponderous and powerless adviser.Jake, the smiling studio representative (Alex Rocco in another small part requiring someone with a memorable look to make some impression) is, I think, the castaway King of Naples, a figure of power who is out of his realm and consequently clueless.Just as 'The Tempest' began with an ostensibly ship-wrecking storm called forth by Prospero to deposit the balance of the dramatis personae on his island, 'The Stunt Man' begins with a harrowing wartime conflagration on a rocky shore except that it's really a movie scene created by Eli and observed by Cameron. But, ironically, as Prospero called forth more wind, rain, thunder and lighting later on, Eli mounts a bridge to brashly proclaim that the elements shall not dare to interfere with their day's shooting schedule.Just as Shakespeare's play cluttered the stage with colorful pixies flitting about, Rush's compositions are filled with visual invention, like the gloriously tumbling roof-top stunt sequence, his famous 'rack focus', and Hershey's beauty framed in an ornate glass window (which Rush had installed for that purpose and is still at the Hotel Del Coronado today).Both Shakespeare and Rush are concerned with a preoccupying question: What is real? And, therefore, what can one trust? Miranda is unsure if Ferdinand is a man, Stephano and Trinculo suspect Caliban is a fish, and on this mysterious island, a mystical being may be a tree one moment and quasi-human the next. Eli likes to keep his actors and new stunt man guessing so as to goose their performances (and probably to savor his manipulative power), creating an atmosphere wherein Nina must question her loyalty and Cameron his own sanity.Some may say I'm being deterministic in my analysis, but certain dramatic templates are indeed endlessly recycled and reconfigured. We know that 'Forbidden Planet' is a direct lift of 'The Tempest', but we can see the prototypical eccentric, exiled, visionary in Jules Verne's Captain Nemo and H.G. Wells' Dr. Moreau as well. Television's original 'Dr. Who', as portrayed by William Hartnell (1963-1966), was somewhat Prospero-like himself: brilliant and powerful but self-interested and dismissive (not the bold hero of later incarnations). His time machine was a treasure trove of sci-fi wonders, and he even had a sweet granddaughter in his charge.Interestingly, whereas the harsh and oppressive Prospero restores himself to the nobility, ending Shakespeare's tale 'happily' for an early 17th-century audience devoted to a social hierarchy and the Christian injunction that they subjugate all things of nature (one imagines), most of his 'mad scientist' progeny must meet bad ends. It offends our modern egalitarian sense that such a martinet should achieve rewards while his slave Caliban suffered so. So Dr. Morbius perishes while his slave, Robby the Robot, lands a new gig on the Earth-bound spaceship. In progressive times, the aristocrat may still be offended, but the commonweal is soothed. But where does Eli Cross fit into this spectrum of just/unjust desserts? The darkly comic 'Stunt Man' ends with the movie director--indeed a Duke-like figure of artistic, social and financial reverence in our day--flying high above worldly concerns in a helicopter as his star stunt man--a literal underling in that shot--shouts epithets to the sky. Rush's complex, layered exploration of reality doesn't cop out-and in contrast perhaps Shakespeare's play does. Cameron, like Caliban, survives and may advance. But Eli, unlike Prospero ('this rough magic I here abjure'), will likely carry on creating emotional chaos throughout his sphere of influence. Simply stated, 20th-century reality hadn't fully changed: fairness is still fleeting and s*** continues to roll downhill. The modern twist is that it's harder to know when you're getting screwed.Well, I wished I'd thought of this when I had Rush in front of me. Anyone know how to contact the guy so I can ask him if my take is at all warm?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time Peter O'Toole was Academy Award nominated as Best Actor, for his portrayal of one-step-above-God-himself, Eli Cross in The Stunt Man, my movie going experience was limited to The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm, Mary Poppins, and some post pubescent indulgences into the realm of Flint, Matt Helm, and James Bond.Through the magic of video I was able to see Richard Rush's wonderful black comedy- And have never tired of it.Had Mr. O'Toole and The Stunt Man not run headlong into the likes of Raging Bull, and Robert De Niro, I venture to say it would have garnered WINS, not just NOMINATIONS from the Academy that year.Rent it?and while you're at it reach for `My Favorite Year' and make it a Peter O'Toole double feature.You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will right off admit that this film is not my type of thing. I watched it because I'm a huge fan of Peter O'Toole's. I found it difficult to follow and disjointed despite some really fascinating scenes and some very good acting.Steve Railsback plays a Vietnam vet named Cameron who escapes the police after he is caught for attempted murder. He crosses a bridge and dodges away from an old car that is out of control. The car disappears. Later on, he encounters a film about World War I being shot on the beach. The director is Eli Cross (O'Toole) who offers Cameron a job as a stunt man. It turns out that the stunt man was in the old car and drove the car off of the bridge as part of a scene being filmed, and drowned. The police are sniffing around, so O'Toole introduces Cameron as Burt, the missing stunt man, and the rest of the cast and crew play along.Cameron learns a lot about stunts (as do we) and he falls for the film's leading lady (Barbara Hershey) who at one time was involved with Eli. Cameron over time becomes increasingly paranoid and believes that the manipulative, kind of crazy Eli wants to kill him.O'Toole, Railsback, and Hershey are all excellent -- we first see Hershey in an old lady mask and clothing. Throughout the film, she is beautiful, silly, and flighty as Nina Franklin, and intense and committed as the character Nina plays. O'Toole is madcap, and doesn't seem to care what happens to anyone as long as he gets the shot he wants, and one can see how Cameron would be unclear about his motives.The print I saw didn't look particularly good - I wonder about the budget for this film. I think a good deal of the budget went to O'Toole and some of those amazing stunts, as the film has a lot of TV actors in it -- all good, but TV actors nevertheless: Alex Rocco, Sharon Farrell, Allen Garfield.This film is a little hard to follow, but it's a good one about the value of perception and how it can change from person to person. Also, the ending is very satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart Dialog And Compelling Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Eli Cross (played by Peter O'Toole) invites Cameron (Played by Steve Railsback) to, "...Step into my looking glass, Alice" I knew that this motion picture was no ordinary movie. Like in so many anti-war films of the 1970's and 1980's, we find a Vietnam Vet struggling to cope with the diametrically opposed realities between peace and war. Only in this film the hero is thrown into the shell shocked fantasy world of a Hollywood Movie Production. "The Stunt Man" offers a look into a world where different hells collide in a Dantean journey of realization and reconciliation.Though the narrative does seems to suffer occasionally, smart dialog and captivating performances by O'Toole and Railsback outshine most of the films obvious flaws.Following in the trail of "Hooper" (a 1978 cheesy Burt Reynolds action film about an aging stunt man) may have hurt "The Stunt Man" more than its inconsistent editing, even before it was ever released. Audiences didn't want another car/beer movie. However, The early 1980's saw the dawn of the Home VCR and "The Stunt Man" became the first film to outgross in video rentals and sales over its theatrical release.This film is a MUST SEE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film cannot be isolated in one genre, which makes it a modern classic by definition. It also made most film executives not want to distribute it. It has always been my feeling that if you are working with an original idea, you are not highly thought of by Hollywood standards. I tend to scoff at big-budget Hollywood productions, tending to lean towards the "sleeper" films with individual stellar performances, and this film has quite a few. Steve Railsback is in every scene in the film, but his presence as the central character is not the only plot point. Peter O'Toole and Barbara Hershey are equally effective in their roles, but director-screenwriter Richard Rush is the driving force behind this movie, and the entire production was dedicated to Rush and his vision. This is one of a few films which I can say is a visual joyride from beginning to end, and Rush's need to get his "product" out to as many viewers as possible shows his love for the story. Many things are happening in "The Stunt Man". Yes, it is a film about the making of a film, but it is also a comedy, war drama, love story, action-adventure, and yes, even audience participation. If you haven't seen it yet, rent it or buy it, take a nice two-and-a-half-hour break and enjoy!!! And, if you can still find the deluxe two-DVD set with "The Sinister Saga Of The Making Of The Stunt Man" take an additional two hours and enjoy this fascinating behind-the-scenes story which has as many plot turns as the film itself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: Script, humor, acting, directing, score.Cons: Cinematography.The Stunt Man is a cult classic that for the most part has been generally ignored or unheared by the public. It deals with illusions vs reality in the movie business. Steve Railsback plays a vietnam veteran who is on the run from the police. In other to escape them, he becomes a stuntman under a maniacal director, played by Peter O' Toole. Barbara Hershey is the star of the war epic Toole is making and Railsback falls in love with her. Illusions are aplenty in this film. For example, we think Railsback commits a heinous crime only to find out that he really didn't commit anything. Also Peter O' Toole isn't as manical as he seems. The Stuntman is a character study on Railsback and the effects the war had on him. This is one of the top ten movies of the eighties and gets better with repeated viewing.Premise: A vietnam veteran becomes a stuntman to escape the police.The Stunt man was nominated for three Academy awardsGrade: 10/10 (Cult classic)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Tall Is King Kong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original King Kong was 3'6" and the central gimmick of The Stunt Man is blurring the distinction between reality and the illusion created by film. Steve Railsback (the main character) is on the run for a silly crime and finds his way to a beach resort. As he enters the resort a song begins playing on the soundtrack: 'Out of nowhere, out of darkness into light?and you watch and wonder where you belong, and the crowd it moves and takes you along?.you ask yourself what good are your dreams, in a world where nothing is as it seems'. The song sums up the title character's situation and its melody will replay several times later in the film. He joins a crowd watching the film production of a WWI battle sequence. The crowd politely applauds at the end of each take. Then during a new scene there are huge explosions and smoke obscures much of where the action is being staged. The onlookers (and we viewers) look on with horror as the smoke clears and reveals a beach saturated with blood and dismembered bodies. The onlookers scream, the director yells cut, and the stunt men pull themselves out of the sand unhurt. The crowd goes wild with applause, far more appreciative about being fooled by the 'fabricated reality' than they were by their glimpse behind the scenes of the movie-making action. And this is the structure with The Stunt Man, viewers (like those in the crowd) are supposed to be kept off balance by this movie within a movie.Yet this is merely a device to advance the storyline, which involves a complex theme about paranoia and trust. Railsback likens his relationship with the movie company's director-Peter O'Toole, and by analogy everyone's situation at some point of their life, to an incident he witnessed in Viet Nam. Someone stepped on a 'Bouncing Betty Mine', an anti-personnel device that while triggered by a person's weight, does not actually detonate until the person steps off the device. At this point there is no choice but to remain standing on the mine, trusting that something will happen to favorably change the situation. Just as in life there are times in the 'free will vs destiny' interplay when there is nothing you can do but place your trust a higher authority. Like 'The Ninth Configuration' (a film made about the same time and highly recommended for those interested in this theme); an authority figure works to redeem someone in his care by teaching them to trust someone or something, even when everything screams for them to step off the mine. While The Stunt Man is an excellent movie, which tells a valuable story in an interesting multi-layered fashion; it is not really the masterpiece that Director Richard Rush and its biggest fans claim. A lot of effort was made to portray Eli Cross (the O'Toole character) as an omniscient 'Godlike' figure and a genius filmmaker; a necessary characterization if the film's theme is to be sold to the viewing audience. Unfortunately these efforts are largely undermined by the moronic nature of the film within the film. The artistic picture this eccentric genius is making is not even on the intellectual level of Laurel and Hardy's 'Flying Deuces', and it has about the same level of slapstick with none of the humor. So there is a major credibility disconnect. You have to sympathize with Wells as he had huge obstacles to overcome getting this film into production and he simply did not have the resources to stage a credible action-adventure tale. But a better approach would have been to stage small things well rather than grand things cheaply; so the painfully on-the-cheap production design is ultimately his fault. A director bent on misdirection has a huge arsenal for manufacturing illusion; look at the widely different techniques successfully employed in 'Pulp Fiction', 'The Sixth Sense', and 'State &amp; Main' for viewer misdirection. It is easy because the viewer only knows what the director chooses to reveal, yet the director must be careful that the viewer does not feel cheated. As Roger Ebbert said, some of the stunts are staged so that they're not only deceiving to Railsback (as intended), but plainly impossible. And the stunts are sneaky, at one point Railsback is on a tower that's blown up in flames. There is no plausible way he could have escaped alive-but the movie merely cuts to another shot of him, without explaining his escape. A film that depends on deceiving us has got to play by its own rules. Deceiving the audience is the magic of movies, but they can't be cheated on particulars. Overall the degree of misdirection was rather spartan and not particularly clever (that darn low budget) , meaning that they did not begin to create the degree of suspense that was necessary.That said there were some interesting little details to look for when watching this film: A tight two-shot of Railsback and O'Toole on the beach, they step onto a platform which turns out to be attached to an unseen crane and are lifted into the air, the actors do not betray that this is happening-their conversation continues as the background changes. O'Toole compares Railsback to Alice about to enter Wonderland, he asks him to close his eyes and then the scene cuts to a hairdresser telling Railsback to open his eyes and see his physical transformation. Watch for the many deep focal transitions (particularly at the dinner scene) and the literal framing (like a painting with a frame)of many shots-which is used to promote the everything is a fabricated illusion message. Watch for the piglets spilling out of the baby carriage during one of the battle scenes-another Alice element. Watch for the very inventive shot of Railsback looking into the rolled down car window, shot through the rolled up window on the other side, with Barbara Hershey's face reflected in the frame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underappreciated, probably easily misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a most fascinating piece of work that has not critically dimmed with age. I'd like to join the other reviewers here in lauding Peter O'Toole in particular for one of the finest performances of his distinguished career. Although I don't disagree with DeNiro winning best actor that year, it doesn't dim the quality of O'Toole's portrayal of Eli Cross. As to the famously convoluted Chinese puzzle of a plot that enraptures some and seems to bore others to tears: I would suggest watching this more than once. Like "Chinatown", this is such a multidimensional experience that one viewing will likely not do justice (it certainly didn't for me....the first time I saw it I came away convinced that the film had no point to make....boy, was I wrong). Whatever you think the characters' motivations may be, the opposite could also be true....right up until the end. One of the best analyses of the artifice (and artificial power) of filmmaking ever committed to celluloid. If that sounds like a contradiction in terms, welcome to this movie's twisted little world.Although I've seen nothing else by director Rush that I could even remotely call a good film, this one was quite obviously his labor of love. He worked on this film for nearly ten years and had to wait until two years after its completion (in 1978) to see it released. Do him a favor and show that the effort was (and is) appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Crane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.There are quite a few movies like this, films that reference films and that also aver that the drama within can bend the reality without. The kernel of this idea was `Citizen Kane' but it seemed to flower after John Fowles published `The Magus' and the Beatles followed his lead.This one has O'Toole who had done something similar in `Lion in Winter.' It uses the third dimension better than anything of the time. It is steeped in paranoia and antiVietnam sentiments. This last dates it, oddly; American culture and imagination seems to have flopped the other way. The closest we come to filmed paranoia these days is `Requiem for a Dream' and `Trainspotting,' both of which set a distance between us and them who are cursed.For these kinds of films to work, the film within needs to overlap with the film without, and ideally the additional layer of reality. `The French Lieutenant's Woman' is the gold standard in this respect. You also need actors who can shift realities and often play simultaneous levels. These actors actually play it straight, even the energetic O'Toole who was layered in `Lion,' as mentioned and later in `Favorite Year.'What we end up with here is a collection of intelligent ideas wrangled by less people less intelligent. Only twice does this thing thrill:-when the stunt man unexpectedly falls through the skylight into the whorehouse. That scene is not only great, it is doubly great because it is pivotal for the film within.-Hersey's much-celebrated scene when the scenery turns and she moves from the film (as an old lady) into the film within. This one scene must be the peak of her professional life, and possibly makes it all worthwhile.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You want to see Peter O'Toole channeling David Lean as the megalomaniac director trying to make a WWI epic against all odds who will stop at nothing to "get the shot"? He goes berserk at his AD ("no one yells cut at my set!"), he often descends from the top of the frame in his crane like a deus ex machina, he insists that his cameraman keep shooting even though his stunt man is drowning. His WWI film is a long string of big action pieces woven together with slapstick shenanigans, people dancing Charleston on the wings of planes and gatecrashing German bordellos.No, scratch that. You want to see Steve Railsback with a Charles Mansonesque gleam in his eye playing the 'Nam veteran who finds himself chased by the police into the set of said WWI movie where he is turned in the spur of the moment into the stunt man who he accidentally helped kill a few minutes earlier? No one knows what he's guilty of but O'Toole takes him under his wing because he carries that same madness he's looking for in his movie, 600 bucks at a time.No? How about a million movies rolled into one, a chaotic, rampant, insane smorsgabord that is at once a comedy about the trappings of big budget film-making, a romance between a famous actress and a halfmad Vietnam veteran, a drama about an emotionally scarred man with no future that finds himself betrayed again and can do nothing but laugh crazily about it and yell after a helicopter for his thousand bucks? All this filled with cinematic references (King Kong, Wings) and constant games with the viewer's perception of what is real and what is fiction, the lines separating real world from film-making wizardry becoming dangerously blurred.Well, if you answered yes to one of the above, there's only one movie for you, Richard Rush's THE STUNT MAN. Nine years in the making, this is for all intents and purposes his APOCALYPSE NOW, the sprawling film that signalled the pinacle and decline of its director's career. The logistics of the production must've been a nightmare yet perfectly reflect the chaotic nature of the film. This is the kind of movie that deserves praise for just getting made. It's one of the only films I can think of that can afford soaring melodrama, political critique, black comedy and plain absurdism in the same scene and magically pull it off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of my favorite films of its time. I can't understand why this film is not more highly rated by just about anyone -- the critics or the public. It's not really a cult film so much as a seemingly chaotic black comedy. One is never quite sure if Eli Cross is totally insane, or has taken measures to prevent the killing of his on-the-lam stunt man. The case is definitely made that Cross is desperate, and resorting to desperate measures. The "killer crane" is a wonderful device, since it helps in the overall feel of vertigo that Rush is looking for.There's obviously the motif of trying to tell reality from false perceptions, and what better way than to have cinema as the setting? We share Cameron's bewilderment at what is happening to him, and there is non-stop tension in every scene -- you just don't know what lunacy may arise at any time. Can he trust anyone? The special edition of the DVD has interviews that really do enlighten. The difficulty in Rush having this film realized is a gripping story in itself -- obviously Rush was as obsessive as his antagonist Cross! I confess to falling for Barbara Hershey -- it's not so much her performance than how Rush photographs her -- she seems to represent not just the Most Desirable Woman but also Comfort. (Or is she just acting? Has Cross put her up to this? What are her true feelings?) And Cameron needs a lot of comfort. They filmed this in San Diego at the Hotel Coronado, but I can't seem to remember reading anything about it at the time! (I was certainly living here at the time.) Of course, Some Like It Hot was also filmed at the Coronado.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most successful example of metafiction in a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Metafiction is something extremely difficult to pull off, which only makes "The Stunt Man" all the more impressive. Its an extremely ambitious film that manages to pull off its many goals without ever coming across as being pretentious. The film successfully blurs the lines between reality and fiction, up to the point where you can't tell which one is which. The conclusion is, upon reflection, ambiguous. All this combines to create a film thats endlessly clever and multi-layered. The fact the main character is just as confused about his surroundings as we are was a stroke of genius needed to make this material accessible. The occasionally sappy love story and clichéd dialog actually work in the films favor, even further making the audience question the difference between real and reel life.There are several parties responsible for the films genius. Most of all is Richard Rush. Judging from this, he could've been a major Hollywood player. However, despite critical acclaim and even several Oscar nominations, the film was barely released and flopped badly. A labor of love for Rush, this seems to have discouraged him. His subsequent feature was the much maligned "Color of Night". His direction for "The Stunt Man" is absolutely brilliant. He takes this complex material, and manages to make it entertaining and quickly paced. Hes equally skilled at staging comedic and dramatic sequences.The acting is another major component to the films success. Steve Railsback is effective and surprisingly sympathetic as the confused and paranoid protagonist. Barbara Hershey never looked more beautiful and essays in another oddly likable character. The supporting cast (Alex Rocco, Allen Garfield, biker movie legend Adam Roarke) also works very well. However, the most memorable characterization here is Peter O'Toole. He gives an absolutely sublime performance as the prissy director of the film within the film (similarities between his character and David Lean may have been intentional). "The Stunt Man" is a rare film that works on many levels and is a must-see for anyone interested in film. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stunt Man finds Steve Railsback on the run from some police and stumbling into a movie set where Director Peter O'Toole is filming a World War I epic. A stunt involving the suicide of the leading man in an old Deusenberg goes awry with the stunt man actually getting killed in the process. Never fear, O'Toole hires young Railsback as the new stunt double. I mean it's either that or the law. Afterwards Railsback ain't so sure.Especially after he woos and beds leading lady Barbara Hershey. Is O'Toole setting him up. He's certainly megalomaniacal enough to think along those lines.He's also enough of a megalomaniac to let nothing including physical safety of anyone on his set interfere in the film he's trying to create. O'Toole in his Oscar nominated performance borrowed from any number of film directors, past and present, some of whom he must have worked for to create a very fascinating portrait.Railsback and Hershey are good too and I also liked Alex Rocco as the sheriff and Allen Garfield as O'Toole's best friend and screenwriter for this epic.The Stunt Man is a real tour de force for Peter O'Toole, a film none of his fans should miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Odd and a little eccentric are the first things that come to mind regarding the film. Then come the words "me want Barbara Hershey".The film is perhaps a bit too long, but remains interesting throughout. The only drawback is the mumbling by all the cast members; either everyone was instructed to mumble - for whatever bizarre reason - or they placed the microphones five kilometers away from the actors.The film has a very original premise.The funniest scene is when Hershey (easy to mistake for a "Hershey" bar on account of her just begging to be eaten) lectures Railsback about how sweet and nice and what-not O'Toole is, right after which O'Toole tells her to leave the screening room (for being a disturbance), the way a teacher would to a misbehaving pupil. Another clever comedic moment is when Hershey's parents and her little sister were shown rushes from her upcoming film and by mistake showed a "nude" bed scene with Hershey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great in many ways, but especially the performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater (or rented it in the very early eighties - I honestly can't remember which), but then didn't see it again until quite recently, when I bought the double DVD with the "Sinister Saga Of..." movie and the commentary. I watched the movie at least three times in the first weekend I got it. Obviously, I consider it a terrific film - one of the rare times when I disagree entirely with Ebert.O'Toole is magnificent, as he was a couple of years later in My Favorite Year. The roles both call for a person who absolutely is Larger Than Life, who dominates the screen every moment he's on it. O'Toole personifies that quality. (I've often thought that's why The Lion in Winter could work - Hepburn was the same kind of woman, especially as she got older, and they were the only two who COULD have stood up to one another on screen, although at that time there were still a few people around who could have managed: Richard Burton comes to mind - when he was on, he was ON).Some of the comments have stated that they thought Railsback was just muddling through. According to O'Toole's comments, the two of them would spend hours after filming each day was over sitting around talking about the roles and interpretations and acting in general - whether you liked Railsback's performance or not (I did), it had to have been VERY deliberate. That Helter-Skelter had come out before The Stunt Man was a lucky coincidence, since The Stunt Man was filmed first, but it was great in convincing you subconsciously that this guy might be a serious wacko from the start. But there were little throw-aways Rush stuck in that helped you in that way, like a little overheard remark the pretty and slutty hairdresser makes about "that guy who killed all those campers" as she's getting out of the car after dinner. These all combine to make the denouement when Cameron's crime is finally revealed especially exciting (and hysterically funny).Hershey is remarkable. In one scene, they are filming the film within the film and she is made up and dressed like an old woman at the grave of her long dead lover. You KNOW she is really a young and beautiful actress (not an old woman), you KNOW that this is a fictional script within a fictional script, the scene lasts all of three minutes, and her performance never fails to bring me to tears. Interestingly, what immediately follows the prop-man knocking over a light and her bursting into tears was not scripted at all. Rush, in a rather Eli Cross-like move, told O'Toole to wait until Hershey really got the scene right (that kind of emotional work-up apparently can take several takes to really hit the spot), at which point he (Rush) would signal O'Toole to go out and speak to Hershey. O'Toole, being the experienced actor he was, didn't need the signal; he just walked over to her and hugged her, whispering "You were brilliant" in her ear, at which point HERSHEY, not the character, burst into tears and jumped into a full body hug on O'Toole (legs around the body, I mean). The whisper was later over-voiced by O'Toole for the movie as "Thank you, my baby." which was more appropriate for the director (I'd never really thought about it, but doing that kind of scene well has GOT to really take it out of you!). A brilliant idea on Rush's part, superbly executed by O'Toole. But Hershey, whose character was loosely called by the cast "The Dream Girl" (obviously from Cameron's viewpoint), gave an excellent performance all the way around of a complex woman, neither totally good nor totally bad. She's egotistical, self-centered, a bit spoiled, but not to the point of losing her humanity or general niceness. And she's SO damned beautiful! I hate movies where you have no idea what's going on, or where there are simply no characters you can stand. I am not an intellectual film buff who infinitely prefers Indies and Foreign films to mainstream American stuff. But I LOVED this movie. You know that you're not sure exactly what's real at any given moment, but that's fine, because eventually you FIND OUT. You're not left at the end of the movie going "huh?" And in the meantime, there's a real, honest-to-God plot happening that you CAN follow, and a lot of humor and wit to enjoy.This is and I expect will remain on my top ten movie list for life. Part of that is a major love of Peter O'Toole, but most of it is that the movie itself is just plain great, if you don't mind being jerked around when you know you're being jerked around (this seemed to be Ebert's major gripe - once it became obvious early on that the movie was going to be jerking you around, he no longer gave a darn). It was very clever, and I LIKE clever movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My step father (in Russia at the time) reviewed this movie when it was fairly new, and said the it was an absolute masterpiece. After watching it I cannot help but agree. The charm of this film lies in its incredible depth; you MUST watch it more than once to really get the gist. A previous reviewer pointed out that it was shallow. The first time I watched it I took it for nothing more than a movie about brilliant director and crazy war kid who is in a tough psychological situation (which stands on its own pretty well, to be honest). But when I watched it again I realized it had more depth; the random elements of which I had though "hum, that doesn't fit in" began to fit into the story. When I watched it a third time I really realized the complexity and attention to detail present in this movie. It really is a truly magnificent film. On of the winning factor of this movie is that while it deals with very intelligent and complex issues, it is exciting and action-filled. It follows the plot-line of a mainstream action picture, with the sex and violence (and lets be honest, sex and violence are awesome). But it also possesses delicate beauty and philosophy that rivals that of top "artsy" movies (and I have seen a great deal many). The chemistry results in an incredible product. The performances are some of the best I've ever seen. Expressions of rage, shame, indignation, and such are incredibly powerful. O'toole is brilliant (duh), and on a final note, the film has some of the best quotes ever.Watch it. Three times. And the commentary helps too. For the good of you and your matrix-fed children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this for the first time this week on DVD in the new remastered Anchor Bay 2-disc set and was totally blown away by this acclaimed movie, set in the context of a WWI adventure.It is an extraordinary movie which has something to say about the nature of insanity and the resultant psychology that even the most reasonable people have in spades.Steve Ralisback plays a criminal who is on the run from the law and happens to be responsible for the death of a driver when he runs onto a bridge near where a movie is being shot. The accident is recorded by the director (Peter O'Toole in sensational form).In a bid to cover himself, O'Toole takes Ralisback on board as a stuntman,with no experience whatsoever, and finds himself in the midst of increasingly dangerous stunts. The lead actress in the film, Mina (Barbara Hershey), takes to him as well. However, his past is starting to catch up with him......Thought-provoking, disturbingly plausible with a genuine sense of dimension in it's characterisation, THE STUNT MAN is a brilliant look into the the nature of illusion.</fullReview>

The themes and message come across clearly, but although "The Stunt Man" makes some good points on several levels, it also drags a lot. Now I hate to criticize a Peter O'Toole movie, but? he's the only bright spot here and the reason to keep watching.The opening scene and some other sequences (especially the stunts and the scenes between Nina and "Lucky") are overlong to the point that you just don't give a damn anymore. The extras are painfully bad in the "carnage" scene on the beach? maybe it's not important, but I couldn't help notice. The script writer (that Sam character if I'm not mistaking) is incredibly tiresome and useless- what he says is supposed to be funny and revealing, but it's not. The whole thing is meant to be funny, but I didn't find anything amusing. Hershey's makeup as an old woman is terrible. The stunt man's stupidity is annoying and his lines sound dumb, but I guess that was the point. The contempt for the audience becomes obvious in the "graveyard scene" (what the hell was that?! was it supposed to be funny or ingenious?).Now, for the good parts? The editing is good. The soundtrack is catchy. Good points on the movie industry are made, even if dialogues could have been infinitely better. But above all, this is Peter O'Toole's show. The 'late 70's style' haircuts and clothes are awful, but he's stunning despite the big hair, jewelry, turtle-necks and other fashion atrocities of the era (men's pinkie rings come to mind). I have mixed feelings about this movie, but O'Toole saves the day. He dominates the space, even if he's not given enough screen time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE STUNT MAN is an excellent example of how to adapt a novel filled with interior monologue to the screen while preserving what is important about the novel. Unfortunately--and this is not the film's fault, or the director/scriptwriter's fault, or the actors' fault--the film was so far outside the Hollywood norm that it nearly sank without a trace.* This film is theme-driven, not character-driven or plot-driven. That means that one must watch it with one's brain fully engaged; it's not a light "entertainment" like a Grisham novel, but a meatier piece like a Graham Greene novel. This is so far outside the Hollywood experience--that is, that some people are entertained by being challenged--that there's little wonder that the studio consolidation of the 1970s nearly extinguished the film.* This film is also one of those extremely rare instances in which the sheer writing is substantially superior to the literary work from which it was adapted. Brodeur was a beginning writer at the time, and it shows. Richard Rush may have had a background in "exploitation" films, but somehow or another he worked a sense of Kafka into THE STUNT MAN without being pretentious about it... in a way that the novel never achieves.If THE STUNT MAN was to be released today, one would expect it to be from one of the "boutique imprints"; Fox Searchlight, not Fox, or Sony Classics, not TriStar. One would also expect that it had been done on a relatively small budget, with the actors taking pay cuts to participate.</fullReview>

It is a fun look into the world of movie-making and an interesting character study into whether the director, Peter O'Toole, is actually trying to kill his newest stuntman, knowing that Cameron is running from the police. The rest of the stunt team are very believable as is Barbara Hersey whose brief appearance as the old woman is delightful.Railsback isn't a total failure in the film but either he didn't have the ability to handle the emotional dynamics required or the writer/director, Richard Rush, just isn't able to get it out of him on camera.What I like most about the film is the parallel between the antics of the film crew and the fictional inmates of the asylum in the movie within the movie. The cinematography is very good for the most part, especially the rooftop scenes and afterward when Cameron falls through it into the asylum. The excitement shifts focus from being directed toward a soldier running to escape the murderous machine gun fire to a fake stuntman running from the police. In that sense the film reminds me of Antonioni's 1966 film, "Blow Up" because of the detachment of most of the characters from the reality of the situation and their acceptance of the underlying surrealism.I watch this one whenever I can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Peter O'Toole is great. But if Richard Rush directed the movie of his career, then Steven Railsback (fresh off starring as Manson in Helter Skelter) was an ingenious touch of casting by the casting director. Railsback is superb as the paranoid fugitive whose bravado fools only himself. He plays it perfectly straight and there is no hint that the actor is in on what is really going on anymore than his character does. O'Toole, is given a plum role, and delivers with gusto. Allen Goorwitz (aka Garfield) puts in a solid supporting turn as the writer who tries to help the young stunt man sort things out.But, Railsback's handling of his demons and his anger in the midst of a true theater of the absurd is what makes this movie such a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies on making movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love movies, you will love "The Stunt Man". It stands in line with the best movies on film making: Vincente Minnelli´s "The Bad and the Beautiful" (1952), Jean-Luc Godards "Le Mepris" (1963) or Francois Truffauts "Le nuit americaine" (1973). It discloses the wonders of direction and camera and manages to maintain them the same moment. Wonderful performances (especially by Peter O´Toole as the mad genius director), an air of high risk and adventure and a great score by Dominic Frontiere add to Richard Rush´s magnificent direction. It´s a shame that he has never lived up to this film before ("Hell´s Angels on Wheels") and surely not after ("Color of Night").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less interesting twenty years on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) The movie ends in manic laughter and a fight about the fee for the last stunt (O'Toole's side of which is yelled from a feverishly whirling helicopter); an image that - summing the whole thing up - evokes the chaos and conflict of real war, transposed into a setting of much more trivial battles and easy myth-making potential. The movie is a rather flatly functional rendering of an intriguing concept, with O'Toole less entertaining than memory suggested as a dictatorial but essentially benevolent colonial tyrant whose excesses must somehow be assimilated by the Vietnam vet for his ultimate healing. The movie plays with the audience, blurring the process of movie-making into an unbroken cavalcade of derring-do; the relationships are just as broad and cartoonish; it doesn't have much texture (partly because of Railsback's rather empty work) until the late stages, where the underlying theme comes to prominence and events incline in a cathartic direction. But even then it lacks definition, being open to charges of exploiting the Vietnam theme for easy gravity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lights, Camera, FRANTIC! A truly dizzying movie-buff experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lights, camera, FRANTIC! I saw this for the first time in a theater in 1981, so it was certainly time for a re-visit: A fugitive (and Vietnam vet, á la the 1980's formula character trait picks) from the law, stumbles upon a movie shoot and inadvertently kills its stunt man. The ruthlessly manic director agrees to shield him from the police - ONLY if he agrees to step in as the stunt man's replacement to finish the film! For any movie buff, this set-up is enough to make you drool and rub your hands together in delight.An absolute one-of-a-kind mix of sarcastic satire, dizzying action plus one of the best movie-within-a-movie gimmicks ever: An overblown WW1 war/romance epic! Top production of course, energetically unpredictable story twists and a lively soundtrack that is SO unforgettable, that I could hum its two main themes in my head even before I put the disc in... almost 30 years later! Also formidably cast, with an indelible performance of a lifetime from O'Toole. The downside though, when there is so much brain in a film like this, is the lack of heart (and subtlety) among the cold-blooded and hard-skinned cynicism, as I really don't feel much for its characters - memorable as they may be - afterward. 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant and mesmerizing cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Troubled and paranoid fugitive Vietnam veteran Cameron (a fine and intense performance by Steve Railsback) seeks refuge on the set of a lavish World War I picture that's being directed by cruel and crazed, yet cunning and charismatic megalomaniac director Eli Cross (superbly played with lip-smacking pompous aplomb by Peter O'Toole). Cross makes Cameron replace a previous stuntman who drowned when a car gag went awry due to Cameron's interference. Cameron soon suspects that Eli may be trying to kill him so he can capture his death on celluloid for the sake of realism. Director Richard Rush, who also co-wrote the ingenious script with Lawrence B. Marcus, offers a fresh, inspired and arresting mix of comedy, drama, action, thriller, and romance while also delivering a rich and provocative existential meditation on illusion versus reality and a fascinating glimpse at all the chaos, tension, madness and arduous labor that goes into making a movie. The exciting and elaborate stunt set pieces are simply amazing. Mario Tosi's gleaming, polished cinematography and Dominic Frontiere's jaunty, rousing score are likewise excellent and impressive. This film further benefits from first-rate acting by the uniformly stellar cast: Railsback and O'Toole are both fabulous in their juicy lead parts; they receive bang-up support from Barbara Hershey as radiant, ravishing actress Nina Franklin, Allen Garfield as harried, neurotic screenwriter Sam, Adam Roarke as humble actor Raymond Bailey, Sharon Farrell as sweet, sassy make-up girl Denise, Chuck Bail as amiable stunt coordinator Chuck Barton, Philip Bruns as smarmy producer Ace, and Alex Rocco as huffy police chief Jake. Dusty Springfield sings the lovely theme song "Bits &amp; Pieces." A marvelously offbeat and original one-of-a-kind knockout that's wholly deserving of its cult status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter O'Toole Plays God (or at Least a Film Director)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't decide whether this or Samuel Fuller's "The Big Red One" is my favorite movie of 1980."The Stunt Man" is loopy, bizarre, intensely watchable and just as unforgettable. It's the kind of movie I want to tell everyone about, yet at the same time I'm glad it's relatively unknown so that I can have the pleasure of keeping it to myself.Steve Railsback plays an escaped convict who winds up hiding out as a stunt man on a movie set. But his grip on reality begins to slide as he becomes more and more convinced that the dictatorial film director (played uproariously by Peter O'Toole) is trying to have him killed. O'Toole adds yet another to his long line of eccentric and brilliant screen performances. He plays the director, Eli Cross, as a megaphone wielding God, sending down orders from on high as he zooms around in his airborne director's chair. The film is full of self-reflexive musings on the role cinema plays in shaping our perceptions of reality, but it's never done so in an overtly intellectual film-school kind of way. The movie is amazingly entertaining, and happens to be one of the best movies about the making of movies ever put on screen.Barbara Hershey does marvelous work as the film-within-the-film's leading lady and love interest to Railsback. A moment of intimacy between the two that takes places in a pile of spilled paint cans counts as one of the movie's most hilarious highlights.The movie's overall impact would be greatly lessened without the rollicking, playful score by Dominic Frontiere, one of my favorite film scores of all time.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like all great films, The Stunt Man is hard to classify: comedy, action film, mystery, satire, meditation on reality. Well worth watching and re-watching. (Suitable for older kids, despite infrequent strong language and brief partial nudity.) Look for a visual version of the metaphor "smoke and mirrors" at the opening. Do NOT look for views behind the scenes of actual film-making: they are purposely distorted to serve the needs of the film. Ironically, the film misses true masterpiece status only because, despite the director's fierce protection of it's uncut length, it's too long -- not the action sequences but the romantic, rhetorical, and other poky, talky scenes. Rush should indeed have reduced the film to 120 minutes, by making many cuts, 5 to 30 seconds at a time.</fullReview>

The chase out of the screen door with the camera chasing Steve Railsback and ran for several minutes. Really starts the pace of the film. When the helicopter finds him on the bridge you really feel that the police have caught him. The film keeps you guessing as to what it happening, what is the truth and what is the illusion of the film making process. The beach scene shows how real the illusion seems to the fugitive character. I really enjoyed the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to read such negative comments here on this movie, but there is no accounting for taste. Several find fault with the "cinematography" without going any further to explain what they mean by that. It was well-reviewed when it came out, and several of the External Reviews linked in here that I read were equally complimentary on this very aspect. This movie is both a glimpse of reality and fantasy, and it picks and chooses from both columns of that Chinese menu. It deals with manipulation, illusion, and chaos and is, in turns, manipulative, misleading, and chaotic. It has great energy which is owed to peak performances from the three principals and a story that is both intricately involved (a fugitive, impersonating a stunt man, who stands in for an actor...) and charmingly simple (leading lady falls for mysterious stranger). The interpersonal dynamics are dealt with in very realistic fits and start, and the action is peppered in perfectly to keep the frantic, kinetic momentum hurtling forward. The main character must cope with situations where he is off balance (figuratively and literally), misinformed, and not in control, and this makes me sympathize with him. We are all writing, acting, and directing ourselves in life, and a film on film-making is commentary on this. Overall, the movie is good fun that doesn't insult the intellect and is full of little artistic touches and tricks. The poster art does, after all, feature a devil at the camera, not an angel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Stunt Man" begins with an image of a vulture, which very soon after flies head-on into a helicopter, giving everyone on board the craft a momentary shock."That bird just tried to kill us!" cries the helicopter pilot."That's your point of view," says a man in the back, biting an apple. "Shall we stop and ask the bird what his was?""The Stunt Man" is a film about perspective, especially as we see director Eli Cross, the man with the apple, through the eyes of Cameron, a fugitive Vietnam veteran. Cross takes Cameron onto his latest film production after a mishap creates an opening for a new stunt man.Told he has much to learn, Cameron defensively tells his stunt coach, Chuck, "I made it through Vietnam in one piece. That's a helluva stunt!" But has Cameron jumped out of the pot and into the fire? He begins to think Cross is setting him up for the ultimate stunt by killing him in front of the camera. By turns flip and obsessive, Cross seems sinister even as he beguiles Cameron to step into his world. Even his very name seems to speak to this duality, suggesting both a double cross and a metaphor for a loving deity.I came to this movie by way of an excellent book by Danny Peary, "Cult Movies 3," which championed "The Stunt Man" as a metaphysical metaphor and told the fascinating tale of how director Richard Rush struggled to get it released. Then I saw it for myself, and very quickly realized this was a classic. You have incredible camera work, hilarious dialogue, a dazzling central location at the historic Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, a wonderful sense of mise-en-scene from an assortment of colorful characters played by gifted actors, and especially a rich portrayal of Cross by Peter O'Toole.O'Toole seems so alive, you almost feel him breathing down your neck as he dips down from the heavens on his crane to offer another piece of whimsical advice. He's intense, yet even when he screams at one of his crew for yelling "cut" on his film, revealing some of the monster Cameron suspects lurks under his smooth surface, you, like Cameron, are unable to take your eyes off the SOB.Over the years, I've watched it a few more times and come to realize Steve Railsback as Cameron gives a performance every bit O'Toole's equal. Cameron is someone we don't know a lot about, either, other than he's in trouble and needs help. The crime he's being chased for is a mystery, though he throws up dark hints of war atrocities that might be true or else just Cameron's skewed sense of humor, projecting what he thinks others think of him, the grunt from 'Nam.Railsback was best known before "The Stunt Man" for playing Charles Manson, and there are times you wonder whether Cameron is a similar character. Railsback plays him as an idealist, badly bruised, with eyes that smolder with a glint of insanity every now and then. He's likable most of the time, enough for us to root for him when he falls in love with a third mysterious character, a lovely actress on the set named Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey). But we are always on guard."The Stunt Man" keeps us on guard throughout, playing with our perspective by showing us seemingly straightforward scenes that turn out to be illusions or subjective visions. The film delivers several elaborate stunts, performed by Cameron on the set of Cross's World War I picture. Some like Peary complain, validly, that the stunts come off as too cartoony, not realistic as they seem to be filmed as one-take deals, and Cameron doesn't seem to know what he's doing even as he goes through his paces with apparent aplomb.But director Rush is playing with us here, delivering a subtle surreal layer to the film that keeps it (and us) off-center while simultaneously commenting on both the nature of the movies as illusion dispenser and of man's situation in a seemingly capricious and arbitrary world.The film is also very funny, so much so that many wrongly describe it as a comedy. It has some over-the-top comic moments, some slapstick, and clever dialogue throughout, but it never lets us stop worrying for poor Cameron. There are a lot of ways this film could have ended in that light, but I can't think of a better way of doing it than the way they did.About the only annoying thing for me is the business of Eli shooting an antiwar film. The metaphor seems lost in the bits of this film-within-a-film we see on screen, and the dialogue between Eli and his writer on this point drag on, except in the indirect way it creates a link with Cameron, a war veteran.So much else is great, though, I wonder how it failed to find a big audience. It's a deep, philosophical film, but with all the stunts, wonderfully goofy dialogue, and the herky-jerky romance between Cameron and Nina, there's something here for anyone who chances to see it. Like the wonderful score by Dominic Frontiere which girds the proceedings, "The Stunt Man" is by turns rousing, evocative, and sinister, a classic one gets lost in again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you hate computer enhanced visual effects as much as I do and really appreciate the traditional art of film-making this movie borders on the documentary. Here we have a film about making a film that gives up all of its tricks as it goes. There are shots explaining how the next shot is going to be filmed and then you see the shot as it's being filmed. Willing suspension of disbelief plays maddening tricks on you as you know you're watching a scene being filmed and yet forget that there's a film crew sitting right where you are that is filming what you see. In fact there are scenes where you can clearly see the fill in stuntman taking the place of our actor stuntman who is taking the place of our actor. And then we watch the dailies and see that the scene was filmed in what the French call "the American night" or we know it as 'day for night'. A subtle dig at the Truffault film released at the start of this same decade and loosely based on the same story. And Barbara Hershey is really hot.</fullReview>

And why wasn't the first car ever brought up with the dead stuntman inside?Even Cameron accepts a ride with the Police chief at the end of the movie, without much concern about being discovered. ---just beating a dead horse.

I remembered it as an excellent movie, and it is even better than I recalled (or I'm more perceptive than I was then). Barbara Hershey had been at a decidedly low ebb in her career for several years before she got this role, and her superb performance put her back on the actress map. Peter O'Toole is flawless as the director whose motives are always in doubt, and Steve Railsback is very good as "Lucky" Cameron. I also watched "The Sinister Saga of the Making of The Stunt Man," and recommend it highly. If you've never seen this film, you may even -- dare I say it? -- want to watch the "...making of..." before watching the feature; it would clarify some things about the film, and add to your understanding and enjoyment. If you have any appreciation for films which are somewhat off-center you will LOVE The Stunt Man.</fullReview>

Peter o toole is perfectly cast as the director and displays his unique ability to deliver dialogue as never before. Steve Railsback impresses as The Stunt Man as was perfectly cast. A large measure of the atmosphere of the film must be attributed to Dominic Frontiere's moody soundtrack which captures this enthralling world of the surreal.

		<fullReview>This is a film which has enormous pretensions:its roots are numerous,which,in the end,does not make it exactly the innovative work which some praise to the skies.First of all,it is Hitchcock's "suspicion" among the stunt men;then the scenarists who play with their characters like some kind of puppeteer was the subject of Julien Duvivier's "la f?te ? Henriette" - poorly remade as "Paris when it sizzles ";and the movie in the movie trick was in Truffaut's "la nuit américaine" ("day for night").The "what lies beneath the picture" trick was Antonioni's "Blow up" subject.One must add that the movie is overlong ,and a lot of scenes could have been edited out without the movie's plot suffering for it.And why did the director ask Railsback to overplay when he reveals his not so intriguing past to Hershey?On the plus side,and mainly in its first third ,the movie has assets:first of all,Peter O'Toole's satanic rendering ,who follows his prey like a witch on a broom.We really believe he is God sometimes.The "special effects" on the beach really dwarf the future " F/X"(1986)And there are excellent lines when O'Toole compares his new stunt man to Alice in Wonderland.SPOILER.SPOILER .SPOILER. The connection with "suspicion" is obvious;both movies feature ominous scary plots which vanish into thin air ,and the audience may think they have been had.There's a big difference .Hitchcock's classic only lasts 100 min;it has everything that lacks here: a tight editing, a knowing screenplay which finally leaves no plot holes.END OF SPOILER"Stunt man" nevertheless deserves to be watched,but it's doubtful you will feel like seeing it twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Possibly the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night at my husband's insistence - he saw it years ago and bought it online. 30 minutes into the movie, I was still asking, "So what's going on here?" "Huh?" "Whaa...?" "I don't get it." My bathroom break didn't even require putting the DVD on "pause." It takes about the first hour of the movie to figure out the plot, and by that point, I just didn't care. I'm not sure what the writers were thinking, but it couldn't have been anything about making a coherent story that viewers could follow, and invest themselves in.Peter O'Toole is wasted in this movie. I wonder what he was thinking; maybe he needed some cash.Barbara Hershey was in about every third movie during this time period, and plays about the same character in each one.I last saw "Helter Skelter" starring Steve Railsback 15-20 years ago, and the moment I saw him the "The Stunt Man," he was immediately recognizable. Apparently he has only the one facial expression: freaky. Even during love scenes, he looks freaked out. There is no tenderness; when he smiles, it never reaches his eyes. That was apropos for "Helter Skelter," but perhaps not for this movie.During the first few minutes, I wondered if I wasn't seeing some odd re-tread of "First Blood." Where's Rambo when you need him?In short, don't waste your time. If you want to see freaked-out Railsback, watch "Helter Skelter" - it's a better movie, and is actually based on a true story. If you're looking for a misunderstood Vietnam Vet, "First Blood" has a coherent message, and besides, Stallone is a lot cuter (just my opinion). If you want to see O'Toole's acting chops, there are many great films to choose from. Just not this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a work of art about the creation of a work of art. The work in this case happens to be a movie, and as with all great works of art, there is one obsessed, cruel, megalomaniacal genius at the helm. Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole) is the most vivid depiction of a Hollywood director ever captured on film. He is a true patriarch, playing father/lover/drill sergeant to his cast and crew, and they all love/hate/fear him for it. Anyone who's ever been near an actual film set can tell you how accurate the character is. But what makes this film just about the last word on the subject is Richard Rush's brilliant blurring of fantasy and reality. That, after all, is the main occupation of those who toil in the "Dream Factory" of show biz. This was director Richard Rush's dream project and it took him nine years to get it on the screen.Although it seems nasty, the movie is wonderfully light-hearted and the outrageous stunt scenes are backed up by a joyous score by Dominic Frontiere. A long scene with Cameron running over a rooftop, as biplanes attack and enemy soldiers give chase, is the stuff of legend. There is a great comic sense of humor in watching them trip over each other, fall off and get blown up. The performances are uniformly excellent. O'Toole is truly magnetic here, and you can see that he was hammered in some scenes and still pulls it off. Now that's a pro drinker! Railsback is perfect, and Hershey is mighty alluring indeed. This is the inside look at film-making that Hollywood doesn't want us to see: the egos, the drugs (watch the t-shirts and background scenes), the general insular idiocy of it all, and mainly the non-stop irony. Yes, "The Stunt Man" is a deceptively-accurate look into what the most highly acclaimed directors do to get the most out of their cast &amp; crew.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter O'Toole as director ropes Steve Railsback into movie stunts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stunt Man" features a great performance from Peter O'Toole as a movie director whose work shaping a film takes great energy and manipulation of people. No doubt he drew upon directors he knew. At times I see John Huston in his portrayal. O'Toole is the heart of this film. The next best performance is that of Barbara Hershey as his lead female in the war movie that he's filming around the Hotel Coronado in San Diego. Steve Railsback plays an untrusting and bitter Vietnam vet who is on the run from police, but who is not a career criminal or dangerous. O'Toole hides him in the movie company and blackmails him into becoming a stunt man to replace another one who has drowned when a stunt went wrong. Allan Garfield provides his usual outstanding support, this time as a script writer. Alex Rocco is a local cop looking into the suspected death of the earlier stunt man.The movie is a bizarre mixture of mystery, comedy, romance, thrills, stunts, behind the scenes movie-within-a-movie and philosophical allusions. In my opinion, it doesn't really succeed at doing any of these really well. The two biggest impressions it leaves on me are the bravura and captivating presence of O'Toole and the stunts that are shown at some length. The romance between Railsback and Hershey is nothing special. The mystery-police aspect is very much shuffled off to the side. Railsback as troubled veteran is almost interesting, but doesn't come across very well. Either his lines are not good enough or he gave us a vacuous man or both. There is at least one scene where he goes a little crazy explaining to Hershey how he came to be wanted by the police. He fills in his back story, and I thought that whole sequence was overdone. Much of the movie teeters on being overdone, even with O'Toole's part but he manages to hold it within bounds. The stunts are overdone, but they are played for something like a Keystone Cops comedy. Much of the movie comes across simply as parody, in which case being overdone is no big issue. As for philosophy, that has mild interest. The themes brought out are obvious and well-known. There is no deep exploration here.But let us applaud vigorously both the scripted character of O'Toole and his playing of it, including how we see him, which owes much I imagine to director Richard Rush. That part of the movie is all first-rate. That is a big reason to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is real?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's questioning one's reality and then there's bending it through a prism six ways from Sunday. "The Stuntman" is the latter, which shrouds itself in questions and stymies you at every turn. Mostly, this is a well-constructed film and the mystery keeps you actively involved. It's fascinating how many layers this thing has. But even if you're not game for this sort of side-winding, it does have Peter O'Toole, which is a joyride unto himself. His megalomaniacal director is larger than life and might just be an evil genius. But he absolutely owns this movie, and it's a ferocious performance to beat them all. Amazing stuff.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film works tremendously on all levels. It is a highly intelligent story about what is or is not real, while at the same time it is a fast-moving and spectacular stuntfest, with much clever and funny dialogue. Steve Railsback plays Cameron, who pretends to be a deceased stuntman who was a stand-in for an actor playing a First World War pilot. So one man (Railsback) is playing another (Cameron) playing another (deceased stuntman) playing another (actor in WW1 film) playing another (WW1 pilot): no wonder that in the world of the film set Cameron has trouble working out what is or not real! I have seen this film probably ten times, and every time I see something I missed before. It is absolutely enthralling, and though it has always had good reviews, it somehow always gets missed when lists of all-time great films are compiled. It is one of those movies which has many fans, and I always recommend it as a must-see, but most people just don't seem to 'get' this film, so it has not got as much recognition as it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right from the opening it had me taken in. The music, the shots, the action.The whole film is so taut, everything is so finely honed. It's a film about films, so it can't get away with any sloppiness. And it doesn't, it's perfect.The human side of it is touching, with the love story and the personal conflicts etc ... but the best part is the "tricks" this film plays, on its characters, but also on the audience. With Peter O'Toole as the great puppet-master, hovering in and out of shots dangling from a crane like the God he emulates.The 'stunt' sequences are legendary. I have purchased this film and it will be watched many times. To be honest I'm surprised that it has gone out of mass consumption, even after 27 years.Watch it. It ROCKS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter o Toole is spectacular in this film. It is about a Vietnam veteran (Steve Railsback) who accidentally murders the stunt man of a film being directed by Toole. Toole hires the veteran as the stunt man. But the veteran fears that Toole is trying to murder him, even as he falls in love with Toole's girlfriend (the gorgeous Barbara Hershey). This film has some of the coolest non-special effects action I've ever seen. The back ground score by Dominic Lapierre is used to great effect.It was my father's favorite film when he was in college. He recently got the DVD imported. It really is a rollicking film. The first few scenes and the title sequence are simply to die for. Great buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes a brilliant blend of action, comedy, romance and thriller. Sometimes a muddle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love movies about movies and The Stunt Man is a very entertaining addition to that sub-genre. I had the misconception that Peter O'Toole was the protagonist (given his nomination), but instead he plays the eccentric director who drives the real protagonist's story. He's definitely the highlight of the film and his character holds the whole movie together. Getting actors in the moment is something I've learned recently and the film is entirely about this director's struggle to get his actors in the moment. It's a concept that's fascinating to watch. With its blend of genres of action, comedy, romance and thriller, it can end up a muddle, especially with things I can't tell are plot holes or not. This mixture in tone gets to a point where its repetitive score is either a blessing or irritating depending on the scene. Unfortunately the film is let down by its lead character and performance who is ironically rarely believable and too bland to be relatable. But the film does have that 70s aesthetic of excess and grain borrowed from All That Jazz that I love.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a different kind of anti-war film, an oft-overlooked gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up front, I'll say that this film came out when I was 12. Didn't see it in the cinema (did anyone?) but I watched it several times when it hit HBO. It quickly became my favorite movie. Peter O'Toole turns in one of his best performances as Eli Cross, the overbearing, manipulative director of a WWI film. Steve Railsback (known mostly for his portrayal of Charles Manson in Helter Skelter) is a fugitive named Cameron who wanders onto Cross's film set while fleeing the police. He gets involved a stunt where a car drives off a bridge and the stuntman disappears. Having seen Cameron's skill and inventiveness in his flight from the police, Cross decides to bring him onto the film set by pretending that he is Burt, the missing stuntman. Barbara Hershey plays Nina Franklin, the leading lady of the film- within-the-film, and quickly she becomes Cameron's love interest. The main part of the film involves the mind games Cross plays with the young couple, and a good deal of stunt work by Cameron running across the various roofs of the Coronado hotel in San Diego. As the film heads towards its climax, Cameron starts to wonder why Cross keeps making him do increasingly dangerous stunts, and wonders if he'll get off the set alive. The film concerns itself with themes of paranoia and trust. Along the way, O'Toole owns every scene he's in. Barbara Hershey does a fine job as Nina. As for Railsback...well, he's not quite up to the O'Toole standard. He exudes manic energy in every scene he's in, but it ends up lacking in subtlety. The cinematography and screenplay have a lot of what now seem like 70s- era filmmaking tricks. One key scene features Railsback speaking while we see Hershey's reflection in a car window. At one point this may have seemed inventive, but from the current perspective it's comically outdated. Still, in spite of its flaws I love this film for its ambition and, above all, for O'Toole. He deserved his nomination for an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..delightfully nutty movie..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I can say is, I bet NONE of you guys have analyzed this movie correctly - I don't think it's supposed to be understood. Just think: If you had to work on something for 10 years - and then wait another 2 to get it to the theaters - couldn't you lose focus, too? Richard Rush was most likely so delighted he finally got all that work out, he'd be overly pleased. The interesting trivia would be to know what scenes were shot when, or if he had to keep calling people back to shoot again. The actors/actresses didn't age ??? Maybe it took so long to do all that crazy stuff on the roof of the hotel and in the planes....At any rate, it matters not to me - I just look around all that hard-to-understand stuff and enjoy the nuttiness. O'Toole, Hershey and Railsback do a fabulous job of acting. What a jolt to see all those gory bodies get themselves up out of the sand and act like nothing happened - truly LOL ! The whole movie is "camp" to me.....the serious parts of it are better because of it. If the director of the "movie-in-a-movie" WERE trying to kill the stunt man, the REAL stunt man must have seen it, to build-in all those escape goodies into the auto. That was a VERY tense scene. I liked all that dropping out of the sky on a crane, and zooming 'copters. Funny ! The only bit I didn't really care for was that stupid bear prop.......totally wasted on me.I think all the extras were super; I liked the cinematography, the costumes were good - what else does it need? I'm not really into a trip to the psychiatrist after vetting a movie.....if I didn't get the true meaning of it, if I enjoyed the movie, I just say "maybe later" - I can always watch it again.......as I have several times.Lighten-up, guys - Paul Broder wrote a multi-faceted story. I'm sure Rush added-on to it. Why try to make it more complicated by talking about all that anti-war stuff, etc.? I guess I have to buy the DVD so I can understand why all you guys think it's a nutty movie - I do too. SO, "Roger" didn't care for it - who cares? Do you REALLY pay attention to what critics write ??? Maybe it was nuts, but I give it a 10.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film upon theatrical release in 1980, and watched it a second time with friends as soon as it was released on video. Unfortunately, it is not nearly as great as I remember it, but it is still a cut above most films from its era or present day.The concept has a lot of potential but for various reasons, it does not reach its potential. Sir Peter O'Toole is brilliant of course, and always a joy to watch on film. I think the only classical actor who can touch him today is equally regal Sir Ian McKellen. Barbara Hershey is excellent as well.Jason</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One user comments that this is the best movie of the 1980s. That might not be true, but you can't leave this one without feeling you've got something for your time and trouble.The premise is good, and the use of the relatively unknown Railsback in the leading role is smart, and Hershey is as delicious as she's ever been, and O'Toole is more demonic than he's ever been.This movie is a subtle and at times not so subtle reminder just how much (how little) reality there is in Tinsel Town. And it's also a suggestion that to get the perfect performance, directors will do the unbelievable.The scene with the paint is the turning point in the movie - after this scene, The Stunt Man has you. It's no wonder it got three Oscar nominations (O'Toole, director, 'best writing based on another') along with a DGA for Rush, six Golden Globe nominations (one win), the Grand Prix in Montreal, the NFSC to O'Toole, and a WGA nomination for the screenplay.This movie plays like a small movie, but it's with these unusual remarkable ones we see bigger things in perspective. On other layers the film is seen as taking jabs at the 'studio system', and so despite the flood of accolades and nominations, it was almost entirely shelved - 'studio politics'.You might think it innocuous what this film could do to the studios; but then you perhaps don't know the studios at all.Top dollar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film seems to have generated quite a few positive comments. That says something, but not something good (cf H L Mencken on public taste). Disregard that praise, is my sincere advice. This is a stupid, poorly acted and generally lousy film, with a paper thin premise that implodes immediately.The actor Steve Railsback could be a candidate for some kind of All Time Bad, and he's got company here.Also, production qualities are generally of the B-movie standard. But if you like that and have a somewhat undeveloped aesthetic sensibility and the feeling that you're going to live for 300 years, go ahead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O'Toole is superb, but not the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter O'Toole is absolutely wonderful and totally irresistible. But the other two leads, Barbara Hershey and Steve Railsback, are not. Hershey's character is poorly written and she does not provide any credibility (nor any appeal) to the role. Railsback plays well the role given to him (a nasty-tempered, dull-witted drifter), but that does not particularly make him endearing in the movie. The net result is that the film flops during all the moments that O'Toole is not speaking his lines.The storywriting is notably amateurish. Nothing is developed to motivate why big-star Hershey would fall deeply in love with the nasty, unappealing Railsback character. And what in the world is a Duesenberg doing in a World War I movie?? (The firm wasn't even established until some years after the end of WWI). I also do not believe there were any Duesenbergs that sported Mercedes three-pointed ornaments on their hoods.The DVD release is accompanied by a second DVD consisting solely of Mr. Rush congratulating himself for having made this wonderful movie, despite the machinations of big, bad Hollywood. The DVD is long but sloppy and he keeps referring to "Deus ex machina" as "Dues ex machina".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not one of those die-hard fans of this genre, or this movie, so I didn't look at all the little details in the movie like loyal fans do. I just watched it once and I am reviewing it like it should be reviewed, like a movie. And upon first seeing this movie, it isn't hard to immediately see that it has poor cinematography, acting, continuity, and so forth. I mean, people try to look deeper into this movie and figure it out. There is no figuring it out. People make excuses for its plot problems by saying that it has many twists and is a blend of genres. I am simply saying that The "twists" were continuity problems and the "blend of genres" was the directors inability to decide what this movie was even about and how it should feel. It's like the director is working out what he thinks the movie should be like as he's filming it. Barbara Hershey was totally unconvincing as the leading lady. What does she see in the stunt man? He's even more unresolved than her, and shows very little character development as the movie progresses. He stays the lonely psycho he appears to be in the beginning. And the character relationships are so awkwardly put together. The movie hints in one direction, and then goes in another and never makes much sense. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* One minute we're supposed to believe that the director of the WWI flick (Peter O'Toole) is crazy, the next he's not, then the next, he is. It's so on-and-of, I mean, at one point we're led to the fact that the lead actress slept with the director, but in another scene, she claims she wants to run away with the stunt man because she believes the directors crazy, but then we're supposed to believe that he actually wasn't and it was all OK all along. ???!?!?!?!!!??!?! *END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS* On top of that there are the obvious problems with cinemaphotography (such as awkward scene cuts and camera shots), bad acting on the parts of Barbara Hershey and Steve Railsback, and overall believability. The beginning is funny and usually makes sense but it really falls apart towards the middle and end to the extent that it's really not worth watching at all.</fullReview>

The way it's directed so you don't know if it's real or not isn't fair to the audience and gets extremely irritating very quickly. Even the acting O'Toole included seems way too erratic to be believable. I'm sure if your a stunt man or in the industry you might enjoy it but I thought it self-indulgent and tedious.

		<fullReview>There's more than one moment in this film when you might feel a little lost, wondering just what it is the director is trying to say. It is absolutely not about redemption, but it is, and it's more about perception of truth than it is about how art mirrors life? but then it isn't. The DVD features an introduction from the director about his intentions and if it weren't for this primer to what follows, the movie may play for you like just another independent flick about Hollywood.Escaping from prison Cameron (Steve Railsback) dodges a car heading toward him on a bridge causing the car to plummet into the water below drowning the driver. When Cameron discovers that he has stumbled into a movie being made by Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), he immediately attempts escape but is stopped when Cross offers the con protection if he'll be a stunt man in the picture. Cameron still plans to leave until he meets Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the lead actress in the film. Cameron falls for Nina immediately and she makes him feel good while Cross gets him to go to greater and greater lengths to get Cameron to perform dangerous stunts for his camera. When Nina and Cameron try to escape together they plan for her to hide in the trunk of the car that Cameron will drive off of a bridge in a dangerous stunt for Cross to film, but when the momentous day arrives will they be able to go through with it? I'm not sure I hold with Director Richard Rush's ideas voiced by his alter ego Peter O'Toole's Eli Cross who on the one hand seeks out great realism with Cameron's true Vietnam experiences and their affect on his movie, while philosophizing about truth versus movie magic. It's clear that Cross is a ruthless task master when it comes to getting his picture made, and this aspect of the Hollywood industry we understand.This is possibly Steve Railsback's only shining moment as a rising Hollywood star. His only other most popular film role was as Charles Mason in Helter Skelter and it's kind of too bad that he hasn't gotten better roles. The Stunt Man is a special case because it puts Railsback in scenes against two really fine actors. In scenes with Peter O'Toole Steve Railsback utilizes his Actors Studio training well to deliver the truth of character and scene, with Barbara Hershey Steve Railsback reveals a particularly sensitive side to his persona that very nearly makes him palatable to the mainstream taste.The quality of the script for The Stunt Man clearly sets it apart from other movies like it. Writing credits for the film go to Lawrence B. Marcus and Richard Rush for adapting the Paul Brodeur novel. The action keeps pushing and pulling us in different directions, and as we recover we find that we are viewing the film story from a variety of angles. Some valuable time is consumed as we learn, along with the main character Cameron, what stunt men do, and it is this process that relates the idea that filmmaking is like life- there are those who direct, and those who act, and those who do the stunt work.Where the film is weakest is in relying on Railsback's Cameron to deliver the angst and betrayal of the U.S. Government on the people via the Vietnam War. If this movie is about that, and we are pointed to the comparison repeatedly through the World War 1 art direction of the movie within the film, then a more direct bond should have been made. There are some great scenes of excellent stunt work that develop the story but logically stop the action for anyone who has worked on a film.It's still an exciting picture to watch and one that for filmmakers and cineastes will continue to bring a wealth of ideas and possible themes. The stellar cast shines and in many ways makes this movie a pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"How Tall is King Kong?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has to be the best quote in the whole movie because not only it defines the whole thing but it's also one of the most funniest (specially when it is said at the ending). The height of 1933's King Kong (3'6) is mentioned in "The Stunt Man" as a representation of how manipulative and incredible movies are. It also represents the audience's manipulation in terms of believing in what they're seeing as real when in fact it's not. Everybody knows King Kong as something monstrous, gigantic but very few know that the real thing was a small toy made to look bigger thankfully to special effects.But what's have to do with the story of a Vietnam War veteran running away from police, who happens to stumble on a film set to be later get invited by the film director to replace a dead stunt man? Everything! The fugitive Cameron (played by a sexy Steve Railsback) while learning to be a stunt gets fooled over and over by the director Eli Cross (a dynamic Peter O'Toole - Oscar nominated for this role), who puts the poor man in the most audacious, risky and dangerous stunts in a World War I film. Along with the filming, there's a romantic story involving an actress (Barbara Hershey) involved with both director and stunt man, and of course, the police hunt for the man and a investigation of what really happen with the original stunt guy. Then, just like Kong, there's the manipulation of "The Stunt Man" on us, audience, when we think that all what's happening with Cameron is real until someone yell 'Cut', and the background is revealed, cameras and people start to show up. Here's one example: Cameron is running away from villains, being chased over rooftops, stairs, bullets flying over his head, explosions, the fear we see in his eyes are very real but then we know it's a planned stunt. This screenplay strategy works but not that much if we consider that most of the time Cameron is performing all the stunts in one long shot where he falls and runs and jumps, I mean, Eli's team is filming like five or six sequences continuously, which is quite impossible to be done in films. It's visually impressive to see all that but not much believable.Even so, this is a very funny and interesting film that show the magic of movies being made. It was a dream project for director Richard Rush that took nine years to be finally made and it worth all the while, guarantying a Oscar nomination for him as Best Director. The performances fit the film perfectly with the highlights on O'Toole making of Eli an egomaniacal film director who believes to be an God who controls everything and everyone, without caring about anything although he's impressed by the mysterious Cameron. Railsback is very memorable and a little sinister as the fugitive/stunt man who gets astonished with the film he became part of and the salary offered, but he doesn't realize how naive he was and how deceivable Eli was.Fugitive on the run, filmmaking of a big budget film, romance, action, comedy, lots of humor, this film in no way could go wrong. Here's an very enjoyable and underrated classic of the 1980's. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks like a made-for-TV movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stunt Man" was released in 1980 to apparently universal praise and earned three Oscar nominations including: Best Actor (Peter O'Toole), Best Director (Richard Rush) and Best Adapted Screenplay. (As a result of those nominations, I saw it on TCM as part of that channel's annual "30 Days of Oscar" scheduling.) Now that I've seen it, I'm scratching my head over what critics and Oscar voters saw in this utterly forgettable and rather tacky tale about a Hollywood film production.Whatever its merits were thirty-four years ago have been seemingly lost to time. This is one very dated and cheap-looking film. If it wasn't for its nudity, foul language, and Peter O'Toole it has all the appearances of a late 1970's made-for-TV movie with its cheap looking sets and bargain-bin actors. Steve Railsback (who?) as the star?!?! Really? The plot: fugitive from the law and troubled Vietnam vet (a major cliché of 1970's TV shows and movies was that all Vietnam vets were borderline nuts)"Cameron" (Railsback) flees the police and stumbles upon a movie set. The film's temperamental director, "Eli Cross" (O'Toole), despite being aware of Cameron's fugitive status, immediately hires him as a replacement stuntman. That leads to Cameron, now renamed "Lucky," performing complex and dangerous stunts without a hitch. He's also able to instantly bed several of the film's female cast and crew including its lead actress, "Nina" (Barbara Hershey). (I guess it's because he's just so studly?!?! Steve Railsback? Really?) Meanwhile, Cross and his script writer argue over the meaning of their film and its alleged "poignancy" as an anti-war statement despite filming it at a beach resort. To put it bluntly, the plot was contrived, paper-thin, and just plain unbelievable.I'm flabbergasted that this film was nominated for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay because neither the direction nor the screenplay rise above the level of Movie-of-the-Week. Yes, it was criminal Peter O'Toole never won a Best Actor Oscar and one can think of numerous roles for which he was robbed of that honor, but his role as "Eli Cross" in this stinker is not one of them.This is a bad movie. It's cheap looking. It has a cardboard cut-out for a leading-man. (Steve Railsback? Really?) Richard Rush was a non-entity of a director before "The Stunt Man" and quickly returned to obscurity afterwards as did this grossly overrated film which has been forgotten. My guess is Hollywood's self-absorbed, narcissistic infatuation with movies about the film business led to the false praise. However, time has certainly not been kind to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great and fun movie to watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of a movie within a movie is greatly and fun executed in this movie and it blends perfectly in with the plot of the movie. The movie is filled with some great and impressive stunts. This is really a stunt men movie! I feel that this movie is a great homage to all the stunt people out there. There isn't too much to the rest of the story but that's sort of OK. It's the sort of story that put its emphasize on the slow development of the plot and character. It isn't until halfway through the movie that the story takes to take form and becomes more personal and layered. It even in part manages to become effective and powerful. The screenplay even received an Oscar nomination.Above all the movie is still a comedy. It's a movie with a realistic directing approach. It's not the sort of movie with forced comedy moments in it but more a movie with a constantly present fun and light atmosphere, with also some great subtle fun dialog in it and other subtle comedy elements. It's an '80's movie but yet the movie still totally feels and look like a '70's movie and that is of course a big plus. This is of course due to the fact that this movie actually shot in 1978 but not released until 1980 by Fox.The movie features some great camera-work and some good fast editing, that keeps the movie flowing and the pace high. Also the nice musical score by Dominic Frontiere suits the movie well and makes it fun in parts and perfectly serious in others. It's a good balance between the comedy and drama, as is the entire movie as a whole.Peter O'Toole is totally great and convincing in this movie as a director. He's such a wonderful actor! He also received an Oscar nominations for his role in this movie. Also the other actors in this movie are just fine, which is also thanks to the good directing approach of the movie. No big surprises to me that director Richard Rush was also nominated for an Oscar for this movie. He's a great actor director.A great and fun movie to watch!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christian is thrown to the lions...Hollywood style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former Vietnam soldier, a curiously uncorrupted rube who finds himself on the run from the law, is recruited by a movie director with a God-complex to work as a stuntman in his WWI epic being shot by a ragtag movie company full of eccentrics and enigmatic shadies. It's the movie world as a battlefield, with the latter spilling dangerously over into the former. Although a personal triumph for director Richard Rush (who also produced the film and worked on the adaptation of Paul Brodeur's novel--and was eventually forced to wait two years after the picture's completion before he could get it released), the results are florid and outrageous without being very good. Peter O'Toole's seething portrayal of the mercurial filmmaker (who is often delivered down from the heavens like an angel with horns) is indeed superlative; complicated and nasty, he's a gleeful mad-scientist who's more than eager to renounce his new star's movie-virginity for the sake of his extravaganza. However, Steve Railsback (just off the TV-movie "Helter Skelter", where he played Charles Manson) never finds an appropriate style as the director's victim; haunted, yet open-mouthed and vacuous, Railsback does manage some brave emotions, but mostly they are just freak-outs. The audience is never drawn to this character, nor to the ramifications of his circumstance. Railsback and O'Toole seems to belong to different times and places, and, as the actress who binds the two men together and then rattles that bond, Barbara Hershey looks absolutely lost. Rush wants "The Stunt Man" to be a merrily complicated web of deceit and confusion, and at times the viewer is terrifically confused (and the comedic after-effects can be exhilarating). Still, it's such an ugly-looking picture, filled with barbed bravado and uncontrolled egocentricity, that one is apt to be worn down long before the final tally. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stunt Man Doesn't Exactly Grow On You *1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor film and though Peter O'Toole received another best actor nomination, Steve Railsback was just as good here.O'Toole always did splendidly especially in parts where there is some sort of homosexual mania behind him.He is quite a character in this one as he portrays a director on the set of a movie about World War 1. Railsback, running from the police, comes upon the set and as a stunt man was killed earlier in an accident, O'Toole takes a liking to our run away and hires him for the part.The picture goes awry after this with Railsback thinking that O'Toole has set him up to be killed. There is a wild scene with Railsback going berserk as he had fallen for the leading lady of the film. Her actions and their plans are most absurd. You don't even know if the end were contrived or not. However, by the end, O'Toole is reduced to the typical movie mogul man, fighting over salaries. Believe me, there was nothing to fight about over this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How tall was King Kong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many conflicting opinions have been expressed about this picture, so allow me to set the record straight, here and now. "The Stunt Man" is one of the best films ever made. Period. If anyone out there doesn't agree, I feel sorry for you, because you just don't get it. Are we clear on this now?Like many films that aren't always easy to categorize, Richard Rush'smasterpiece has apparently gone straight over the heads of some people --from the clueless studio clods who refused to release it, to some of the viewers posting user ratings. Ironically, I've read several criticisms here of thephotography. What the hell are these people talking about? The camerawork is just one of the masterful elements of the film, featuring Rush's trademarktelephoto rack focuses, split-diopter 2-shots, mirror/window reflectioncompositions and long, tracking/Steadicam shots. I consider Mario Tosi one of the best DPs ever (check out "Report to the Commissioner" sometime if youwant to see one of the best lit films ever made), and his collaboration with Rush could not have been a more creative one.But the cinematography, of course, is just one of the key components of thisunique movie. Dominic Frontiere's alternately lively and melancholy score, Jack Hofstra and Caroline Ferriol's (Biggerstaff's) frenetic, perfectly-paced editing together with Richard Rush's and Larry Marcus's brilliant, textbook screenplay all work in perfect harmony to make this a one of a kind, tour-de-force cinematic experience. Nothing like it has been made before or since. It's funny,suspenseful, and terrifying. And never before has the circus-like atmosphere of a film crew on location been so perfectly captured; never has the craziness and danger of stunt work (and movie-making in general) been so effectivelyportrayed. Truffaut's "Day For Night" is a fine film, no question about it -- but with all due respect to the great Francois, comparing the relatively simple "Day For Night" to the sophisticated, multi-layered "Stunt Man" is like comparing a silent student film to "Citizen Kane." The passionate and colorful performances are of course the glue that hold all this expert technique together. Steve Railsback is perfectly cast as the paranoid and frightened would-be stunt man, while Peter O'Toole has never been betteras his opponent -- the ambiguous, possibly dangerous and always- megalomaniacal director Eli Cross, who is put in the odd position of trying to create the illusion of World War I with the reality of a Vietnam veteran. Barbara Hershey gives a highly-charged performance as emotional starlet Nina Franklin, while Allen Garfield, Chuck Bail and Alex Rocco are all superb in keysupporting roles.But without question, the most dazzling talent on display here is director Richard Rush. From start to finish, he magnificently captures the crazy, surreal world of filmmaking by dropping an unsuspecting participant into the mix and befuddling him at every turn. We, the layman, see the eccentric Hollywood smoke-and- mirror world just as Cameron perceives it -- with a combination of delight and suspicion. Just as Cameron is seduced by this world, he is also terrified by it, and knows enough to suspect control freak Cross of absolutely anything --including murder -- to get his personal vision onto film. It is this dichotomy -- the obsession to create illusion, and the bizarre, often ugly reality that sometimes rears its head along the way that makes filmmaking such a bizarre art, anddirectors such a fascinating species. As some perceptive viewers have noted, there are many interesting details that can be picked up on subsequent viewings -- but I wonder, how many of you outthere have noticed the subliminal? I won't say where it is, but I will say what it is: a one-frame closeup of Steve Railsback, that could not be in a more perfectspot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only O'Toole makes this worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A convict named Cameron (Steve Railsback) is being chases by the police. He inadvertently stumbles upon a stunt being done for a movie--and the stuntman dies. The crazy director Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole) makes believe that the stuntman didn't die and passes off Cameron as him. Cameron goes along with it and becomes the official stuntman for the movie. What follows is a frustrating and decidedly unfunny black comedy.I caught this back in 1980 and couldn't make heads or tails out of it. Critics were raving about it nonstop but I thought it was pointless and quite dull. I (sort of) get it now. It's a VERY surreal black comedy about a bunch of people making a movie about WW1 and being ruled over by a mad director who will do ANYTHING to get it done. Some people may find jokes about people being killed or wounded hysterically funny but I didn't. Also the movie is constantly playing with the viewers mind--fantasy and reality keep intermixing in the film. You think you're seeing something real...but it turns out to be fake. This happens nonstop throughout the film! It's kind of fun at first but then it just gets annoying. Acting doesn't help. Railsback (who can be good) is dreadful here. He has just one look and uses it throughout the entire picture! I didn't have a clue on how to take his character. His big speech towards the end is more funny than shocking. Hershey (another one who can be good) is ALSO terrible! Was she taking acting tips from Railsback? She's all over the place here. The script is lousy. Nobody talks like a real person here. I was always aware I was listening to a script--NOT dialogue.There are only two bright lights here: the action sequences are fast, furious and lots of fun. And O'Toole takes his meaty role and runs with it. He was justly nominated for an Academy Award for this. He's WAY over the top but it fits the surreal material like a glove. He's just incredible but he's the only thing worth seeing here. Everything else is just horrible. The total adoration of this picture is beyond me. I give it a 2 and that's just for O'Toole's brilliant performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Folded Narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All real moviegoers have their ticks. Some require action vehicles. Others demand horror. A small but increasingly vocal group demands "self-reference" or "self-reflection" or "folded narrative." When they get it, they make all sorts of allowances they would not grant films in genres for which they have no affinity.They'll blissfully overlook:1. Horrendous cinematography2. Pretentious direction3. Clumsy editing4. Inconsistent performances5. A weak scriptAnd myriad other faults, besides.Bottom line: This film is a mess. It lacks a professional standard in all but a few scenes. As E.B White said of James Joyce, "It takes more than a genius to keep me reading a book."Ditto for movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's almost impossible to decipher this extremely offbeat movie and find its deeper meaning - or even if it actually HAS a deeper meaning. The very good performances (Hershey has probably never looked more stunning) and the general air of unpredictability and originality sustain your interest, but ultimately it's a rather disappointing, empty movie, full of "reality vs fantasy" games than never become truly inventive. Worth a look. (**)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe there are so many people who love this film. I thought there were no genuinely likable or compelling characters. Railsback's character has got to be one of the most annoying in film history. How could a film star fall for him?, especially after his psychotic storytelling episode. The plot twists were so obviously contrived and pathetically manipulative. I couldn't have cared less about the final scenes which others read so much into. And now some filler--I rented the 2 disc set from the library(free thank god); documentary was pretty good, learned a few things about movie distribution; Rush was so proud of his film, I laughed a lot at the absurdness of the praise and pride.

		<fullReview>The incomparable Peter O'Toole is the only reason to watch this film. Apparently released in 1980, it seems even more dated to me (like the middle or early 1970s) The movie is long and complicated and moves rather slowly in some ways.I could do without Barbara Hershey and her Stuntman all together. I can see why mega-producer Eli Cross (O'Toole) would be using his employees for cannot fodder by having complete control over their existence.O'Toole is a legend and deserved his Best Actor Oscar nod for this thing, and he would have won had the supporting film/cast been better.If you want better O'Toole fare, go try Lion in Winter (1968) and of course Lawrence of Arabia (1962).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood usually makes yarns that merit some degree of intelligence. Whether it is to pull on your emotions or to stress some theme is what is at heart in the matter. The Stunt Man is not this. It is a failure. In my opinion, it is the epitome of Hollywood garbage. Bad acting, horrendous story-line, and to top it off the stunts are ridiculous. It is no wonder why Peter O'Toole's career is non-existent or relevant in modern Hollywood. This film is absolute trash and is not even worth renting on DVD, VHS, or even watching for free on television. Avoid this film as if it were the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmm. I`ve never been much of a fan of the genre described as " Black comedy " it`s usually a cop out expression used by writers and film makers who can`t decide if they`re working on an intellectual drama or a silly farce. That`s the problem with this movie If I push myself I suppose I can recognise the themes of war ( Via a vietnam vet been given the part of a stuntman in a farcical WW1 film ) and paranoia ( This vet knows everyone is out to get him ) set around the film making process with a meglomaniac director , but THE STUNT MAN is never more than an average film and most of its critical acclaim from the Oscar board and the IMDB is down to the fact only die hard film fans will know what to make of this movie. If you want to see a much better film dealing with paranioa and a farcical war try watching APOCALYPSE NOW</fullReview>
