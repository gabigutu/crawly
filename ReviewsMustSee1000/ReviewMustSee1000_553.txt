		<shortDescription>A dreamlike reality or a realistic dream?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson's latest film You, the Living is not easy to review. One of the reasons is that in his own words he has broken with the Anglo-Saxon tradition of story-telling, in all essence the template of most Western film productions. Another reason might be that although Roy Andersson is somewhat heavy on symbolisms, his, unlike those of, say, Andrei Tarkovsky, are of a more elusive nature. It took him 3 years to complete this 86 minute long film and it wasn't because he was forced to have long breaks between shootings due to financial troubles or problems with the actors. The film consists of 57 vignettes shot mostly by a still camera, and it was the careful design of each of these scenes which required much time. The imagery of this film which is closely related to the director's previous film Songs from the Second Floor is of utmost importance to the story, thus this story is told to a great degree by the surroundings and the environment in which the characters of Andersson's universe dwell and interact. Before each scene was finally shot, there would have been no less than 10 different test shootings with different actors, colors, dialog etc. The result is a dreamlike version of the surrounding world which most of us would recognize and if the setting is like a dream, why not dream a little? Just like in Bunuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, when somebody says "Last night I had a dream", you get to watch it. But then again, what is perceived as reality here is not very much different from the dreams.Despite the fact that the film lacks a plot in the traditional sense of the word and there are no main characters as such, the different characters who appear and reappear in different scenes still meet each other and their stories are inevitably intertwined. What most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people. The trailer trash chain smoking and binge drinking woman who dreams of having a motorbike so that she can get away from "all this crap", her corpulent and mostly silent boyfriend and his frail and seemingly gentle but rather absent-minded mother, members of a brass band whose skill improving efforts at home aren't getting a favorable reception neither from their families nor their neighbors, the depressed Middle Eastern hairdresser and his arrogant customer on his way to "a very important business meeting", an elderly man having a nightmare about bombers in the skies, a young girl dreaming about marrying the young rock star that she is so madly in love with. It's all about dreams and nightmares versus reality but it works as much as a statement in support of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's claims that "all human communication is miscommunication". People speak to each other but it is as if they speak past each other. They try to reach out to the others but shut the others out when those try to reach them.You, the Living is a poetic film set physically in Stockholm but yet universally applicable. The society it portrays is Sweden, its artistic language and the people displayed are generally unmistakably Nordic. Yet, the subject it deals with, namely, the misery of the humankind in a selfish world, reaches far beyond this hemisphere. Despite the seriousness of its theme, the film itself seems a lot more cheerful and laden with humor than one might have expected. But in the words of the director himself "living is so complicated to each one of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor". Hence, this film is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on your sensitivities, and not a depressing black reality tour of the human nature. It is unusual in its language and structure, but if you can think outside the box and enjoy it, you will certainly find this film both entertaining and meaningful at the same time. It was shown at this year's Cannes festival as part of the Un Certain Regard program which offers "original and different works" outside the competition. After the film was shown in the Salle Debussy, the 1,000 strong audience gave it a standing ovation for several minutes. Do I need to say more?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intimate insight into what makes us all human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no plot. There are no central characters. There are no moving cameras or close-ups. In fact, this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream film. However, Roy Andersson's Du Levande is a remarkable piece of cinematic storytelling. It is a touching look at the human psyche.Comprised of a series of vignettes, Roy Andersson gives us an intimate insight into what makes us all human. In perfectly framed static shots, added with the perfectly in tune, yet quirky, music, Roy introduces us to a host of characters as they undertake their daily existence. Some bordering on tragic, others hilarious, we are taken on a Nordic journey like no other.It is a journey into the little things that make us human. Instead of over-the-top storytelling or visual techniques, everything is stripped down to the bare minimum so that our sole focus is on the characters themselves. It focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are; our dreams, our desperation. It's through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals.The washed out colours and deathly-pale makeup of the characters only seems to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them, we are all alive. There is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this film, yet you walk out of the cinema with a sense of life. Much more accessible than his earlier film, Songs from the Second Floor, Du Levande, is a truly inspiring piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Cinema; an amateurs review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A short review without any spoilers follows.I saw this movie yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival. My initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness. I'm so happy films like this are being made in our age of blockbusters. Roy Andersson's new movie "You, The Living" is nothing less than a complete masterpiece. You, The Living is composed by some 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera. I will not give away the content of the scenes here, because I hate when people spoil even the smallest details. But, yes, most of the scenes made the 1000 people in the Claude Debussy theatre absolutely baffled and amazed. When the film was over we applauded for several minutes, we had no other choice.So what's the score with "You, The Living". Hm, Andersson isn't afraid to take on the heavy questions; History, guilt, gand The Holocaust during WW2 are big subjects (and these themes work very well together).The images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes surpasses "Songs from the Second Floor". Well, sorry for this ranting, praising review. Look out for the Flying House in the beginning folks!10/10 stars - A Masterpiece (I never throw this grade out).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another cautionary tale in Andersson's unmistakable style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"With all the misery in the world, how can we not get drunk?" ? MiaA lovely aerial view of a major city turns ominous with the approach of a fleet of airplane bombers; an irate hairdresser reacting to a perceived racial slur cuts a road through a businessman's bushy hair; a man dreams of being dragged to an electric chair after a failed magic trick and a teacher breaks down in front of her grade school class because her husband called her a hag. These and about fifty other vignettes that run the gamut from the outright depressing to the wildly humorous to the joyously uplifting populate Roy Andersson's You, the Living, his first feature since his critically acclaimed if commercially unsuccessful Songs From the Second Floor.You, the Living is filled with the same kind of imaginative set-pieces as Songs, replete with black humor, surreal situations, and strange looking characters. Though a bit overlong and less focused than his earlier work, what remains constant is Andersson's unmistakable style with its stationary camera, sterile-looking backgrounds, and precise attention to detail. If there is a theme that ties the sketches together, it is that our time on Earth is limited and "tomorrow's another day', so let's treat each other with kindness. Along the way, we are entertained by tuba and drum music from the Louisiana Brass Band, dinner guests at a banquet hall standing on their chairs singing a rousing song, and a house that turns into a moving train.The emotions range from the gloom of a daughter attempting to communicate with an Alzheimer's patient to a young woman's ecstatic dream about marrying a handsome guitar-player named Micke to the cheers of a crowd of onlookers. While there is no continuous narrative thread, the theme of greed and desperation appears in several sketches. The first of these threads features two corpulent individuals and their tiny dog sitting on a park bench, the woman bewailing the fact that no one understands or loves her, yet she blithely ignores the man's comforting and reassuring words.There is also a hefty admixture of irony. During what seems to be an executive luncheon, one man tells another on the phone that workers don't appreciate quality and how nice it is to appreciate money and the things that it can buy such as fine wine. When he is not looking, however, a man at an adjacent table calmly lifts his wallet from his jacket on the back of his chair. Though Andersson's cynicism is at times not very well hidden, You the Living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. It is a cautionary tale that looks at the mess we humans have gotten ourselves into but suggests there is still time to turn it around, if we heed the warning of the poet Goethe that opens the film, "Be pleased then, you the living, in your delightfully warmed bed, before Lethe's ice-cold wave will lick your escaping foot."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...and smash us all to bits!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't see this one coming. Roy Andersson had me pegged out, I am the perfect sucker for a static camera (long live King Borowczyk!) and I was laughing hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the film, he hit me straight between the eyes. You have to be a brilliant man to make self-pity hilarious. Andersson reminds me of the third mate on the Pequod in Moby Dick, Flask, a man who took the whole of life to be a practical joke that the good lord Himself is playing on us. And the web of egotism in this movie is truly hilarious.The level of satire is at fever pitch, you have one deluded self-pitying dreamer harp on about the cruelty of the world and then totally ignore a spiritual self-reflection crying out in agony. The very depths of egotism are plumbed. I really never thought it possible to go further than Bergman's "The Silence" in this respect. However the grotesqueness of the self-love and self-regard, by every single character in this film, is staggering. We are shown an existence where the talentless and the idle rail against a world they believe has been unjust towards them, they truly are legends in their own living rooms. The human beings in this film make self-deception and self-delusion a great artform! Only one woman in the film appears to have any sort of understanding of what is going on. An old woman who refuses to leave a chapel, knelt down praying for the forgiveness of all mankind, her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world I have ever heard. She reveals through her prayers that what is wrong with the world is not to be fixed by mere tinkering, there are not a just a few faults, there is an abyss of corruption that can only be mended by immolation, and judgement day. Watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk, stood waist deep in a cold river at midnight screaming out a thousand Kyrie eleisons for the sins of humanity. Another grand jape is that it is clear that her prayers are futile, and in fact she is stopping everyone going home at closing time.This is not a film for the smug, no-one is spared, no idols are left on the altar, no one group of humans is harangued to the glory of another group. Never has there been a greater more transcendent more astonishingly beautiful summation of our sins. It is a film for the end of the world, it is the grand jest, the great hideous practical joke of human life! From the catalogue of images it is too difficult to pick a favourite, I slapped my thigh and almost fell off my chair in the cinema, screaming with laughter as a man attempted to pull the tablecloth from under a set service. I won't spoil what happens, but the suspense builds up, and something truly unexpected occurs. It is probably the funniest thing I have ever seen in a cinema. I am quite reserved and I just couldn't control myself: that is the measure of the greatness of this film.The shooting of "You, the Living" is impeccably formalist. We are shown the palette of an artist, dingy browns, yellows, greys, and sky blues set alive by the shock of luminous brass textures. There is never a tone out of place, it's like an hour and a half of symphonic Whistlerian colour-meld. The obsession that must have gone into putting that colour scheme in place is extraordinary. And no shot is wasted, as with all great movies, there is not a spare inch of celluloid.Perhaps the best film I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film isn't supposed to be funny, but it made me laugh.It isn't designed to be sad, but my heart felt heavy through a number of the vignettes.It isn't written as action adventure, but my pulse raced more than once.Just like life, this movie doesn't manipulate your emotions and tell you how to feel. It simply is, and you react.If you don't find it funny or sad or moving, I suspect that says more about you than the film.It amazing and refreshing to see a director so wholeheartedly celebrate that we are all human, and embrace that we are all trapped here, doing this "life" thing, over and over for as long as we must.Tomorrow is another day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a wonderful, human film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roy Anderson's film 'You, The Living' comprises a series of fifty-odd sketches, snapshots and vignettes set in a Swedish city. Some characters are on screen for just a few second, whilst others appear in numerous scenes and are sometimes seen loitering in the background while another story unfolds. Many scenes are drawn from the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of the strange but believable characters inhabiting this world. It is a fascinating approach: each of the scenes could be enjoyed in isolation, but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be human.For the first half hour or so, 'You, The Living' is gloriously funny. Much of the humour centres on the members of a brass band, whose music practice infuriates the neighbours in their apartment block. The comic highlight, however, is provided by a dinner-party track gone horribly awry. After this hilarious introduction, however, the mood of the film darkens considerably. The dinner-party dream turns grim when the hapless protagonist is put on trial for his life, setting a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film.In the subsequent scenes, the unhappiness of the cast of characters becomes increasingly apparent. Theirs is a world where people are unable to connect with one another, where talk of dreams, nightmares and fantasies is widespread, but where no person can be comforted, even when others reach out to help them. The despondent woman with the 'nobody loves me' refrain and the young girl with unrequited love for the rock guitarist, Micke, are archetypal characters.The world of 'You, The Living' is also blighted by selfishness. An elderly professor is called away the warmth of a vast banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous money-grubbing son; a thief steals the wallet of a ruthless executive; an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a Muslim barber and receives his comeuppance. In the film's bleakest moment, a woman in church recounts the long list of human sins as her fellow parishioners shuffle out at closing time.And yet, for all dark moments in this film, the shared refrain of 'tomorrow is another day' points to the ability of people to go on living in spite of many miseries. The soundtrack provided by Benny Anderson (of ABBA fame) seems inappropriately jovial at first but makes more and more sense as the film realises this human capacity to persevere.'You, The Living' has an extraordinary visual style. The same washed-out, pale-green colours recur throughout, and there is nary a shadow in sight; this makes the characters appear exceptionally pallid and creates the sensation that human life is being laid bare for examination. Almost every scene is captured in a static camera frame, as if these are photographs being brought to life. The few occasions where the camera does move are all the more extraordinary; the contrast between the life and movement of the great banquet form a startling contrast with the deadness of the cloakroom scene. In the most intense moments of longing and despair, the characters transfix the viewer by directly facing the camera ? they know that they are being examined and have a few moments to pour out their hearts to us, the viewers.This is a wonderful, human film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's an endless fascination about where the film wants to take us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The large bell in a bar intermittently rings for last orders and the inevitable rush to queue forms at the counter ? do we want what we need only when it's too late? Or is the irony of the opening scene's wailing Cassandra a more resonant reflection of our perceptions on individual existence? There's an endless fascination about where writer-director Roy Andersson wants to take us in his fourth feature, "You, The Living". With fifty or so semi-related vignettes strung together by a penchant for tragicomic hyper-reality, its wistful interpretations and symbolic instances of life that bind us all in this great big cosmic Sisyphean struggle. The sheer simplicity of these vignettes act to dramatise the tenuity and immense preciousness of being apart of the symbiotic relationships we have with one another. Andersson might whittle down the complexity of the human condition through harsh and fast cynicism more than he should, but he also reminds us of the inherent, reassuring glory of waking up each morning to a new tomorrow when we're all aware of our own distinct forms of arrested development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better and more complicated than 'songs from the second floor'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor Spoilers will follow.This movie is even more odd and unconventional than "songs from the second floor". There is no main character we follow around. There is no "plot" in the conventional way. There is no emphasis on an happy end. There is no crowdpleasing. In other words Roy Andersson is back with a vengeance. Instead of falling back on convention and fixed formula Roy Andersson concentrates his film around an idea. I will not go into what that idea is, but even if you don't "get it" i promise that you will see the greatest visual depth ever put to film. The majestic scenes from "songs" pale in comparison here. A work of visual splendor.So be kind to your fellow man, because after all "we are the living", and only you and I have the power to change our lives. That is at least what I thought when I saw the final scene in the movie, with the inhumane bomber planes sweeping in over the city in the film to take our lives away. And of course don't forget to see this movie when it gets a limited release near you. This is one of those movies that actually have the power to make you a better person, like de Sica's "Bicycle Thieves". A very warm and humanistic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slice of life unlike any other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't really call Roy Andersson prolific, (6 films in 37 years). Nor can you accuse him of being conventional; he doesn't do 'straight-forward', at least when it comes to narrative. "You, the Living", his first film in seven years, is like a surreal documentary in which a large number of characters are observed doing nothing very much and if that sounds off-putting, let me assure you it isn't. This is a funny, accessible and surprisingly warm-hearted movie, a slice-of-life far removed from that which we normally see on the screen.Of course, 'slice-of-life' is hardly the proper moniker to apply to this movie since most people's lives are unlikely to be anything like this. The incidents on the screen run the gamut from the almost terrifyingly ordinary to the downright wacky and while characters may flit by, sometimes never to be seen again, others to reappear as if anxious for approval, Andersson bestows on them all a kind of benign affection. That, and some rollicking music, ensure the time we spend with them is time well-spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I laughed out loud several times during this film though give it a cursory glance and you would think it was something else altogether. I adore the pace and the way it slowly burns into you as you are presented these gobsmackingly beautiful tableaux. Andersson gives us something else here. Shows us something I had not seen since his last film. He is compositionally exceptional and via his method of fixing the camera and allowing action to take place before us, he opens the door on humanity and we peer into a place that reflects our own lives, our little lives. It is powerful stuff. It is the simplicity with which he allows the events to take place that creates the opposite feeling of complexity. Everything in front of the camera is anything but simple. Andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. I believe most scenes, if not all, are sets built from scratch according to his designs. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. For me it took me to a place and I came out of it having witnessed a world frayed and beautiful, starched and pained, barren and splendid. At once alien and familiar. This film is brilliant and life affirming. I know because I came out smiling feeling wonderful. It has taken him seven years to make this. If he only made this one film he would still be up there with the greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Swedish film is billed as a comedic meditation, but for me it was just too arty, cold and a study from a warped artistic mind. There are apparently 50 ironic vignettes in this film, whereby a mainly muted story made from rolling scenes of uncomfortable nonsense combines visions of bored individuals, with a link to musical instruments. The film could be interpreted as deep, meaningful and different but most will see it for the art for arts sake tripe study of expression that makes art so subjective and personal. Be in the mood, for enlightenment, and see what you can draw from this piece of film.Here, filmmaker Roy Andersson draws the viewer into the world of a woman whose most uplifting moments are always balanced by tragedy, and whose joy is constantly offset by sorrow. This comic tragedy of life manifests itself in a manner that all can surely relate to, it's just whether YOU GET IT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piddling their lives away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No film has captured the essence and opulence of existence like You, the Living a 2007 Swedish film written and directed by Roy Andersson. You, the Living cuts to the core of what it means to be human and the existential dread that plagues society. The characters portrayed are everyday people each with their own caricatured personality trait that makes them identifiable as plagued by some facet of the human condition. The composition of the film is masterfully accomplished with a finesse and style that exemplifies the brilliance of Roy Andersson as a director. Arguably the most prominently apparent theme is that of existentialism. The opening sequence immediately sets the tone of the film with the lamentations of a middle-aged woman who tearfully proclaims that nobody loves her to the dismay of her boyfriend. She rejects his condolences and even shuns the love of her dog. Despite her boyfriend's attempts to console her and assure her that things are not as bad as she believes them to be, she is determined to be miserable. As her boyfriend stalks off she sings a song about how a motorcycle would make her happy to the tune of a swinging jazz band. Her requirement for material possessions in order to be happy is a fundamental flaw that pervades modern society. As the film progresses it introduces a carpenter who is executed for botching a magic trick, a pickpocket who robs a pompous wealthy man, a psychiatrist who has given up on counselling people and now just prescribes pills, a girl who dreams of marrying her rock star idol, and a couple dwelling on an argument throughout the day. The profound discontent of the portrayed people is framed by the juxtaposition of the psychiatrist's monologue. The immense unhappiness exhibited by each of the characters is clearly self-inflicted; they fail to recognize and appreciate everything they have going for them.The sets in the film are bleak and minimalist, almost devoid of colour, in order to draw attention to the lives of the characters. The vast emptiness and geometric simplicity of the scenes is a visualization of the way the discontented characters view their world. Andersson's consideration and removal of all distractions from the core of the piece make the message of the film that much more clear. Furthermore, the stationary camera shots and complete lack of any sort of change in perspective during a scene is nigh unique amongst mainstream films. Consequently, every aspect of every scenes is focused on the characters. The camera work combined with the washed out colours gives the audience the perspective of a third party observer with the exact same outlook on life as the characters portrayed. When combining the cinematographic styling and the lack of any sort of plot to speak of the film takes on a sort of breadth of humanity discourse. Roy Andersson goes a step further than just a discursive portrayal of self-inflicted human suffering. In a brilliant series of cuts Andersson shows each character stop their daily routine of feeling sorry for themselves as they look to the sky. What is a common sign for a search for redemption in American film becomes a dark and poignant scene when the film cuts to a shot from above the wing of a bomber flying over the city. The miserable lives of the characters is symbolically brought to an end illustrating Andersson's resentment of the pitiful and self-absorbed lifestyle that was rampant throughout the film.You, the Living is a masterfully rendered machination of Roy Andersson. His control of the creative process engenders a complete and unified work that at its core thrusts at a single point and never wavers. You, the Living is a film that forces viewers to think about the manner in which they live their lives. The lifestyles portrayed in the film are rejected as unfulfilling and proposes that instead we enjoy and appreciate as the title card suggests "Therefore rejoice, you, the living, in your lovely warm bed, until Lethe's cold wave wets your fleeing foot."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed You, the Living(Du levande), 2007, 90-minute long collection of 50 short vignettes so much that I've re-watched the whole movie as soon as I finished it and I keep coming back to some of my favorite sketches over again. I highly recommend the film to the fans of truly original, defying classification and definitions independent movies that mix in perfect proportion tragedy and comedy while explore the different aspects of modern human existence. In his less than 90 minutes long movie, Swedish director-writer Roy Andersson attempted to look closely at all humankind while not leaving for a moment a rather gloomy rainy Stockholm and its unremarkable, often miserable and complaining, depressed and misunderstood, inhabitants. Their lives can be described as disharmony in the faded gray, green and beige, the palette that Andersson has chosen for the film which creates the atmosphere of quiet desperation and misery. The dreams and reality of the characters substitute each other effortlessly. It seems that three of the greatest filmmakers from the past, Luis Bunuel, Ingmar Bergman and Krzysztof Kieslowski, might have inspired Anderson to make this extraordinary film, because their impact is difficult to deny. With all the existential subjects and non-sentimental outlook, You the Living manages to be very funny, finding humor, poignancy and tenderness in the absurd situations beneath the minimalistic style and remoteness. As always in a movie with great deal of intertwined short stories, some were more memorable than the others. For me, the funniest was the sex scene ?it has to be seen to believe. The best, most memorable, gentlest, the most optimistic in the pessimistic world, perfectly constructed, with the best cinematic surprise and the most beautiful music was a dream sequence told by Anna, the young girl desperately in love with a rock musician Micke Larsson (Eric Bäckman ("Cat Casino", a guitarist for Deathstars). This miniature has become one of my favorite film scenes ever. The choice of music in You the Living is fascinating and adds so much to the film appeal. The best scenes (or are they just my favorite?) are filled with music: Louisiana Brass Band playing Mozart Lullaby which sounded like a marching tune and made me smile. The woman in a bathtub singing beautifully the old Russian folk song Odnozvuchno gremit kolokol'chik /Monotonously Rings the Bell that was popular in many European countries by the different titles. Actually, this short, less than one minute long scene seems one of very few depicting happy people, a singing woman in the bathtub and a man who dresses in the room and sings along with her. When people are happy, they often sing, just for themselves. When they are not happy, they also sing, and there is a hilarious motorcycle song in the beginning of the film performed by one of the funniest characters, a middle aged lady, wannabe biker, and the embodiment of annoyance and nagging. I already mentioned the Anna's dream sequence that I watch every day and can't get enough of. Comparing to faded and for the lack of the better word muted colors, the music is lively, expressive and catchy. This contrast works very well for the film. You The Living is the second film in the reflection on existence trilogy that consists of Songs from the Second Floor (which is on the top of my Netflix queue right now) and A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence which Roy Andersson still works on, and hopefully it will be released in 2013. I am very happy to have discovered and experienced You the Living, truly unique work of the great modern film creator and eagerly look forward to seeing the rest of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy and occasionally very funny continuation of Andersson's typical cinematic approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Advancing on the characteristic approach and satirical thematic concerns of director Roy Andersson's previous film, the excellent Songs from the Second Floor (2000), You, The Living (2007) presents to us yet another vaguely tortured, darkly-comic look into the failures of human existence; with an ironic juxtaposition between the presentation of both content and form that is disarming to say the least. Unlike his previous film, the themes of You, The Living are much less enigmatic and oblique. There is also a greater sense of structure here; and although the whole thing can be interpreted as a prolonged nightmare (or a dream of social dissatisfaction), the ultimate realisation of that final scene - which stresses subtly and a cruel sense of humour - makes the socio-political message of the film much clearer and more relevant than any of Andersson's work since the AIDs related short-feature, Something Has Happened (1987). Again, it can be seen as an extension of the director's background in commercial advertising, with any awareness of even a handful of his often fantastic TV commercials establishing his trademark use of deliberately static tableau, filled with an impeccably rich attention to mise-en-scene, and a genuinely impressive use of bold, comic-timing.This, of course, shouldn't really come as a surprise; throughout his career - stretching as far back as even his second feature film, the critical and financial failure Giliap (1975) - Andersson has used elements of cruel, social-satire to draw on the notion of human fragility, and often in the attempt to mine an almost absurd comedy of errors motif that seemingly grows from routine, everyday-like misadventures, into full-blown comic-tragedies. At its most simplistic, his work could be interpreted as a series of sketches that attempt to parody the seeming futility of everyday existence in such a way as to find humour and hope in even the most despairing of situations. The aesthetic then is to document the harsh-realities of the world in the form of an ironic stylisation - once again capturing despair, loneliness and alienation with all of the designer gloss of an IKEA commercial - with the sly implication that modern consumer society wants us to aspire to the level of middle-aged suicide, alcoholism and tragic desperation being close to genius in its presentation. Nonetheless, there is much more to the film than such a glib description might suggest; with Andersson structuring these scenes in order to show the escalating sense of desperation, selfishness, worthlessness and self-pity of these bemused and befuddled characters, as their shallow hopes and dreams are exposed against a literal, last-minute offering of swift, apocalyptic despair.As ever with Andersson, the design of the film is rich and exquisite from one scene to the next, with the director and his crew going to great lengths to create these locations (including all but one of the exterior shots) on the sound-stages of Andersson's Studio 24. Even though the world of the film is plausible to the point that we forgot the film was even shot in a studio, there still remains a continual off-kilter quality of wily exaggeration that becomes more and more notable as the film progresses. This sense of creative abstraction finally achieves its full potential during an apparent dream-sequence; in which a house moves through the countryside on a railroad track before finally pulling into a local train station to the cheers of the supporting cast. It perfectly captures the bleakly beautiful spirit of the film and the depth of Andersson's imagination as a filmmaker, here at the height of his creative abilities. Once again, we can argue the merits and the meaning of the film as we did with the more obviously downbeat Songs from the Second Floor, seeing it as either a stark, Godardian satire on the nature of consumerism and a comment on how the wheels of everyday existence conspire to grind us into place, or as a work of high-concept design intended to parody the slow grind of everyday existence - and the even greater weaknesses and despair - hidden beneath the already drab facade of day to day life.Unfortunately, many will no doubt see the film as plot less or formless even, and, to an extent, it is. However, there is a real meaning here that is expressed through images that - even in spite of Andersson's ironic detachment and occasional mocking of his own characters and the directions they follow - offer us a number of moments that are emotionally affecting, and indeed, entirely memorable. Regardless of such interpretations - which are ultimately there for the individual to discover and interpret by themselves - the film works as a result of its keen sense of humour - which is continually dark and again reminiscent of the work of Aki Kaurismäki; in particular films like Hamlet Goes Business (1987) and The Man Without a Past (2002) - and of course, Andersson's uniquely defiant and immediately iconic style. As with "Songs" (and indeed, all of Andersson's work over the course of the last twenty-years) the episodic nature of the film can be a strain at first; however, it is worth sticking with, as the more obvious characters soon become apparent and their individual strands of the narrative become compelling in an oddly affecting way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wonderful and Terrible Snipits of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You, the Living (Sweden, 2007) captures every day life's sorrows, joys, and regrets through the world's best medicine, humor. Roy Anderrsson, the director and writer of You, the Living, uses off beat sarcasm similar to that of Monty Python to portray short clips of unglamorous people from all different walks of life. Although many of the characters appear to be in the dumps, the whimsical comments and random actions in the background make for a somewhat lighthearted film.Within You, the Living there is no clear plot line nor do all of the characters have an actual name but they all a story to tell. The film opens with a frumpy middle-aged man snoring and fast asleep on a sofa. In the background you can see that there is a fake skyline out the window, which added a humorous touch on the set. The man suddenly awakes and states: "I just had a nightmare". This first scene set the anticipation for odd and out of place interactions.In addition to the snoring man on the sofa there are several other absurd and rather interesting characters. For example, there's the tuba player that announces he lost his retirement money while having unexciting sex with his wife, the teacher that cries in front her class because her husband called her a hag, the man that gets invited to a dinner party and sent to an electric chair shortly after etc. Collected together these characters create a theme of the common man's life and how dismal yet silly it can be.A way that these strange characters escape their dismal lives and find deeper meaning is through music. Some of the characters are members of a Louisiana music band that plays at rather strange venues. Each individual member of the band is given their own independent life snapshot; showing them practicing their music while having rather boring lives. Though their lives are unexciting they're band is a offbeat and quirky. For example, the band plays upbeat New Orleans music at a funeral, which at first appears inappropriate. That is until a woman accompanying the band sings a song about living in a land without tears or sorrow. The song combined with the place and circumstance added to the nature of the film as I found it comedic, touching and somber.Intertwined with music there is a theme of desiring to be loved and feeling unloved. Anna, a hopeless purple boot-wearing romantic, desires to be with, Micke Larsson, the lead singer and guitarist of a punk rock band. Anxious to see him, she practices telling him that she thinks, "he sounded great" at the show, she wishes he called her, and ultimately that she loves him. None of these words are actually spoken to him, which reveals her desperate nature and desire to be loved by him. Towards the end of the film, Anna describes a dream in which she marries Micke. The dream has Micke and Anna post wedding relaxing in a moving house. The house comes to a standstill in front of a crowd of random people that congratulate them on their marriage. The scene was rather bittersweet because the dream was whimsical and charming but the reality is that Anna will always long for his love.Though all the characters faced quite different hardships one consistency was having random people with blank stares scattered throughout the majority of scenes. Literally almost every scene had a random nurse or bystander in the background that would stare directly at the camera as someone talked. At first I thought the stares were just to add comedic effect but it also brought attention to those in the background. This effect made me wonder who the main subject was of each scene. Additionally, it showed that extras could have an impact on the scene greatly when in a position to stick out.The director, Roy Andersson, used many camera techniques to make the scene comical yet bleak. For example, he used dark colored lens to show the baseness of the plain character's lives. In contrast with these colors he had fake painted skylines that made it hard to take the scene seriously. The majority of Andersson's scenes were used with a tripod and showed the entirety of the scene. This made me feel as though I was an additional bystander observing these people's lives whether it was from across a street, through a door, or against a wall.Overall the film was quite absurd and mildly entertaining in some scenes. I would recommend this film to anyone that like's Monty Python's humor and doesn't need an in depth story line to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You, the Dying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roy Andersson has become known for his deadpan, surrealist, and often-dark humor. You, the living is a great example of that. It deals with the lives of ordinary strange people with no real connections until you look closer and notice the details. For me, that is what makes this movie funny, sad, and artistically impressive. Andersson is known for tending to use unprofessional actors in his film, which add to both the realness of the reality he has created and the offsetting surrealist feel of the film. Thought You, the Living, Andersson has the actors monologue about their lives (often breaking the fourth wall) with whatever grievance or happiness is afflicting them. One woman (in a very famous scene) reflects on a dream she had in which she married her crush. Another woman cries as her class watches because her husband called her a name. The acting is atrocious, but the sets are absolutely incredible, so that there is a strange disconnect between the actors and their surroundings. At the same time, their slightly off looks, pale dead-like faces match the sad, dreary, sterile feeling of the environment they are placed. The humor in this film tends to be completely oblivious to the characters, which is a sad commentary on the reality we find ourselves in. A great example from the film is the very sweet looking man who is practicing his drums. He is alone in a very simple room listening to music while keeping beat with his drum, which has been muffed. Partway through the scene, the door shuts behind him in a seemingly angry way, while the man notices, does not seem bothered and continues to play. Another example is when a man is recalling a dream he had while slowly passing the camera in his car (he is stuck in traffic) The entire dream is emotionless for him until the very end when he has the realization that the electric chair is a terrible invention.Andersson uses steady, long shots to capture this humor. Because of this, he has created a style that is entirely his own with no imitators or followers. This is partly because the shots and construction of the set are so detailed that other directors cannot possibly think of doing it in this way because it is so time (and money) consuming. When the woman talks about marring the guitarist. Andersson built that large set on a functional rail so it could be moved around and leave at the end of the scene. While digitally altering the film may have been more feasible, knowing how much work went into that one scene is incredible and makes watching it again, that much more impressive. In this sense I can really see the artistry in this film, even if I did not particularly enjoy watching it, I can appreciate the effort, time, and thought that went into each scene.For all its humor and incredible artistry, the overall message of the film is rather sad and depressing. Andersson tears about the way we think we fit into this world with his mockery of our feeble attempts to be something special. He even troughs the title in our face with a bit of sarcasm and perhaps contempt, You, the Living. With the sad monotonous way we live our life and pointing out the humiliation of our existence. Though Andersson has been critiqued for his seemingly blaming stance of society, he says he does it with a sad heart, and that his films are not meant to anger, but are done with understanding and sadness.You, the Living is supposed to be the second in a trilogy of films, the first being Songs from the Second Floor. His next and third film for this series is anticipated to come out soon. What I find interesting, is with his great success of his first movie, A Swedish Love Story, he was depressed about being pegged for a certain type of style and refused to make a sequel. After years of work (not with feature films) he has finally been pegged down to a style, but it entirely his own and of his own making. In today's world, even with a relatively new industry like film, that originality and creativity is what I find most impressive; especially with his work in You, the Living.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different World Seen Through Distinctive Eyes: A Modern Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people are happy with a Matt Damon thriller, as well they might be; some folks want a weeper, a well-made tear-jerker like Hachi, which is well and good. Those of us who have lived long enough and seen enough films sometimes crave a new approach, not merely for newness itself, but because the challenge of a new viewpoint, the exposure to a cinema world unlike any other, is often fascinating and fulfilling.In his time, Griffith did created a new vision, as did Fellini, or Bergman, or Bunuel, most of their films not always huge at the box office, but leaving a mark simply because they changed the way people look or thought about things. Roy Andersson does just this, painting an extraordinary world without a conventional plot line, without the usual throbbing soundtrack, without even professional actors--but if you allow yourself an immersion into his strange, lonely world where all those folks suffer miserably like so many other desperate souls, you will experience something in its own way like Chaplin and Keaton, often weirdly hilarious and sometimes terribly sad. Andersson's world is distinctively unusual, sometimes appearing static and monochromatic, often springing briefly to live only to sputter out suddenly, leaving the viewer contemplating what might have just been before being taken into the next field, the next room, the next life. Both distressing and oddly hopeful, experiencing Andersson's You, The Living and it's match, Songs From The Second Floor is unlike any ordinary narrative but vividly memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What prevents you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will learn few things about what cinema (and you) can be until you learn to train and practice your perception against the flux of images, and this means to be the still point from which everything else is viewed to be in motion, letting it be what it is as it makes its journey to reach you.This is comic, at first sight, tragic, about modern alienation, failure, ego, compromise, desperation. People die. Lose their pension fund. Lose love. All for no real reason that we see of so just the way life strikes us most days. A gloom because it's all faced dead-on, simply the pain without story-drama that justifies. The same as his previous film except a little lighter even, with actual songs this time.But if you are still long enough, then what? A woman sings in a funeral about a next world without grief, loss, want. But of course the funeral itself like every other vignette here is not filmed to sadden or crush. There is a distance here from which all this gloom is filmed which is the distance in which whatever real grief, loss, want, we would normally perceive in these lives (say, in a melodrama) evaporates as if absorbed by the dingy walls.The same woman repeats the song a little later but now casually in a bathtub, her husband is putting on a shirt in the background, a window looks out to bright day. There is a routine in what we do, yes. Elsewhere characters measure a carpet, rehearse their bass drum for parade, shake hands for a business meeting. They all look like they haven't had a good day in years, none of them a hero, all of it inglorious. But just what of all this we see isn't a world without grief, loss, want? Characters suffer, or seem to, but do we as we watch? The whole thing was like a breeze of air lifting human pettiness and desperation and showing them to be flimsy curtains that can flutter and let air and light through rather than just hang.Where you put in life to always have a lover or a pension fund? If any of these go, like the guitarist lover the girl searches for, they have been returned. Something lingers in the air, a beautiful dream here of a moving house. And when you are negligent of the 200 year old china that you smash trying to perform an impossible tablecloth trick because it was a boring dinner-party (a hilarious moment in the film), does anything prevent you, if it comes to that, from taking punishment with the same smile as part of only another absurd game?Some poignant satire, but even better, the mind that would fret and despair over suffering is not here, a stoic mind is.A marvelous image encapsulates this worldview, a brass band is rehearsing in an empty room, one of them is standing before huge windows playing his clarinet while outside a storm is heard booming and roaring. We are small, yes, and the outside is vast. But what prevents him from playing his music against the storm? If something does, he will stop then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak at Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been wracking my brain to figure out a good comparison in popular media to Roy Andersson's dark comedy You, the Living or Du Levande (2007). The best parallel I can draw is to Tom Wilson's comic strip Ziggy. If you are familiar with the comic, it revolves around a rather mundane little man, Ziggy, who always winds up being the butt of his own jokes. Luckily, Wilson's comic only appears once a week and is four short newspaper frames at most. You, the Living sadly perseveres for an hour and a half.The film is made up of dozens of vignettes. Some are very brief glimpses while others last uncomfortably too long. Almost every scene is taken in a single shot with a wide angle, with the camera positioned in one spot. Occasionally there are slow zooms, or pans that shift so slowly that the viewer is unsure whether the camera is actually moving or if they are just becoming drowsy from staring so long at an unchanging scene. I have never seen anything filmed like this before, with so few shots and perspectives. Most filmmakers try to engage the audience with diverse composition; this felt more like I was watching a play because of the static angle. It also had a theatrical quality because of the set. I found the set to be very pleasing to the eye. It reminded me a lot of Wes Anderson's films because everything in it seemed very deliberate, like it was in exactly the right place. This contrasted with the subject matter; the majority of characters were disheveled and were going through existential crises. They seemed not to belong to the pristine world of this elaborately constructed set. Many of the vignettes began with a character breaking the fourth wall and addressing the viewer, "Last night I had a dream," and the set successfully created the dreamy quality that many of the characters described. Andersson used colors that were very bright, vibrant shades and vibrant, but they were all washed out shades and seemed to be watered down. The fact that this film took place in contemporary time in an urban setting (an imitation of Stockholm) but all of the scenery was designed also added to the dreamy quality in which you know that you are in a specific place but it is different for some reason than the way you know it in reality.Though it was aesthetically well put together, when it comes down to it, I think this is a film that you'll either love or hate. I happened to hate it. It had aspects of the absurd in which there were scenes that could certainly happen, but they never actually would because they are far out. All of the characters were caricatures whose actions were disgruntling. They found themselves in awkward situations which were laughable and pathetic. It was like Family Guy because it was so stupid that I felt bad laughing, though that is not the strongest comparison because that humor is slapstick, whereas Andersson makes you cringe and chuckle at other people's misery. Usually, what began as humorous lasted half a minute too long, leaving me as a viewer anticipating the next bizarre event, tapping feet hoping to escape the current misery. Andersson admits that he has an expressionist influence, which I saw come through in this piece. The film was not so much plot driven as theme driven. It never focused on one character for too long but would switch between characters whose lives vaguely intersected. If any take away from You, the Living it would be, "when something is bad, it can only get worse." In one of the early scenes, a man is practicing the tuba in his apartment. It cuts to the man in the apartment below, frustrated with the noise bleeding through the ceiling. He bangs a broom against the ceiling to signal the tuba player to stop, but his broom banging ends up knocking down his chandelier. This pretty much sums up the "heads you win, tails I lose" motif. You don't get to really learn any intricacies of the characters. Instead they are all seen as one dimensional and are defined by a certain type of action rather than as multi-faceted. There is no passion for any of them, and ultimately, you don't really care that they are in miserable predicaments because none of them have depth. This is ultimately a very bleak film and even if you find it more amusing than I did, it will likely still leave you disheartened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You, the Living (2007)Mordant. I've never written that word before but it comes to mind here. Let me look it up. Well, it's part of it--corrosive, but also funny as heck. So corrosively funny. This is a dour film, for sure, with so much dry dry dry wit and quirky humor it's impossible not to like it on some level. Filmed in a very spare style, often with a static camera and really balanced, stable compositions, like theater stages, we see a short enactment occur.But that makes it seem ordinary--which it is not. Ordinary life is shown to be frumpy, ironic, delightful, coy, and depressing. And impossible. We, the living, must live, and since we're alive, we may as well take note. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you find yourself laughing and don't know why. Exactly. And the promo material somewhere said it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python, and what they mean is it has the dry, silent, probing look of Ingmar Berman's famous Swedish films, but it has the zany, somehow touching elements of the British comedians. I'd say, definitely, definitely watch at least half an hour of this. There is part of me that thought I was through by then--the rest continues in a similar assemblage of little skits and moments, and they do gradually evolve, but there is no great plot to follow or climax of the usual kind. There are some great moments later, even just the attention to the thunderstorm, which takes us out of the mundane human events nicely. The filming is gorgeous in its classical control, almost like a series of Gregory Crewdson scenes (and outdoing the photographer, actually). And the acting, with all its very ordinary, non-glam folksiness, is right on. A startling, beautiful, odd experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outta the Ordinary Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How best to describe about Roy Andersson's quirky art-house satire about everyday life, titled You, The Living (2007)? To begin with, I had a lot of mixed thoughts seeing this film throughout the entire time because I felt that each episode almost had no real plot and sometimes whether it was humorous or depressing but can be both at the same time. Each episode had different characters dealing with life but also had reprising roles in the next one or so, the main focus was just on these people and as their daily lives unfold in comical or tragic ways so it is easy to tell the whole film is just that. What about the title itself? Perhaps I may never know why it was so called You, The Living. More importantly, the film is well shot &amp; well edited as for its acting by the cast and there are simply no spoilers since each episode doesn't have a real plot (as mentioned) but could take a few multiple viewings after first time seeing it. Frankly, the art &amp; humor of the film do make a good blend for some of today's art-house comedies - ones that is hard to tell yet just simply sit &amp; enjoy. Besides, this marks my first time seeing the works of Andersson as well. Not a bad start, it could need little more understanding the concept when seeing it time to time afterwards.My Rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Andersson's follow up to Songs From The Second Floor in what is supposed to be a loose trilogy, spanning more than a decade and each seven years apart. And it is not dissimilar. Songs was about a bleak and futile beginning of the new millennium, about the past coming back and haunting our characters, about the pervasive sense of disillusionment that converges so brilliantly in the final scene. Here, because Andersson injects more humour into the film, it resembles his many commercials much more than Songs, and becomes a complaint heavy film. There are characters complaining about not being understood, characters complaining about bad haircuts, about neighbours practising loudly with their brass instruments, and sometimes they are valid, sometimes they are not. The backdrop is the same; the same sense of dread at the future, of financial and emotional instability, of life being wasted, but while Songs did not provide a remedy, You, The Living provides a compromise. A whole cast of characters look up from their menial day-to-day tasks, and as a whole squadron of bombers prepares to bombard the city, a warning is heeded. But it is funny first and foremost, and I think this is the major difference from Songs. That had the same city of characters, but each of them seemed to be going through the same life crisis. In You, The Living, Andersson prepares no less than fifty living canvases of different classes, careers and aspirations, and shows all their unique woes and worries, and then lightly laughs at them for this (a psychiatrist has begun to feel the weight of all his patients, and refuses to treat them anymore, or a man bemoans the loss of his retirement funds during sex). The beginning is as telling as ever; a heavyset punk middle-aged woman moans about how no one understands her, how all she wants to do is get away from it all, and then starts to sing in time to a brass tune that pumps up and introduces the opening credits. And here is another difference; Songs was tranquil in its soundtrack, and the weeping of its city took over, but here a Dixieland jazz theme by Benny Andersson seems to creep in and out of scenes (along with a thunderstorm), whether it belongs or not. An example of this would be at the funeral of the CEO; the sudden cut seems to signal the key message, that life can end so suddenly, and therefore it is that much more precious.The film touches upon each of these characters, and explores how they differently deal with grief, or pain, or suffering. It is the same kind of suffering, but it becomes so funny and unique how they retreat to different areas of their imagination. A carpenter spends an eternity narrating in traffic jam a dream whereupon he fails to perform a magic trick, and much like the failed sawing of the volunteer in Songs, it is funny, but moreso in an absurd way, instead of depressive. The comedic timing here milks the failure for all its worth, and then keeps going; the sentencing is done via auction, and look for the the man quickly thumbing through the instruction manual for the electric chair moments before the execution is to be carried out. A hairdresser has been taking a barrage of xenophobic comments over the years, and lashes out, but amends by 'fixing' it, and that becomes a rather pointed comment at the businessman's age. A woman begins a well-meaning prayer about the pervasive problems of society (and I have seen many describe this as the bleakest scene in the film, an electric condemnation), but it quickly descends into a rather ironic and hilarious bit as she begins to pass harshly judgement herself, as the list grows and grows without any attempt to slow down, and as she keeps the church waiting. And we see how various inhabitants react to the incessant and loud practising of the brass band. There are also moments of such starkness that oppose this comedy, and Andersson manages to take such simple and common problems and explore how unique our reactions to them are. He depicts not a marriage couple fighting, because the insults hurled are of course childish and of no real meaning, but the aftermath, split into two separate scenes, where their worries spill into their careers, and others offer their advice. A girl has bumped into her idol singer, before being directed to the wrong address, and turns up instead to the brass band's rehearsal (and here we see subtly how Andersson weaves the stories together). Each scene in You, The Living is a long take, but her daydream is the most vivid of them all. Who hasn't let their imagination run wild into endless idyllic territory? Andersson's construction of this cosy apartment block mounted atop a train becomes so heart-lifting in its symbolism, as the crowd gather and congratulate their marriage. Where will you go, they ask? Does it matter? It is also one of the only times a character directly addresses the camera, and we can feel the young girl's heartbreak through the screen, even for a fantasy so far-fetched. Songs, seven years ago, would have reacted to this with such cynicism and bite that crushes her dreams instantly. But here, she is allowed to be vulnerable, to have a little hope. The characters are self-absorbed, wallowing in pity, and each think their lives are over, but that is the depth in them. That someone could be so petty, or hypocritical, or so lost in imagination. That delightfully warmed bed is sometimes just so, so comfortable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak Film Saved by Comedic Relief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roy Andersson's film, "You, The Living" ("Du Levande in Swedish) covers the broad topic of humanity with vignettes of many different stories of people in Sweden. Andersson shows many sides of human nature, including loneliness, fantasizing about the future, getting stuck on dreams, and forgetting to appreciate what you have while dwelling on what you think is wrong in your life and your relationships. He gets his message across pretty clearly with the various examples of people from different places in age, society, and life in general.The lives of the different characters are not very connected as you see in other Nordic films with the same style, but they do typically meet at least once. The film does not have one plot or even a connection that ties all of the characters together other than short meetings and the connection of humanity. The style used to connect each vignette was similar to that of "Paris, Je T'aime", a French film with a similar concept of showing human nature through short vignettes. Although there is not much connection throughout the film, it still succeeds at generally holding the attention of the viewers and getting a message across. With each scene, we learn a little bit more about what Andersson wants the viewers to take away form the film- enjoy life to the fullest while you can. Each character and story displays an example of how humans tend to take life for granted, whether through daydreaming instead of actually living in the now or through literally taking what is good in life for granted. The characters in the film show how humans can miss out on good things because they are focused on the wrong things, such as money or dreams of the future. The one character that shows an attempt to make her fantasy come real is Anna. We are introduced to her with a full view of what she imagines could happen with the musician at the bar. The difference between her and the rest of the characters we see is that she actually acts on her desires and does not lose sight of the present opportunity due to other distractions.What makes this film unique in the genre of films with many vignettes to get across a single message is Andersson's style. The lighting is natural, but the characters all seem very pale and mundane, like life without the right desires and intentions. On top of having very pale, almost lifeless skin, the characters dress in boring colors such as grey and khaki. The only one who really stands out is Anna and her bright pink boots. It is impossible not to notice Anna's boots right away in Andersson's fictional lifeless world. Her boots are a great example of Andersson's common use of symbolism. Her boots represent her odd ability to go after what she dreams of, unlike the other characters in the film. Furthermore, the music played in the film is used very strategically to enhance many of the actions of the characters. Each song shows some of the quirky characteristics of each character while also emphasizing their own view of the world, whether that be bleak or optimistic. For instance, the song in the opening scene with the woman singing about no one understanding her has a quirky melody, yet demonstrates her focus on the wrong parts of life. Contrastingly, the music played by Anna's new husband at the end of her dream shows a brighter, more beautiful world. The sun comes out and the people gather all because of Anna's willingness to act on her desires and take a risk. The use of color and music in the film to represent life without truly living show Andersson's vision of some of the flaws in humanity. Andersson successfully takes a common theme seen in films and makes it his own with his unique filming style.Andersson's film is a serious take on the flaws of human nature and how to get what will truly make you happy in life while still having some comedic relief. With Andersson's odd sense of humor, you will find yourself laughing at times that you feel you should not be laughing. This comedic aspect of the film makes it much easier to take in the message that Andersson is attempting to get across and, ironically, take him much more seriously. Without the comedy, the film would be very bleak and pessimistic. However, this film is actually easy to take in most of the time and sends a very strong yet honest message. Andersson does a great job of creating a film with an important lesson that is also entertaining to the viewers, which not many directors do successfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Odd Intellectual experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You the Living directed by Roy Andersson seems to be a quirky satire on the life of all human beings. The best words to describe this movie is humorous, quirky, odd, unique. I have never seen a film quite like this in my life. The combination of filming style and segmented story line make this an interesting film for a particular audience. This is definitely not a film for the average audience.This film has a unique way of following various random stories to portray the events of life in a unique way, so much so the movie is almost hard to keep track of. Most of the scenes portray everyday normal events of real life including emotional distress, depression, relationships, shopping for rugs, the troubles of old age, young love, and traffic. There are two particular examples that are particularly enlightening to ways society is a little screwed up. The first illuminates how many people in society can take things way too far and worry about things that don't matter. In this scene a man commits a "crime" that isn't really even a crime and is sentenced to death. The whole court room wants him to die, and for no particular reason. The beautiful part about many of these scenes is that people can interpret them in many different ways, taking similar or different things from them without really being wrong. Another way this seen could be interpreted is as a joke on the justice systems around the world. This man get's sentenced with swift and unanimous action, in the real world justice is never this quick, instead of minutes it can take months even years of slow deliberation. A quote from this trial is, " Gross negligence is the worst crime punishable by death". This quote itself could provide the viewer with many thoughts on its satirical value on society.Scenes like this occur throughout the whole movie and are constantly keeping the viewer's minds on their toes, and active. With these insightful scenes comes a lot of humor. Each scene is intended to provide a laugh to accompany its intellectual purpose. An example of this awkward humor is a scene where a virtually anorexic man is having sex with a large woman. This scene lasts a few awkward minutes of complaining about life on the man's end and interestingly placed moans on the woman's end. This scene again gives the viewer an opportunity to interpret the meaning.Another thing that really makes this film unique is how it is filmed. All but one of the scenes are filmed from a standing still tripod. This is a different way to film a movie but I think it works in this case, especially when you realize how important each detail of the scene is. The importance to the detail and the background is illuminated right from the beginning. There is a scene when a man is having an argument with his wife and in the background you can see characters from a previous scene, one playing a tuba, and another couple trying to make him stop from below. I feel like I could watch this movie ten times over and notice something new each time. The problem is I don't know if I would want to watch it ten times over. On a movie critic level, I'm sure it's loved, on a normal person level, it really isn't all that entertaining.One of the finals theme could be particularly interesting for American's since we do love our celebrities so much. The theme plays on the nonexistence of privacy for people, especially celebrities, and our shear absurd adoration for celebrities. The nonexistence of privacy comes from the moving house that is surrounded by people as soon as it enters the city. The adoration for celebrities and celebrity couples is scene by the no basis love for a good guitar player and the general publics happiness for their love. I think the theme above, as well as many other themes make this film appeal to a wide range of people all over the world not just the Nordic countries. The film addresses aspects of life that can be applied universally to all parts of the world. Overall, this film is odd but intellectual, and can keep the viewer engaged throughout. Those people who like filming and cinematography well also have a lot to enjoy, appreciate, and analyze. Those who don't really like to think while watching a movie and enjoy a little odd humor, can also enjoy this film, but for those who don't like odd humor and don't want to think, just want to be entertained, I would not recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something about us, the living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah yes, Roy Andersson. That humble, down-to-earth guy, famous creator of oodles of award winning commercials with a Scandinavian sense of super dry dead-pan humor peppered with a touch of surrealism and the absurd. He's also undisputed champ of static shots and builder of pitch-perfect studio sets, a director who prefers vignettes over a consistent story to make a picture, and quite an essential (post-)modern film-maker. Located somewhere between Bergman, Fellini, Bu?uel, some say even Monty Python, he draws from all of them in a way, and yet is entirely unique by doing his own thing - filming losers, life, people caught in the clutches of capitalism, haunted by guilt, with death, destruction and the dark cloud of the apocalypse always hanging over life, the universe and everything. "Songs from the Second Floor" (2000) marks part one of his still unfinished trilogy. "Songs" is bleak, depressing, revealing, thought-provoking with dark comedy mixed in it, and, naturally, a must-see."You, the Living" (2007) returns to the same world in a comedic way, sort of. "Sort of" because among other things there's of course that streetcar named "Lethe", the name of one of the rivers of death in ancient Greek myth, and people stream out into their lives from it, zombie-like blocking its path... Fitting to the river of forgetfulness a bartender regularly reminds us again and again: "Last drink!" Other people have little to remember, but dream their lives away, in romantic fashion far removed from reality, feel nightmarish bombers looming or embarrass themselves by trying to impress others, and get the death penalty before they wake up. At least they finally provided entertainment that way, as popcorn is handed out at the electric chair. Between dreams, hopes and impending doom life has to be lived, and it's full with its little quirks, pumped up by Andersson to the point of hilarious grotesqueness however presented realistically. Or the other way round. By marrying these apparent extremes without focusing on a central story in a painterly style we enter a state of mind that helps us to evaluate, appreciate and apprehend the fun way: you know, learn more about those guys addressed by the movie that are just mirrored on screen, supposedly known as "the living". Because we shouldn't be surprised that while we hold our heads high towards heaven our life as we know it will be extinguished at the end. That bombshell of a bummer would be the point when we - as the living - should have figured it all out, or at least have an inkling what all that Dixieland jazz is actually about...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique -- truly one of a kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You the Living" is quite unlike other movies. It is more like a series of quasi-comic sketches, or perhaps even a series of photographs of animated paintings. It opens with a man sleeping, for what seems an eternity. You must relax into the slow pace, that proceeds much the way real life does with long periods of the same thing happening, with what's interesting confined to a tiny dot of the screen, like watching a plane wreck from great distance. It is set in a very bleak, rainy, cold foggy Norway where interiors are painted shades of hospital green, and lit with cold fluorescent light. The actors are nearly all overweight or over 65. Only a tiny handful of the enormous cast could be considered photogenic. Nearly everyone is unreasonably grumpy and seriously depressed. The theme is selfishness results in ordinary cruelties. People create their own misery with their self-absorption. You have to stand back and see the humour or you too could be smothered in the gloom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film restores your faith in film making.The director takes what appears to be simple moments in life and displays them as cinematic voyeurism , principally of ourselves.They say to express something simply in art is one of the hardest things to do however the director gives us a lesson in austerity. The end result is a mirror of our day to day existence and perhaps the banality of it or for the optimists.. the beauty.Some scenes capture moments in life that would pass the observer by without a second thought however when seen on the screen it gives a whole new meaning to existence and the futility of the day day to progress of ordinary lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absurd View on the Repetition of Life and the Dreams We Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I had a dream last night..." This repeated line sets the tone and much of the plot for Roy Andersson's film You, the Living. You, the Living is a film that gives the viewer a few scenes of a number of people's lives and gives them the opportunity to see what the characters had dreamed the night before. These characters live very mundane and repetitive lives and the movie goer is given an opportunity to see into their more fantastical imaginings about what their life could be like. This non-linear story progresses through a series of glimpses into the everyday lives of a number of characters ? some who turn out to be connected to each other and others who do not. The repetition of the music of the 'New Orleans' jazz band and the phrase "I had a dream last night" are the strongest connections that the viewer can make to understand the story. Roy Andersson seems to be taking a study of the everyday realities of human life and the mundane repetition that compromises so much of it. Andersson is able to manipulate these realities by looking into the dreaming minds of his characters, and showing what their dreams from the previous night actually looked like ? playing them out as if they were a part of reality. The audience gets to see everything from a man put to death for breaking antique china ? to a young woman marrying a rock star and the awesome times they have together. These dreams are completely absurd but played out as if they were completely realistic. Overall it is an interesting story that attempts to look at reality and absurdity together.I think that the different dreams that Andersson (and the writers) have chosen for their characters to have and for the audience to see are very interesting and completely opposite of each other in every way. On the one hand we have the dream of broken china and the death penalty. If I were a psychologist I'm sure that I could have a field day with all the dreams in this movie, but the first one seems to have the most blatant symbolism of fear about public performance and a fear of death. I adore how this man is overwhelmed by this feeling that he must be the entertainment at a sad dinner wake and the way that his dream plays out. Andersson is brilliant in the extremely careful setup as he exams the different pieces of china and the different sides of the table cloth ? only to have all his worst fears come true when the china comes flying off with the table cloth. We then move on to the masterfully absurd court scene in which this poor, scared out of his wits gentleman is sentenced to death for his awful crime of destroying antique china.Andersson uses absurdism to point out a lot of the more quirky aspects of our everyday lives that we may just not be paying attention to. He contrasts the daily call for last drinks at the local bar with a young woman's dream of her life as it would be married to a rock star. By using so many extremes in the film Andersson is able to get at the quintessential idea that life can be mundane and repetitious if we allow it to be, but if we dream big dreams and try to pursue bigger things, our lives can be more than just the daily grind we live through every day.While I found this film difficult to follow at times, and slightly confusing in the formatting ? with periods of very little dialogue and seemingly unconnected actions, in a close viewing I really enjoyed the overall message of the film. I found the filming style of Andersson to be very interesting and it is clear that he is a real masterful filmmaker. He was able to connect a group of seemingly unconnected scenes in an interesting and entertaining way. I think that this is the type of film that only gets more compelling and interesting as you view it multiple times. As you continue to understand the connections of the characters and how their dreams fit into the realities that they live you are able to see how compelling the story of everyday life can be especially when you look at the dreams that go with it. Overall I recommend this film if you are willing to dedicate yourself to the multiple viewings it takes to truly appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visual of Life Advice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**This may contain spoilers**Roy Andersson presents viewers with a film of unconventional content. Lacking the traditional plot and list of main characters, You, the Living is a commentary on life's ups, downs, success and struggles as told through 50 some-odd "mini stories". Each scene, while simplistic and short, speaks to a different aspect of human nature. Each scene is simple in part because a single, static camera angle is used. Every scene in You, the Living uses a straight on camera angle. This single camera angle focuses audience's right into the heart of the scene. There is no jerking or nauseating camera movement to be distracted by. The static camera angle also prevents from the audience seeing any close ups of the actors. This makes the whole film seem somewhat distant and makes the characters hard to become emotionally attached to. Furthermore, each scene is adorned with simple props. Only what is necessary to the message of the scene is incorporated. With that said, Andersson also uses the scenery and props in order to bring some continuity to the film. For example, the same amateur band is seen playing in the background during several scenes and the same bar is used as a location. Lastly, almost every scene uses the same, bright, artificial lighting. The lighting has a tendency to wash out the colors and make the film have a uniform, muted color palate. Although You, the Living commentates on many different aspects of life and human nature, there seem to be two major unifying themes in the film. The first one, life goes on, is presented right from the start of the film. Mia, a "miserable wench on a bench" wails that no one understands her. While she lingers on the idea that she was happy yesterday but is not today, the man with her points out that that was yesterday, in the past. His advice to her invokes the importance of being present in our lives here and today. Similarly, later on the film, audiences are prompted to remember that tomorrow is another day and to try and recall good memories when life gets tough. The second unifying theme is to be kind to everyone you met. You never know when someone has been fighting with their loved ones, dealing with complex emotions or just hasn't had anything go right for them that day. Although our interactions with strangers are just a fraction of our days and lives, how we conduct ourselves in the presence of that person can have a huge impact on their day and life. With that said, You, the Living reminds us to live in comradeship with our fellow human beings. What I particularly enjoyed about this film was the little bits of subtle humor mixed in. The messages of each scene are quiet serious and deep but have little elements which make it funny. For example, the large and "biker tough" couple in one of the opening scenes have a tiny, little, fluffy dog which contradicts the "biker tough" image portrayed otherwise. In another scene, when a man is being unjustly punished by death with the electric chair for breaking 200 year old china, the "victims" are watching the execution and enjoying buckets of popcorn. Only a keen and observant eye will pick up on the subtle humor of the popcorn. I believe Andersson was using these sprinklings of humor to portray two ideas to audiences. The first is to really pay attention. By really focusing and paying attention in life you will pick up on so much more and get more enjoyment out of life. Secondly, the little bits of humor remind audiences not to take life too seriously and to find humor in every situation. In all I really enjoyed Roy Andersson's You, the Living. I believe the film would have benefited from cutting out a few scenes in order to shorten it and be able to keep audiences engaged more. By the last 20 minutes of the movie I was getting tired of the individual scenes and somewhat randomness of the film. While I really enjoyed this film, I believe it takes two or three sittings to really get all of messages and ideas Andersson is trying to portray. It takes some time to get used to the randomness of individual scenes and to get a sense of his style and overall themes. If I knew my friend was patient and a critical and reflective thinker than I would definitely recommend this film. I would, though, have to keep in mind the style of the film and the personality of the friend when considering a recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "tragicomic" account of the human experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Be pleased then, you the living, in your delightfully warmed bed, before Lethe's ice-cold wave will lick your escaping foot."This opening quotation by Goethe speaks to director Roy Anderson's quest to expose the human condition of the living through a series of absurd and whimsical vignettes. Although the film lacks an overarching linear narrative, these vignettes all speak to unique human experiences in the at times crazy world that the living occupy. Through the character's bizarre interactions and comedic confessions, You, The Living opens the viewer to see the world and its workings in a novel way. One important theme of the film is the role of onlookers. These scenes explore how we don't realize how entangled we are with the bystanders that frequently surround us. Many of us go on our day-to-day business without considering the experiences of others. For example, there is one scene where daughter is trying to communicate with her mother who is suffering from Alzheimer's, while an unaddressed nursed sits daftly in the background. In a more obvious way, the large depressed woman who humorously wails that nobody understands her blatantly ignores her devoted partner and his tiny dog, who try to care for her. Ignoring the people around us comes to serious detriment to the businessman in the restaurant, when his oblivion allows a man sitting nearby to swipe his wallet out of his pocket whilst the rich man boasts to his friend about his wealth on his cell phone. At other times, the film shows what happens when the world simply ignores us. A man must endure the rain when a crowded bus stop denies him a place to stand, and another must take the stairs. These scenes capture the film's carefully balanced tone between humor and tragedy in its exploration of the world's forgotten or overlooked.Another interesting aspect about the film is that there are several occasions when the actors directly address the camera and audience. This often occurs when characters are describing their dreams to the viewer. The effect is humorous but poignant. For example, during one scene a man caught in traffic leans out the car window, looks into the camera, and begins to describe a dream where he is sentenced to the electric chair for breaking a family's precious china during a magic trick gone wrong. We see the dream played out, then return to the car inching along the screen. Although the content of the dream is certainly absurd and humorous, his story reveals complex emotions and human insecurities. Likewise, when a lovesick girl addresses the viewer and recounts her dream, we get a personal glimpse of her wild but lighthearted passion for guitar player Mikke. In one of the most visually compelling scenes of the film, Mikke plays the guitar in their moving house, while a crowd of supportive fans wish them the best as they continue on life's journey. The girl's recounting of the dream expresses her deep desire to be supported and loved. One criticism of the film is that because there is no real plot development or overarching resolution of conflict, the film does seem to drag on towards the end. Each vignette is entertaining in and of itself, but without a narrative to tie them together some may find the film too long to captivate the viewer's attention throughout the entire length of the film. However, the filmmaker does make several attempts to subtly connect the characters in unexpected ways. Fore example, all of the characters find themselves in a torrential thunderstorm midway through the film, and their shared experience of the dark deluge unites their stories. Likewise, there are some characters who we revisit from time to time throughout the film, notably the lonely Mia, and the lovesick girl who pines over Mikke the guitar player. We also often find ourselves at the seedy bar. The monotony of day-to-day life is explored in the bar, as every day the bartender ceremoniously rings a bell and shouts for the people to come order their last drinks. Although these connections and patters do unite the story as a whole, the film would probably be improved if the director has pared down the vignettes and omitted a few of the scenes to make the story move faster. Although this film is a clear deviation from Hollywood narrative style, the raw human experiences explored through the characters and scenes is a wonderfully comedic cinematic journey through the life of you, the living. It is no surprise that the film has won a host of awards across the globe, and an overall positive international response. The film cover's description of the film as a hybrid of "Bergman meets Monty Python" is not far off base: it adopts the famed Ingmar Bergman style of revealing the deep emotions and underlying psychology of the characters while also using hilarious timing and dialogue to explore these themes. Overall, this "tragicomedy" explores what it means to be a human in a refreshingly enjoyable way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dreamy Reality of the Living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not often that a film combines dream and reality or tragedy and comedy the way that Roy Anderson's film Du Levande, You, the Living, does (Sweden, 2007). The simple title of this film simultaneously calls out to viewers and states the film's subject, "You, the Living." This film is a portrayal of the living, of the dirty, gritty, comically painful parts of life that the living experience. The film is composed of fifty vignettes portraying different aspects of life for different characters all set to the soundtrack of Dixieland jazz music partly adapted from music by ABBA's Benny Andersson. The film has many characters but the starring roles go to Elisabet Helander, Björn Englund, and Jessika Lundberg.To give even a very brief plot summary of this film is a nearly impossible task. To fully understand the plot of this film, explanations of each vignette are necessary. The film has many story lines that rarely intersect, and these intersections are insignificant at best. There is little character development, and only one character's name is mentioned enough to commit to memory. Essentially, each vignette is a portrayal of an ordinary life occurrence that is a little bit quirkier than normal in an attempt to elicit amusement from the audience. To summarize some of the stories, there is a couple whose fights cause them to get into trouble at their work, a groupie hopelessly in love with a guitarists and dreams of their marriage, a self absorbed woman who feels as if nobody understands her and is frustrated when she receives attention from the wrong man, a carpenter who daydreams that he is put to death for breaking china, and the leader of the film's music, a man who plays the sousaphone at funerals. Clearly, the stories do not make for a coherent synopsis.This film is billed as a comedy and in some senses, I would agree with this. However, for me, it was the kind of amusement that I get from hearing about humorous daily trials from my friends and not the kind of comedy that I usually enjoy, comedy that is seated deeply in relationships between developed characters and circumstances beyond the ordinary. And while many of the circumstances seemed beyond the ordinary, such as the man who dreamt that he was given the electric chair for breaking a two hundred year old china set, the ordinary, lighthearted humor seeps its way into every scene, manifested in this specific scene as the electric chair operator reading the manual to figure out how the chair works. The circumstances vary in their commonality, but the thread of humor based in reality is is woven through each vignette.With depicting various life situations that are somewhat standard for the people involved, the out of place Dixieland music in the background made the film interesting, and tied the scenes together. From the first scene to the last, this lighthearted and carefree music colored the mundane backdrop of this film. Another interesting technique that added depth to the film was the choice of filter, which had an unrealistic and dreamlike quality to it, making a shot of an apartment seem more tenuous, more ethereal, less ordinary.Personally, the humor of this film is not something I particularly enjoy but I did appreciate it for many reasons. Like I said before, this film has the incredible ability to combine the difficult messy details of reality with dreamy hopes and fears creating a film that is both amusing and saddening. Something I enjoyed about the film was that I could relate to it. I, along with all "the living," can connect with the funny mundane moments in the film where one can only respond with the phrase "such is life" and the frustrating and troubling places we can get stuck in as a result of these circumstances. The duality of the film, the fine line between reality and dream that this film dances on, is what garners it so much critical acclaim. While I may not appreciate its content, I know this film is artistically skilled and can understand how it has won awards in both the United States and the Nordic Countries, among other places.The director of this film has said that it took three years to get all of the shots together the way he envisioned them. I think that fact speaks to the film as a whole. The complexity that was creating these sets of "ordinary" life mirrors the complexity that is "ordinary" life, in line with what I see as the film's purpose: to depict the difficult intricacy of life, in all its humorous glory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What to do during the long Swedish winter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes the long, dark, teatime of the Swedish soul to make films like this, consisting of fifty short vignettes, each filmed in a single take, and not all relevant to each other. I have no idea what it was about, though some of the vignettes had a memorable quality. The IMDb suggests it is a "film about humankind, its greatness and its baseness, joy and sorrow, its self-confidence and anxiety, its desire to love and be loved." I didn't quite see it that way. A man alone in a room practising on a base drum (to the annoyance of a neighbour below), another man practising a Sousaphone, a crowd of people huddling in a bus shelter in the rain, a bar tender always calling time, a fat and middle-aged couple of Hell's Angels squabbling, a man in a traffic jam relating a dream. Actually, this one had its moments. He dreams he is at a dinner party and the table is loaded with crockery. He tries the old trick of pulling out the tablecloth without success, but revealing the tabletops with embossed swastikas, a reminder of Sweden's ambivalent attitude top Fascism. Accused of damaging property, by a show of hands he is sentenced to the electric chair (a nod I gather to Andy Warhol). Though a dream and nothing happened, it was quite chilling. In another scene a lot of people are sitting down to a formal dinner. They start singing and groups of them stand on their chairs until all are standing. Meanwhile the main speaker is called away to the telephone to deal with an annoying son.The IMDb explained that the song is called "Oh, Alte Burschenherrlichkeit" in German, and is still sung by German fraternities, being a reflection on the old times. YouTube has several examples of the song. The version used in the film refers to the professions people have followed, and it is as these are mentioned that each group stands up.The film ends with a fleet of B-52s flying over (presumably) Stockholm. Very Nordic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's nice to feel alive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You, The Living" is a dark Swedish comedy that paints a picture of Scandinavian life in a way that is similar to that of Edvard Munch and his "Scream" painting. It portrays the melancholiness of life yet shows that through those gloomy life experiences that we are indeed alive, and it is something to celebrate. Director Roy Andersson creates a gallery of moving portraits by mixing together elements of advertisement and feature-length film to create an abstract artistic vision that exposes the hilarity in the melancholy of real-life in the modern world.The story opens with a self-absorbed overweight woman who laments over her life while her boyfriend tries to comfort her. In a world where she has good in her life she lacks acknowledging this by constantly thinking of the bad, and drinks her life away in rebellion. From here any sense of a clear storyline is lost and it becomes a window into the lives of many other characters and their troubles. Andersson directs the film in a way where we bounce back and forth between the lives of these characters in a non-sequential order. There are many other characters in the film that me meet such as a girl who falls in love with a singer from a band, but is giving the wrong directions, on purpose, to the bands' rehearsal. We also meet a tuba player who plays at funerals, and a husband and a wife who allow a recent fight to effect their daily work. Where the film becomes even more engaging is when Andersson allows some of the characters paths to cross in the story and when one persons life indirectly affects another.There is something to be said about the lack of a clear storyline. Without a clear storyline the viewer is left with a sense of unknowing and picks up a sense of chaos. One can argue that this is a reflection on real life. There is no knowing what will happen next in our life and chaos is something that we have learned to celebrate as it brings the unknowing good, or bad, into life. A perfect example of this is love. Everyone in life experiences dreaming of being together with one of their love-interests. We foolishly hold on to the idea that maybe we'll be together with them, but when they reject us we slip into a period of sorrow, yet we still dream that it may one day be a reality. Andersson takes a real-life experience and turns it into laughable-absurdity when we see the young girl in the bar who meets, and falls in love, with the lead singer Micke Larsson, from a band. She fails to get his interest but we keep coming back to her and experience her life through her disappointment in never seeing him again. However, we also witness the young naive attitude she has in thinking that he is the "one" and dreams of marrying him one day.Andersson takes another interesting aspect of life, the influence of ones life on another, directly or indirectly, and portrays it in a laughable, yet believable, way. Sometimes we go through life imagining that we are having the worst day ever, like the business man does when his hair is cut off, but we reflect upon the actual downsides of our life when we experience another persons upsets- such as the CEO who dies in the middle of the meeting that the business man is in attendance with. This shows that while we may feel like we are sometimes the only ones who feels alive through emotion, like Edvard Munch did in "Scream," there are others in pain and it becomes a way of acknowledging that we are not alone in living.The artistic styles used in this film also contribute to the juxtaposition of feeling alone in life, and being alive. Through the use of a static camera Andersson creates a gloomy, highly choreographed situation that seems to disconnect the main actor in the scene from the rest of the people. This becomes a reflection for how we feel alone. This is even more enhanced with the artificial lighting and fake backdrops and props used in some of the scenes to create the feeling that life isn't real. This disconnect reminds me of surrealist artist René Magritte who painted "The Menaced Assassin." In this oil painting Magritte references popular culture while creating a static image filled with drama. The drama, however, is like that in Andersson's film where the characters act in a way that is almost detached from what we encounter in real life. This mundane artistic style can also be seen in some advertisements today, most notably Steven Klein who has done many of the advertisements for designers such as Calvin Klein, Dolce and Gabbana, and Dior, and creates a sense of the hyper-real like Andersson.Roy Andersson's "You, the Living" is, in a nutshell, a creation that detaches us, yet subtly engages us, with real life fantasies or experiences through the over-enhanced, hyper-real imagery of the film. This, coupled with the absurd and laughable real-life situations people experience on a day-to-day basis, show that we are indeed alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is what you make of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that defies simple analysis, You, The Living finds humor and pathos in examining the absurdity of life and the human community. Through 50-some loosely connected vignettes, Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson creates an off-kilter tableau in which disaffected souls search for meaning in the banality of existence. You, The Living has the logic and profundity of a half-remembered dream. Its world is populated with normal, nondescript and long-suffering individuals meant to be reflective of the audience and examine the human condition. Andersson's sly, sardonic view of life is enhanced by his static, carefully staged and beautifully lit scenes which compliment his skewed view of the quotidian. Despite the film's existential and bleak subject matter, Andersson finds humor in this dreary quagmire suggesting that, maybe we (read: humanity) shouldn't take ourselves so seriously.You, The Living does not have a main characters, instead, the protagonist is humanity itself. The film's structure, much like a dream, is fragmented. Throughout the film's myriad vignettes, characters appear and reappear, some are seen only once and, in the same way, some stories are connected and some stand alone. Many characters directly address the viewer and, considering the film's title, Andersson seems to be implying that the people in this world are not so different from us, the audience. Furthermore, for a film called You, The Living, the characters do not seem to be very alive. Most, like the heavyset biker woman who appears on and off throughout the film bemoaning that, "No one understands me," are glum, full of dissatisfaction and longing for understanding and love. In a very Swedish way, Andersson's views humanity as disconnected from one another and fouled by fate, like in a scene in which a disgruntled barber whose wife has left him take his anger out on a businessman by shaving his head before an important meeting. In the end, all these dispirited characters and their emotional baggage are brought together by the film apocalyptic conclusion which suggests that life is one big cosmic joke.Perhaps the most impressive element of You, The Living is Andersson's distinct visual style. Like an inverse Norman Rockwell, Andersson portrays life not as he would like it to be but how he sees it under the surface. His exquisitely staged and composed scenes are done entirely in long shots and recorded from the perspective of a (mostly) stationary camera which portrays the world as a hyperrealist caricature. To borrow a phrase from Paul Schrader's "Notes on Film Noir," the theme (of You, The Living) is in the style. The drab gray-green dioramas that Andersson constructs give the audience a distant and objective view of the people on screen. The Andersson's morose aesthetic world is reflective of his character's pessimistic outlooks. His deep focus cinematography and bleak/unforgiving lighting solicits the audience to take in the frame's mise-en-sc?ne and interpret the scenes as they see fit.Despite the film's bleak subject matter, You, The Living is in fact funny. The film cultivates a tricky tone that swings between comedy and tragedy (though it always errs on the side of comedy). Andersson delights in the humor, pathos and often ridiculousness of humanities problems and dissatisfactions. The comedy ranges from simple sight gags (a man dragging a dog) to slowly built-up scenes (such as when a man tries to do the "tablecloth trick" at a party only to be arrested and executed for breaking the antique china). Much of the humor is derived simply from recognition of how much of our lives we see on screen. By taking a humorous approach to the dreariness of life, Andersson is suggesting that perhaps humanity takes itself a little too seriously. A key scene in this regard is one in which a man is having sex and, while the woman is enjoying it, he is complaining to the audience how he was "screwed" in a business deal, seemingly oblivious to what is happening around him. If we would just take a step back and contemplate the absurd and silly thing we do perhaps we could find a bit of joy and actually live life instead of incessantly complaining about it. You, The Living is a wakeup call to the audience. The film's unique style of story telling and seemingly dreary existential themes may be off-putting to many viewers hoping for a tidy narrative and obvious meanings. Like the best art, You, The Living appeals to our senses and emotions to derive meaning both intended by the creator and personal to us. However, despite the film's complexities one thing is clear; we need to find the moments of bliss in our lives and hang on to them as long as we can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You, the Living artistic and original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Muted colors, mundane and melancholy topics with characters who feel their lives are meaningless are elements of director Roy Andersson's artistic and dark comedy. Andersson directs a film titled, You the Living, a compilation of 50 vignettes, all about the typical emotional struggles of the average person. The film is engaging in a way I have never experienced before. Some parts worked for me and some parts didn't but there is no denying the unique style of Andersson is something not seen everyday.In this dark humor the audience rarely finds themselves laughing out loud. Instead they may find themselves smirking at the irony and pain of daily life. A theme that I found very pervasive is that of depression, melancholy and the mundane. This message is hard to miss. As the movie opens the audience is asked to appreciate their delightfully warm beds before the river Lithe pulls them away. This little bit of satire clearly sends a message that is portrayed throughout the movie. The message, we as individuals don't appreciate our depressing little lives; however, we only have short time on this earth before we forget our lives and death takes us. One way the audience is forced to realize the dinginess of this film is through the way it is shot. Most scenes are one continuous long shot, the camera does not move and often we are at equal level with the characters. Another obvious filming technique is that of filming so all the colors are muted and gray. These filming techniques are also ones that Andersson uses in his famous commercials to create a melancholy feel. Additionally the majority of the characters appear depressed or at least not content with their lives. The second vignette shows a woman smoking on a park bench, yelling at her boyfriend and dog to "get lost" and "scram" because no one understands her struggles. No one understands the way she feels.Another overriding theme and one common to the Nordic are is that of alcohol. In the movie the characters strive for the relief from the mundane, an escape from reality and the freedom from their depressing lives. Their method of escape is alcohol. For the depressed woman in the park alcohol is an escape from her feeling that no one is able to understand her. We see this same woman again in later scene. As the people in the bar went about their business, oblivious to her ranting, she whined about not being understood. In a later vignette this same woman calls her own mother a sadist for serving nonalcoholic beer. Alcohol is clearly of great importance to her and most likely to many others. A great example of this is when the bartender rings his bell and announces last call for drinks, every person in the bar flocks to the counter to order their next fix.Additionally music is an important element of the movie. Though there is not a lot of music used in the background there are many musical elements within the vignettes. One of the initial scenes is a man playing tuba in the living room of his house. The house rocks, things fall over, but he continues to play. An angry neighbor tears a hole in the ceiling and breaks his hanging lamp in attempt to silence the tuba player and the story continues. Later a man plays a drum in his living room. The most elaborate scene in the movie involves a young woman who dreams she falls in love with and marries a rock star, Micke Larsson. Most of the music itself is melancholy and make the lives of the character's seem even more depressing because even music is not enjoyable. The only music that is enjoyed is that of Micke Larsson.Throughout the film each vignette overlaps with another. There is some connection between each of the vignette. Some share characters, for example the man who received the dreadful haircut was later seen at a business meeting. Other vignettes also bleed into each other, a teacher and carpet salesman (husband and wife) get into a fight both proceed to have emotional breakdowns at work. The overlapping serves not only to unify the film but also serves as an example of the connection and ties between the people that walk this earth.One last theme that adds the great majority of interest to the movie is the theme of oddity. All humans are odd creatures. Andersson makes this very clear throughout the film. This element of oddity is something that we can all relate to on some level but Andersson takes it just one step further. My favorite odd scene is that of the man who receives the death penalty for breaking dishes at a family dinner after failing to perform the table cloth trick. Other examples of oddities is the scene with the man and woman having sex, while the woman is wearing a Viking hat.The elements within this movie serve an entertainment and also an artistic purpose. Though not my favorite movie I did enjoy the majority of the film and found myself chuckling. Overall Roy Andersson directed an engaging and interesting film made with meticulous care and planning. Is interest in the artistic side of filming seals the deal and makes for one the most original movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is perfect, Life is strange.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We as humans have a strange attraction to the bizarre. Sweden's Roy Andersson is certainly fondness of the alternative as evidenced by his film "You, The Living." The absence of a coherent narrative and definitive protagonist doesn't make this film any less enjoyable to watch -- indeed, it's both the quality of product and the intrigue of newness that draws the viewer into "You, The Living."As mentioned, Andersson manages to achieve a high quality film despite straying from traditional film norms, not the least of which is found in the film's cinematography. Andersson has a very unique style -- he prefers very long, deliberate shots. With the complete opposite mindset of the MTV style present here in the States, where shots rarely last longer than 2 seconds, Andersson manages to hold your attention for a stunningly prolonged amount of time. Having been conditioned by the rapid pacing of modern TV, I found these elongated shots to be a breath of fresh air in a polluted media. One memorable moment portrays a scene where a man comically and unsuccessfully removes a tablecloth littered with china in a dream sequence, only to be found guilty of negligence and sent to the electric chair. The whole event takes place across roughly 7 minutes of film, yet the purposeful camera-work and emotional connection formed by the audience make the whole series of scenes feel like an eternity. It's that emotional connection that Andersson has mastered in "You, The Living." This poor man, sent to die for a seemingly trivial action (although, the china he broke was over 200 years old), manages to capture the viewer's hearts in a strange but powerful way. This is not the only instance of emotional manipulation: one subplot involves a girl, Anna (played by Jessika Lundberg), following a band member, Micke (played by Eric Bäckman), in pursuit of a satisfying relationship. She confesses her dream to the audience, a somber but fulfilling marriage sequence that ends as abruptly as it started. Andersson uses the still videography and long takes to allow the audience's emotion to wash in. Andersson finds his niche here, driving the film forward with his masterful use of emotional film-making.Emotional manipulation is not the only aspect that pushes the film forward. The absence of a plot should not deter the viewer's expectation of the film -- as another reviewer mentioned, it's our genuine curiosity that keeps us watching. Andersson does a wonderful job of creating images that are just plain visually interesting. The events that transpire within these images are inconsequential on their own, but are often paired with a scene or sequence that put the previous sequence in context. These scenes are connected by the rhythmic and bouncing notes of a tuba as it practices its timing. Simply put, the film rarely makes sense. However, part of the beauty of the whole thing is that the viewer can still understand and appreciate what is transpiring. This appreciative strangeness occurs in one scene where a man attempts to give a woman flowers, but she slams the door shut, crushing the gifts. The man is dejected and cries next to an apartment door, only to be persuaded aside by a postman doing his rounds. We then never see this man again. Like daily life itself, Andersson captures snippets of humanity, but dwells on no particular one. If you want an enjoyable but oddly accurate portrayal of human existence, check out "You, The Living." But be warned -- life can be a bit strange at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Each day is one less to live</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a tragic-comedy that reflects over everyday life. It shows us different people in different settings where each day is one less to live. You, the living is a rather artsy film with Roy Anderssons touch of unique style. Almost every vignette in this film is shoot with a static camera. In three years of making, the film has a consistent perfection picture frame with a direct lightning and cold, diffuse colors. Andersson also uses an amazing depth focus through the film, where you always get to see whats going on in the background. Every frame underlies a poetic style, and he uses a lot of symbolism. The characters are also always pale and strange-looking. You might say they look like zombies walking around in their own world. You, the living gives you characters like the alcoholic lady, Mia, the young girl with pink boots who are in love with a rock band member Micke, the barber who gets his revenge by shaving a mans head, the psychiatrist who says that ''happiness can only be achieved trough kindness'', and a man who is put in the electric chair for ruining a 200-year-old porcelain. Each character tries reach out to one another, but no one ever truly listens. The alcoholic lady, Mia, says: ''No one understands me'', witch is repeated throughout the movie. Andersson uses black humor to underlie the tragic life they live. When I watched the movie for the first time, I laughed a lot, but in the end you really understand that the film could be about anyone. The pale and odd people look like they have the same disease of some kind, where it is ironic that no one understands each other. The simplicity in every shoot makes the characters the most important and gives a reflection on how boring life is. Through showing the characters dreams, desperation and struggles in everyday life you get a glimpse of real humanity. You will also see a lot of similarity in style from his previous film, ''Songs from the second floor''. Andersson dozen't use a ''main stream'' dramaturgy with a straight forward view. Instead we get served a series of 50 vignettes rapped together with no visual plot. We meet peoples dreams and nightmares, only to get a glimpse of the humanity we live in. Andersson shows us a fascination of peoples everyday struggles. You may say this film also shows a critique of the society they are stuck in. A good visual metaphor is placed in the first frame of the film where the character of the literature icon Don Quijote appear. This gives an analogy or a hunch to what this movie is about. Like Don Quijote, the characters is lost, living in a dream and trying to escape their own mind. This is a odd and special film all together, and it reminds us that we are all just humans.You will either cry or laugh of this movie, either way it will move you in a way you haven't experienced before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You, the Living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Be pleased then, you the living, in your delightfully warmed bed, before Lethe's ice-cold wave will lick your escaping foot." This quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe begins You, the Living, the currently latest feature film of the Swedish auteur director Roy Andersson. Considering how easy it would have been for me to go through all four of his full-length films made during his decades-spanning career, I now wonder why I haven't watched any of his work before seeing this one last night. Well, better late than never, they say, and I'm certainly happy that I finally decided to give his work a go because I haven't been this impressed by a movie in a long while.As mentioned, I haven't seen any of Andersson's previous works, so I cannot tell for sure how closely You, the Living resembles them thematically, but judging from what I've heard, his visual and directorial style has not changed dramatically between this and his previous effort Songs from the Second Floor (2000). This type of bleak, grayish cinematography (here provided by Gustav Danielsson) has often been used to convey a feel of suffocating mundanity; in this case the visuals support Andersson's very long takes and nearly complete lack of camera movement that create stylistic connections to the works of, say, Yasujirô Ozu, Michael Haneke and Jaime Rosales. I know many people do not appreciate such slowness and artificiality but personally I have been a fan of static shots for a long time and think that they allow a special opportunity to present certain calmness and meticulous planning that moving cameras and quick cuts do not allow.As for the obligatory plot description, in this case writing one is difficult since the movie consists of partially overlapping vignettes of ordinary life in a Swedish city rather than a straightforward and easily summarizable story. To me the most remarkable characters include at least a lonely girl named Anna (Jessika Lundberg) who briefly meets her favourite rock star Micke (Eric Bäckman) in a bar and spends the rest of the movie futilely searching for him. Also worth mentioning are a self-pitying woman named Mia (Elisabeth Helander) and a carpenter (Leif Larsson) who recounts one of his terrifying nightmares that we get to witness in an illustrated form along with several other dreams by other characters. These are not the only people we follow during the film but they are the ones I felt closest to, especially Anna, so I will leave the rest of the people to be discovered by new audiences themselves.The tone of the scenes can be best described as tragicomic; not often does one see such seamless unity of tragedy and comedy within one movie or scene. Awkward silences, wide shots of people who never get too close to each other... there is something very characteristically Nordic about these little snippets of life. Take for example the carpenter's Kafkaesque nightmare that starts tingling in anticipation and advances via laugh-out loud comedy to alienated absurd tragedy all within minutes ? masterful handling of the audience's emotions! Another highlight and perhaps the most touching part of the whole film is Anna's dream which she presents straight to the camera. The beautiful guitar notes, the rising music and the cheering crowd outside create a wonderfully beautiful image which is only elated by the fact that we already know it is just a dream.Dreams in general are a major motif in the film; it both starts and ends with one, blurring the borders of bleak reality and mysterious dream logic. Perhaps not surprisingly, the nature of death (and inevitably life) also comes to mind when thinking of important themes examined by the film. We witness a character's unexpected death and the aforementioned Goethe quote has already set the mood rather dark right from the beginning (the quote also ties in with the train scene; note how its destination is marked as Lethe, a river in the Hades of Ancient Greek mythology). Returning closer to regular life, problems in communication are a repeated theme as well. Characters constantly misunderstand, fail to hear or just ignore each other as if they are all blind to the inner similarities between them. An obvious example is the scene where Mia rejects the flowers given to her by a strange man. To some his subsequent reaction could easily come across as heavy-handed and overdone but I think it is a powerful little moment that stands out among many other strong scenes. The scene with the frustrated psychiatrist in particular feels like Andersson talking directly to us by breaking the fourth wall: "Live, don't lament!"Andersson's use of a traditional hymn, upbeat Dixieland jazz and military marches throughout the film, sometimes lingering softly in the background, sometimes overtly dominating the mood, can often be seen as lightening up the tone but also making everything appear utterly laughable in a way, once again harking back to the excellent sense of tragicomedy that the director utilizes in the film. The jazz score is probably most notably used at the very ending which I would rather not give away, as ambiguous as it is. The final shot truly elevates the story to yet another level: will this be the end for everything? Is it all a collective dream? I am not sure, but I cannot think of a better ending for the movie.After witnessing such a withdrawn whirlwind of comedy, tragedy, the mundane and the otherworldly, ordinary movies just feel so... ordinary. More knowledgeable audiences may find it plausible to criticize Andersson for excessive repetition or not developing his style actively enough between films (I wouldn't know, having seen only this one) but since I am just trying to capture my own first reaction here, I can only praise this work of art: You, the Living is a wonderful tale of humanity and should be immediately seen by anyone looking for both emotional and entertaining cinematic experiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One critic describes Andersson's recent films as 'Ingmar Bergman meets Monty Python', and that's about right. Once again, a surreal series of vignettes, almost all shot in beautifully composed single long take. Some are howlingly funny, a few quite heartbreaking. A few are less interesting. And while there's no obvious story, like a Laurie Anderson concert it all adds up to a bigger whole, a satire on modern society, our values, our nightmares. And Andersson's use of washed out color to create a creepy cold modern world is unlike anybody else's. While his terrific 'Songs From the Second Floor' got a little more attention, I found this even more cohesive, funny, sad, and visually amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every so often, you watch a film so strikingly different from anything else you have seen recently it can be quite a challenge to decipher your own reaction to it. YOU, THE LIVING, the most recent feature-length work by Roy Andersson, is one such film.A multitude of individuals all loosely connected in some fashion, jumping between scenes in their lives - some tragic, many incredibly comedic - are the subject of YOU, THE LIVING. Incredibly funny in places, the tone of the humour varies across the film, from the simple humour of a man in a zimmer frame dragging his dog along behind him to the more absurdist. Chief among them a builder's dream where he is sentenced to death, by judges drinking steins of beer, for destroying valuable antique china in a predictably ill-fated attempt at the old trick of pulling the table-cloth from under a huge dining table. Despite the differing lives portrayed, all are part of the distinctly framed world that they inhabit.'Framed' is really the right word here. Andersson's camera is static, shots are immaculately set and none of the individuals receive close ups or anything more intimate than the medium range shots which comprise most of the film. The indescribably drab sets almost bathe in a greenish-blue hue, as if reflecting the misery and zombie-like appearance of those under its harsh glow.The straight-faced, deadpan humour of YOU, THE LIVING is really quite distinctive. An excellent film definitely not mistaken for any other. 5 out of 5Cambridge Film Festival Daily</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roy Anderssons "Du Levande" is not totally original as it is counter piece to Anderssons previous movie "S?nger fr?n andra v?ningen". Still the movie has aura of total originality. Some conventions of movie making are still thrown away: most of the actors look nothing like what you would expect in movie and the shots take long time. Most of the time camera doesn't move but people move around it. The shots start from somewhere and many times the scenery builds up in amazing proportions. W.G. Sebald comes to mind in literature with same technique. Because of the time invested in every shot the suspension is really high in many of the scenes. There is a story and isn't - it is left for viewer to build up in his or her own mind. This movie is positive. It is determined not to see this all in negative way and at the same time will not pass the social injustices. One of the messages I got from it was that maybe all failures and accidents are not fatal after all. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can such brutal sadness be made so damn funny?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an antidote for all of those that inevitably move toward a predictable conclusion. You never know where it is going. Through a sequence of vignettes it takes on some heavy subjects. Among others: the arbitrariness of the justice system, capital punishment, psychiatry, alienation, the pettiness of human behavior, greed, class, drug abuse, racism, and the collaboration with the Nazis that is buried in Sweden's past. The overriding theme seems to be how casually people disregard the feelings of others.How can such serious topics be treated in a manner that provokes anything but despondency? Take the capital punishment scene as one example. The starkness of the scene is horrifying, but the satire that has the onlookers viewing the proceedings as a show, while they eat their popcorn, is so biting that you don't have much choice but to laugh. This film reminds me of "Dr. Stangelove" in that respect. The absurdity of human behavior, both at the personal and societal level, is so finely drawn by way of exaggeration as to make it laughable. The music, most often upbeat, also tempers the mood. The opening quote of Goethe's, "Be pleased then in your delightfully warmed bed, before Lethe's ice-cold wave will lick your escaping foot," sets an ironic tone--most of the people in this movie do not come close to having a delightfully warmed bed that pleases them, even though Lethe's ice-cold wave is closing in on them. Their solitary unhappiness is to a great extent self-generated, but is also the result of a society that has let them down, where life is so grim that for many drug abuse is the only way to deal with it. Rather than being appreciated as precious, each day is simply to be endured. The viewer is encouraged to ask how we have come to such a place where so many people are in such a situation?If you like the paintings of Edwin Hopper, you will probably like this movie. It's what I would imagine Hopper would have come up with if he were to have directed a movie--it's a feature-length riff on "Nighthawks."The DVD contains interesting commentary by the director as well as how the sets were constructed and how some of the scenes were filmed.This unique gem is film-making at its finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is Short, So Start Living It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You, The Living (Du Levande) is a film compiled of a series of vignettes directed by Swedish film maker, Roy Andersson. The stories address human nature ? the propensity to see what is wrong instead of what is good; the inclination to egoism and self-obsession; the tendency to dwell on dreams and fantasies, rather than living a life based in reality. It begins with the following quotation, belonging to the poet, Goethe, according to Wikipedia's article regarding the film: 'Therefore rejoice, you, the living, in your lovely warm bed, until Lethe's cold wave wets your fleeing foot" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You,_the_Living). Lethe (again, according to Wikipedia), is one of the five rivers in Hades and is the "river of unmindfulness" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe). The poem, and, consequently, the message of the film is that one should enjoy life while they're living, because death is sure to come.The stories Andersson tells are interesting. The characters are distinct. The dialogues and monologues are pithy and poetic. Most scenes are shot in natural light ? if it can be called light; the setting is Sweden over a period of perhaps one week, when there is persistent cloud cover only interrupted by a raging storm. The literal darkness of the film is reflected in the attitudes the characters possess and the humorous situations that emerge. The humor is sharp and funereal as one would expect. The sets themselves are bleak, dingy, and gray, as is the clothing ? with the one exception of the fuchsia boots worn by Anna, the one character who does attempt to seize opportunity and make her dreams a reality. Only when the sun finally emerges do we see color. The pervasive solemnity is juxtaposed with the happy sounds produced by the "Louisiana Brass Band." The points Andersson tries to make are clear, perhaps too clear. Our society values property over human life; taking business too seriously can quite literally kill you; it's pointless to waste your time and energy in a career that brings you unhappiness; feelings of isolation can obviously not be solved by pushing people away and drowning your sadness in alcohol; it's important to take time to make music. These points are all nicely illustrated. These stories, however, don't have the poignancy, the emotional impact I believe Andersson attempted to create and I had hoped to experience. Or, perhaps, that was not his intention. Because the stories are short stories, we spend too little time with the characters to become emotionally attached; their sadness, their self-pity, their complaints seem annoying, and the characters are largely unsympathetic as a result. This might have been Andersson's portrayal of how those outside us perceive our internal struggles.As I stated earlier, Andersson's film attempts to convey certain lessons. The preach-y undertones make this film at times difficult to enjoy; does anyone enjoy being told how to live? I think this is most clearly illustrated by the man who describes his dream of a family gathering with complete strangers; attempting to lighten the mood of the cantankerous bunch, he tries the tablecloth trick, which ends in a total disaster. The dishes fall onto the floor with the cloth, and on the surface of the long table are two designs, which I perceived to be the symbol of the Nazi Party. He is taken to court, where he is indicted for the gross neglect of property. One member of the party which he attended repeatedly berates him for having broken a casserole dish that had belonged to her great, great-grandmother. The suggested sentence is either life in prison or death. So there are three lessons packed into one scene: as a culture, we sweep our ugliness under the rug; we value tradition and glorify the past too greatly; we value possessions over people. The way in which these ideas are translated to the screen is imaginative and certainly comedic, but the intention to edify is very obvious and sometimes distracting.The characters are not entirely developed. We know little of their history and a lot about their sorrows. This is not conducive to a sympathetic movie audience. I often found myself waiting for one character or another to stop speaking because it was simply to irritating to listen. I wish the director had dedicated more time to establishing character plots and personalities.On the whole, I would not enthusiastically recommend this film. The script was good, the music excellent, the stories were mostly interesting. I developed very little attachment or sympathy for the characters; the setting was oppressive; and I don't tend to like movies that try to persuade me. If you like dark humor with sermonic undertones, this film is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking the road traveled by all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you ever feel like you are completely alone or that no one else could possibly understand the way you are feeling? While I would venture to guess that almost everyone has felt this way at some point in their life, viewing You, The Living, by Roy Andersson (2007) is a valuable experience, even if you haven't experienced feelings of loneliness and solidarity. This film presents the intimate moments of several different people's lives. Through several small anecdotes viewers are invited to watch people as they experience the joy and daily struggles that are all a part of the human experience. The anecdotes illustrate a variety of experiences, but all of them present the idea of longing; a longing to feel understood, a longing to connect with others in a meaningful way, a longing to do something important/valuable within one's life, etc. However, many of the characters' wishes and hopes for the future seem silly. For example, the young woman who has a crush on Micke Larsson (Eric Bäckman) believes that if only she could be with him, then everything in her life would be alright. Similarly, the woman in the opening scene wants a motorcycle to leave town with the belief that her problems will stay behind. The characters' ideas and visions for the future are unrealistic because there are no simple answers or "fixes" to being happy and living in the moment. Andersson explores difficult questions through this film; Do we matter to anyone? Would people notice if we just disappeared? What is the meaning of living in the moment and being alive? Through oddball characters and over-the-top scenarios, viewers are presented with a dark but comedic look on life. Sometimes it feels as though everything in the world is backwards in relation to what we expect or perceive during certain situations. This feeling is reflected and explored through the multitude of small sketches that make up the film. Take the psychiatrist sketch for example. He prescribes tons of pills to his patients claiming that he is too tired to help people become happy through therapy. Since this scenario presents a situation we might not expect, or something that goes against the norms of society, we are forced to think critically and question the meaning of what we are seeing. The viewers takes viewers on a whirlwind adventure of musical entertainment. Several genres are represented, and an interactive approach is taken to incorporating sounds to the film. The opening is characterized by grand, sweeping orchestral music. Micke Larsson's character adds a large element to the film by the inclusion of rock music. An unusually popular genre for Sweden, the inclusion of this sketch is also supported by the two characters in the opening of the film who also portray a "hardcore" vibe. Another interesting aspect to the sounds/music in the film is the interactive approach that is taken. In several of the smaller stories background music is playing and characters begin to play an instrument or speak in rhythm, adding a supplement to the background track. This is evident in the scene where the man begins to play the sousaphone in his kitchen, as well as when another man participates in the funeral band. This film is one of the latest film of Swedish director Roy Andersson, and is one of only five feature films that he has directed. Andersson's career has been directed mostly towards commercials as well as a few short films. While You the Living certainly has overarching themes, the film is broken up somewhat into the individual stories of several characters. These stories come together to emphasis the often comedic tragedies of life, and while they might be less effective at communicating this point as an isolated incident the story of each character could be viewed on it's own. This could be link to Andersson's experience of working in shorts and commercials is apparent; he is comfortable conveying a large message or point in a more condensed period of time. This film is certainly successful in pushing me to question what I was viewing. However, I will also say that I found this film to be confusing. The multiple story lines, while reflective of the chaotic nature of life, were sometimes difficult to piece together. I can certainly respect the themes of interconnectedness and the universal human experience that Andersson explored throughout this film, but I do feel that through the seemingly random collection of anecdotes this message may be confusing or difficult to see. But if you are looking for an artsy film to analyze or just something out of the ordinary, then I would definitely recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Humor, I think I get it....but do I want to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder if I enjoyed this film in spite of itself? The message seems bleak even by Nordic standards. Love is repeatedly unrequited, people feel sorry for themselves directly as in the woman who launches the film, or indirectly like the woman visiting her grandmother in the nursing home.Dreams taunt or haunt the dreamers. Dreams do seem to merit the longer scenes in this panorama parade. The guy stuck in life/traffic recounting his death by dinner party dream, young Anna and her rock and roll fantasy. Granted the apartment on wheels was nicely done, showing how she wants to move on...and gradually drawing your attention to the window, where eventually adoring strangers throng.Music might be the most beautiful thing that men or women can create in this film, often at the displeasure of their spouses or neighbors. Nature, or specifically the weather, garners more respect than anything else. The powerful declarations when the thunder spoke, and then towards the end, the sort of beatific visions of people looking away from not just their friends and family, but from themselves to the clouds in the sky.Or is it to the planes. And are they bombers? Poking fun at bureaucracy worked well. Something about the barber scene was very enjoyable. The psychiatrist's confession also resonated with my more abject attitudes. The scene in the rich man's restaurant is likely to be a fan favorite.There's probably more going on than I pulled out of viewing this over a couple of nights between my own (pathetic) living. Stark and spare walls in all scenes make things seem even emptier than they are. But when Don Quixote appears on a wall, and bus is headed to/from Lethe, these are surely more than mere signs.Not sure, but I wonder if in America if Coen Brothers' fans might like the sort of treatment of the less than photogenic people going about their small lives. Plenty of drab and flab on dismal display.Is this a film for We, the Dead to laugh at You, The Living? Or just a mirror...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkly comic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film consists of a series of vignettes with one common theme; that fact that the protagonists have life harder than everyone else. It's very interesting and very darkly humorous in places. It's one of those films I would like to watch again at some point because I'm sure I'd get much more out of it a second time around. There are many and varied characters including a woman who just wants everyone to 'go away' because nobody understands her? but will probably be round later for tea. A girl who is a fan of a guitarist in a rock band; she is depressed because she wants to marry him, but she can't see how that could happen. A depressed psychiatrist who has given up and just prescribes pills now. There are many more and they all seem interconnected. The music was very interesting; mostly traditional or rag-time jazz but with a little bit of rock thrown in every now and again. All the performances were excellent throughout and I love the, almost comic book, look and feel of the film. I have to admit I probably enjoyed this one a tad more than my score might suggest. Definitely one that will get a second viewing sometime.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 6.4/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Troll more than droll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is troll more than droll. We pass from droll Tati to revisiting troll Ibsen in the seams. Keaton deadpan to elaborate, but ultimately inhuman Tati, we have at last a film where humanity is revisited in a tender, political absurdity."Tomorrow is another day" is shorthand for a jazzy appreciation for what comes obliquely, voiding the gone with the wind theme the film evokes. Boozy, absinthe, ashen backgrounds are so evocative in the film, that, apart from partaking in the trollishness, demonstrate the tender absurdity, and the ultimate logic of the two dreams that are some kind of axis in the film.First, we have a worker (as the cement machine exemplifies) narrating to us the viewers his dream of being sent to electrocution after playing the tablecloth game during a dinner, that is pulling the tablecloth under some important china. But look what appears: some swastika marquetry on the table; this is a sublime instance of shorthand for political and historical commentary, not pushing and not pulling.The other dream has a marriage on a locomotive - what a dear example of Freudian phallic thrust as always a train in a film exemplifies - only now married to a guitar and a celebration from the onlookers to the public.What these two instances offer is a re-visitation of the Brechtian effrontery towards the public with trollishness, regret, beauty, class conscience in a watermarked but oh so potent tone, all in the direct but under-marked theme of dream which can bring melancholy and a pervasive sense of reality when back to awakeness.Awakeness? The film has this deadpan particularity as if commenting among other things on the poker-faced practicality if not malfunctioning of our lives. It takes Brecht who asks the public with class and narrative punch and turns it into singsong exposing the undercurrent underdog rhythm of ashen vistas or unexplained vast perspective in nutshell interiors with Judy and Punch panache. The surroundings are inhumane in their more-than-personified manner, so when the aircrafts occur we feel what was exposed in the beginning: someone licks our hasty heels in and out of this world, in bouncy, aligned, unexplained and ordained awaking as the first shot with the Don Quixote (Daumier) print exemplifies. The urban locomotive bounces unseen. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingmar Bergman?with zombies! (Not a good thing!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am glad to see some dissenting views from the general acclaim. I give this a 6 because it's clear from his commentary on the DVD that the director has lofty goals, and no doubt a distinctive style. But ? this film makes Jim Jarmusch's movies seem miraculously fun! If I must have a diet of minimalist cinema now and then to keep me from ODing on over- produced H'wood claptrap, give me something that's more meaningful and beautiful. And all that hideous Louisiana Jazz Band music! In this context it has about as much "life-affirming" quality as a Benny Hill loop played about a 100 times.Yes, there are some lovely moments, most notably the wedding dream that nearly ends the film. (Too bad it didn't, but it can't, can it? We have to follow it up with some more darkly "humorous" vignettes, and the Kubrickian final sequence of airplane bombers coming over the city. Huh? This is meant to be menacing, but it seems more ham-fisted and silly, whereas the plane flights in Dr. Strangelove were both bone-chilling and beautiful.) In his commentary, Andersson says he never could identify with the characters in Bergman's films, because they were all "professors, doctors," etc. In the first place, this is simply false. In THE SEVENTH SEAL, for example, and SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT, and many other Bergman films, characters of many social strata are represented. In the second place, if one wants to make films about "common" people (a very patronizing and smug way of looking at the world), at least make them intelligent and full of changing moods. Otherwise it seems like you despise the people your movie is supposed to be about and addressed to.It's really a movie about zombies, but no one ever bites or gets bitten. The horror ? The horror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique Portrayal of Humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his fourth and most recent feature film, director Roy Andersson examines the mundanity of human existence, making use of an incredibly distinct filming style. This dark comedy highlights the egocentric nature of mankind as well as the struggle to find happiness in life. Unique to "You, The Living" is its general lack of a plot and character development. The film introduces a number of individuals, depicting rather ordinary aspects of their life in long, artful shots. These fifty vignettes have only minor links to previous scenes and lack a persistent storyline. But without a plot, the focus of the film turns toward the nuances in the lives of the characters. Accompanying the film's absence of plot is the lack of prominent protagonists. The roles of some characters, however, are emphasized through both the appearance in multiple shots, as well as the importance their dialogue or interaction within the scene. These characters include a self-pitying, overweight woman (Elisabeth Helander), a carpenter (Leif Larsson) who dreams of his own unusual crime, trial, and execution, a worn down psychiatrist (H?kan Angser), a business man (Olle Olson) who receives a botched haircut before an important meeting, and a young woman (Jessika Lundberg) who dreams of marrying a famous musician, Micke Larsson, after meeting him in a bar. The stylistic elements of "You, The Living" are prominent strengths of the film. Roy Andersson creates a distinct film aesthetic through the use of multiple cinematic techniques. The use of a stationary camera in nearly all of the shots is one of the most apparent techniques. Each shot is tediously composed to capture all elements of the scene. In addition, the use of only fifty scenes makes it necessary for each take to be relatively long. Long takes from a fixed camera position emphasize the individual characters and their interactions within the scene. Andersson also uses very subdued color tones and contrast in each of his scenes as well as lighting that eliminates shadows. The result is a very surreal tone and, when combined with the detailed and stationary composition, a scene that is very much an individual work of art. Along with these cinematic techniques, music plays an interesting role in this film. Music is used both diegetically and non-diegetically. Micke Larsson's guitar solo, an example of the use of diegetic music, is in the style of a rock ballad. But the film also uses dixieland jazz, a rather uncharacteristic style for both the melancholic tone of the film and Nordic film in general. Through its portrayal of mundane human existence, "You, The Living" highlights the self- centered nature of humanity. Mia, who is introduced early in the film, strongly exemplifies this theme of egotism. Each of her scenes is accompanied by verbal self-pity. Mia rejects any attempt to improve her well-being, yet maintains that no one can understand her. Her distinct sense of self-importance is contrasted with her partner, portrayed as a rational individual. While his suggestion early in the film has little to do with the theme of egotism, it communicates a much broader message of the film; "You have to do your best in life. Or At least try." Another prominent example of mankind's egotism is seen through the business man who receives a butchered haircut. The man's self-importance is reflected in his bitter and racist attitude toward the barber. This bitterness, derived from the man's egotism, is attacked with a swift and humorous thrust of the razor, a not-so-subtle commentary on the egocentric nature of mankind. In addition to highlighting humanity's self-centered tendencies, "You, The Living" examines the struggle to find happiness. After meeting Micke Larsson in a bar, a young woman, Anna, desires to see him again and even dreams they get married. Throughout the film, Anna searches for Micke Larsson and the happiness he has come to represent. But Anna is left only with her dream, providing a seemingly real experience, but ultimately, artificial happiness. The psychiatrist's monologue provides a direct portrayal of the nature of finding happiness. He notes that people demand to be happy, while being egocentric, selfish, and ungenerous. The psychiatrist knows therapy cannot make a mean person happy so he simply prescribes pills. This scene and message is very honest in its delivery. The notion of finding happiness as a process without a quick-fix is an important one in this film, which points back to the character of Mia. In all of her self-pitying misery, Mia identifies an easy solution to her joyless life: "If only I had a motorcycle." Unique to this film is the utter lack of happiness, despite the inclusion of elements commonly associated with happiness. Even considering his apparent success, the businessman is unhappy. Marriage bonds a number of couples in the film, yet they are unhappy. Even Anna, a character in love, is unhappy. This sense of melancholy present throughout the film suggests mere existence is not enough to provide true happiness.In all, "You, The Living" is an incredibly unique film, both in terms of cinematic style and the portrayal of humanity. The muted color-scape, dark humor, and emphasis on the mundane aspects of life are distinct Nordic expressions, but the film's depiction of life and mankind are universal. A film that simply examines the lives of ordinary people is one that will leave a lasting impression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an interesting yet slow paced film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>YOU THE LIVING, is a strange film about the human condition, its faults, flaws and triumphs, what little they may be. Rather than a straight forward film, its a series of vignettes, detailing different characters, there situations and problems. Some of these characters meet up, or pass each other, some don't, and we also drift between dream world, fantasy and reality throughout. Funny at times, complicated and intriguing, the film can be frustratingly slow, and annoying, though there are certain scenes that are well made, brilliantly set up and timed, and with a dark streak of humour throughout, that borders on a cross Beckett and the British comedy THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN. One thing I did like about the film is its look, Andersson uses static camera shots throughout, with a subdued and bleak look in the set designs and cinematography, that add to the overall feel of the film, in its look on the drabness and blandness of life. An interesting and simultaneously frustrating film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Human Emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an exquisite exploration of the human condition. What makes us human and holds us all together is sometimes more important than the surrounding events that are taking place. This is the main premise for You, the Living, as we enter a peculiar world filled with grief, loneliness, and sadness. The film is set up as a staged performance. The camera rarely moves and the subjects are almost always sitting completely still and simply narrating or doing some other seemingly out of place action. When I first watched this movie, the first few scenes were something that I had never experienced before in my movie going past. I tried to figure out the genre of the film, but as more and more scenes went by the purpose of the scene construction became more and more clear. We enter into a dream like state. Everything in the movie when picked apart individually seems to be rather normal. But we still get a sense that there is just something off about the whole film. The timing is a bit awkward. People's interactions with one another are just a bit off. People's actions are out of place. What then can we say is the driving force behind the movie? There isn't a central plot to hold on to; we skip around to different characters that all end up in some way having interactions with each other. This strengthens the sense of dreaminess about the film as frequently you might have several seemingly disconnected dreams in a night but there is one thing that ties them all together. The construction of this film, when viewed in this way is extraordinary. You need the whole film to know what is going on. The film plot and story are not being acted out by actors, but rather the editing and the scenes themselves. You can look at just about any scene individually and write the movie off as almost being completely insane. A long shot of a man playing a tuba? A long hall with people standing on chairs and singing? People shopping for carpet to only have the clerk break down and pour out his heart about his marriage? These are all things weave together to address what we all feel as people. What we dream about, good, bad, rewarding is captured by this film. For example, we have a middle eastern barber who shaves the head of an arrogant customer. Anyone who works in a customer service industry knows what it is like to deal with pushy customers all day and how good it would be to just to act out. Another example would be the carpet salesman who all of the sudden went on a long rant about his wife. Or the Prominent man of the community who was interrupted before an important speech by his son asking for money. What about the old man who was sent to the electric chair because he broke his wife's dishes? These things when paired with the dreamy filming of the film make you question that perhaps the events that take place are simply internal anxieties that manifest themselves in the world. Perhaps that is what Andersson is saying about the human condition. Maybe our deepest anxiety is that we are truthful with one another and, in the words of the characters in the film, "nobody understands." Overall, this is a very strong film. It is a film that is unique from any other film that I have seen previously. As you watch you are memorized by the oddity that each scene takes on. Previous film techniques are almost forgotten. We have very little movement, almost no action, and the camera remains still throughout. On top of that the plot doesn't exist. Instead we are left with small episodes that offer little to no resolution of the problems they present. In each scene only the main character of interest truly "acts." The rest of the people present simply have little to no reaction to what is going on with that character. As such this is a film about lonely people who are desperately trying to seek out and connect with others. Some people will not like this movie. People looking for a typical Hollywood experience should stay far away from this film. However, if you go into the film with an open mind and stick with the film to truly find out what the film is about it is an absolute delight. It is quirky, witty, funny, and sad. Most importantly it reminded me of just how versatile film as an art form truly is. I would say that it is probably the most memorable and inspiring movies that I have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schadenfreude</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, which was shown dubbed in Italian at a Rome cinema (not as bad as it sounds) after being presented at the Rome Film Festival, is very much an art film and a festival film, guaranteed to charm and delight such audiences for its distinctive style, droll humor; ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others; appealing, cheery music; spot-on performances; overriding sweetness and humanity--but doomed, because of its oddity and lack of a compelling story line, to leave average audiences wondering what they're watching it for and why anyone admires it, how it even got made.Andersson gives us almost a series of dry skits. Running through them are various themes. Money: a guy at the next table (Waldemar Nowak) nicks the wallet of a rich bore talking on a cell phone in a restaurant over a glass of brandy, then goes and orders a set of posh suits made to order; a deadbeat son calls his celebrated father away from an elaborate gathering to beg him for one more loan. A shrink worries aloud about his depleted investments while his wife humps him in bed wearing only a shiny Viking helmet.Depression: an elementary teacher (Jessica Nilsson) breaks down in class because her husband has called her a "harpy;" the rug salesman spouse (Pär Fredriksson) collapses before clients because he's called her that. Several men have depressing dreams. But hey--this is Sweden. Isn't everybody depressed? Love problems: a fat bohemian couple is perpetually breaking up; a girl groupie has fantasies about a lead guitarist, Micke (Eric Bäckman). Wives slam doors when their husbands start to practice their instruments. (Music too is obviously a unifying theme. Besides the dashing guitarist there's a tuba and a drum player who're in a Dixierland band and also play in marches and funerals. Every scene has an added lilt from the music, which niftily links one sequence with another.) A raging storm outside the window of many scenes, violent rain, people out in it, thunder so loud it sounds like a battle raging across the land. This also unifies the tone and gives the impression various scenes are happening on the same dauntingly tempestuous day.Andersson is a master of visual composition and the static middle-distance shot and the film has a foggy gray-green look engineered by DP Gustav Danielsson that's perfect because it evokes the gloom of a Swedish winter but also twinkles with the subtle colors of the director's wit, which ends every scene with a smile. One almost never knew drabness could be so beautiful. (Or perhaps one did: Alexcanr Sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts.) Within scenes and in the film as a whole there's a kind of stillness that comes out of the visual style, the pacing of scenes, and the detached humanism of the overall outlook. There's something about a fully mastered style that's calming, reassuring.Not everything works equally well. One may feel impatient with the succession of barely related scenes, which read too much sometimes like the work of a Saturday Night Live writer in need of Prozac. Since some scenes plainly move you or draw a laugh, it's obvious that others fall a little flat.But some scenes are real zingers, and one obviously triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream--described and then visualized dreams being another important thread) in which the girl groupie imagines herself in a wedding dress newly married to her fey guitarist ideal, who plays a delicate series of riffs while a crowd of admirers gathers outside a big window. The viewpoint switches to outside and the window slides slowly away as if the building the dream newlyweds look out of were a train moving out of a station to take them to their honeymoon. It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.Eventually one may feel everything in You the Living (Du Levande) is a dream, including the recurring scene where the barman is always striking a bronze bell and announcing last order time, whereupon all the torpid customers rise from their tables and go up to get one more drink.An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right. It limits itself in a dozen ways, but there is greatness in it. Roy Andersson is a little master (like some medieval miniaturist) of the inner comedies of Scandanavian gloom, and this is a film unlike any other. Shown this year as a Cannes "Un Certain Regard" selection, this is also the Swedish entry for the 2007 Best Foreign Oscar. Hard to say what Bergman would think, but Andersson worked with him; is famous for his elaborately produced TV commercials, some of which one can see on YouTube. Bergman called them "the best commercials in the world." It will be interesting to see if this director, whose craft is as subtle as his viewpoint, will start working in longer segments some time. Meanwhile, any good film buff really needs to get a look at this."Schadenfreude" isn't quite the right word. That means delight in the misery of others. Andersson is teaching us to delight in the misery of all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, evocative but fractured modern tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roy Andersson has managed to craft something that defies nearly all conventions of what a film should be, a piece of art that is both beautiful, funny and evocative at the same time. The end result is a moving, if somewhat fractured tale about humanity in its simplest and most honest forms.This is unlikely to appeal to everyone, in fact the humour is so finely tuned that many are unlikely to get on its wavelength. The almost absurdly long takes, awkward silences and consistent medium shots will most definitely put off even the most willing of audiences. But it is within these disjointed tales and unconventional thinking that Andersson shapes a world where every character seems to take centre stage in their own absurd way. Each scene is absorbed by the desolate environments, with the characters seemingly left alone in their own oddity Its a difficult piece to watch at times, not least because like many of its scenes, it requires patience. But whilst some may hail it upon an artistic throne, others will simply look on in confusion. Its a film that blends understated humour with own brand of heart</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absurdist, surreal movie not a masterpiece, but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This surrealistic, absurdist movie is the first film I have seen of cult Swedish Director Roy Andersson. He is a veteran filmmaker who has made his living filming commercials, directing only four feature films in the last forty years. This background shows: the film seems like a collection of fifty 2 minute arty commercials. There is no story interconnecting these vignettes, though some characters appear in more than one vignette (there is a theme throughout underneath them, though: the absurdity of modern life). Some of the film's mannerisms (having the actors appear in light white makeup) are more irritating than illuminating. Some of the skits amount to very little (a man unsure in which queue to stand?). Other skits are better, though. The best is the one about the rock chick dreaming that she goes on honeymoon with her rock guitarist bride on a house that turns on something akin to a train (you have to watch it to get it). A film worth seeing, even if comparisons made by some film critics with such great filmmakers as Keaton, Tati and Kaurismaki seems overwrought: Andersson lacks the vision of them and the lack of a story interconnecting the vignettes is fatal to this film's pretension of being a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. There are some wonderful descriptions of this film from other commenter's here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so I won't too far into giving a film synopsis but you could see a little of Woody Allen and maybe a little of Federico Fellini in this film's collection of some 50 short sketches or vignettes strung together with no real singular plot. A few of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines however and a a corner bar is used frequently as a central scene where they are always giving last call. The beginning and ending scenes have a common theme too that bookends the film. It took three years to film this and much of the time must have been spent on finding the plainest and homeliest looking people in all of Sweden to make the cast. This is Sweden's official submission for Best Foreign Language Film for the 2007 Academy Awards. It's a nice movie but hardly worthy of an official submission for best foreign film. Last year Sweden's official submission was the very weak Farväl Falkenberg and the year before it was expensive looking but dull ZoZo, so once again Sweden will have no chance in picking up the Oscar. This film has it's moments and would have made a good 20-25 minute short film but it gets a little old and cold for a full length feature film. Roy Andersson directs. Gustav Danielsson is the cinematographer. Editor Anna Märta Waern deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have put into this. Benny Andersson of ABBA fame provides an entertaining music score. It's an interesting film with a lot of dry humor and I did like it but It's nothing really special and could only give it a 7.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people think of Sweden in a negative way: too neat, too clean, too serious, too organized and too Northern. A people tortured by their own religious fate and history, sometimes leading to depression and compulsive heavy-handedness. This need not be a problem for a filmmaker, as for example the late Bergman has shown us what can be cinematic possible under these conditions. Bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not explicitly comment on this identity as such.Andersson however does the reverse: He comments only on this identity hereby dissecting his people to the bone: In his world Sweden is equivalent for hell on earth. But he does not take this any further and for me this is just not art but merely annotation. Despite the exceptional amount of time it took to make this filmmaker has serious limitations he clearly cannot step out of.Compared to his previous movie S?nger fr?n andra v?ningen / Songs from the Second Floor, there is also not much progress to be observed. The intention was that this was more accessible, but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that try to please a larger audience aren't the best in the movie. The same absurdism and minimalism also still apply, there is the one-shot camera position and the (lack of) action in front of this shot. Yes, the stills are well done, some of the scenes actually work and the coloring and positioning is amazing. But does that make an interesting movie? Thinking in a negative way, this is cinema taken a step backwards.Andersson's background as a maker of commercials shines through in the elaborate setup, but I find his movies about as empty as those commercials. There is a message about mankind, but it is trivial and without much depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You the living? OK I think I am an intelligent, educated, liberal and really into films. I really like and have a great sense of humour. I was under the impression this was a bleakly painful comedy. They got paid for making this, petrol was used, electricity burnt, food was consumed, sets built........why? I blame the current state of the world on this film and all those people associated with it, I will even include us the viewing public. We are all to blame and deserve whatever coming. Its not funny, not much happens, everyone it seems is bored or boring. There are no conversations, communication is minimal. There is no plot as far as I am aware. I have in fact just lost 89 point something minutes of my life. I will never ever get that time back. The only message I have come away with is perhaps life is too short to sit around watching movies of people doing not much......and then you die!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>whooooa...the ONLY dissenting review so far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i stopped this movie at 48 minutes and change... i don't know...maybe it's because i'm not Swedish...or french(the cannes commenter)...or any of those OTHER sleepy places from which the previous reviewers held forth... born and raised in NY. lived near san francisco for a quarter of a century. and now Holland. i love a good independent film as much as the next movie enthusiast... but this, in a word, isn't funny. see? now THAT's funny...that you're thinking that i made a mistake. i said, 'in a word' but then said, 'isn't funny'... nope. no mistake. if this is your type of humor, i'd say you haven't really had much of a life... consider your appreciation of this film a symptom... and PLEASE don't EVER write another review...i have a tendency to believe them when they're unanimous. even if there only were about 3 reviews before mine...i figured i might ACtually be able to save someone ELSE the boredom...the anticipation of laughter that never materializes... i DID smile once or twice, though... when i started the movie...and when i stopped it. that should be 10 lines.</fullReview>
