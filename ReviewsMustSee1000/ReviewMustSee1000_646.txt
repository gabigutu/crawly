		<shortDescription>Forget Armageddon and the laughable Pitch Black. Never mind Lost In Space and Mission to Mars. Even the great Men In Black is dismissable here. THIS is a space movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably one of the most significant things about Apollo 13 is the fact that it managed to be such a strikingly realistic film despite the abundance of well-known Hollywood actors. Tom Hanks, of course, can convincingly act any part in the world, and his role in Apollo 13 is no exception. All of the actors involved seemed to have been given parts that they were born to play, because they were so successful in the roles. The true events of the historic Apollo 13 mission are amazingly re-created here, and the results are spectacular. Not only is this film wonderfully acted, it also presents a nearly flawless portrayal of the time period, even down to the slide rulers that were used to do calculations. The audience is literally taken back in time to the 1960's, and all of these universally exciting events are brought back to life, and this is one of the things that makes this movie so special. So many films try to do this, and the vast majority of them fail miserably, so it just feels so good to occasionally see it done right.Another thing that was used in the perfect amount in Apollo 13 was the special effects. I am entirely against excessive special effects, because if they aren't justified in being in the film, they can sometimes ruin the film by themselves (remember The Perfect Storm?). The special effects in Apollo 13, however, served the film very well. Of course, the most significant special effect in the film, aside from the space scenes, was the zero gravity, which was done flawlessly. I'm just glad that they decided to go up in one of those Zero-G planes for these scenes, rather than have the actors drift lazily around and act as if they are in zero gravity, because that would have taken a lot away from the film. Apollo 13 has an excellent story made even better by the fact that it is true, it has great acting, skillful direction, and plenty of tasteful humor. It is not only a highly entertaining film, but is also educational, which should please parents (as if they need any more pleasing than seeing their younger years brought back to life on the silver screen). Definite must-see, Apollo 13 is a contemporary classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first job as an engineering graduate in 1960 was with NASA. I was fortunate enough to have been a Project Engineer on the Apollo Program, and I am familiar with the technical aspects of the program. But this movie was not as much about the technical aspects of the program as it was about a thrilling, real-life drama that just happened to take place during a glorious time and a once-in-a-lifetime project. Despite all of the little technical errors, Ron Howard and his crew have put together a superb film, one that deserved the 9 Academy Award nominations which it received. I wish that present-day film-makers would concentrate on happy situations, like this one, instead of the constant barrage of drivel to which we, the movie-going public, are made subject. Long live NASA and long live courage!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brief synopsis of a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to say what makes Apollo 13 such a great film - perhaps it is the idea that it "really happened", and that someone can look at a history book, then at the film, and see an overall reality. Some might say they love it just for the effects; but I believe that it has a great story, and a perfect selection of actors, perfectly cast. Ed Harris excels, as does Tom Hanks - and Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are each superb in their roles.The most wonderful thing about this movie is that it encompasses so many parts and peoples, and appeals to so many, that by the last reel you feel that if they don't make it through, you have lost some of your closest friends.In short: a minor masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, i was simply compelled to watch it until the end. I already knew how it ended so i was surprised it commanded my attention so intensely.The fact is the characters were all so realistically portrayed and the film was so expertly directed that it was almost as if the Apollo 13 disaster was filmed and that is what i was watching.Now this film is certainly not to everyone's taste, it is quite slow in the build up and the film relies almost entirely on the script and ability of the cast.If you like your disaster films loud and in your face then this is probably not for you, but if you like them realistic (slightly dramatised) then watch it and be astounded.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is really some movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can watch this film over and over. Not only because I am so terribly interested in the exploration of space and the historical events that have taken place - but because it's a great film with excellent performances and a truth-telling style. Heck, even Lovell's wife dropping the wedding ring in the shower the day of the launch is true!Just the fact that this film is true makes it even more enjoyable. It's hard to understand how in the hell one can make it back to Earth and survive with a fatally crippled space-craft. It's even harder to appreciate just how close they actually got to dying out there.The performances are astounding. Ed Harris is just stupendous as Gene Krantz, and Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Garty Sinise and Bill Paxton (who seems to always get the role as the whiner...) are also great.As Hanks put it: this story is one of the greatest ever. The question is, how do you get home? That question is as old as humanity itself.You can tell he put his heart and soul into this one. And the fact that this happened to the American space explorers is hardly noticeable. Good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made Me Want To Study The Real Apollo 13 Astronauts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very well-done true story of a space mission that came extremely close to being a disaster, but the astronauts miraculously made it home safely. Except for some language problems, it's good storytelling and so interesting that it made me want to study the real Apollo 13 astronauts.The movie is fairly long at 140 minutes and there is not much "action" but there is a lot of suspense and first-rating acting, both of which should keep anyone's interest. Knowing this was a true story makes one all the more involved with it. You can usually count of Director Ron Howard putting out an interesting and well-photographed film.What also was interesting to me, too, was to see these actors, most of whom usually play volatile characters- or did prior to this film - act in such low-key roles. I refer to Ed Harris, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon. By the way, one of the young Lovell children was played by Miko Hughes, who became a co- star in a film - "Mercury Rising" - several years later.For such a tense story, with these astronauts lives on the line, none of the astronauts or people at NASA or anyone's family members are ever seeing praying throughout this ordeal! You can bet, in real life, a lot of prayers were answered on this mission. Overall, this is good movie-making and recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the moment the problems started I was sitting on the edge of my seat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what the real event was like, because I wasn't even born then, but I guess it must have been really shocking to see how these astronauts were fighting for their lives. The movie really has done a good job on showing how inventive people can be in times of need, and on recreating the emotions that the crew, their families and the people in the flight command center had to go through.If you ask me, the film really was at its best as soon as the crew was actually taking off in their rocket. Before that the movie was a little bit too slow to my taste and it didn't have that much to say. However, from the moment the problems with Apollo 13 started I was sitting on the edge of my seat. It all felt very real and you just have to empathize with the crew and their family.Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, Bill Paxton,... all did a great job showing us the astronauts, their families and the flight crew on this doomed mission. Their performances made "Apollo 13" one of the better movies of the nineties. I reward it with an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>APOLLO 13 (1995) ***1/2 Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Kathleen Quinlan, Ed Harris, Loren Dean, Clint Howard. Exhilarating and absorbing true life account of the 1970 mishap of the American space program's Apollo 13 that nearly became a tragic catastrophe based on astronaut and team leader Jim Lovell's novel "Lost Moon". Hanks is excellent as Lovell, grace under pressure realized, as is the rest of the fine ensemble and perfect visual effects of space travel and ingenuity. Harris won a nomination for Best Supporting Actor as Mission control's chief. Noteworthy: that's director Ron Howard's real life mother as Lovell's mom and look sharp for Lovell himself at the film's conclusion. Oscar winner for Best Editing and Best Sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Astronauts Lovell, Haise and Swigert are on Apollo 13. People aren't worried about this expedition because the people already made it to the moon safely and had came back alive. That's not the point when things go very wrong and the hopes of coming back alive starts to fade.This is a very good film. It shows human dedication and perseverance that they won't give up, even though hopes from other people seems to increase.The acting by Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, and Kathleen Quinlan are all great. This film also delivers some of the best lines in movie history.This is a true story and has turned into a great movie and has great acting. Although I wouldn't say it's the best film, it's still one of the best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie. A touching yet thrilling action-packed story of hope and beating the odds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is my all-time favorite. It has every element that makes a movie a classic. It is suspenseful, thrilling, and touching. It has drama, comedy, suspense, and even a little romance. I read the book "The Lost Moon" written by Jim Lovell and was the basis of the movie. The writers, producers, director, and actors did a marvelous job of portraying the events of the perilous flight of Apollo 13. The actors (Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinland, and Gary Sinise) did a wonderful job as their character. I absolutely love movies where everyone comes together to fight and work toward a certain, unified goal, and I cannot think of a better example of this than what is shown in Apollo 13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is designed for people like me who have seen Apollo 13 dozens of times. Apollo 13 is one of my favorite movies for several reasons and here is a short rant: the movie was robbed at the 1995 Oscars. It could have been Best Picture and either Ed Harris or Karen Quinlan could have won best supporting actor/actress. At the time the movie was released, people wondered whether it would be Tom Hank's third Oscar in a row. The role of James Lovell was too "normal" and the movie too much of an ensemble film for him to have had a chance. Of course that doesn't take anything away from his brilliant, understated performance.The movie premiered around Memorial Day 1995, and I saw it that first weekend in an old-fashioned multi-plex (before stadium seating). Seen in a theater, this movie wraps you in and rockets you back to 1970. It also puts you in a fourth chair in the Command and Lunar modules. I was around for the original Apollo 13 incident: I was the same age as the younger Lovell daughter. Yet, even knowing the whole outcome, I was still enthralled with the intricacy of the whole plot and all of the characters. The "corridor control burn," where the astronauts have to floor the engines and get the LEM back on course was especially exciting in the theater. I think all of the air got sucked out of it by people gasping! Last year I was lucky enough to meet Tracy Reiner, who played Mary Heise. She told me some neat insider information about the movie, such as how they filmed the Lift off scenes at Long Beach, CA and not Florida. Tracy also said that in the arresting scene where she and Marilyn (Karen Quinlan) gaze upward at the ascending rocket, with tears in their eyes, they are actually watching a hanky being hoisted up a flagpole. She also said she filmed most of her scenes with a broken toe.One of the movie's best scenes was the docking sequence. In the hands of a lesser director, it would have been a ho-hum, forgettable scene. Yet Ron Howard rachets up the drama by cross-cutting between Ed Harris and the actor playing Deke Slayton as they worry about Jack Swigert, a last minute replacement performing a critical command module maneuver ("C'mon rookie, park that thing.") As many other reviewers have said, the producers did a perfect job re-creating 1970. I laughed at the part where the one Lovell daughter says about the other "She's still moaning about the stupid Beatles breaking up!" The older daughter swishes the door open and shoots back "They're not stupid, you're stupid!" This brings up another point: whoever did the costuming for the movie absolutely nailed the look of 1970 clothing and hair fashions. Yet, the movie was not nominated for a costume Oscar. I guess you have to be an 1800s or earlier period drama to be considered for that category.At the time the incident originally occurred, we followed along in social studies class. I always knew that they would get the astronauts back safe and sound, but of course, I was an innocent kid. Still, the way the producers handled the re-entry was absolutely breathtaking. I can still see the condensation from the instrument panels dripping down on Lovell, Heise, and Swigert. There was such a dramatic build-up of the broadcast delay from re-entry, it had me and everyone else in the theatre going "Wait a minute..." until the static crackled and James Lovell's voice triumphantly booms over the speakers. Everyone in the theater cheered just like the people in mission control.Apollo 13 didn't get the credit it deserved in the year it was released but it is still one of the best movies ever made, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent recreation of a factual drama-in-space.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As if to prove that the number 13 is truly unlucky - as superstitious people have been telling us for years - the 13th Apollo space mission was a catalogue of disastrous mishaps from start to finish. Ron Howard directs this film version of the events surrounding the ill-fated mission with great attention to the technical detail, making it almost documentary-like in approach. But while some documentaries are rather cold and distant, Howard remembers to keep the emotional drama in his film tense and involving, just as it must have been as the events unfolded for real back in the spring of 1970.Astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) has long dreamed of setting foot on the moon, and gets his chance when chosen to be a member of the Apollo 13 moon landing mission in 1970. The three man team also includes Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton). During their flight to the moon, the three astronauts make regular live transmissions that they believe will be televised down on Earth. However, their TV slot has been axed without them knowing it, as no-one seems particularly interested any more in the rather dull and technical terminology associated with space travel. The mission is destined to become the centre of everyone's attention, however, when a routine oxygen tank procedure goes awry and leads to an explosion. The Apollo shuttle is suddenly marooned in space, with little power, little control and little air. The objective of landing on the moon is replaced with the sole aim of getting the astronauts back home alive. In Houston, scientists struggle against the odds to plan a way to bring the astronauts back to safety, working around the clock to solve various logistical problems facing them. Meanwhile, Lovell's wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) must hold together her family as they face the terrifying possibility of losing their beloved Jim. And aboard the shuttle itself, the three astronauts endure several days of unrelenting doubts and fears as their very lives hang by a thread?.Apollo 13 is a superb recreation of the true story. Its most impressive achievement is that it manages to generate genuine gnawing tension in spite of the fact that most viewers already know the outcome. The performances are first-rate throughout, with Hanks, Bacon and Paxton exceptional as the endangered space travellers, Quinlan totally convincing as Lovell's distraught wife, and Ed Harris in commanding form as the mission controller sweating it out down in Houston. William Broyles Jr and Al Reinert provide an excellent script, which makes absolute sense of the potentially confusing technical dialogue, and also explores the emotional toll of the ordeal realistically and effectively. The final scene especially, in which communication is lost as the astronaut's re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, is so taut that you can feel your heart thumping inside your chest. The film is a celebration of human determination ? some have criticised it for its unapologetic flag-waving and patriotism but such criticisms seem, to me, to be missing the point. This is not so much about America conquering the odds, more a film about the human spirit in general conquering the odds. And that's a message that we should all take from the film with open arms. Apollo 13 is an outstanding film indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Houston, we have no problem...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many would argue that, because it is based on true events, history ruins the ending of Apollo 13, and thus, its thriller aspect is worthless. I will confess to ignorance here: I knew next to nothing about the real-life mission, and thus, I was able to really enjoy the movie's thriller aspect.The first half hour of Apollo 13 basically introduces the main characters. Its slow pace actually helps it in the long run; it plods along and finds its own, comfortable pace. Some mightn't like this, but I did. As soon as a little complication is introduced involving Gary Sinise's character, the movie skyrockets forward and doesn't stop. Characters that we've gotten to know and care for are then involved in one scary series of events, making the film that much more thrilling.Ron Howard really knows how to direct. The suspense sequences of Apollo 13 work out fantastically. He doesn't add unnecessary material to the film to make it more popular to the masses. There is no "asteroid field" sequence that a superficial teen audience would go crazy over. As a result, the film really feels like it is taking place in outer space. This adds a layer of realism to the (fantastic) special effects, and the film is that much better.An added bonus is Tom Hanks in the lead role as Jim Lovell. He is one of the few popular actors who really deserve all the praise. Hanks adds a touch of humanity to his role; he doesn't feel like an unerring, invincible protagonist, and he doesn't feel like a "Gary Sue" who will mess up at all the appropriate times. As the ship's crew begins to argue, Hanks joins in the shouting, trying to "break it up". But it isn't his voice that stops the arguing. Hanks makes his character and the danger he is in feel real. That takes real talent.But Hanks is not the only one who deserves praise. Every single actor in the film, from Gary Sinise to Ed Harris, does a fantastic job. Their characters are not imitations of real-life personages; they are their own. Everyone seems to fit their character perfectly, even Jim Lovell's elderly mother (who is introduced lamenting that her son's broadcast is not on TV).Arguably, Apollo 13's most pleasant surprise is found in its gentle inclusion of comic relief. It doesn't seem intrusive or inappropriate. The best way to describe it is "gentle". For instance, two world-famous astronauts are introduced to Jim's mother as regular, ordinary young men. It's funny and doesn't seem forced into the plot.The Verdict: Apollo 13 is a splendid little film, thrilling when it has to be, comic at times, and carried all the way by splendid performances from all the actors. Solid direction and superb visual effects just add to make it the great film it is.Overall Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly superlative "really happened" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am amazed this film does not have a higher mark than 7.5 at the moment. It is difficult to see how this could have been done any better - a genuinely thrilling story that encompasses the very best in humanity.The casting is perfect - everyone puts there heart into it (Ed Harris is especially worth a mention), and the special effects are not only an incredible achievement in themselves, but also used just the way they should be - to tell the story, not replace it. The Zero-G is brilliantly executed, and the CGI Saturn5 on the launch pad is utterly convincing.Regardless of the fact that we all know the outcome to the story before we start viewing, this is compelling edge of the seat stuff. Howard manages to convey the desperation of the situation, while never once leaving us without hope.This film is just sheer class from beginning to end. You will love it even if you think you aren't interested in space exploration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a recreation of America's third NASA mission to land on the moon in 1970, and the subsequent disaster that almost befell the mission........Director Ron Howard and his producer Brian Grazer, made a top draw picture about an incident that everyone knew the outcome too. That it engrosses and thrills to make the inevitable denouement a mere component of a whole, is quite a fabulous achievement. Sure it can be said that it lacks a certain political appendage {RE:The Right Stuff}, but for the duration of this picture we are wowed by the design and construction on offer. It would have been easy for Howard to use stock footage of real NASA missions, but all sequences are recreated by the makers with astonishingly impacting results, thus adding authenticity to the palpable tension when things go belly up.Howard was wise in his choice of leading man, who better than Tom Hanks {Jim Lovell, who's memoirs the script worked from} to portray a bastion of Americana?, nobody, because Hanks is perfect, as are Bill Paxton {Fred Haise} and Kevin Bacon {John Swigart} sitting either side of Hanks, a couple of bona fide solid and respected actors you could not have wished to have. Down on the ground the acting is also exemplary, Kathleen Quinlan as the fraught Marylyn Lovell is fantastic, with Ed Harris {Gene Kranz} and Gary Sinise {Ken Mattingly} adding emotional weight to the unfolding drama. With Howard reining in his trade mark sentimental flourishes, Apollo 13 relies on its story and its craft to steer it safely home, and safely home it gets, just like the men of Apolo 13. To give us a punch the air joy that comes as much out of tension relief as it does because of raw human emotion, quite a picture indeed. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The crisis of Apollo 13 mission is shown from all points of view, including ground controllers and the families.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Apollo 13" is a docudrama that has you on the edge of your seat even if you may know what's going to happen. It's the true story of the 1970 mission to the moon where the famous "Houston, we have a problem," quote originated. Other documentaries tell the same story, but this 1995 version, directed by Ron Howard, is a must-see masterpiece.The lead character of mission commander Jim Lovell is played by Tom Hanks. (My 10th-grade students watched it and recognized Hanks' voice as Woody from "Toy Story".) Lovell refuses to be superstitious about the number 13. When his crew is moved up from Apollo 14 to 13, his wife asks, "Why does it have to be 13?" "Because it follows 12," he replies. Lovell is funny, smart and a good leader. He was a step ahead of mission control and always had his crew working ahead of mission director's requests. Before this mission Lovell had flown three missions for NASA, but now he wanted to walk on the moon in the worst way.Unfortunately, the crew winds up facing a catastrophe that threatens their mission to the moon and their lives. Instead of using the lunar module to land on the moon, they have to first live in it to survive their flight. The amazing thing is how director Ron Howard lets us experience everyone's journey, not just the astronauts. We also see the mission controllers arguing and problem solving. Lovell's wife, Marilyn, is shown each step of the way constantly adding depth and emotion to balance the technical NASA speak.Emotional balance and master pacing is a hallmark of Ron Howard's films. All of his movies, which include "Cacoon," "Splash," "Backdraft," "A Beautiful Mind," etc., have emotional cores that anchor them. You come away feeling like you've had a truly human experience.I am addicted to this movie: once I see a scene of it while flipping through channels, it's impossible to turn it off. I have to watch it to the end. I have almost studied it frame by frame for the unusual camera angles and another time for the pacing of humor to make the tension bearable.I'm not sure I'll ever grasp all the magnificence of this movie, but I think if I keep trying, all my storytelling will improve.Ultimately, there's something for everyone in this film, so watch if you haven't seen it. Watch it again, if you have!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with a good friend. We were SO IMPRESSED that we left the movie saying 'vote for Opie'.As many other people have said, we know the end (safety for the crew). But even when I get a copy of the film, I am still glued to the screen.Many actors were SO good in this film, particularly Gary Senise, working so hard like the astronaut that he is, until he finally gets the 'right' sequence for the return of the guys in space.Again, so many good performances by all of the actors. Loved when Ed Harris was so touched when the ship was in the ocean and his effort to keep his face straight and brush away any tears when he faces the rest of his crew.Also, the funny part when Jim Lovell's Mom is glued to the television and Marilyn Lovell brings in some people do distract her. When she introduces them as Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, and the mother turns to them and asks them if they hope to be in the space program. What a hoot!Ron didn't get any award for this wonderful movie, but it will live in the minds of everyone who has ever seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated movie about a real event</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am at a loss as to why some people criticise this movie unless they are far to young to understand the period and the importance of the space program at the time.Anyone who has been to the Smithsonian in Washington DC will appreciate that these were pretty crude instruments to travel to the moon and back. I would'nt cross town in one of these but men of determination, dedication, vision and belief set off for what has been until now the greatest adventure of all time.Inevitably something was always going to go wrong and this was Apollo 13. That through ingenuity, analysis, and bravery under fire (so to speak) the crew returned to Earth is every bit as remarkable as what the story suggests.The settings are realistic, down to clothes, hairstyles and the like. The fusion of the event with the more mundane aspects of family life add to the realism. The acting is strong and believable, and I particularly liked the interpretation of Lovell's wife, who manages to blend support of her husband, with fear and concern, while trying to run a relatively normal household.The parts of the three astronauts are well portrayed. Hanks, who I wax and wane on does a good job and Kevin Bacon is plausible as Swigert, even if his bachelor status is a bit overcooked. Gary Sinese, as always, is terrific and his role in the rescue of the mission is a little overstated, but he is just as good here as he was as Capt. Dan in Forest Gump. Ed Harris, also as is usual, is very good (and I particularly liked his waistcoat).This makes a great companion piece to The Right Stuff, another of my favourite movies, and anyone interested in the space program, and where it came from, should have both in their DVD collection, along with the documentary piece, In the Shadow of the Moon and the TV series From the Earth to the Moon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was little I always dreamed of being an astronaut so a film like Apollo 13 was a dream come true. I vaguely remember watching this film as a kid, only being able to recollect small details. Now, I've revisited this film and realized how much better it is from an older and more knowledgeable perspective. I no longer have desires to be an astronaut, but Apollo 13 is still a great movie. It's the true story of Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert and their disastrous Apollo 13 mission where everything went wrong, yet through courage and determination the men made it back to Earth safely. It's emotional, it's daunting, and it's powerful. Apollo 13 is a truly thrilling film from start to finish as we watch the wonders as well as the risks of outer space come alive.Apollo 13 is a prime example of the Hollywood machine at work, but this time it produces fantastic results. Ron Howard directs this picture with the utmost care, as well as an obvious passion for the subject matter. Sure the events are probably glorified, but that's what this kind of melodramatic big budget Hollywood production is all about. Meanwhile, the film rounds up an all star cast with Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinse, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, and many more. This fine collection of actors come together in such a brilliant way as they all pull off fantastic performances that make Apollo 13 a melodramatic, yet still believable film. Then you throw in an almighty score from James Horner and you've got yourself a surefire win. Everyone involved with this film deserves credit because it really and truly comes together to be a wildly engaging film.You don't even have to necessarily have an interest in space or astronautics to enjoy this film. You can enjoy it as an engaging dramatic piece full of tension, suspense, and emotion. However, if you come into this film not caring at all about space you will likely leave with some sort of newfound interest in the wonders it beholds. There's something incredibly fun and fascinating about the way these characters speak. Their space jargon rolls off the tongue and allows the dialogue to flow so graciously and poignantly as mission control quickly streamlines commands to the men in the ship. The whole film has a great flow that keeps you engaged and thrilled, never losing focus on the film, always wanting to know what will happen next.It's actually incredibly ironic that a film like this can keep you so hooked and so boiled with emotion and suspense because we already know what happens. We know the story behind Apollo 13 and it's general knowledge that it was a disastrous mission to the moon yet the crew made it back safe and sound. Yet, amazingly enough, the suspense is so vigorous and the tension that builds is so captivating it's as if you had no idea what would happen. It takes true skill in acting and directing to pull this off, and it's the major challenge to overcome when making a film out of true events. But this is the task that Apollo 13 overcomes, and it helps it to become a really great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apollo 13 is possibly one of the most famous space missions in history, almost as famous as the Apollo 11 mission. But Apollo 13 was famous for nearly ending in disasters, but NASA was able to prevent it.After the success of the Apollo 11 mission veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) and his crew Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) are assigned to the Apollo 13 mission to the moon. They train and become an effective team, but Ken is removed when his blood test shows he is inflected with measles. Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) has to replace the man 2 days before the flight. When the flight takes off everything seems find for the first three days. But then one of the oxygen tanks blow up, and their capsule starts to run out of oxygen and the moon mission is abandoned. The NASA ground control team lead by Eugene F. Kranz (Ed Harris) and the astronauts enter in a race against time to get back to end. On the way they have to uses as little electricity as possible and make sure that the carbon dioxide levels from getting too high. On Earth there is also a personal drama involving the families of the astronauts, led by Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlan), who can only watch on TV and pray that their husbands can come back to Earth safely.Ron Howard is easily on of the biggest hit and miss director's in Hollywood. For every quality film like Frost/Nixon there is a poor film to counter act it like the Da Vinci Code. Luckily Apollo 13 is on the good side on the Ron Howard scale. I have been very critical of the films that were nominated for Oscars in 1995, the awful Braveheart winning undeserved awards, whilst The Usual Suspects, Heat, Casino, Se7en, Nixon and Twelve Monkeys were all over looked for a nomination. Apollo 13 was at least the most deserving for a nod in that year. Ron Howard direct's a fine film, having some wise directional choices. He uses some excellent special effects, has some wonderful camera, shots in real locations and uses low gravity, a good use of real news footage and after a slow build up makes a interesting and exciting film about how NASA got the astronauts back against the odds. Ron Howard also shot the film as PG, which in modern cinema normally seen as weaken a film because it doesn't make it seem adult: but this was a wise move by Howard. This story didn't require swearing or violence, giving the film a wider audience and a older-fashion feel like Casablanca or Spartacus. But despite these good aspects, the film does have a very overwhelming score which wasn't needed.There is also a good cast to the film, Tom Hanks, who is very good in the film, Kathleen Quinlan was also very good, Ed Harris, an actor I like, Gary Sinise in one of his better performances, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon. This was a film that was acting for awards. In another year it would have got them.A good film if you are interested in NASA and the space programme.</fullReview>

It manifests a worldview that a lot of Boomer men had to wrestle with growing up... and to a large extent let go of through the consciousness-raising of the 1960s and 1970s. Apollo 13 reminds us of the best qualities of that era that saw the rise and fall of the US government's adroitly romanticized space program......For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Houston might have had a problem, but Hollywood has a gem. "Apollo 13" out-rivals any space film in its believability and quality. Nothing about space in this film seems like science-fiction and for all the technical jargon, it's really easy to follow, resulting an a deeply moving film.It might be like "Titanic," where you know that the ship is going to sink in the end, but still, "Apollo 13" moves you through its characters and the way the story is told. It might also be a near 2.5 hour drama, but it keeps things rolling as well and you don't ever get bored. The premise surrounds the historic "successful failure" of the Apollo 13 shuttle's attempt to land on the moon, a mission lead by Jim Lovell, played by Tom Hanks, whose patience and poise make him a fascinating character. The bulk of the film is Houston and the crew working together to do whatever they can to get these men back home alive.Simply put, the acting here conveys the danger of the return mission and just how serious it all is. Ed Harris, for example, as NASA flight director Gene Kranz is other-worldly commanding on the screen. These actors suck you in to the last detail of what's going on, the great screenplay pads that with actual media coverage of the event to convey a sense of how the world is feeling, and then Ron Howard steps in to make the transitions flawless (with the help his Oscar-winning editors) There are times where a scene will show in the shuttle, in Houston, inside Lovell's family's home, at the nursing home where his mother lives, etc. all within minutes of each other and it's not confusing at all. No single thread seems overdone, they all work cohesively.Since the focus is on the characters and problem-solving, space does not become an integral part of the storytelling. It is contextual and is used to help convey the astronauts drive and motivation. For example, at first when things on the shuttle go wrong, it's not "oh, I hope we survive" but "damnit, we can't go to the moon now." Especially for Lovell, the missed opportunity for space is something that nags at him despite just being glad he survived. That is what makes this film a great space film: space is simply a new place for disaster drama to play out and make us wonder about the implications of being in danger so far from home."Apollo 13" doesn't have all the suspense that a film with a lesser publicly known outcome has, but it certainly gets you riding its emotional train to triumph. It's not glitzy, it doesn't over-glorify space and while it might have taken a hit on the entertainment value one might expect from a space movie, it more than makes up for with great, engaging storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember listening to the news on the radio that the lives of the astronauts aboard Apollo 13 was in danger as there had been an explosion and that they were losing oxygen. Not understanding what this meant as I was ten year old child, I immediately put the question to my father and he explained it to me. I ran to the nearest window in the room and looked up to see if I could see it. Because I couldn't I presumed that something had happened and prayed that they returned safely. After that I never heard of Apollo 13 until the movie was released.In the days during the Aplllo missions, it was something exciting to hear about men being put on the moon. The movie portrays the excitement of the mission launch and not to mention the first landing on the moon by a human - Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Successful Failure of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"O, swear not by the moon, the fickle moon, the inconstant moon?" ? Shakespeare, "Romeo and Juliet".I smell that familiar kerosene funk in the air: solid rocket boosters firing, RP-1 propellant and liquid hydrogen surging, flux capacitor giga-watting - yes, it's the Tom Hanks Oscar-Machine chugging rugged in red-carpet mode. Trying to film a story with so many integral characters is impossible with a camera-magnet like Hanks tooling around on set. Our media-driven lifestyle denotes that "star-power" dictates character importance in a movie, so though Hanks may be playing a prominent role as one of three astronauts imperiled by the Apollo 13 malfunction, Every Single Member of NASA is equally worthy of the limelight blindingly focused on Mr. Fantastic. Though not a Hanks-Hater, I feel credit is squandered on his character of Jim Lovell, simply because said character is played by Statuette Boy. In the real world, credit for the rescue of the seemingly-doomed Apollo 13 spacecraft is dispersed throughout hundreds of personnel, each of them a Hero, with a capital 'H': not least, the Flight Directors, Gene Kranz, Glynn Lunney and John Aaron (Kranz played by Ed Harris, the most notable actor of the FD's, thereby implying he was the most "important" ? once again, sigh). Lunney, Kranz's relief FD, was played excellently by a stoic Marc McClure and Aaron - the FD who identified "power" as key factor in the life-saving stakes, thereby engineering the decision to "turn off everything but the essentials" ? was fleshed out by the clinical-tastic Loren Dean. Astronaut Ken Mattingly, dropped from the original Apollo 13 crew and earthbound for medical reasons, was personified by the suave intensity of Gary Sinise. Lovell's crew were Fred Haise (played by Bill Paxton, in his patented "Game over, man!" swoon) and John Swigert (the ever-dependable Kevin Bacon, whose presence in this movie with so many other A-Listers puts him at least "two degrees" closer to about 436 other actors?)Unlike the DeLorean DMC-12, or the LZ 129 Hindenburg, or the RMS Titanic - all failures on a grand scale, all seemingly trespassing on virgin technology and future advancement, with each failure marking the end of an era for their respective milieux ? the "failure" of the Apollo 13 lunar mission aided in advancing space-faring dialect and paved the future with skyward momentum for the International Space Station, the Space Transportation System (Shuttles), Mars Soft Landers and beyond?Disabled by a wiring malfunction explosion, Apollo 13's prime directive shifted from "frolic on moon at taxpayers' expense" to "stay alive, no matter what occurs". As a result of the explosion, technical problems compound, each adversity overlapping the previous one, with the spacecraft crew and Mission Control united against the exigencies of the failing mission itself.Director Ron Howard intelligently chose to have nothing more than true-to-life events provide the drama of "Apollo 13"; as obvious as this may sound, very few "true" or "inspired by" films refrain from inserting Hollywood subplot and cliché to ramp up the stakes ? with this tale, Howard did not need to. The phrase, "You can't make this sh*t up!" springs to mind, as all the "formulae" were present: "ticking clocks", "family stakes", "technological adversity as villain", all encapsulated in the real life tale of three astronauts who missed the moon but unwittingly hit a jackpot?Had the Apollo 13 crewmen died during their rescue attempt, American fortitude would have suffered a blow infinitely worse than the beating it took when either of the lightning-quick Shuttle disasters stunned the nation. With the Shuttles, it was over before anyone had time to realize problems had even arisen. With Apollo 13, manifest effort was expended over the course of four days; a public vigil during an avalanche of adversity that would have broken the back of America if the crew had not survived. And in the surviving, gradually attaining a "success" (read as "fame") far greater than any of the men who actually trod the Moon's surface (barring Armstrong and Aldrin). Proof? Tell me: who were the three astronauts of Apollo 14? (Not even Apollo 11 had the honor of having a PINBALL MACHINE created after them.) In the movie, responding to the notion that it could be "the worst disaster NASA's ever experienced", Ed Harris retorts, "I believe this is going to be our finest hour." He was right. An exemplary aspect of this film is the unobtrusiveness of its computer-generated visuals. Though Georgie Lucas believes he has the monopoly on CGI-film-making (simply because he owns the company that icings a large percentage of A-List blockbuster), Ron Howard illustrates ? via Digital Domain's finesse - how to incorporate CGI into one's movie with class and taste. Quite simply - this is as good as it gets! Every star-field, exterior shot and moon view is seamless subtlety; without even realizing it, we see *all-new* footage of Apollo 13 rising on the Saturn V pillar of fire; Hanks' fantasy of descending to the Moon's surface (made ever more poignant by the fact that he has lost the opportunity) captures the sheer, crazy joy of raking one's fingers through regolith and gazing skywards at a gibbous earth-rise? No need for dandy villains, exotic beasts or killer droids, Howard's judicious use of CGI captures everything that Lucas' imprudent abuse lost ? true magnificence and awe.Lucas directed Howard in "American Graffiti". In sooth, the Padawan has become the Master.It is a testament to the talent of this Master that he could fashion such an involving movie from three guys stranded in a refrigerator for a week and a pack of Reservoir Dogs jargonizing at outdated computers.If not for those Apollo 13 "failures" (Lovell, Haise and Swigert), Alan Shepard, Stuart Roosa and Edgar Mitchell of Apollo 14 might have had a more glorious day in the sun ? or the Moon, as it were?(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

The cast were excellent in the roles in they portray - but what do you expect, when you have the likes of Hanks, Bacon, Sinise, Paxton and Harris filling the major roles. A good film, but I wouldn't consider this amongst the best ever made. The pace of the movie at times seemed to drag and due to its storyline there was no real climax.

		<fullReview>There is something innately fascinating about films that are based upon real historical events. To know that what we're on screen actually happened in some capacity, or at least most of it did, makes what you're seeing so much more potent than fiction. When you think about it the aborted Apollo 13 lunar mission is prefect for the big screen. Three astronauts on a mission to get home against all odds with the intelligence of those back on Earth as their only hope. It almost writes itself. The story of Apollo 13 mainly succeeds as a film because it is told with a great deal of clarity and a clear understanding of its aims. From a technical viewpoint to a directing and an acting one, the film is pretty much faultless which only adds to its entertainment value. Ron Howard is frequently accused of being far too sentimental in his directing, which I do at times agree with, yet he is pretty much perfect for this film. He views this time period as one of wonder and discovery. I think that his more emotional style suits the film down to the ground. Every shot of the black of space inspires awe and every conversation between the astronauts and their families comes across as genuine. There are a number of scenes between Lovell and his wife (brilliantly acted by Hanks and Quinlan) that completely avoid falling into the schmaltzy category in part because of how real they are. I'm not sure that many other directors would have been able to get across such emotions as successfully as Howard does here. Hanks, Paxton, Bacon, Sinise and Harris are all superb actors and provide the material with extra weight. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon all fit perfectly as the astronauts given their charismatic styles. Gary Sinise is always a gripping screen presence and you really get to sense the disappointment he feels at missing out on the voyage. Ed Harris (in an Oscar-nominated performance) is at his most convincing as tough guys, but here he manages to balance that out with deep compassion for his men in what is a powerful performance. Quinlan (who was also Oscar-nominated) probably has the most difficult part as Lovell's wife, but she injects the role with plenty of heart and every expression is believable. The NASA control room is packed full of people, frantically working on various methods to get the astronauts home. Despite some many being involved, almost all of them are fleshed out just enough that we get an idea of their personalities. The ever increasing wave of tension that takes place each time something appears to go wrong is executed magnificently. By the time the craft is attempting re-entry you are truly exhausted, in the best way possible, by all that has taken place. It's a testament to the high quality of the directing and acting that we are so concerned for those that are a piece in something so spectacularly eventful. I like how despite the humanised approach, the film doesn't forget that there needs to be thrills for the story to really hit home and there is tension in all the right places. These instances were aided by stunning visual effects, which still convince to this day, and a beautifully stirring score from James Horner.By the time the film draws to its conclusion you are left emotionally drained. It thrills you in all the ways you'd want it to, and pulls on the heartstrings in the exact same way. For me it doesn't matter that the film can delve into the sentimental a little too often because it fits the style it is going for almost perfectly. It made me care about these individuals, even when we know so little about them. The cast is full of actors who are a joy to watch and they help bring this film to life as much as Howard's deft direction does. Even if you know the outcome of the story you still get drawn into the struggle and constantly questioning whether or not those on board will survive. That is possibly the highest praise that a film of this kind can receive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>August 19, 2015This is one of the best films of the year. Ron Howard knows how to make a great movie, visually and creatively. Tom Hanks is a great actor and this creative team of actor/director takes me all the way back to 1984 when Howard directed Hanks in "Splash," one of my favorite pictures of love, magic, and beauty. "Apollo 13" is a visual masterpiece that is based on the real-life ill-fated mission to the moon that happened 25 years ago.It begins on July 20, 1969, with an astronaut, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) who has orbited the moon on "Apollo 8." Jim tells his wife he wants to walk on the moon's surface and he gets his chance when he is selected to take flight in "Apollo 13," instead of "Apollo 14." Jim, along with his flight crew, blast off into space with minor difficulties. En route to the moon, one of the crew members performs a routine housekeeping procedure that causes one of the ship's liquid oxygen tanks to spill out into space while the other explodes and sends the ship tumbling. The mission to land is canceled and the crew becomes trapped in space. With time running out, Lovell and his crew must now work together to figure out a way home before it's too late.The "Apollo 13" mission was launched on April 11th, 1970 from Cape Kennedy, Florida. It was the seventh manned mission in the Apollo space program. Two days later, an oxygen tank exploded and crippled the service module for which the command module depended on. The three astronauts became trapped with the loss of power, loss of cabin heat and loss of oxygen while mission control worked desperately to try and find a way to get them home safely. They faced almost impossible odds and the fact that they might just end up marooned in space, frozen to death.I can just imagine what the cast went through for this movie because their performances are stellar and you can see they were well prepared. It opens with a surprise party for Jim. We meet his wife, Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlan) who is always worried about her husband going into space and not coming back. She follows him through his training and eventually she shows up to the launch party to see her husband take off into space. Kevin Bacon is fantastic as Jack Swigert who feels responsible because he, unknowingly, flipped the switch that caused the explosion and Bill Pullman is Fred Haise, the man who hangs on to every last minute he may have. Ed Harris plays Gene Kranz, the chain-smoking mastermind at Houston Mission Control who tries to figure out if the Apollo 13 crew can safely make it home. He doesn't take "no" for an answer and commands his team to work effortlessly to keep them from dying in space.Originally, Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) was supposed to fly the "Apollo 13" mission but was grounded due to possibly being exposed to the measles. Early in the picture, Ken is diagnosed and we see that Gary Sinise might be limited in his screen time but he's not. He becomes some of the brains to figure how to get the ship home. He works tirelessly in a simulator to figure out a way to power the weakened batteries on the Lunar module exploration device (a lifeboat) so they can swing around the moon and flame burst the ship home.What Ron Howard manages to create is a technically accurate film with a crew that floats around "weightless" in the spaceship and we see some visual shots of earth from a space-eye view. He takes all the technical work and makes it shine. At one point, the crew is freezing out in space and suffering from carbon dioxide poison. Back on earth, a group of engineers is put together to creatively build something that will clean the air. The come up with a jerry rig that the crew can make materials out of on board the shuttle to give them more times. These are the intense sequences that really make you pace and wonder what will happen next and wonder if the crew will make it home alive.</fullReview>

How this didn't win a a best movie or best director for Ron Howard and only pulls a 7.6 on IMDb is beyond me, but once again I sat absolutely mesmerized for 2:20 to watch this tale of the near disaster and rescue of this manned space mission to the moon. Howard captures the drama and tension of the event and the teamwork and dedication of all involved with the space program.Excellent performances by Hanks, Paxton and Bacon as the crew of A13, Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, who was scrubbed from mission at the last minute but selflessly did so much to help the crew make it back. Ed Harris was stellar as Gene Kranz, the Mission Control flight director as was Kathleen Quinlan, playing Marilyn Lovell, wife of A13 commander Jim Lovell.And after viewing this again I realized that we have had a couple generations of Americans (those under 50)grow without having experienced and seen the excitement and pride virtually all of us shared in the manned space programs, that climaxed with the moon landings in 69 and the early 70's. It is truly sad to think of what our space program could have accomplished in space exploration after all we did during the incredible decade of the 60's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think because I was alive during the Apollo 13 flight and remember as a young teen how captive the world was as the damaged ship made its flight back was watched and how I saw the world, our nation, my neighbors, my friends all respond and the intensity which caused my initial interest. But in watching the movie, realizing that these men went to the moon using technology less sophisticated than what is in my smart phone and that there was only 1 mission where something went wrong was miraculous. Plus the bravery history shines on them as we now can compare how little we knew to the achievement, and that it was will to beat the soviets that drove the nation to willingly pay to risk these lives to make a trip to the moon that made the movie have an impact on my life as an adult. It was the drive of a nation to prove that we where technologically superior to our enemies that drove this to be such a high priority. The fact that it resulted in tremendous growth in high technology as the tax payers willingly backed this effort which drove technological innovation and breakthroughs for years as we went from WWII technology to the information age. To bad our government doesn't invest in our economy that way now instead of taxing the middle class to strip them of medical benefits to fund benefits for the poor. This movie and the comparison of where our nation was vs. is makes this an incredibly emotional movie for me. I wish those who were younger (and not foolish enough to believe these accomplishments were not real; tainting a great period of investing in our technological future) would look at it and learn from it and what this nation is capable of when its population is working and leadership strong with some true vision can accomplish.I think this was a well made movie and Ron Howard did a great job of capturing the important aspects of the events around this mission. Living through the real event and "holding our collective breath" for all those days until we saw the parachutes open upon re-entry (an event we watched in the gym at school) and the celebration that nobody died helped to make even more real the true level of danger those men faced and not the version communicated through the press until after it was over. Things that would be lost if you weren't alive at the time, but part of what makes for an excellent movie of an incredible event in our countries history.</fullReview>

He works alongside 2 of the best men to be ready for the mission, but a medical emergency causes a team change at the last minute, which replaces a member of Lovell's crew with a man without much training just 2 days before the flight. Together, these three men travel into space, where everything seems to be going OK. That is, until a major explosion causes massive damage to the Oxygen tanks, and overall ship. To survive, the men must preserve what little oxygen remains, what little fuel remains, and what little power remains to slingshot around the moon and reenter the Earth. This movie is accurate in its portrayal of the time period as well as its source material: the real Apollo mission. The actors all played their parts beautifully, with special credit given to Tom Hanks, who, in my opinion, is incapable of doing a bad job in a role. The special effects continue to hold up really nicely. This is an epic and a classic. A must-see film.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apollo 13 (1995): Dir: Ron Howard / Cast: Tom Hanks, Kathleen Quinlan, Ed Harris, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon: Stunning and overwhelming achievement about the Apollo flight crew launched into space and the oxygen tank that blows out the side of the spacecraft. This puts them in jeopardy of dying deep in space. They communicate with Houston in hopes of guidance home. Their loved ones watch with uncertain hope as the media broadcasts their progress. Emotional film experience by director Ron Howard who previously made such insightful films as Parenthood and The Paper. Tom Hanks leads the mission and imagines himself stepping onto the moon. Kathleen Quinlan plays his wife who awaits news. After that her role is pretty much limited to waiting and hoping. Ed Harris is commanding as the mission control communicator whose role is straight forward but quite insightful. Gary Sinise was originally assigned to the flight but rejected due to an illness. Next to Hanks he is the second most interesting performance in the film as he is now positioned to lend an important hand in bringing the crew home. Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton play the other two astronauts stranded within the ominous wonders of space. With exquisite production and visual scenery of space and the moon, it becomes a superb portrayal of the events that hits home in more ways than one. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is a space movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apollo 13 is one of the films that got me into watching movies in the first place. I love it. There are three things that I love about the movie: the direction, the acting, and the premise of it. Ron Howard is a great director. He knew what he was doing in this film and kept it going all the way. His direction towards the story is brilliantly executed and well thought-out. With his collaboration with Brian Grazer, they made the impossible possible. The acting was amazing through out the film. Tom Hanks delivers his character very well. Kathleen Quinlan carries her supporting role very good. The rest of the cast fits in with roles that they were given and they were great. The premise of the movie is based off of a true story. Apollo 13 has suffered a major malfunction in space putting the lives of the three astronauts in jeopardy and NASA must find a way to back them back home. That is the premise of the movie: story. In the end Apollo 13 won two Oscar awards for Best Sound and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for seven Oscar awards including Best Picture making this the first space movie to have ever received an Oscar nomination for Best Piecture. But overall I love this movie. Great script, awesome direction, amazing acting, and couple of special effects that don't feel overused but necessary. I would recommend to you to watch this movie because it will keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie came out almost 20 years ago, so going in I was a bit worried the movie wouldn't hold up effects wise. And that I had been spoiled by the recent space movies such as Gravity, Star Trek, or even Man of Steel. While technology has come a long way since 1995, I think Apollo 13 does hold up. And that is thanks to director Ron Howard and the entire cast of the film.When I say entire cast, I mean it. There are a number of great actors who were involved with the overall greatness that this movie was. Ed Harris is once again the bright spot of the film. He can do no wrong in any role, and Gene Kranz is one of his most iconic roles. This role even helped him get the speaking only part in Gravity. Hanks, Paxton, and Bacon formed a good trio inside the spaceship, though I would preferred Sinise. Sadly it does take awhile to get into space, a near 40 minutes before lift off. I understand you need to set up the emotional side with the family before capturing our heart strings in the final 15 minutes. But to do that you also need to have capable cast members as the family. Which in my opinion were the major weak spot. You don't really get to know the children at all, and Hank's wife doesn't do anything that we haven't seen out of worried family member. It just wasn't what ill remember this film for. I will remember it for showing the amount of hard work that hundreds and probably thousands of people had to do to save 3 people. It just shows you what a little teamwork can do.I thought the pacing was nice, especially for a 2hr 20 minute film. I also found it fascinating how many steps go into just one particular task while aboard a spaceship. Comparing it to one of my favorite films Gravity, there's a lot more going on. But Gravity's story is probably more remarkable because it was just one person. It isn't a true story like this one so when a miracle happens in the film, you know you're watching something that has actually happen. Where would I put this amongst the all-time space films? Not sure, but it would have to crack the top 10. At least until Interstellar comes along.So in all, with a tremendous cast with a truly unbelievable story, this film can be enjoyable and thrilling at the same time. Just remember that this happened and that human beings were able to pull through that day and save human lives.+Great ensemble cast +Thousands save three +Pacing +Score -Family members didn't care about8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, and Satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A downfall to creating a film based off of well known true events is that the conclusion is spoiled, therefore, leaving little in the conclusion that is unexpected. Therefore, these kinds of films tend to rely more on the journey to provide the emotional umph, then the actual conclusion. When the film is made to be suspenseful, this doesn't always work so well. Films like Valkyrie shows us how this can fail. Films like Apollo 13 shows us how it can work.Three astronauts, named Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise, find themselves in a dangerous predicament when after blasting off into space, begin having extreme rocket malfunctions. Problem after problem occurs, and things are seeming really, really bleak. With just about everything going wrong, it's a frantic survival tale, where the three men are desperately fighting for their lives.Despite being based off of well known true events, Apollo 13 still provides a suspenseful ride. Though the first half-hour or so is a bit slow, the pace quickly picks up quite a bit, and the film rarely feels long after that. This is quite an accomplishment for a film that's nearly 2 and a half hours long.Despite being a highly suspenseful and exciting film, Apollo 13 is not what one might consider a "joy ride." The emotional aspect of the film keeps us in pain and sadness for the families waiting to hear whether their husbands and fathers will return from space alive. And of course, worrying families aren't comforted by exaggerating media that are squeezing every last drop of suspense out of the already emotionally taxing situation. By playing a more stressful and tragic game with the family's involvement, Apollo 13 becomes a more intelligent and thoughtful film than it might've been otherwise.The families aren't the only stressful aspect the film plays from. Back at Mission Control, the entire staff is frantically trying to find a way to guide the astronauts back home. Going with little sleep and lots of coffee, each small victory is a reason for celebration, though there are no rests until the men are safely back.Solid acting further assists this. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton, as Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise respectively are very good in their roles, as is Ed Harris as the Apollo 13 Flight Director, Gene Kranz. The standout here, however, is Jim's wife, Marilyn, played by Kathleen Quinlan. She portrays a distraught and pained wife in a performance that we truly believe. There's some deceptive depth in this role, and Quinlan nails it.The visuals are quite nice. While not particularly breathtaking, the effects look good, and they look real. The zero gravity effects specifically are very good. It's certainly a breath of fresh air from the often excessive CGI effects in film today. The score, by James Horner, is good, but it's an interesting approach to the film. While one might expect a film in space to have a much more grand score, James Horner composes a less loud and brassy score. While there are moments of triumph in the music, they come less often then one might have expected. Also, in moments of high tension (and there are several), Horner takes another interesting approach to the music. Rather than composing pieces at higher tempos, these pieces are usually played at a slower speed, letting the on screen action carry most of the tension. Whether this is a plus or a minus is up to your own tastes.Apollo 13 is a well made and well acted film. Told with suspense and precision, this is a fine example of true event films done right. Still, while there's not much here in the way of flaws (though some might argue that it's a bit repetitive), Apollo 13 also just misses being a truly great film. It's certainly an enjoyable one, and making a 2 hour film endurable is an achievement in itself, but I couldn't help but wonder while I was watching Apollo 13, why I wasn't loving it. The funny thing is now that I've seen the film, I still couldn't tell you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Made Drama Full of Great Tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apollo 13 (1995)**** (out of 4) Ron Howard's excellent re-enactment of the Apollo 13 mission, which left three astronauts in space with a damaged ship and not knowing if they'd be able to return to Earth. It's always a wonderful achievement whenever a filmmaker can take a story that everyone knows the outcome to and still manage to make it intense. APOLLO 13 is without question one of the most intense films you're ever going to watch because as soon as the trouble starts in space, you the viewer, are pretty much curled up in a ball worried about every other problem that pops up throughout their situation. It's really amazing when you think how intense it is to just watch a movie so just imagine what it would be like really being up there not knowing your fate or being a family member on the ground not knowing if they are going to see their loved ones again. Director Howard perfectly mixes in these personal dramas with the stuff going on in space and I thought he did a wonderful job at balancing the two. Needless to say, the most amazing stuff happens in space as we see the three men trying to work their way out of the situation. How the film bounces from them to the families to the people in the control center is just remarkable to watch and the level of drama is just so high. Another major plus are the terrific performances. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan are just flawless in their work but so is the rest of the cast even down to the smallest role. APOLLO 13 is great entertainment that works on pretty much all levels and is without question one of the best of its type.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard is right in his comfort zone in this dramatic retelling of an early NASA near-disaster, with a bevy of strong characters to play with, volatile situations to work through and nostalgic heartstrings to tug at. Backed by an all-star cast and an excellent script, it's a lesson in efficient, powerful big-event storytelling. Tom Hanks and Ed Harris are especially convincing as commander of the crippled spacecraft and the flight director in charge of his safe return, respectively. Like you might expect from a Hanks / Howard collaboration, it has more than its share of soft-hearted emotions, but a good sense of humor and convincing special effects help to compensate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" This mission will be known as America's most successful, failure "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is 1970 and the U. S. is used to the fact, America's space program is brilliantly successful and it's space trips to the Moon have become routine. However, just when the U.S. becomes complacent about it's achievements, disaster strikes. According to the book written by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, a faulty circuit built into the wiring aboard their space vehicle two years before their scheduled trip, a problem was waiting to endanger their mission. Ron Howard the gifted actor/director creates a real-life historical drama with this film called " Apollo 13. " Nearly a quarter of a million miles into space, the astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and rookie Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) experience a major explosion aboard this space craft and within minutes realize they may not only not reach the moon, but are in danger of dying before they get there. Their only hope is that the ground team at the Huston Space center can somehow discover a way to help them get home. Despite the fact there are several special teams who help the astronauts' convert their landing craft to become a life-line, none of it would have mattered had it not been for Astronaut Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise). His expertise and computer knowledge is incredible and one applause's his tireless efforts. The film itself is a tribute to the courage and fortitude of the families and their daunting task of trying not to show their fear in front of a plethora of newsmen, media correspondences and T.V. reporters who lay siege to their homes. The movie is exciting and sympathetically poignant as the audience joins the three men in a life and death struggle. This movie is a triumph not only for the actors, the director, but also for the space program which endures to this day as America's finest. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could anyone possibly want beyond "Apollo 13" for a historical movie? Nothing at all. Perfection is the only quality that could be attached to this masterpiece.Starting by the HUNDREDS of zero G parabolas in the Vomit Comet. My goodness! The soundtrack, the performances, spacecraft interiors, Houston control - Everything! Everything hits the mark!I remember praying to God every night when I was child, along my mom and my sister, for the safe return of the three astronauts. It was a great joy when they came back safe and sound. The movie entirely honors that unique event in space flight and all those who lived an died to conquer the space.While "Apollo 13 the actual mission" was a "sucessful failure", "Apollo 13 the movie" was a "superlatively successful success".There are movies that, however great, you don't feel like watching more than once. There are others that are not necessarily that good, but I feel like watching again and again. "Apollo 13" is great, and I never get tired of watching it whenever it's aired.If you haven't seen it yet, give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Let's work the problem, people!" - Gene Kranz Man builds rocket. Man sends rocket to the moon. Rocket malfunctions. Man forced to bring rocket back down to Earth. Man encounters a series of errors, problems and hurdles, which man must overcome if the rocket's astronauts hope to survive. Man uses his genius, perseverance and ingenuity to solve each problem. Man's rocket lands safely in the ocean. Everyone happy.What we have here is really a story of mankind triumphing over fate (13 literally being the bad the luck number), chance and human error. It's a simple tale, but it's well told, despite a few moments where director Ron Howard can't resist spreading on thick layers of syrupy Americana. The casting of Hanks here, and the hokey music, would heavily influence Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan".8/10 ? Ron Howard's best film, "Appolo 13" is filled with some tense moments and a good message. But though it unashamedly salutes NASA and "national heroism", Howard missteps by laying on super-thick melodrama (why is Bill Paxton's character portrayed as a snivelling softy?), mushy sentiment and needless flag-waving. Phillip Kaufman's 1983 astronaut epic, "The Right Stuff" , handled this material in a much more interesting manner, with its ironic look at the US space program and America's obsession with "conquering boundaries".Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

And the movie manages to portray that with some emotion, but not over the top sentimentality. The men involved were heroes no doubt about it.

This movie is uplifting in a way that we all need to feel a little bit better about ourselves, and as as a country whose people know how to suck it up and get 'er done. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton are superb in their roles as Astronauts doing their jobs and systematically meeting the incredible challenge that confronts them head on. Ed Harris is no less perfectly cast as the stoic but steady hand at the helm to guide the efforts to bring the ship safely to shore. Ron Howard's direction, although heavy handed at times, stays the course by intertwining and humanizing the lives of all those involved in this historic event in US space exploration. The photography and special effects are, well, special. Not over the top or cartooninsh but as they should be...an enhancement to an already dramatic story. If you've seen this movie before, see it again, it really is quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood re-telling at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great thing about 'Apollo 13' is that it tells a true story essentially as it happened, one that most people over a certain age are at least somewhat familiar, a story of which everyone knows the ending, and yet makes it as fresh and exciting and even tear-jerking as if the idea had just popped out of some talented screenwriter's head. It is no small achievement that the movie takes stiff real-life dialogue and even some lame 'true' jokes and by sheer screen presence and charisma of its stars again makes all of it sparkle, not to mention the traumatic scenes in space of the crippled spacecraft as it wobbles its way back to Earth. It is fair to say 'Apollo 13' makes its story much more exciting than it seemed in real life, which somehow just doesn't seem right, but which feels like an unimportant thing to worry about while you're watching it. Part of this success I think is due to the fact that most of us really DON'T (or didn't) know the whole story of what happened on this space flight. I know I was shocked to realize just how badly the spacecraft was damaged in the initial explosion; one whole side was ripped away. Given what the astronauts and NASA had to work with at the time in terms of technology, and witnessing as we have even greater tragedies since with the space shuttle, it really is nothing less than a miracle the three men made it back to Earth safely. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon are all fine as the astronauts; each gets to be heroic at various points in the film though there is subtle stereotyping: Hanks as Commander Jim Lovell is level-headed, compassionate, almost too good to be true (the film is based on Lovell's book); Paxton's Fred Haise is quite ill during much of the flight and puts up a brave front but, well, he's no Lovell; and Bacon portrays Jack Swigert, who garners nearly everyone's resentment as a hotshot young pilot, a last-minute replacement for the more respected Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise). Back on the ground in Mission Control, Ed Harris is wonderful to watch as Flight Director Gene Kranz, and 'director' is a good description of his role- he orchestrates the rescue effort, cool, determined, confident. The scenes in space are quite convincing, many of them shot in weightlessness, and convey believably the crisis which faced the crew and their counterparts on Earth. I didn't realize how good a film 'Apollo 13' was until I watched it the other night for the first time in about five years. It is an uncommon example of Hollywood telling a 'true story' and getting it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Successful Failure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Desite a few sizable flaws, APOLLO 13 is a great romp. Ron Howard's riveting and dramatic APOLLO 13, a terrific recreation of the famous events NASA near-failure, should be the answer to all those questions thrown in by those too young or too old to remember that fateful day when NASA's "routine" flight to the moon turns into the most memorably tragic one in their careers. Adapting from the novel "Lost Moon" by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, screenwriter William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert has written a riveting and gripping screenplay toying with the techno-jargon and human drama of the fateful days of the monumental disaster, while Howard stuck to the facts. From using the real newsreel footage covering the entire event to realistic images of space, Howard has created a perfect realization that captures the tension and especially the drama.As for the casting, nothing could be more flawless with the casting of Tom Hanks as astronaut Jim Lovell (by the way, the real Jim Lovell actually makes a cameo somewhere in the film) who dreams of the stars and sees the chance to reach it when he is tasked to be one of the astronauts manning the Apollo 13 mission. Bill Paxton plays Fred Haise while Kevin Bacon plays Jack Swigert, the last minute replacement of Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), believed to have drug complications. Kathleen Quinlan, however, provides what may be the film's more challenging performance as Lovell's wife Barbara, who experiences the dread, fear and drama back on earth as his husband and two of his companions are trapped inside the bowels of the crippled ship Odyssey, slowly running out of fuel and oxygen, aiding the help of Mission Control, led by Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), back at NASA.The pacing is a little slow during the first hour, but everything picks up real quickly as Howard jump-starts the tragic events. While we are already familiar about the splashdown ending, Howard and screenplay keeps audiences' palms sweaty with suspense and tension. This is because the characters are so involving, we let ourselves carried away by them, and what happens to them. From the endless commotion going on inside The Odyssey to the drama back on earth with Lovell's wife and family, APOLLO 13 keeps us right up there with them, from lift-off to splashdown.Excellent cinematography by Dean Cundey and an excellent score by James Horner are just among the final touches that make APOLLO 13 the best in pure "you were there" entertainment.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies based on true stories do have one strike against them, and it's we know how it ends. Apollo 13 overcomes this problem to become a terrific, suspenseful space opera staring American astronauts that we know came back to Earth. But during the most trying times of the aborted 1970 mission to the Moon, the audience is questioning themselves if they really make it or not. The appeal of Apollo 13 also comes from the benefit of actually being shot in zero-gravity conditions. No special effects here, the no gravity you see was the no gravity the actors and the crew experienced, thanks to help from the NASA airplane known as the "Comet Vomet." But I believe the real lure of Apollo 13 is how Director Ron Howard made these heroes, these spacemen, real men who had to deal with a real problem. Everyone, from the men just a couple of miles above the lunar surface to the guys who put the carbon monoxide filters together, had to come together to bring home "NASA's most successful failure." From the musical score to the claustrophobic feel of the space capsule suggest suspense, and will these men really make it. They do, we know that. But there is always that doubt...</fullReview>

Much of the movie was filmed in a zero gravity airplane. this is definately my favorite tom hanks movie. The DVD includes wonderful bonus features including commentary by director ron howard and a second commentary by jim and marylin lovell. it also includes the origional trailer and an hour long behind the scenes featurette. Even though i already knew the outcome of the movie, Ron Howard finds a way of keeeping you on the edge of your seat throughout much of the movie. this is a must for any aviation or space enthusiest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding human achievement (a few spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was drawn to this film when it came out because of my interest in astronomy and space. While I recognize the enormous achievement in even sending people to the vicinity of the moon-- much less landing on the moon and returning home several times-- I was too young to remember the feelings of awe and excitement that must have accompanied the moon landings.In a way it is sad that the one unsuccessful Apollo mission would be the one made into a hit movie-- but the movie brought out such a range of emotions (like most good movies do, in my opinion): a child's curiosity, the overwhelming excitement mixed with apprehension and fear of the adults, and the way public apathy suddenly gave way to intense interest. For those of us who were too young to remember, the movie gives a good brief introduction into the culture and politics of the day. But the thing that struck me the most was the primitive state of technology that brought men to within inches of the moon in that day: I have to say the shots of calculations being done by slide rule and pencil and paper nearly brought me to tears.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another user here at IMDB asked what a Main Bus-B Undervolt was. In the Apollo CSM's, whenever there was a substantial loss of power in one of the fuel cells, it would register on the panel as an undervolt. On Apollo 13, they lost two fuel cells. As a matter of fact, they lost four major systems--an unheard of disaster, and an outcome which could have rivaled the tragedy of Apollo One, were it not for the massive rescue efforts that were launched on Earth.Yet they did make it back. And this docudrama by Ron Howard is one of the all time, great space epics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can remember well the time period of the APollo 13 flight, called by James Lovell a "successful failure", in that the crew did not reach the moon BUT-- despite the serious malfunction, got home safely. It was very dramatic, protrayed history far more accurately than can be gleaned out of a textbook. That is why historical drama IS my #1 favorite type of movie. The comment that the astronaut is the most visible member of the space program, but that the sweeper of floors at the Space Center counts, puts positive note on the space program. Not everybody can be an astronaut; one needs flight trainin g, advanced degreee in science, etc\., but the remark about others' being important gives encouragement to those aspiring to career in the space program.

		<fullReview>I've seen "Apollo 13" a few times now, and even with two sets of DVD commentary and a fine documentary under my belt, I can't exactly say what took place. They call it a "Main Bus B Undervolt," but whatever the case, it cripples the spacecraft Apollo 13 just as it is about to reach the moon, forcing the crew to abandon their mission and undergo some hasty improvisations in order to make it back to Earth alive.There's a lot of technical jargon spewed in this film, not as much as was actually uttered on the spacecraft and at Mission Control in Houston, but enough to befuddle those of us who dozed off in science class back in high school. Still, I enjoyed this film, even when I didn't quite understand it.Tom Hanks stars as steady-in-zero-G Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, successfully underplaying the heroics without losing the dramatic urgency of the moment. Early in the movie, we see him joke with his wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) with the sort of easy banter those of us who have followed him since "Bosom Buddies" are accustomed to. There's a funny scene early on, as he watches the Apollo 11 landing with a roomful of simultaneously proud and jealous fellow astronauts, all yelling at the television to abort seconds before Neil Armstrong takes his one small step for man. It's funny because they all wanted to be first on the moon, and also, in a ghoulish kind of prefiguring way, because aborting the mission is exactly what is going to happen to poor Jim.There's also an early scene between Lovell and his youngest son, when the father is asked if he knew the crew of Apollo 1, who perished in a capsule fire scene in an opening sequence. Hanks answers matter-of-factly, with a mesmerizing combination of steely control and compassion for what his child is experiencing. There's a lot going on under the surface, and while it's my favorite scene, it's easy to miss. Many good moments like that are sprinkled like stardust throughout the picture.The movie is a fine, solid piece of entertainment, a little loose with the facts but essentially true to what Apollo 13 was about, but what makes this especially recommendable is the DVD, particularly the commentary track by the real Jim and Marilyn Lovell (SPOILER ALERT: He did survive.) At one point, when the film has Hanks imagining himself landing on the moon, the real Marilyn Lovoll audibly breaks down as she describes her sadness that her husband would never have this moment in reality (though what he got instead, however harrowing, turned out to be far more memorable than merely being Moon Man #5.) Jim himself is laconic as he fills in gaps in the storyline and explains where the film took liberties, meanwhile giving us a sense of where Hanks got his character from. For that, and many other reasons, this is a prize DVD for anyone's collection.A good feeling for the period abounds. We see smoking in the control room, miniskirts, floral upholstery, and ugly shagwall sideburns. The Lovells' oldest daughter has a conniption the day of the launch because the Beatles have just broken up, one of the things the Lovells address as a liberty in their commentary (she wasn't that much of a Beatles fan) but does make sense, because April 1970 was the month Paul McCartney announced the end of the band.Director Ron Howard piles on the technical detail. He wants us to understand just how tough it was to get Apollo 13 back, on enough power to barely run a coffee machine. He doesn't shirk from showing us a control room that is stacked to the rafters with what Howard himself calls "techno-nerds with pocket protectors" who emerge as real heroes in one of NASA's darkest hours. You have Todd Louiso from "High Fidelity," Val Kilmer's buddy from "Real Genius" (Gabe Jarrett), even Clint Howard, Ron's brother, perhaps filmdom's uber-nerd.Nepotism is a good thing here. Not only does Clint have a good scene explaining to flight director Ed Harris that the moonshot is kaput and they will have their hands full just bringing the crew home, but their late mother Jean Speegle Howard shines as Jim Lovell's stroke-addled matriarch, delivering two of the film's best lines.I'm not crazy about "Apollo 13," but I like it a lot, and I find myself liking it more the more I watch it. Ron Howard movies tend to push for maximum uplift, and the manipulation can be annoying, but here he seems to pull back on that while focusing on the human equation at the heart of the story. Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinese and especially Harris and Quinlan give excellent support for one of Hanks' best star vehicles, all the more a vehicle because Hanks serves the story rather than tries to make the story serve him.Hanks was inspired enough by this experience to do a series of critically-acclaimed mini-films documenting the Apollo program. You might be inspired enough to visit your local library, or do some Googling online. It's not `Gone With The Wind,' but as a history/science lesson, `Apollo 13' is a damn fine piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Each time I view this film, I can't help but be drawn into the action. I am amazed at the few who have written of the dull direction of the dialogue, or the so-called cheesy effects."Apollo 13" effectively retells the true story of a near-disaster in space. I think that people today have been spoiled by the canned summer 'blockbuster'. They're told when to jump, laugh, or cry. When I hear comparisons to "Armageddon", I laugh. That was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen.The actors did an amazing job. Tom Hanks brings his full talent to this role. Unassuming, subdued at times, he brings gravity to the storyline. Astronauts are in reality scientists, engineers, and skilled pilots, so there's going to be jargon. Well used in this film, I think. We've become accustomed to the sci-fi myth that flying in space is as easy as jumping on the expressway. It's not.The camera work in "Apollo 13" was what made this movie. One truly grasped the claustrophobic feeling of the command/lunar module. The extreme close ups that Ron Howard uses, in conjunction with the real weightless effects, kept me at the edge of my seat. All this, even though I knew how everything would turn out.I do find this to be a patriotic piece, as has been pointed out by the mostly foreign input here. They forget that this was a true story. In 1970 we were deep in the Cold War. The lines were pretty clear then. You were with us, or you were against us. A little flag waving is appropriate here."Apollo 13" ranks as one of the finest docudramas ever made. If you're a fan of the space program, or fine acting with real suspense, add this one to your library</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just purchased the Collector's Edition DVD, and I'm somewhat ashamed of myself for a) waiting this long and b) buying it used.This was my first time viewing the film digitally (after seeing it once in the theater and countless times on VHS) and I must say that, with the DVD format's perfect picture &amp; sound quality, I felt like I was seeing this perfect film for the very first time!As someone who has followed the Space Program closely all his life, I consider this to be the most accurate depiction of manned spaceflight ever committed to film, and feel it should be considered an historical document, rather than "just a movie".It breaks my heart when I see comments from uninformed &amp; uninspired individuals, who come out of the woodwork for the sole purpose of spitting bile on this masterpiece, inventing flaws where none exist.I know how NASA personnel behave and communicate, and these performances were absolutely flawless. The recreation of all the hardware and locations was perfect in every detail, which had never been attempted before, nor had the concept of generating ACTUAL weightlessness inside a KC-135 flying a parabolic trajectory!People complain that... ...the dialog was too technical, when in fact it was "dumbed down" quite a bit! If you're having trouble understanding what's being said... READ A BOOK! ...the ending was known! Ah, but the tale was not! It was a true Odyssey: "a long journey marked by many changes in fortune."The sheer magnitude of effort pumped into this film, and the obvious love and care displayed by each and every member of the cast and crew for the subject at hand, deserves much better than the merciless apathy it's been getting here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly remarkable film. You could argue that Ron Howard had an easy job, given the source material, but this is so much more than a documentary of what happened to Apollo 13.These days, men like Dennis Tito can pay to go into space; in two decades or so it may be no more remarkable than flying between continents. This film is a celebration of a different era, and the remarkable individuals that made it happen. Watching the problems the crew are faced with, and the solutions they come up with (with a little help from their friends at Houston) makes me proud to be a human being - that's the effect this film has on me.Then I think of the layers of bureaucracy and mismanagement that have since come to represent NASA, and I wonder if a similar crew would survive if they faced the same problems today.The story itself is standard fare - a group of people must overcome technical obstacles and personal differences in order to survive in the face of unlikely odds - but you're never allowed to forget that it all happened for real. The fact that we already know the outcome doesn't reduce the tension - quite the opposite in fact. Because these are real people, the problems they have to deal with, and the emotions they have to go through, matter so much more.This is a story that everyone should be told. If you get the chance, see it at an IMAX theatre - I've heard it's awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the very few movies that go very deep. This is way beyond entertainment. It is a document, not your average documentary film.What looks like American patriotism at a first glance is in reality nothing but people rooting for the human race in general. What an achievement to bring back these astronauts alive. I remember the real event. I was age 9.One of my favorite scenes is when the team of astronauts walk their lonely way into the spacecraft and we see it from a distance. Then we hear a solo trumpet within the wonderful musical score accompanying these men and we are aware of the incredible scope and importance of this mission - and of the incredible courage of a few men.It is very hard for me to really judge this movie since I always look through the actors and see the real men and the real story behind them.The special effects are O.K. but we can see clearly that CGI still has a long way to go until it will be able to produce 100% convincing images. Nevertheless the launch sequence is great as we see it from a camera angle that is freely flying through the dramatic event. Hopefully they will replace it in, say, another 10 years - as George Lucas did with the Star Wars trilogy - with better technology when it can be done 100% convincingly.Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton and Gary Sinise are enjoyable but try a a bit too hard for my taste. Tom Hanks and Ed Harris are natural talents and enlighten the movie as they always do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To my mind, "Apollo 13" is Ron Howard's masterpiece. That it is a largely factual retelling of an historic event makes it even more remarkable. I was riveted from beginning to end. Tom Hanks, as Jim Lovell, and Gary Sinese, as Ken Mattingly, were perfectly cast. Nobody puts images on film that tell a story dramatically and well better than Ron Howard. In this connection, the reason that the sequences showing the astronauts floating were so effective is that the actors really were weightless. Howard arranged to have airlines fly parabolar orbits so that a little more than twenty seconds of weightlessness could be achieved, during which time he filmed the weightlessness sequences. 10 out of 10. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If summer blockbusters were collectively defined as a person then 1995's cache would be Victor Meldrew: Tired, irascible and beset by problems.Batman Forever was a glossy and forgettable romp; Die Hard With A Vengeance a fuel-injected monster that turned cops and robbers into a Ben Hur style adventure. Then there was Waterworld and Judge Dredd, two sci-fi adventures which cost about the same as the Third World debt and yet delivered so little.They were all modest successes plagued by mishaps - the whole floating set of Waterworld sunk - but there was a definite sense of Hollywood losing its way without the likes of James Cameron, Steven Spielberg or George Lucas to show them the way. Luckily for Apollo 13, Ron Howard - a Lucas protege - decided to stick to a more realistic subject matter than those caped crusaders or moist Mad Maxes.With the help of Cameron's effects company Digital Domain and the Midas touch of Tom Hanks (as Jim Lovell), Howard brought to the big screen a gripping tale of three astronauts trying to get back to earth when all hell breaks loose on their eponymous spacecraft.On a critical level, Apollo 13 succeeded where so many other movies failed by spending a little more time on the characters than on the derivative eye candy. It also tapped into the nostalgic hopes and fears of so many people growing up watching those fuzzy black and white news reports in the late Sixties and early Seventies.The Apollo moonshots were ripe for Hollywood exploitation so it seems strange that no-one had attempted the programme's ill-fated adventure earlier. If landing on the moon was part of the American dream, then this was, without doubt, the American nightmare. Watching how the crew at NASA - led by the excellent Ed Harris - solve the problem of getting the desperate astronauts back home with next to no fuel and far from compliant equipment will leave your heart in your mouth.Although the third act was written in reality 30 years ago, Howard has you gripped throughout, partly because he went to extraordinary lengths to achieve a degree of realism for the movie. While effects could successfully remove any wires holding up actors these days, many of the zero gravity effects were achieved by taking cast and crew up in a special aircraft and then filming certain scenes while the plane went into a zero G nose-dive.If you're a gadgets whiz, then chances are you'll already be watching in ear shattering stereo but if not then it might be time to invest in the relevant equipment - if only for that launch scene.As Apollo 13's engines fire and ice breaks away from the body of the craft, you'll be slack of jaw as the sound crew give you the sort of experience only usually possible by strapping your head to the space shuttle.For that alone, it's an unmissable experience. Watch it all and you may need a good lie down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apollo 13 shows how well structured NASA was during the Apollo program of the '60s and '70s. The administrators, flight directors, and mission control crew were capable of making quick decisions and therefore were able save the lives of the crew 200,000 miles from the earth. I believe the most important moment is when Lovell wonders when we will go back to the moon. After the Apollo program NASA started to lose public interest while overlooking major design flaws in its spacecraft (which led to the Challenger disaster). Only recently has the public started to take interest again with the Mars Pathfinder and John Glenn's return to space. Apollo 13 shows us how NASA worked then, and insight on how it can work in the future.The acting was great particularly by Hanks who in real life has a deep interest in the space program. The character of Deke Slayton (my favorite astronaut!) was well played, except for the fact that he should have had a Wisconsin accent. Deke is portrayed as someone who knew how to lay down the law, but at the same time he truly cared about the astronauts who worked for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apollo 13**** (out of 4)136 mins / PGCast: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade, Jean Speegle Howard, Chris Ellis, David Andrews, Joe SpanoDirector: Ron HowardPlot: Three astronauts on Apollo 13 must survive and return to Earth after the spacecraft begins to malfunction. JJ's Verdict: What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines "Houston, we have a problem", Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects.Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apollo 13 is a rare Hollywood film that gets onto our nerves and lifts our spirits with equal aplomb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring a superb cast including Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris, Apollo 13 is a dramatic account of the 1970 NASA space mission to the Moon that met with a critical problem midflight, putting the lives of the astronauts in very grave danger. But they managed to return back to Earth out of sheer determination, bravery, and luck, with coordinated help from a much focused ground team. Capturing the attention of the world at that time, the survival of these astronauts was one of the great moments of the 20th century.This is unmistakably a film about the triumph of the human spirit, of Man's innate determination to survive no matter how bleak the circumstances are. Directed by Ron Howard, Apollo 13 stands tall among other exemplary examples of inspirational cinema, and despite many of the sequences being rendered with CG visual effects, it remains to be an affecting human story of substantial worth. Deservedly nominated for nine Oscars including Best Picture, Apollo 13 also features a splendid score by James Horner, who also scored for Braveheart (1995) in the same year.Ron Howard is a fine director, albeit without a unique style to call his own. Although he is quite inconsistent with his output, Apollo 13 ranks as one of his top films alongside considerable efforts such as A Beautiful Mind (2001), and Frost/Nixon (2008). His lucid switching among sequences in space with Jim Lovell (Hanks) and his men, sequences in the chaotic ground control station with Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), and sequences shot from the perspective of the astronauts' worried loved ones gives the film a kind of understated wave of human drama that rises and falls complementarily.The most exhilarating sequence from Apollo 13 is without doubt the launch of the rocket. The visual effects are respectable for a mid- nineties film though it seems more dated with each viewing. It is the sound mixing, however, that truly transforms the film into an extraordinary experience, as if the viewer is brought to the site of the launch. Despite viewers knowing how the story ends, Howard manages to create one of the most nail-biting climaxes in American nineties cinema ? the anticipation of the astronauts' pod emerging in the sky after more than three minutes of transmission silence as it cuts and burns through the Earth's atmosphere.The joy and sheer relief of everyone matched by the soaring main theme of Horner's score after the emergence of the pod will make even the most emotionally-hardened viewer pump his or her fist into the air. Apollo 13 is a rare Hollywood film that gets onto our nerves and lifts our spirits with equal aplomb. Watch it for that experience.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The near tragic flight of unlucky Apollo 13 galvanized (at least for the duration of the crisis) a nation grown predictably bored with the Space Race after Neil Armstrong's historic one small step on the Sea of Tranquillity one year earlier. But its unlikely Ron Howard's dramatic re-enactment will have the same effect on moviegoers, however well crafted and exciting it can be. The trio of marooned astronauts is shown responding to their predicament with not unexpected fortitude, but the film correctly identifies the true heroes as the aerospace engineers who improvised a series of life-saving maneuvers using slide rules, string, and sealing wax. The best moments, as a result, are those at Mission Control in Houston, and the near documentary flavor of these scenes generates surprising tension for such a familiar scenario (facts aside, the outcome is never in doubt: high caliber stars like Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon would never be allowed the indignity of a slow death in outer space). Too bad the suspense is then diluted by constant cross-cutting to flight commander Jim Lovell's anxious family: Kathleen Quinlan may in fact be the real hero of the film for enduring such a thankless token role (Mrs. Lovell's lonely vigil was certainly every bit as brave as her husband's ordeal, but it belongs in another movie altogether). The screenplay, credited to three writers (including 11th hour script doctor John Sayles) leans hard on space cowboy techno-jargon, but at least it's convincing. Someone obviously did his homework, and co-writer Al Reinert's experience making the 1990 documentary 'For All Mankind' (for which he watched five million feet of NASA Apollo footage) was obviously a boon.</fullReview>

Tom Hank said he was a fan of the space program, and I believe it, his acting on this one rival's his on Saving Private Ryan. He really made a great job on it, and no other Hollywood actor is the real Jim Lovell. Ed Harris for Eugene Kranz? Perfect choice. Kevin Bacon looks almost exactly like Swigert, and Bill Paxton looks a lot like Fred Haise. In short, well done! Maybe they could all get together and make something for the Space Shuttle Astronauts in the 1980's, ever read Mike Mullane's 'Riding rockets', would make a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was well-made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was well-done and Oscar-worthy. Apollo 13 was based on a true incident that happened in 1970. According to my family, this movie depicted the actual events very well. It is about a three-man crew who went up in space to visit the moon. They never made it to the moon. Just about everything in the ship blew up and caused problems. They eventually made it safe home. I thought the acting and directing was great. Ron Howard really knew what he was doing. Tom Hanks and Ed Harris leads a Oscar-worthy cast that can be found in very few other movies. I thought that the score fitted well with the movie. The script was good and so was everything else. If you have not seen this film, you had better see this film. I loved this movie so I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who were not born when the Apollo space program was running, like myself, may often wonder what it was like. How did the astronauts train? What did the inside of the lunar module or command module look like? How big was a Saturn V rocket? "Apollo 13" answers all these questions and more.Using computer graphics, the infamous "Vomit Comet", and realistic sets, this movie conveys what it was like aboard an Apollo spacecraft. The liftoff is breathtaking, with multiple views of the size and grandeur of the Saturn V rocket. Inside the spacecraft one sees the benefits (and drawbacks) of weightlessness. There's even a simulator in which the astronauts train for maneuvers they must perform during the mission. The movie is a "behind-the-scenes" look at the NASA space program in the 1960's and 1970's, giving all those not present at the time an idea of what it must have been like.The cast was worthy of such a project. Tom Hanks is Commander Jim Lovell, an experienced space voyager who wishes to land on the moon. Fred Haise (played by Bill Paxton) will accompany Lovell down to the surface as the lunar pilot. Ken Mattingly (played by Gary Sinise) is slated to be the command module pilot, who will orbit the moon as Lovell and Haise land and explore the surface. Other notable cast members are Ed Harris, who plays the military-like Gene Kranz; Kathleen Quinlan (playing Marilyn Lovell, Jim Lovell's wife); and Kevin Bacon (playing Jack Swigert), the backup command module pilot for Ken Mattingly.The movie is quick, with a lot of technical terms. I highly recommend reading a few books about the Apollo-era beforehand, including "Apollo 13" (previously titled "Lost Moon"), on which the movie was based. The books will give you a better appreciation of what goes on in the movie.Just a warning: you won't watch this movie unaffected. It will make you wish you could be one of the space voyagers (despite the risks involved) or even just a spectator, watching as the mission events unfold. You may need to see the movie more than once to get everything; for me, it's been about a dozen times and I still see something new each time I watch.So run, don't walk to your nearest video store, pick up a VHS or DVD copy of "Apollo 13", and watch it as soon as possible! You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent. This is a true masterpiece, and a true showcase of what cinema should be.The big-name cast really packed a wallop. Truly great performances all around. It takes real talent to make a movie that, even though you know the ending, really puts you on the edge of your seat getting there.But that's only half the movie, as it is complemented by the stunning visual effects and brilliant soundtrack. A perfect example of this is the launch, which I consider to be one of the finest sequences on celluloid. If you did not think "wow" during that part, get yourself checked.In short, this is how a movie should be made.</fullReview>

Still, when it comes to the 3 minute wait towards the end of the movie,I keep my fingers crossed expecting the miracle to happen. At the end of 4 minute 30 second wait, when odyssey responds, the significance of the "moment" is summed up by the expression in Ed Harris eyes. MAN SECCEEDED IN FAILURE. It is this kind of movies we call great movies because even after so many years when one thinks of them, one can "feel" the situation. Shawshank redemption, Forrest Gump, Cast away, Gone with the wind, The Pianist, Schlindler's List to name a few.Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Ron Howard, and TOM HANKS wow what a combination.

		<shortDescription>Great movie making but misses the big picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie in 50 years will be viewed as a semi documentary of the Apollo 13 mission. Pity, because as a piece that claims to be accurate from a historic point of view it misses the mark by a wide margin. My main problem with the film is how the story and characters were changed for dramatic effect. The best example of this is Jack Swigert. In the film he was shown as an inexperienced rookie who had to constantly prove his worth. Meanwhile Ken Mattingly is shown to be the great hero and the only one who knows the command module well enough to save it. The truth is Jack Swigert wrote the emergency procedures for the command module, the very ones the crew used when the emergency happened. It was said they were lucky Swagert was on the flight as he was one of the best to handle the situation. Mattingly meanwhile was also a rookie astronaut and it was in fact Gene Cernan and other veteran astronauts who worked out the problems in the simulators. A good film that tries to be very accurate in the look and feel but fails to be accurate in it's script as it goes for old Hollywood dramatics instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant cast, masterful direction, and an excellent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first rented Apollo 13 on VHS 20 years ago I found myself to be easily distracted and my interest seemed to waver throughout the movie. I don't know why but that's just the way it happened. Fast forward to 20 years later and I made the right decision to hire out Apollo 13 on Blu-ray. Apollo 13 was a fantastic experience from start to finish and I gained a greater appreciation of the movie. Apart from the fact it was based on true events, you couldn't go wrong with a brilliant cast with the likes of Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise and Ed Harris. On top of that, the masterful Ron Howard has added another excellent movie to his stellar career.Following the success of Apollo 11 in which in a landmark event in history Neil Armstrong became the first man in history to step foot on the moon on 20 July, 1969, the titular Apollo 13 is destined to be the third lunar landing mission on the moon. The following year astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) are picked to be the crew members of Apollo 13 for a seemingly routine mission to the moon. Things go awry when an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power. Lovell's message to ground control changes everything when he announces the immortal words, "Houston, we have a problem". NASA's ground crew led by the no-nonsense Gene Krantz (Ed Harris) orders Apollo 13 to abort the Moon landing and along with original crew member Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) who was sidelined on medical grounds, spearheads the operation for the safe return of the three men back to Earth.Everything about Apollo 13 was excellent. Tom Hanks, riding high from the success of Forrest Gump (1994), is faultless as Jim Lovell. Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton and Ed Harris (who received a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor) are also perfectly cast in their respective roles.The late James Horner's score was beautifully done throughout the movie and fit in neatly. I found myself getting goosebumps from the opening score.Ron Howard who has come a long way from his days as Ritchie Cunningham from the TV series Happy Days has carved himself a brilliant career as a director. His attention to detail throughout his movies as well as his love of depicting historical events is a perfect fit for Apollo 13 and Ron Howard has done a superb job as a director.Apollo 13 was met with widespread critical acclaim as well as becoming one of the biggest box office hits of 1995. It is still deserving of its praise and I have grown very fond of Apollo 13. With a brilliant cast led by Tom Hanks, the masterful direction of Ron Howard, and a gripping story based on true events, Apollo 13 is still an excellent movie.9/10.</fullReview>

I think it was an accurate representation because of the ring being lost at the beginning of the film - we were surprised when we found out that was true.It was a tense and heart warming story.It was a phenomenal mix of incredible actors.It was a very adventurous story and a high flying film.It's historically accurate apart from the lighting in the space ship after the power was cut, but overall it was a good movie.It was a very good movie but when they went past the landing sight it would have been quite tricky to see - the perspective was unrealistic.It was good most of the time but when you were just about to think it was going to get better it didn't quite!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iconic...But Not Much Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From beginning to end, I wasn't particularly invested. While I do appreciate the technical accuracy (which makes up the majority of the dialogue), it certainly got redundant after an hour or so. From start to finish, "Apollo 13" is essentially a collection of set-up and pay-off; (1) we start in the capsule with the Apollo 13 crew and they run into a technical problem (2) we cut to Mission Control working on a procedure (3) meanwhile in the Lovell home (4) back to the capsule and how the astronauts are coping (5) Mission Control solves the problem (6) Apollo 13 works it out. And so it's essentially this repetitive chain of events, capturing the exhausting 5-day redundancy of the historical incident. Tom Hanks steals the show in one of his most iconic performances. The score by James Horner (R.I.P.) is terribly dated and at times too sentimental, but one of my favorite tracks captures the vastness and mystique of space. I was surprised at how well the special effects have held up. Props to Ron Howard and the effects department.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard has come a long way since his days as 'Opie Taylor' and 'Richie Cunningham,' even though those are great performances, too!This is not only a true story, but, also a spectacular and monumental breakthrough epic space adventure! This movie really is a monumental undertaking with a great story; great actors; great characters; and, great effects. In fact, the effects in this movie are so good that Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin (Apollo 11 and second man to walk on the moon after Commander Neil Armstrong) asked Ron Howard if NASA could use the launching footage.Although this was a 'failed' mission since the crew, Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and, John "Jack" Swigert never made it to the moon...they circled the moon and NASA set new safety standards and made monumental and noted achievements with a make-shift carbon dioxide removal system!This movie ranks among the-best-of-the-best of 'true space' movies right along with "The Right Stuff" (1983); and, right along with 'fictitious space' movies like "Solaris" ("Solyaris" 1972); "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968); and, "Space Cowboys" (2000).This is an enormous undertaking, and, Ron Howard and his cast and crew made it work...brilliantly!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Houston, we don't have a problem. Apollo 13 was amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apollo 13 has that don't tell me, the sky's the limit, when there is footsteps on the moon, feel to it. Directed by Ron Howard, this out of this world movie was very successful on bringing the exciting and the entertainment value. One small step for a man, is indeed one giant leap for mankind. Adapted from the book, 'Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13', by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger. The movie follows astronauts, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) aboard Apollo 13 spacecraft, attempting for a Moon landing mission. En-route to the moon, they suffer from an on-board explosion that deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power. This force NASA's flight controllers to abort the Moon landing, and turn the mission into a rescue operation to get the three men home safely. Can they get the men back to Earth or will the astronauts, perish in space? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much; since the movie is based on true events, the movie does have a predictable outcome. Anybody, who readt the history books, or saw any NASA program, knows how the events ended. Still, there are some really dangerous moments that might surprise some viewers, and make you jump, out of their seat, wondering if the crew was going to live or die. Even if you were the biggest NASA fan; the movie showcase a lot of things that you might not, know about the mission. You don't know the gravity of the dangerous situation until you watch Apollo 13! Indeed, failure wasn't an option. This movie was intense! Honestly, in my opinion, the best way to watch this movie, is to go into it, having no clue, what's the story is about. It will leave you more of an impact. While, Apollo 13 shot for the moon and it kinda miss, at least, it's among the stars. Every actor in this movie shine. Tom Hanks was great as the leading man. The supporting cast was equality as good. My favorites had to be Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, Head of Mission Control and Gary Sinise as astronaut, Ken Mattingly. I even love the cameo from the real life, Jim Lovell as a captain of the recovery ship USS Iwo Jima. One thing, that I didn't like, about the film, is how negatively, the portrayal of Jack Swigert was. They portrayal him, as a weaker astronaut, compare to the others, because of his lack of training, and bachelor status. In real life, Swigert was a well-trained Command Module pilot and highly respected. He was no black sheep. No one was really too worried about whether he was up to the job, but the real-life, Lovell admitted, he were really worried about was the rendezvous with Swigert as they left the Moon, but that never got to happen. Another thing, when did being a bachelor; became a bad thing? Didn't every man in the life, start out, as a bachelor, at one time? I have to say, despite that. Kevin Bacon did surprising, pretty well. Bill Paxton as Fred Haise, was alright for the role, but he's by far, the weakest in the film. I love how accurate the film is. The dialogue between ground control and the astronauts was taken nearly verbatim from transcripts and recordings, with the exception of one of the taglines of the film, "Houston, we have a problem." This quote alone, was voted one of the best movie lists in movie history. Ron Howard went to great lengths to create a technically accurate movie, employing NASA's technical assistance in astronaut and flight controller training for his cast, and even obtaining permission to film scenes aboard a reduced gravity aircraft, KC-135 for realistic depiction of the "weightlessness" experienced by the astronauts in space. The actors went aboard multiple KC-135 flights so much, that they outdone, even real astronauts in the amount of training, they got. I have to say, all the training, pull off in a realistic portrayal. Not only that, the movie went the extra mile in special effects. In an era where CGI was primitive, this movie was able to make it look like a rocket was blasting off into space, while, using little CGI. All the space shots were original made, and not taken from previous NASA space stock footage. There was no moment in the film that I didn't believe, they weren't in space. Even, real life astronauts like Buzz Aldrin got fooled, in believing they were in space. While, the movie is pretty accurate to historical events, Apollo 13 did take some artistic licenses for dramatic effects. In real life, the three astronauts remained surprisingly cool under pressure in real life, but the movie ramped up emotional tensions between them to make it, more thrilling. One thing that I didn't like, about the film is how much, foreshadowing, they used in the film. We get it! Did we really need, the scene where Jim's car was having problems or Jim's wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) losing her wedding ring? Come on! Another problem is the abundance of technical babble and bureaucratic jargon. Some scenes were really hard to understand, what was going on. Still, the movie does a good job, trying to explain, all the science. One thing that I love about the film; is composter James Horner's score. It really captures the wonder of flight. Overall: From lift-off to splashdown, Apollo 13 gives one hell of a ride. It was a very compelling, smart and suspenseful movie. A must-watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NASA must devise a strategy to return Apollo 13 to Earth safely after the spacecraft undergoes massive internal damage putting the lives of the three astronauts on board in jeopardy.First of all, a nice shout-out to the great Roger Corman, who appears here in a cameo, and Clint Howard, who has a cameo himself. Corman had a similar small role in "Silence of the Lambs", and it is great to see directors he helped raise giving him a nod of appreciation.Today (2015), those who think of a stranded in space movie may think "Gravity", but "Apollo 13" did it first and did it better. Maybe they did not have the impressive visuals that "Gravity" has, but they knew how to tell a good story and build suspense -- and, best of all, it was completely grounded in reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched Apollo 13 many times and each viewing seems as fresh, as fascinating and as gut-churning as the first.I am old enough that I can still remember listening to the Apollo 11 moon landing on the radio, and how it seemed we held our breath for days on end during the enthralling and gut-wrenching saga of the Apollo 13 mission not very long after.This movie recreates that intense sense of fear, awe and trepidation that burned in my young mind while the world fretted over the fate of the three astronauts in such peril.Ron Howard directs masterfully, enabling a brilliant cast to excel at portraying the attitudes and attributes of the early generation of US astronauts and NASA personnel.Unusually for a 'true story', Apollo 13 is remarkably correct factually and takes only the very slightest dramatic license with minor details. The representation of the spacecraft and the technical settings is incredibly accurate (I believe that the mission control sequences were actually filmed in the genuine mission control room at Houston space center.) The film would still be fascinating, entertaining, dramatic, humorous and emotional if it were merely fiction. Knowing that this superb movie retains all those qualities while being the true story of an event - that I still remember with powerful emotion - lifts it from the realm of good movies to the ranks of all-time classic masterpieces of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The space program is still haunted by Apollo-1 test accident on Jan 27, 1967. Man finally lands on the moon on July 20, 1969. Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) is the experienced leader. Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) is the brash eager young gun. Both Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) are aiming to be on Lovell's crew. Lovell is slated to be on Apollo 14 but gets bumped up to 13. Mattingly gets sidelined for not having had the measles and backup Swigert is put in his place. They are sent up on April 11, 1970. Having already achieved the landing, the world isn't paying attention to this mission. That is until things go wrong. Ed Harris plays the Flight Director Gene Kranz and Kathleen Quinlan plays Marilyn Lovell.This is a compelling story on its own. On the surface, this is the B-side of the epic man's mission to Mars. However director Ron Howard meticulously retains the details of the mission that makes it all come to life on the screen. That is the greatness of this movie. It is epic in all of its small details and its scope. All the actors are giving sincere performances in an old fashioned movie.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his career along with the Oscar level work from the cast members who starred alongside Hanks. Tom Hanks plays Jim Lovell perfectly (as what he does with the other characters he plays.). The movie has not only great actors but it also has excellent cinematography, art direction, costume design, and it also has excellent writing. Director Ron Howard can make i history movie look so realistic as he tries to make his actors go in depth with their characters.

		<fullReview>I believe Jim Lovell made a cameo at the end of the movie Apollo 13. The shot of him is very brief. Once the capsule has landed in the water and the crew is then is hauled up to the waiting helicopter. The helicopter then lands upon the aircraft carrier Iwo Jima. The three leave the helicopter and are greeted by the crew of the carrier. During the time that they are being greeted you will see several men in white uniforms. You will see one man in the scene pat Hanks character on the shoulder, the greeting is longer than the others. That is who I believe is Jim Lovell is standing to the left of Hanks in a profile shot. Next time you watch the movie give it a glance and see what you think. I researched the real Apollo13 and photos of the actual astronauts.Thats how I came about to recognize who I think is Lovell in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great on Technical Stuff, OK on Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start out by saying I'm a fan of old, classic films and don't watch new movies at all. As a matter of fact, this is the most recent movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I am interested in the history of the space program, was a space junkie when I was a kid, and am old enough to vividly recall the entire event of Apollo 13. I am not familiar with the actors in the film, who, from reading other reviews, are big names to movie fans. So I come to the film uninfluenced by my like or dislike of the actors, which often distorts one's view of a film, and I watched it mainly to see how "right" they "got it".I think they mostly got it right. Visually, the film is beautiful. Having lived through the time myself, I think they got the look of the period perfectly. This isn't always easy to do, and the filmmakers should be credited with their dedication to accuracy. Hollywood hasn't always been so vigilant, even on such relatively recent events. One need only watch a 1940's film depicting the 1920's, to see how the filmmakers feel the need to "modernize" styles, not trusting the audience to "get it", that it's a period piece. Cars, furniture, houses, clothes, hair styles, everything looks right in this picture. If you have a disposition towards accuracy, the research needn't be that deep?just dig up a 1970 Sears Catalog; but even this effort often seems too much for Hollywood.Same with all the rocket stuff. I'm not an engineer or scientist, but I have a fair layman's knowledge of the Apollo gear, from 40+ years of interest in the subject, and I didn't notice any glaring mistakes. I'm sure there were some, but you'd have to be annoyingly obsessive to be offended by, or to even notice, them.A couple of things bugged me, striking me as hokey. First, was the argument between Haise &amp; Swigert in the LEM. I guess this was added to create dramatic tension. I suppose you need this to make it a "story" instead of a documentary, but it is simply not credible. Second was the part at the end when TK Mattingly takes over as CapCom during the reentry. This scene smacked of old time Hollywood bathos, and I wasn't buying it. Third, making Grumman the goat in a couple of scenes where an unnamed Grumman executive is depicted as being hesitant, obstructive and noncommittal. I guess every movie needs a villain and it's easy to pick a now non-existent corporate entity to be the villain in a film where everybody else bonds together in a spirit of cooperation, but it's a libel on the company that, after all, built the spacecraft that saved the crew's lives.The acting was good, but the writing was often clichéd. A lot of it reminded me of things like "Back To Bataan" or the "Sands of Iwo Jima", only moving the scene from the beachheads of World War II to the vacuum of outer space. Watching the film, I got the feeling the actors looked a little too young for the parts they were playing, especially the guy who played Jack Swigert. Swigert was a tough, hard looking guy, while the actor portraying him looked almost adolescent. The actor playing Lovell did a good job in playing "A" part, but he didn't come across to me as Jim Lovell, whose public persona I've been familiar with since I was in the first grade. Lovell always came across as one of the more glib and well spoken of the astronauts, with a strong sense of humor, and we don't sense this in the film. I think ii's more a product of the writing than the acting, but the Lovell character in the film seems more like a generic movie action hero than the real life Jim Lovell. This, I think, is the main shortcoming of the film, that the crew members, Lovell, Swigert, Haise &amp; Mattingly, seem like 4 interchangeable guys, rather than distinct personalities. Again, I feel the fault is in the writing, not the acting.A couple of the characters are never really named in the film (that I noticed) but it's obvious who they were supposed to be?mainly Sy Liebergot and John Aaron. I don't necessarily think an actor in a film needs to look exactly like the historical figure he's portraying, but the actor playing Liebergot looked nothing like the real Liebergot. I did find it interesting that the actor playing the unnamed CapCom through most of the film looked a whole lot like John Young. I wondered if this was done on purpose, because in the photos and films of the actual event, Young is often seen around the CapCom desk, though he never was CapCom on this flight. This didn't bug me, but it was interesting. (Also, the other CapCom in the film strongly resembled Stuart Roosa, Apollo 14 Command Module pilot, and I wondered if this, too, was intentional. Like Young, Roosa was never a CapCom on this flight.)But for all the complaints, I did like the film. You have to expect a certain level of hokeyness when Hollywood tackles a serious subject. There's a happy ending when the astronauts return safely, and an even happier ending for Mattingly (in real life, not the film) when he was assigned to Apollo 16, a much longer, more interesting, mission, in which he got to do his own EVA, a deep flight space walk, which he would not have done had he not been booted from 13. Hopefully some of the folks seeing this film will be interested enough to read up on the subject, and then look at other missions of the Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) programs, because it's all fascinating stuff. US space history doesn't begin with Apollo 11 and end with Apollo 13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Astronauts of Apollo 13 - 'Houston, We Have A Problem.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true story of the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission back from 1971 captured the world and its people at the time gripping them with death-defying suspense. The film Apollo 13 does more than a magnificent job of imitating this space navigation near-tragedy. The real life details from this NASA lunar mission may be a little technically shaky but Apollo 13 depicts the event in a cleaned presentable way. It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through. It certainly does not devalue the movie in even the slightest degree. Apollo 13 is one of the most incredible family dramas. The minor flaws of it, the direction is a bit rigid, the on screen story needs a broader scope, it could have used a vaster array of supporting characters, are noticeable, but forgivable. It doesn't fully diminish the overall greatness of this amazing cinematic achievement. The daunting and heartfelt nature of this storied event overwhelms and awes the viewer. What a spectacular feat for humanity. These astronauts endured an unbelievable journey to the moon and back. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are all American heroes. Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10! I already have and will certainly continue to watch over and over again this touching and marvelous family adventure.</fullReview>

Ron Howard pulls the viewer heartstrings that previously limited his critical success. We're reminded of the lost trait of American ingenuity as inspirationally seen through the determined NASA team where failure was not an option. Just like the mission, this was not about individual performances and energized American pride. The Jim Lovell story comes to life through strong performance and a clear vision that remains as awe inspiring as space travel itself was in its youth.</fullReview>

There was a lovely cameo by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin who were played by actors since the real ones were too old by the time this movie was made. This movie is sad, but had to be so because it was based on a real life tragic event were Apollo 13 was so crippled int he service module that they had to terminate the moon landing and come home alive. A serious lesson from Apollo 13 is that things can go wrong. This was one of the seven best astronomy movies according to Astronomy Magazine. I do like the historical accuracy of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard creates a great movie about the most successful failure that NASA has ever had. It's a failure in that they didn't accomplish their original objective. But the mission was a success in that it returned all the astronauts and the shuttle in one piece. If they had died in outer space with the shuttle just floating out there in space it probably would've killed the space program for at least the next 10 years.The filmmaking here was done expertly by Howard and his team. With the success of this movie then Howard, Tom Hanks and Brian Grazer all were able to make the great mini series From the Earth to the Moon which showed you the beginning of NASA to the end of the Apollo series of flights.The movie lists a who's who as far as its cast goes with Hanks, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon and many, many more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the history of United States, a lot of people wanted to be a pioneer of frontier to find new lands, fight with nature and seek a new life. Today, however, no more lands to be found and no more areas can be explored. It is wondered whether the frontier hero is gone, or if we can still seek a new life. This movie give us an answer -- yes. This is why I love this movie and watched more than one time.In the geographic field, there is definitely not more land can be found. However, about space, we still do not know much more about it. Furthermore, even in many new scientific field, they are strangers to us. We have to research and learn more and more about them.There are still frontier culture in the world, but why I love it. Somebody may tell you, because frontier life is extremely exciting and excellent. Anybody have the same opportunity to be a winner. However, there is not everyone can be a winner because of many different reason. For personally, in the three days before the launching, Ken Mattingly was removed from the mission due to exposure to German measles, which he never contracted. For the whole mission, 13 could not land on the moon, and they have to come back to the earth. Nevertheless, All of them are still frontier heroes, because they have to fight with every dangerous cases which they met.In summary, there are still frontier heroes in today. But no every frontier experiences are exciting and excellent, no every one can be a winners. But nobody can say pioneers are loser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Houston, we have a problem."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard's "Apollo 13" tells the true story of the ill-fated lunar mission of the same name from 1970. En route to the moon on a 'routine' mission the vessel is practically crippled by a mechanical malfunction. In short order the objective changes from landing on the moon to simply making it home safely.Based on astronaut Jim Lovell's book "Lost Moon", the screenplay sticks pretty close to the facts. Certain tweaks were made for dramatic effect, of course, but the filmmakers strove for authenticity. I, for one, was surprised at how successfully the film built tension considering the fact that the outcome is known to any who are already familiar with the incident.As for the cast, it's a good one. The lead, Tom Hanks, was fresh off of back-to-back Oscar-winning performances in "Philadelphia" &amp; "Forrest Gump". Joining him as fellow astronauts were Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon &amp; Gary Sinise. Quite an enviable line-up, in my estimation. While none of these individuals garnered Oscar nominations, Ed Harris &amp; Kathleen Quinlan both received nominations in supporting roles. Overall, the cast was well-picked and without any weak links.Ron Howard's underrated direction keeps the action flowing despite being anchored to only a few sets for the vast majority of the picture. Meanwhile, the Oscar-winning editing seamlessly integrates footage shot in simulated zero gravity with footage shot conventionally. The Oscar-nominated special effects are also both believable and attractive. Finally, James Horner's score effectively contributes to the mood of the piece.Overall, "Apollo 13" is a captivating period piece that is constructed with technical know-how and skillful performances. While "The Right Stuff" is generally regarded as the top film based on the space program I'd take "Apollo 13" any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not always great throughout its 140 minute run, but very often an exciting blockbuster about a major historical event</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2000, I saw no less than the first approximate hour of this 1995 Ron Howard film based on a true story, but never got to see the entire film that year. Before that, I had seen the movie mentioned in a magazine, so I was aware of its existence, but didn't know much about it. I never watched "Apollo 13" all the way from beginning to end until ten years and a few months later after just seeing some of it. I don't think I had much of an opinion on what I saw of the film just over a decade ago, but by the time I sat down to watch it all, I knew it had a good reputation, so I was expecting a decent film. After watching it, I don't think it's as great as many others who have seen at some point it in the past fifteen years do, but it's still a good drama.In 1969, astronaut Jim Lovell is mesmerized by Neil Armstrong becoming the first person to set foot on the surface of the moon during the successful Apollo 11 mission, and hopes to go there himself someday. It seems he will have a chance to make that dream come true, as he is expecting to take part in one of these Apollo missions, originally Apollo 14, but then he is switched to Apollo 13. He will be going into space with Fred Haise and Ken Mattingly, so the three of them begin their training for the mission. Shortly before the day of the launch, Mattingly is pulled out of the mission due to exposure to the measles, and is replaced by Jack Swigert. On April 11, 1970, the spacecraft is finally launched, and leaves Earth's atmosphere with the three astronauts inside. At first, the mission doesn't get much attention, but that completely changes when things go terribly wrong, and Lovell, Haise, and Swigert find themselves in serious danger, and there's a good chance they won't survive their journey! The beginning of this historical drama features archive footage narrated by journalist Walter Cronkite, and this is an intriguing sequence. I did not care for the flirt scene right after this, but that fortunately didn't last, and most of the film can certainly hold the viewer's attention with the events leading up to the Apollo 13 launch, as the crew trains for the mission and Jim Lovell talks to his family members about going into space. There is one awkward scene with Jim's oldest daughter freaking out over the break-up of the Beatles, but fortunately, most of the movie isn't like this at all. The launch scene is intense, with a fitting musical score to go along with it, and after this, it's hard to stop watching "Apollo 13", as we see the three astronauts in peril far from the earth's surface as Mission Control tries to help them, the news reports on the spaceflight, the reactions of Jim's wife and offspring, etc. This 1995 blockbuster also has great visuals, showing the space shuttle in orbit, and also well designed sets. The performances from the lead actors (Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris) are strong, while some of the supporting performances are a little weaker, but that's not the case with most of the supporting cast. The cast as a whole is very impressive.I've watched a lot of movies in the past few years, and am not sure exactly why it took me so long to get around to this one, since I had seen a lot of it years before and knew for a while that it was a popular film based on a true story. However, now that I've finally seen the whole movie, I can understand its appeal and why it was nominated for nine Academy Awards, two of which it won. This 1995 blockbuster shows that an adventure movie like this doesn't necessarily need a lot of action to be exciting, since "Apollo 13" doesn't have a lot of that, yet still manages to be effective. At 140 minutes, it's certainly not a short movie, but despite occasional stumbles in quality, it remains intriguing for the vast majority of that time. As an historical film, there are obviously inaccuracies, but it seems many have praised it for its accuracies, unlike some movies based on true stories, and this drama can remind us of how risky space travel is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A meticulously detailed thriller, giving a dramatic account of the near-disaster of Apollo 13's failed moon-landing mission that ultimately ended well. What makes this potential-disaster movie so watchable is that there is no baddie. There's no interpersonal animosity weighing the whole thing down - instead the cast is entirely populated with characters who are in search of the same best outcome. It's a sort of moon-landing achievement in negative: as Ed Harris' mission commander Gene Kranz predicts, 'I believe that this will be our finest hour.'Consequently we are free to wonder at the physical realities of pioneering 60s space travel, hung weightlessly from a taut narrative thread that Ron Howard never slackens. All the performances are fine with a nice variation across the cast. I like the script-direction relationship which delivers all the melodrama you might expect without ever inflating itself. A thoroughly satisfying film (if bad for the fingernails). 7/10</fullReview>

The crew used the Lunar Module as a "lifeboat" in space. The command module systems remained functional, but were deactivated to preserve its capability to reenter Earth's atmosphere upon return to the earth. The crew endured difficult conditions due to severe constraints on power, cabin heat, and potable water, but successfully returned to Earth.Watch it!!Worth it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a second and consider the similarities between APOLLO 13 and TITANIC... you'd have to be a dolt not to know how both of these film were gonna end but think about the leeway James Cameron had over Ron Howard in the fictionalization department. Howard has accomplished something truly remarkable with APOLLO 13--- he's skillfully wrought out the personalities of (mostly still) living people and makes care about the dire peril they faced. While not diminishing Cameron's accomplishments with TITANIC (I had to be dragged into it, but found it affective), APOLLO 13 is the standard for all fact-based films in the future. Side note: Tom Hanks has worked on two continuation projects where you get the feeling he didn't want to let go of the subject matter: after APOLLO 13 (RACE TO THE MOON) and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (BAND OF BROTHERS), which is some kind of testimonial to the impact he felt in being involved with these projects. This was absolutely THE BEST film I saw during 1995 and deserves to be a part of any DVD library. Ron Howard easily ranks as one of the most compelling directors ever to work in Hollywood.</fullReview>

The extraordinary visual effects combined with the all-star-packed casting couldn't have been better; each performance, from Tom Hanks down through the ranks to the techs at Mission Control, and the 'spot-narration' voice over (in the form of news bulletins) by Walter Cronkite accurately captured the anxiety, character, enthusiasm and 'can-do' attitude of this 'gremlin plagued' mission.If you lived these events then see it, it's sure to recall the times and places. But if this is history to you see it and know that "that's the way it was", at the very pinnacle, of the age of exploration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of 1995</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me and my Mom saw this at the theatre in the summer of 1995 and it was such a beautiful satisfying movie experience. I continue to marvel at the skill in which Ron Howard spinned the tale based on the true incident which happened in April 1970. I adore this movie, even to the point of being corny!!! Let me just say that everything, from the music to the period detail, was beautifully brought to life. I loved all the guys in Houston with their 1970-looking hairdos, clothing and horn rimmed glasses, I loved the big honking (now antique looking) TV in the Lovell's living room, I loved Kathleen Quinlan's retro clothing and earrings (she's such a lovely woman and actress) and I loved the acuracy of the rocket, the command module, the lunar module (that spidery looking guy) and the little pod with the parachutes. The cast was absolutely perfect. Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell, the commander of the Apollo 13 mission to the moon, was brilliant, and brought all the excitement and anticipation...and then disappointment and fear, to life. Bill Paxton is always a joy to watch, portraying astronaut Fred Haise, whose wife is pregnant. Paxton displays a childlike joy in his excitement about "flying in space" for the very first time. Kevin Bacon was quiet and strong as Jack Swigert, a "bachelor" astronaut, and his feelings of guilt over what happened to the spacecraft were very tangible to me. Gary Sinise was a fabulous support as astronaut Ken Mattingly, who was supposed to be the pilot, but was held back from the mission because of exposure to measles. Ed Harris, ahh, Ed Harris. I love this guy. He turned in a fiery, commanding, yet lovely performance as the head of the flight operations in Houston. The stress that Gene Kranz must have been under looked exhausting coming from Harris. While the crew of Apollo 13 awaits a plan for re-entering Earth's atmosphere safely, they encounter problem after problem, loss of power, loss of breathing oxygen, increase in toxic CO2 gas, freezing cold because of the lack of electicity, a kidney infection in Haise, inappropriate weight, velocity and angle for re-entry, and if all that weren't enough, their parachutes might not open and the heat sheild might have been damaged to where the astronauts would be incinerated before they can return to earth!!! Oh yeah, and a typhoon in the south Pacific too!!! This movie is over two hours long, but it is so absorbing, so interesting, and so riveting, that not one milisecond is boring. The supporting cast also features Xander Berkely, Clint Howard, Loren Dean and many other familiar faces whose names escape me, as the hard working, wonderful staff of experts in Houston who were DETERMINED to bring the three men of Apollo 13 home alive. This movie was perfect. I can't say a bad thing about it. It deserved Film Of The Year for 1995 (I don't even remember which film got the award, so it must not have been all that memorable) and I think it is Ron Howard's finest film to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Houston, We Have A Problem."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Our story begins July 20, 1969, the night when the Apollo 11 crew landed on the moon! Jim Lovell was having a party at his house in celebration. Lovell was on the Apollo 8 mission that didn't land on the moon but got pretty close. Lovell's friends Fred Haise, Ken Mattingly, Jack Swigert and others were there. They watched in awe as Neil Armstrong stepped out of the lander and said his famous speech, "That's one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind". Jim hoped that one day he could go in space again. His wish came true on October 30 when the man who was supposed to be manning Apollo 13 fell ill so Jim would be manning it instead. Fred Haise and Ken Mattingly would be joined them and they spent countless hours in the simulator getting everything just right. But soon, Jim got word that a blood test showed that they were all exposed to the measles virus and since Ken had never had the measles, they would scratch him. Jim was opposed but head of NASA, Deke Slayton, said that either they replace Ken or Jim doesn't go into space. So Ken was replaced by Jack Swigert who didn't do too well in the simulator. Soon the day of the launch, April 11, 1970 arrived. Jim's wife Marilyn was there and so was Fred Haise's wife, Mary. Jim, Fred and Jack are suited up and board the ship. Soon all systems are go and they blast off. Ken watches sadly. Soon the rocket disappears into the atmosphere and as soon as they enter space, Fred vomits and it floats and it floats around the craft along with their equipment. That evening, they broadcast a little show from the ship but the TV networks refused to air it so only people at NASA could see it. They were eagerly anticipating the moon, but two days later something went horribly wrong! Something in the oxygen stir tanks went haywire. Alarms blared and the computers flashed. "Houston, we have a problem," says Jim. Their oxygen began venting out the side of the ship. Gene Kranz, a mission control specialist, tried as best as he could to solve the problem. He suggested shutting off the fuel cells would stop the vent but would ruin their chance of landing on the moon. They shut them down and it didn't help. They had to move into the LEM, the lunar module, before air ran out in the Odyssey. The module was only built to hold two people so it got cramped with all three of them in there. The NASA engineers awakened Ken Mattingley and seeked his help so he began working on solving the problem in the simulator. More trouble arises when CO2 levels rise. The goal was to make a square peg fit in a round hole! They soon constructed a filter from miscellaneous items around the ship. It worked! CO2 went down. Now the only thing left to do was get them back to earth! The LEM's engine could withstand a short burn so after having orbited around the moon, they aimed for earth and blasted right towards it. It was very tough but they finally accomplished the goal. Ken looked for a way to conserve enough energy to return the Odyssey to earth and still have enough to open the chutes. Back in space, tension began building. Fred and Jack would argue and Jim was caught in the middle. At Jim's home, Marilyn kept a TV crew from setting up equipment on the lawn. Because Apollo 13 became a disaster, the TV networks were now interested. Marilyn assured everyone Jim would be home soon. Ken worked hard and came up with a solution: use the LEM battery power and reverse it with power from the Odyssey. Or something like that. It worked! They detached the LEM and strapped in in the Odyssey and headed back to earth! Estimated time for a lander to come out of blackout was three minutes. Jim, Fred and Jack were a minute late but they soon splashed down in the water! When they returned to Houston, they were declared heroes and went down in history! Epilogue: Fred Haise was scheduled to go up in Apollo 18 but due to budget cuts, his mission was canceled and he never went in space again. Jack Swigert left NASA to go into congress and died shortly thereafter; Ken Mattingley flew the space shuttle and commanded Apollo 16; Gene Kranz retired mission control and Jim Lovell retired as an astronaut but every so often, he looks at the moon and wonders when and who would be going back. Great movie! Good tension, was acted just great! Tom Hanks was good, Kevin Bacon was good, Bill Paxton was good, Gary Sinise was good and Ed Harris was good. What do I mean good? They were great! A great job of directing, Ron Howard! Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise were together in Forrest Gump, the year before! The Apollo 13 disaster happened 13 years before I was born but I'm sure this movie captures everything exactly how it happened! Watch for Ron Howard's brother Clint as a man in mission control; his mother Jean as Jim's mother and father Rance as a preacher near the end! But anyway, I recommend Apollo 13 for you Tom Hanks fans or you fans of that tense situation!!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Ron Howard film is his best yet and that's saying a lot. Howard seems to always be in the right place at the right time and his directorship of this film is no exception. The acting is excellent by the stars and all the supporting cast. The stars are such that one can only expect great things from them. There's Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon. There's also Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan. This, folks, is an all-star cast and the acting definitely reflects that. A good touch was letting us get to know the Lovell family, which added to the drama and poignancy of the story. The story is true and I believe that I heard that there is very little artistic license taken in this film...it was made to be realistic. Howard has another masterpiece on his hands! This is a film to acquire for your film library!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failure is not an option</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since so many NASA insiders seem pleased with "Apollo 13," including astronaut Jim Lovell, I assume the story is fairly true to what actually happened. There was carping over some over-dramatized aspects and use of poetic license, but it's difficult to avoid criticism of this sort if the goal is an entertaining recreation of an historical event and not a documentary. (Ron Howard and company suffered harsher reaction to "A Beautiful Mind" for essentially the same approach.) As far as I'm concerned, the movie is a rivetting one, a triumph of the human spirit against fearsome odds, against the lethal and unforgiving expanse of outer space. The actors did a creditable job, in particular Tom Hanks as Lovell and Ed Harris as mission controller Gene Kranz. The computer graphics are spectacular. A footnote: "Apollo 13" is the first movie to use real weightlessness or zero g (via the Vomit Comet).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is so superbly professional - really a wonder by all involved. Like others who wrote comments, I do recall the events - I was in 9th grade - but (again like others), the suspense is still so taut, so thrilling.To compliment those involved means mentioning everyone in the credits. I particularly liked Gary Sinise and Bill Paxton but everyone impressed me.There are so many ways this movie could have been done wrong - too much pathos, too much technological discussion, too little sense of what it was like down in Houston as they tried to work on the problems. The movie avoids all these wrong paths. In fact, I think showing the way Houston was handling the problems was the most unusual and wonderful thing about the movie.I also compliment the studio - imagine the temptation to do it at FAR less cost by showing it all from only the astronauts' perspective - a three actor movie with only a spacecraft to pay for. Thanks for not doing it that way.I just loved it. It's the kind of thing a big Hollywood studio can finance - and superb top echelon pros can do so excellently - and in truth, no one else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film about a great NASA accomplishment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far the finest film made about an actual space travel mission mainly because this had the always-important life and death drama element. The Right Stuff (which also starred Ed Harris) was a great film about actual space travel events but its appeal was more on the historical nostalgic aspect of things. Having been in High School when this i.e. Apollo 13 took place I remember that while it was carried on the news it was not around the clock coverage something that was just not all that frequent then like it is today. Great film making and direction by Ron Howard. Great performances all around. While watching this film give some thought to what was actually accomplished and also what was accomplished by the entire manned space flight program between 1961 and 1972. These were years before the computer technology that is enjoyed today existed. It is now the year 2002 yet we are not in space as it was portrayed in 2001 A Space Odyssey. In fact it has been 30 yrs since anyone has walked on the moon. Were the accomplishments such as those of Apollo 13 all for nothing or is man truly going to venture out and visit the moon again along with the planets and their moons as well? Let's hope so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well done movie and truly should be on the top 250.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie from beginning to end was a very well made movie from beginning to end. Yes there was a love story, but this love story actually existed and it didn't interfere with the whole meaning of what actually happened like what Pearl Harbor mistakingly did (though I did like Pearl Harbor. But still this movie's title didn't trick you into really what the movie was about. So really if you think about it, if you want to see a movie that's accurate and well done about the Apollo 13 mission, I suggest seeing Apollo 13. The script was very well written, the acting was incredible, by Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, Gary Sinice, and the woman who portrayed Jim Lovell's wife. The movie was perfectly paced. They give you time to get what they're going to do on the Apollo 13 mission. They tell you everything that was important that was prior to the launch, happy and sad events. Tom Hanks truely desereved to be the winner for 1995's best actor, though I don't know who were the other contenders. But anyways, if you want to see a great historically accurate movie, Apollo 13 is definitely worth seeing, because it is truly about Apollo 13. Apollo 13 deserves a 13 and also deserves to be on the top 250 up in the 8.0 to 8.5. A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

Other than that, the movie was exceptionally thrilling. And best of all, most of it's true. Good research, fellas.It makes you feel so good about America too. Hundreds of determined men refused to lose thier comrades in the last frontier, and they brought them home. Meanwhile, the Russians lost quite a few in space.The soundtrack is excellent, with such patriotic music played at the right times during the movie. I never get bored listening to it. Photography and camera work gets two big thumbs up as well, and to see Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, and Tom Hanks float made the movie much more credible.I watch this film every six months, and everyone else should see it at least once.Kevin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the real Apollo 13 launched in April, 1970, I was an 8-year-old space program fanatic; I followed every detail of the Apollo missions I could get my hands on - still do, in fact. As such, I KNEW what happened w/ Apollo 13. So I originally saw this movie w/ the intent of picking apart its glaring flaws.Boy, was I WRONG!Not only was the movie highly accurate from a technical &amp; historical standpoint, but Howard's direction of this tale I knew so well STILL had me on the edge of my seat for the duration. My hat is off to Ron Howard!***WARNING - SPOILER AHEAD**** As a further testimony to just how gripping this movie is: Shortly after buying this movie on video, I showed it to my Sister-In-Law, who was not even born yet when Apollo 13 flew. The poor thing was a nervous basket case from the instant the Service Module blew until Lovell's voice was heard at splashdown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most successful film of the 90s was this stunning recreation of the near-tragic flight of Apollo 13 to the Moon in April 1970.Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert were 200,000 miles from Earth at 9:15 PM on April 13, 1970 when an oxygen tank in their service module suffered an electrical short, ruptured, and exploded. Two of their ship's three fuel cells were gone, their entire navigational system was thrown into a tailspin, and their life support was rapidly fading. It was bad enough that their planned moon landing was scrubbed, but it was even worse to consider the strong possibility that they might not get home alive. But with the help of all the brave people at Mission Control, this most perilous flight in the history of manned space travel ended happily with a successful splashdown in the South Pacific on April 17.Director Ron Howard (BACKDRAFT) recreates this true story with such technical and dramatic precision that APOLLO 13 is nothing short of a masterpiece, ranking it right up there with other such films as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, THE RIGHT STUFF and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. Tom Hanks (as always), Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon give great performances as Apollo 13's crew. Gary Sinise also scores as Ken Mattingly, who was to be the ship's command module pilot before a feared measles infection (which never materialized) beached him. Kathleen Quinlan is good as Hanks' wife, and Ed Harris gives a very steely performance as Gene Kranz, the chief of Mission Control who urges his men on to find solutions to the complex problems that eventually came to surround this mission.Featuring an excellent score by James Horner, in the Copland tradition, APOLLO 13 won justly-deserved Oscars for sound and film editing. Not to be missed, especially for those space travel enthusiasts out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Hanks attempt to monopolise the Oscar...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Apollo 13" is yet another movie where Hanks is cast as the 'everyman' overcoming some difficulty. He IS a fine actor, and "Apollo 13" IS a great film, but does anyone else get the urge to see Tom Hanks playing a real scumbag for once? His characters always seem so WORTHY, making them a cert for Academy nomination at least. Sometimes I wish he'd be a little more brave in his career choices. Academy recognition aint the be all and end all. There are plenty of fine actors never to be recognised in such a way. I think I'm right in suggesting Johnny Depp? Still, onto the film. Director Howard has assembled a superb ensemble cast, and has a decent script to work from. Everybody should know the basic story by now but this fact is impressively never allowed to destroy dramatic tension. No-one with any sense would label Howard an auteur, and this works well for A13 because it allows us to concentrate on the individuals IN FRONT of the camera rather than the guy behind it (take note Scorsese.) The moods in this picture are impressively judged, the historic build up (which admittedly does drag slightly), the perilous middle and the triumphant end. The effects are superb, but they aren't the only thing here, making this a true blockbuster with soul. The crew on the ground, led by Ed Harris, are almost as impressive as those in space, if not more so. The whole production has obviously been polished until it gleamed... Definitely Ron Howard's best film, and one of the best pictures of '95. As I mentioned before, I just wish the Academy weren't so obvious in their Oscar choices... Incidentally, I didn't like this film when I first saw it. Never has it been more apparent that your taste and attention span increase as you get older!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best and Most Accurate Movie of All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a space buff the one thing I am most turned off by in space related movies is technical inaccuracy. Apollo 13 was completely accurate and the few things that were not were very minor. I have read numerous books by authors who were involved with this mission and I do not find many contradicting details of Ron Howard's extraordinary film with their recounts of the "successful failure." Apollo 13 is so accurate that the dialogues of certain scenes (i.e. Flight Director Gene Krantz in mission control) matches verbatim with NASA recordings. In addition to the accuracy, the acting is superb while the pictures and sound are astounding. Howard had full cooperation of NASA and to reconstruct weightlessness he used the method NASA trains its astronauts with-the KC-135. The scenes of mission control were shot at Johnson Space Center in the actual mission control and astronauts Jim Lovell and David Scott trained Hanks, Paxton, Bacon, Sinise, and Howard at Space Camp. Ron Howard should be commended for what I consider the greatest film ever and for not "selling out" to crowds that just want to see big, shiny exploding things, such as the Titanium Shuttle in Armageddon. This is a must see for anyone with an interest in the space program and an appreciation for an accurate documentary.</fullReview>

It´s a big surprise to me, that Ron Howard did this one, after he has become famous for more entertaining than pretentious stuff (Cocoon, Parenthood, etc.). I guess this film was an important turning point to him. It brings the nearly- catastrophe of April 13th, 1970 close to you. When I´ve watched "Apollo 13" the first time, I was amazed about the weightless in the spaceship, and I asked myself "How did they do that?!", because it looked so real! They simulated the weightless in the NASA KC-135 jet. A big praise to all the actors for their hard work to let this film look 100 % realistic. Breathtaking in every moment, altough you know the ending. It´s an intimitate play in space, so don´t expect an action packed movie like "Armageddon".

The performances by each main character made "Apollo 13" one of the best films of the 1990s.The performances from Tom Hanks and Kathleen Quinlan were among the best because they didn't have to act much to convince me that this was really happening to Jim and Marilyn Lovell.

It taught me about the NASA program and the Apollo 13 mission. The other reason I liked this film was everything so real. From the chemistry between the cast to sets that doubled for space. This film is well acted, directed and written; it deserves a second and third look from people who have seen it. I'm glad I got the opportunity to watch this film because it truly illustrates what can be accomplished if everyone comes together and use teamwork to accomplish their mission on and off the set.</fullReview>

If Mel Gibson had only waited a year before releasing "Braveheart", he would have been a lock. Also, this is, above all, an ensemble picture. But you don't need me to tell YOU that, you already KNOW that. Right? So...next.The special effects. If you don't already know, many of the zero-gravity shots in this flick were accomplished by constructing a set of the space capsule inside what's known as the "Vomit Comet", a modified jet aircraft designed to simulate weightlessness for astronaut training. What it does is simple: it flies up to a high altitude very fast, then gradually turns earthward at just enough speed to make whatever is inside of the jet "float" off the ground, thus creating a weightless effect. Not too impressive, right? Except the actors, directors and other crew members made between 500 and 600 individual flights on the "Vomit Comet" to get all the required shots. But you already know THAT. Don't you?The story. It's kinda like watching "Titanic." You KNOW the boat sinks, you just wanna see how it's DONE. Same here. Ron Howard, director extraordinaire, tightens the story and ratchets up the tension so we are prepared to either bawl our eyes out or stand up and cheer at the end...and either way would be equally as satisfying.But you don't need ME to tell YOU this...do you?</fullReview>

Although I'm unfamiliar with the full details of the Apollo 13 facts, the way they presented them in this movie through the various scenes, made it believable and got me emotionally involved with the crew's dilemma. This movie was filled with Hollywood's superstars and they played their parts well- even the children of Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks). Ron Howard caught the interactions between the performers in the important scenes so you could feel the situations. You get caught up in the efforts the space shuttle crew and Mission Control make to get the Apollo 13 back to earth.A hearty high five to not only the actors and actresses that portrayed the real-life characters, but a hearty high five to the real spoken and unspoken heros of the Apollo 13 mission as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, but the music sounds awfully familiar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nominated for 9 Academy Awards (but not best director), "Apollo 13" is a little sterile, filled with techno-speak that sometimes makes the action difficult to follow, but, overall, it is a good film, very deserving of its Oscar nomination for best picture. Tom Hanks, sacrificing the spotlight to do ensemble duty with Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon, is terrific, of course, completely natural as astronaut Jim Lovett, and, as always, eminently likeable. The entire cast is equally fine. James Horner's Oscar nominated score, however, should have been disqualified on the grounds that it sounds suspiciously like the melody of Art Garfunkel's 1973 hit, "All I Know." Am I the only one who noticed that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film depicting a unique true life drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the third time on TV last night and was again enthralled by the drama. It's way ahead of any of the fictional space films, but then true events will always be so. The film deserved its award.Tom Hanks and the other actors played their parts well.Perhaps most important, this film records an historical event in the human endeavour to conquer space. As we move into the 21st century, which will bring many exciting space missions, there will undoubtedly be other incidents like Apollo 13, which technology will enable us to see live as it happens.The new international space station being constructed and the prospects of our grandchildren being able to take vacations on a revolving Earth satellite will bring Arthur Clarke's visions to reality. No doubt we can expect many more fims about space but film makers please keep a sense of reality and scientific accuracy as seen in Apollo 13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only movie where engineers and science are the heroes. Detailed and realistic beyond most. Gravity, you suck!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great movie of history which sheds a lot of light on the extremely awesome technical accomplishment it was to send people to the moon (and with computers that could "fit into a single room" that are less powerful than and old Nokia brickphone). There's a bit of drama added, but overall the movie does extremely well at also going deep into the technical struggle with a well executed fortitude far beyond what most Hollywood would dare (i.e. Gravity).This movie teaches, entertains, and inspires the audience toward scientific endeavor like no other. Special effects are amazing, especially for its time, but they are not the sole source of meaning (as with mofoing#! Gravity). Apollo 13 respects its audience, and though filmicly it's rather standard storytelling, it's great to see a film made that tells such a story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is clearly one of my favorite movies in recent years. Even though some dramatic license is taken, it's still better than The Right Stuff, which it's often compared to. This film is taken from Jim Lovell's book Lost Moon, rather than a fiction book like Tom Wolfe's It also portrays the characters with more respect than that film, although Jack Sweigert was NOT a "rookie" by any means, and Ken Mattingly didn't solve the CM restart by himself (but it is mentioned that Ken was representing all those who did help out with this. This is a movie I would see over and over again. Even Gene Kranz liked the line "Failure is not an option," though he never said it. That's saying something! Kudos to Ron Howard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional true life drama comes to cinematic life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, "Apollo 13", 1995, get's it all right: the look, details and emotions. Based on the true story of the the failed Apollo 13 mission. The film really brings back the drama and excitement, of this historical time in NASA's history. Nominated for 9 and won 2 Academy Awards. I'm surprised by the omission of a particular award nomination. Director Ron Howard deserved an Academy Award nomination for his directing. Clearly, this is a director's film. The inspiration shows. Ron Howard did receive a Director's Guild of America Award for Best Director.To me, "Apollo 13" is just about a perfectly made film. The sense of time and emotion is very true to life. The story is told between three perspectives: the crew of Apollo 13, their families and the mission control center in Houston. Everything from direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, film editing, visual effects and sound, all come together remarkably well in this exceptional film. The film manages to be educational, inspiring and entertaining. That's a rare and special achievement.I was 7 when the mission of Apollo 13 occurred. The look and feel of the film is very accurate. I felt very much like I was back in 1970 again. The attention to technical, personal and environmental details, is what makes this film outstanding. I'm a science/technical minded person. I noticed most of the technical details are accurate, and what was lost in the historical archives (personal and technical), is recreated intelligently and dramatically.The makers of the film definitely did their homework and put some admirable passion, creativity and inspiration into the film, and it shows very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By-the-Numbers Movie Is Still One of Ron Howard's Better Efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A taut and polished studio film from Ron Howard that manages to be quite suspenseful even though we all know the ending from the start.The film is a lean recreation of the Apollo 13 space mission that met with disaster and almost didn't make it back home. Tom Hanks gives one of his many appealing performances as leader of the mission, while Ed Harris gives a muscular, intense performance as head of mission control. Kathleen Quinlan was inexplicably nominated for an Oscar for playing Hanks' anxious wife -- her role consists of nothing but sitting around looking worried.As by-the-numbers and mainstream as they come, but still one of Howard's better efforts.Grade: A-</fullReview>

We have here depicted a heroic and true story (with some cinematic drama added), and an ensemble cast to die for. Every time I see it (which is at least once a month) I am moved to tears and happiness.

		<shortDescription>An exciting time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boys own adventure about the ill fated "Apollo 13" mission which was to follow the successful journey that saw Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the moon.Ron Howard deftly recreates the tension, ambition, hope and disappointment which accompanied the crew who dreamed of writing yet another page in 'space race' history. Ronnie helms with a purpose, never allowing any sidelines or subplots to undermine the story which he skilfully builds to not one, but several nail biting climaxes. Many of us know the story, yet writers John Sayles, William Broyles Jnr. and Al Reinart still manage to entertain us with an involving screenplay which recreates the excitement of the time.All the technical teams have masterfully brought to life the NASA Space Centre at Cape Kennedy, along with the amazing hardware that goes with it. The take-off sequence is especially well produced thanks to some stunning special effects and clever cinematography (Dean Cundey - who wields with effect throughout the pic).Tom Hanks convincingly personifies the ambitious dreamer Jim Lovell, sharing with us his trials and his triumphs. In support of him is Bill Paxton (in perhaps his biggest role to date), finally playing a character who is not paranoid, and doing so very well. Kevin Bacon also joins the crew, playing a late replacement for the devastated Gary Sinise, who is ousted due to concerns he may contract the measles. Back at Cape Kennedy, an impressive Ed Harris calls the shots in an Academy nominated role, keeping his feet firmly on the ground, unlike his turn in "The Right Stuff".James Horner provides a familiar sounding theme.Friday, October 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema</fullReview>

As we all know it is based on the actual mission of Apollo 13. The story is very well told and greatly acted by the actors portraying the characters. Im a huge Tom Hanks fan and this is one of his best. You get to see what goes on a little bit behind NASA and and lives of the families and friends. It's a movie worth watching. And you never get bored of it. You can watch it again and again. You always find something new with each time you watch it too. If you haven't seen it yet. Go see it today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Failure is not an option," is the most memorable line in this movie. It is funny how Tom Hanks so perfectly fits another diverse role the way he fits this one. The entire cast seems to be perfectly fit in like with a shoehorn.The way the story is presented is important here. After several successful missions to the moon, things had become so successful that even the astronauts &amp; their wives did not realize the real risk involved in going to the moon. The 1 small step of Neil Armstrong was really a giant leap.When this drama happened, television brought it home to a public that was deeply surprised by what was going on. After all, success breeds success. This story perfectly illustrates why success can never be taken for granted.It illustrates the teamwork in space &amp; on the ground that made this rescue possible. It is a story of failure of a mission that evolves into the success of a second mission- survival. That is the importance of this story.If you have not seen this, it is worth viewing. While it is not essential, it is definitely dramatic. Great work by everyone including Ron Howard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Houston, we have a problem"; the biggest misquote in cinematic history no less, but for all the right reasons. Apollo 13 has to be one of my favourite films of all time.It is amazing how things always seem to be much longer you are young. I first saw the movie when I was about 6 or 7 and it seemed to go on for much longer than, but I was still gripped. The acting is very good, with Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon in the centre of it all, giving life to the situation that they are in. The visual effects were awesome, and even to this day they still look good, and the fact that for the zero gravity scenes, they really went up in a "vommit comet" (the same aircraft training scheme that the real astronauts used, and still use for the astronaut training program!) However, the film is brimming with factual errors and anachronisms, which most people find intolerable; TV programs that appear on screens throughout the movie that don't actually appear until after or before April 1970; Lunar errors (give me a viewing of E.T. any day!) and props that didn't appear until after the incident e.g. coffee mugs, beetles albums and other items. However, it is only a Ron Howard film, what can you do?However, this is made up for with the good acting, brilliant visual effects and brilliant score (composed by James Horner, who I think, next to John Williams and the late Jerry Goldsmith, is the one of the best movie composers). A brilliant "historical" adaptation (in terms of drama and acting). 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Versions of Howard's flick a bonus too good to pass up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard's "Apollo 13" (1995) is a compelling account of the bravery and commitment that men of character faced during the initial and dangerous days of the space race. The film stars Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell, devoted family man and adventurer who's dream of outer space turns into a nightmare when a serious malfunction jeopardizes the safety of his crew orbiting the earth. Along for the ride are Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon). Grounded after a bout of measles, but ever the committed optimist, is Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) ? aiding in the morale boosting efforts of NASA specialist, Gene Krantz (Ed Harris). The talented Kathleen Quinlan is wasted in the role of Jim's devoted wife, Marilyn Lovell ? an insult to her formidable talents made all the more obvious when one views the new IMAX edition of "Apollo 13" presented on Universal's new 2-disc edition. Her performance has all but been distilled into a cameo.About the transfers: both the original 1995 2hr and 20 min. Panavision 2:40:1 aspect ratio feature and its new 1hr. 57 min. 1:85:1 IMAX aspect ratio incarnation have been digitally remastered by Universal for DVD. In both cases image quality is quite superb. Colors are bold, rich and vibrant. Whites are white. Blacks are deep, solid and rich. Contrast and shadow delineation is stunning with fine details appearing throughout both versions, even during the darkest scenes. The audio on both editions is 5.1 and will give your speakers a healthy workout, particularly during the blast off and re-entry scenes.What is particularly irksome for the film purist, is the way director Ron Howard's original pacing has been butchered on the new IMAX edition. Nearly 35 min. of footage has been excised ? presumably because anything more than two hours of a really big image is just too much for audiences to endure. As a result, the IMAX edition loses some of the film's most poignant scenes to the cutting room floor. Also, the original scope and depth of the Panavision aspect ratio is compromised greatly during several space scenes. The bone of contention here is in today's ever increasing ability to make disposable art that is more user friendly to the masses. The IMAX version fills all of one's widescreen television with the film's image. The original presentation results in thin black bars filling the top and bottom of the screen. And yet, that is the way the film was originally intended to be seen, with more width and a longer running time. Purists will undoubtedly agree with this assessment. The average consumer will easily overlook the both absences.Extras include some very nicely packaged and quite comprehensive documentaries on both the real space mission and the making of the film, as well as an audio commentary and theatrical trailer. Since Universal has given us both versions to experience in pristine image quality, this edition of "Apollo 13" comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Houston, we have a problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American space program really was something to be proud of. Men putting their lives on the line just for a chance to get out into space, and reach for the stars. It's so unfortunate that nowadays we have far greater resources and sophisticated computers at our disposal, but the idea of space exploration has waned and petered out.Of course, back in the 60s and 70s nobody could forget the days of the space race. The days when America was in fierce competition with the Russians to put a man on the Moon. And did it in 1969 when Neil Armstrong took those first steps. In the opening scenes of Apollo 13, we get to see that happen, and the reactions of the astronauts on Earth is priceless. Their amazement and envy is clear.After the success of the Apollo 11 mission, NASA continued to send men to the Moon, but by the time the mission for Apollo 13 dawned, the public's enthusiasm for the space program was all but gone.That all changed when one of the oxygen tanks aboard the command module exploded, putting our three astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) in mortal danger. Then the public took a very real interest. People can be so hypocritical can't they?! Anyway, with a Moon landing now completely out of the question, our heroes had to put every resource they had into finding different ways to get home safely.Ron Howard doesn't always succeed with his more serious motion pictures. Sometimes they're downright dull and plodding, but he gets Apollo 13 very right. You can tell he's put a lot of work and effort into trying to recreate the mission right down to the finest detail. In fact, if you watch the 1989 documentary "For All Mankind" which is an account of this mission, there are almost uncanny similarities between the two. It's as if Ron Howard was present during those events, and captured the whole thing on camera.In fact, Ron Howard's film almost has the look of a documentary. What with the tight camera angles to heighten the sense of claustrophobia and tension, as well as panning around quickly to capture the different conversations at Mission Control. I always notice minute details every time I watch Apollo 13.The film can never quite shake the "all-American" feel to it's characters and events. In fact, if it weren't based on a true story, it might seem so ridiculous it could be attributed to American propaganda. But what really holds the film together is the film's solid storytelling, and some fine performances from the cast.Tom Hanks makes for a very effective choice as Jim Lovell. The way he tries to keep up the spirits of his crew while trying to mastermind the success of getting back to Earth is tremendously entertaining. His best scene is when they are going past the Moon, and can't land on it. Haise and Swigert are by the windows craning to get a good look, but Jim prefers to use his imagination. His sadness is profound and moving.Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon also put in some stellar support, especially the scene where they start arguing with each other about whose fault it is why the oxygen tank exploded. You could sometimes cut the tension of those scenes with a knife.Back on Earth, we have Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, and Kathleen Quinlan as Marilyn Lovell. Ken has to work around the clock putting together a procedure that will enable the space shuttle to reenter the Earth's atmosphere. Of course he does in the end, but it's still gratifying to see him put it together.Ed Harris is almost pitch perfect as Gene Kranz. He is like him in so many ways. They even look similar. Although some of his lines of dialogue are very "all American", he is still very rousing as the head of Mission Control.Kathleen Quinlan is a talented actress to be sure, but she doesn't get a great deal to do in this film. All she can do is watch and wait for her husband's shuttle to return home. She still gives it all she's got, and it would be hard to imagine the film without her.Some of the methods the astronauts improvise to get home are truly remarkable at times. Putting together a new filter is very nerve-wracking, making course corrections, restoring systems are all edgily worked into the narrative, and with the tight camera angles we really feel like we're right in the thick of it with them.Although we can't inevitably escape the fact that we already know the outcome, it is still a very rousing experience. When I saw the capsule parachute to safety in the cinemas, I almost cheered along with the people in the film.Definitely my favourite film from Ron Howard, and Tom Hank's epilogue really helps put things into perspective. Although people have been to the Moon and back, that doesn't mean we should interpret that as "been there, done that."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard's direction provides excitement and suspense, even if you already know the outcome of this remarkably film that vividly chronicles the most dramatic space flight in history; the ill-fated 13th Apollo mission bound for the moon. It had been less than a year since man first walked on the Moon, but as far as the American public was concerned, Apollo 13 was just another "routine" space flight--until these words pierced the immense void of space: "Houston, we have a problem." Stranded 205,000 miles from Earth in a crippled spacecraft, astronauts Jim Lovell (Hanks), Fred Haise (Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Bacon) fight a desperate battle to survive. Meanwhile, at Mission Control, astronaut Ken Mattingly (Sinise), flight director Gene Kranz (Harris) and a heroic ground crew race against time--and the odds--to bring them home.The best thing about Apollo 13 is how moving it is during its most quiet moments. This is a powerful story, told with great clarity and remarkable technical detail. The acting is superb, perhaps Tom Hank's finest hour. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off ? I have to confess I am an avowed space junkie and this tends to raise the bar in terms of my expectations of this movie, being familiar with the true life events that form the background of this movie. In summary, the movie surrounds the near-disaster which surrounded NASA's Ill-fated 3rd Mission to the moon. After two landings on the moon the missions had become almost commonplace and public interest in the space program was beginning to wane. This changed at 03:06 UT on 14 April 1970 when a malfunction in a heating coil caused an oxygen tank to explode, severely damaging the service module. The damage was so extensive that it forced the abandonment of the moon-landing and the severely compromised the ability of Astronauts Cpt James Lovell, John L Swigert and Fred Haise jnr to return home, a task they were able to accomplish only by jury-rigging their available equipment under the direction of Houston and suffering cold temperatures before they were able to successfully renter the Earths atmosphere in their spacecraft.Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are eerily convincing as the astronauts and excellently manage to convey the tension of being in mortal danger in a malfunctioning tin can a quarter of a million miles from home, facing not only the bitter disappointment at not completing the mission of landing on the moon but the prospect of losing their lives in such an inhospitable and lonely environment. Of course nobody except the original astronauts knows what was going through their minds but Hanks et al allow the audience to appreciate the state of disciplined tension and terror that the voyagers were subjected to.Other performances worthy of note include a determined and gritty portrayal of Charismatic and forceful Nasa Flight Director Gene Kranz by Ed Harris.The film is well directed and the pace does not lack, despite the difficulty of portraying events in a tense fashion in a space not much larger than a large caravan, and the long periods of inactivity that form a large part of manned space flight.Summary : An excellent `true life' movie, successful in portraying events both in space and the reaction of those left on the ground.Rating : 90%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving and epic tale of American heroism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here it is, one of the best films of the 90s. A truly moving and beautiful film that deserves every bit of praise that has been heaped on it by critics and audiences alike. This movie is more of an experience than a narrative, as most of us are quite familiar with the events surrounding the doomed Apollo 13 mission to the moon.I was simply impressed with the utter and stark realism of the film, and the fact that the near tragedy did not manage to sour the audience on space exploration. The men on the Apollo missions were heroes, and the men on this 13th mission were no less heroes than those who actually made it to the moon. I can't imagine the feelings that these three men must have experienced being trapped in space, so very far from home, but this film really manages to capture the essence of the trip.Howard made an excellent decision when he chose to simply re-tell the story rather than adding lots of peripheral dramatic storylines (as a lesser director surely would have), he allows the story to speak for itself. The acting is so understated and controlled that it is often hard to notice that we are dealing with actors and not the actual event itself. The special effects are also unnoticeable, which means great. There was never a moment in the film when I felt as though I was watching a movie, but instead I always felt like I was experiencing something. Apollo 13 is truly a film that any lover of the medium must see, any future director must watch and anyone who dreams of space travel and exploration will truly enjoy. A seriously amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film really takes me back...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 11 years old when the Apollo 13 was launched, and I can remember so well my whole family following the story on TV. This movie brings it all back to me, including the PRIDE all Americans felt when those three astronauts returned safely home. That fourth minute during re-entry was a long one! Anyone who was too young to remember the actual event, or not yet born, will never know the thrill those moon shots gave us. But this movie will, in my opinion, give you a reasonably good idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally had to give this movie the perfect 10 it deserved for a multitude of reasons.First of all, the acting was superb in this movie. Second, the realism - you honestly feel like you're watching three men in zero-gravity.But most of all, they did their best to adhere to the storyline, without taking too much dramatic or artistic license. Having seen a documentary made using the actual radio transmissions and testimonials from the actual crew of Apollo 13, I was absolutely amazed when I watched this movie. I own it on DVD, and with my kids will watch it over and over again. Do yourself a favor and share this depiction of one of the biggest triumphs of mankind with your loved ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Age: 13Jim Lovell, played by Tom Hanks, is selected, along with Ken Mattingly, played by Gary Sinise and Fred Haise, played by Bill Paxton, to fly to the moon on Apollo 13. Ken Mattingly, however, is pulled out of the mission, when his tests reveal that he could have a case of the measles coming on (they never do) and is replaced by Jack Swigert, played by Kevin Bacon. There isn't much public interest in this flight, as it has been done before, that is until things start to go wrong, among them oxygen venting out into space. The possibilities of a safe return begin to go away.I don't normally enjoy dramas, but Apollo 13 is one of the select few (others including The Shawshank Redemption, Mr Holland's Opus) that I do like. First of all, the acting is superb in this movie, Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan all excelling in their roles. Unlike most dramas, this one was actually moving to me. The science used in the film seems accurate (though I wouldn't really know) and you never get really bored watching this. Overall, Apollo 13 is a compelling drama and one of the best around.Australian Classification: PG: Low Level Coarse LanguageRating: 74 out of 100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few days ago was the first time I'd seen Apollo 13 (I'm 15, we were watching it at school) and I thought: "Anything to get out of work"What greeted me afterwards was weird. I enjoyed the fact that it was based off a true story and not some Hollywood crap of what MIGHT have happened. I will admit the re-entry scene (the ending) was done superbly, as well as Tom Hanks narrations of what happened after the events of Appolo. Perhaps my favourite part of the movie.I struggled not to laugh at Tom Hanks' voice after years of seeing him as Toy Story's Woody; I believe Bill Paxton's role was not a good one, the actor was not suited for that type of role.The entire movie in itself was very boring, especially the opening and before the launch. There were times during the space mission that I found interesting, but other than that, I really didn't enjoy it. Not one I'd watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screenplay: tripe Direction: competent FX: good Acting: excellentA great true story is...made into a Football Movie in space? Harris is the coach, and Hanks the QB. Kevin Bacon? He's the RB who fumbled the ball in the 1st Quarter and must now redeem himself. Paxton? The Tight End who sprained his knee in the 3rd Quarter but somehow pulls through the pain anyway. The man in the simulator? He's the benched chap who is dying to be out there on the field with the boys. You know from Frame 1 that the Hail Mary will be caught. And the dialogue is not simply shopworn, it's so manipulative you can almost feel the heartstrings being tugged at. And yet...Harris, Hanks, Bacon, and Paxton, play it with the sort of conviction that would be better applied to the last production ever of HAMLET. The last three are shot in close-up, just like M. Falconetti, for almost the entire film. If any one of them doubted for one second what he was doing, the movie would fail. The 1930s (Rest In Peace) were the Golden Age of screen writing. But right now, right under your nose, is the Golden Age of screen acting, and no one will realize it until it's gone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This unequalled and unsurpassable adventure of three courageous men in a spatial capsule is well told whether in the technical or the human aspect. There is no detail that you can say it's out of its place in what concerns feelings or handling of all the equipments involved. It's a movie that seizes us from the beginning till the end because we feel in the skins of those men and their families that witness powerlessly down here to their drama. We can in fact discuss whether the conquest of a dead planet like the moon is worth the risk run. But that's another aspect of the question which exceeds the aim of this movie and there no room here to deal with it. Here we are in presence of the story of a human 20th century epic which is what interests and suffices us in what concerns this movie. Space is the last frontier of Man. His destiny is to search it. This movie is well directed, presented and performed.It has some wonderful and original images considering the epoch in which it was made (1995). Its last third is particularly full of real and intense suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A most thrilling ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have even the remotest knowledge of history you know how Apollo 13, based as it is on a true story, will turn out. And yet the film is filled with a tremendous sense of drama, placing you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Being able to wring that much drama out a of a film which you might expect to have a sense of inevitability about it is a tremendous achievement. Full credit to director Ron Howard and his brilliant ensemble cast of wonderfully talented performers.Apollo 13 tells the story of a 1970 American space mission gone terribly wrong. The crew of Apollo 13 was headed to the moon which sounds exciting but at the time nobody in America seemed to really care. The general public now saw space travel as routine and the sense of wonder had been lost. A successful mission would have been barely noted by the American people. It took a potential disaster to capture their interest and the story as it is told here will certainly grab hold of you as well.When their spaceship is crippled by a potentially catastrophic failure the crew of Apollo 13 is facing seemingly insurmountable odds in its quest to safely return home to Earth. This film brilliantly captures the hardships the crew had to endure and the bravery and grace under pressure they exhibited. The film also shows the heroic efforts of the men on the ground who attempted to devise a way to bring the crippled ship home. All of the key roles are performed wonderfully. As the central figure in the drama, spaceship commander Jim Lovell, Tom Hanks is reliably brilliant. Lovell had to be a real leader and it's a role which fits Hanks perfectly. Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton portray the other two astronauts aboard the ship and each has his moments of brilliance as well. Gary Sinise has a key role as Ken Mattingly, an astronaut originally scheduled to be on the fateful mission who now does all he can from his spot on the ground to help bring his comrades home. Aside from Hanks probably the best performance is by Ed Harris as the man in charge on the ground, the resolute, confident, unwavering Flight Director Gene Kranz. Harris does a great job of bringing this character to life, inspiring you to believe that the seemingly impossible is possible after all.While the film, quite literally, takes a little while to get off the ground, once the spacecraft takes off Apollo 13 is an absolutely thrilling journey. It is wonderfully acted, beautifully photographed and packed with drama. Even if you know what's coming you can't help but be swept up by an immense wave of emotion. Given the benefit of a great story to work with Ron Howard delivers a masterpiece. Brilliantly done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failure is not an option</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of American race to the Moon is incomparable. At first it was a try to catch up with the Soviets, after that pass them. JFK knew well what he did. He wanted to settle that the democracy is superior to communism. He proved it also in outer space. One of Nasa achievements was saving lives of the crew of Apollo 13. And this is the story. Due to incompetence and neglect the crew of Apollo 1 died during a routine count down. Due to the human intelligence and good fortune Jim Lovell and his crew returned safely home. The movie is excellent. There are technical flaws of course but most of them are covered by live Lovell's commentary. And the story is about how every human being, sometimes against all odds, can survive activating the human will of survival and powers of our mind. The visual effects are of minor importance here. It's the actors, their faces, tone of their voices, their moves tell us the story. They did well. After I read Lovell's 'Lost Moon' and Kranz's 'Failure is Not an Option' /which quote was spitefully used on the NYT after the tragedy of Columbia/ I liked the movie even more. Dust in the wind we are. Such achievements like the conquest of the cosmos give our lives a bit of meaning, due to possible harvesting the assets by our children. Apollo 13 is a kind of record of such heroic efforts. Worth watching and thinking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It can't really be perfect...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apollo 13 is the type of film that inspires an almost reverential cinematic high immediately after a showing. This in itself is good. It's yet another example of the a well-made film's power. But then you sleep on it for a few nights; your blood cools; and you realize the film isn't actually perfect. Right?Apollo 13 certainly has everything going for it. The acting is first rate, with Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton all giving career-high performances. The script is excellent; it successfully rides the line of maximum emotion without degenerating into cliche and saccharine territory. It has excellent cinematography and visual effects. It's a superior period picture, although I'm relying on hearsay for this, since it takes place a generation before my time. Ron Howard also displays a willingness to take a few risks. The movie would have worked excellently as a straight docudrama, but he instead adds a few touches to give it some more intangible impact -- some "evil omen" signs that don't insult the audience's intelligence, and some dream and fantasy scenes that work excellently.One thing I noticed was that the film wears its era's politics quite unashamedly. There is precious little revisionist history here. The women are all housewives with very simple moral world-views, and the world they live in is completely white-bred. Tom Hank's Lovell reminisces about his World War II record, his son goes to military school, and the newscasts at the end are overstuffed with references to prayers for the astronauts going on all over the world. A lot of these are small details that could have been changed with no trouble, but the filmmakers retained them, and the cumulative impact is to give a very clear sense that you are living in the Nixon era.Ultimately, this may be the cause of my hesitation. This is a film that works best if you whole-heartedly immerse yourself in its emotions, rather than holding back to ponder its political bent. But even so, that climax and ending monologue will get you every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't worry about the capsule - Tom Hanks is aboard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every other February an old debate is revived: how, people ask, can a movie POSSIBLY be nominated for Best Picture without its director being nominated for Best Director?`Apollo 13' shows how this can be so and rightly so. It's good, to be sure, but what MAKES it good? The story (amazingly, a true one) and the subject matter. Neither of these were Ron Howard's doing. He transferred the story and subject matter to the screen and created a good film which, given the potential, falls a bit flat. Considering the grandeur of space and the unspeakable emotions of astronauts trapped in a flying sardine can, in constant contact with the human race but thousands of miles from the nearest atmosphere, it ought to have been a knockout.But the problem is that there's the usual Howard mannerisms: formula, graceless direction, no taste whatever in music, and, worst of all, an inane trust in brawn, leadership and the power of positive thinking. This is a film in which engineers and scientists are made to look like ineffectual fools, where people can be made to do the impossible if - and only if - someone shouts at them loudly enough. I don't want to press this point. `Apollo 13' is far from being the worst offender of its kind. Most of the film's energy is concentrated where it should be: on the space capsule and the difficulties it faces.A more serious drawback is Tom Hanks. Somehow it's always Tom Hanks who talks sense, Tom Hanks who settles disputes, Tom Hanks who manifests initiative, nobility, perfect health and good cheer. The other two astronauts might as well be made of wood. For a film about three people who share exactly the same fate and have exactly the same claim upon our sympathy, this looks suspiciously like a star vehicle. I personally find this particularly hard to take, since the star in question gives a typically leathery performance. More than anyone else he looks as if he never left Earth.Still, he hasn't given a better performance and Ron Howard certainly hasn't made a better film. It COULD have been much better - but superb though the subject matter is, the film wasn't GUARANTEED to be engrossing - and yet it is.</fullReview>

I liked the lingo that's everywhere in the picture, at least they had a good space travel advisor (well that's before you read the goofs section:-).

		<fullReview>While history taught us about the events that took place during the actual Apollo 13 mission, it was nice to have this movie put Visuals to these events. But as such, then this wasn't fully a very necessary movie, except for boosting American ego.What made "Apollo 13" watchable was the impressive cast list and their individual performances. And I will say that the ensemble of actors and actresses here really was phenomenal.For a space movie then "Apollo 13" isn't really amongst the most interesting, perhaps because this was science fact and not science fiction. That, at least, was the breaking point for me. Being familiar with the actual story then I found this 1995 movie, well, unnecessary, to be honest."Apollo 13" is worth watching for the star quality acting performances, or if you are not already familiar with the actual historical events.A good enough movie for what it turned out to be; a mediocre visualization of real events.</fullReview>

However, I have no real complaints except that the last hour kind of dragged on. I was getting bored at a few parts in the last hour, although the last 10 minutes or so are quite good. However, the first hour is very good though, although I think they should have spent less time in the space shuttle and more building the characters because you don't get a sense of danger and there comes a point when you don't care whether they make it back alive or not.

		<shortDescription>The Apollo 13 explosion creates inspiring lessons on the risks of space travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was 1970. Apollo 13's mission was to repeat what the astronauts at Apollo 11 did---go to the moon and go back successfully.The blast-off was normal and the series of separations just before they reached space were also good. As they reached about 80,000 miles or so into space, one of the astronauts tries to stir the fuel tanks with just a press of one button. Little did they realize that this action would mean a precarious event is going to hit not only the spacecraft of Apollo 11--but also threaten the lives of the astronauts inside it.It started with a main explosion of a fuel tank, and then, subsequent shakes and booms. There are reports of fuel tanks having undervoltage, and not until about 10 minutes later, does astronaut Jim Lowell (played by Tom Hanks) visually realize that at least one oxygen tank is spewing out oxygen. He is the first to realize that there was a major leak in one of the fuel tanks of the command module.They now realize that they have to follow Mission Control commands in Houston, because Lowell is telling the two other astronauts that they have to shut down the power to the command module, or the "Odyssey", as they call in the movie. And Lowell is the first to tell those other Apollo 11 astronauts probably one of the most famous quotes..."We've just lost the moon." Not just the other famous quote, "Houston, we have a problem!" Later on, Mission Control specialists tell the astronauts that they need to shut down the command module's power, which they do, and they had to move the LEM--or the lunar extraction module (or "lunar module" for short), which is nicknamed "Aquarius." Then, now that the landing of the moon had been scraped, the astronauts had to make a controlled burn around the moon in a slingshot action almost similar to that burn-around you may have seen in the movie "Armeggeddon." Yes, using lunar gravity to speed-up the trip back to Earth.The burn is successful, but they need to save much needed power, so they shut down power to the LEM, which includes shutting down heat to it, so that means they have to freeze a little bit in order to have a safe trip for a good geodesic entry towards Earth.Then more problems. Readings on the LEM indicate that the carbon dioxide levels are rising to toxic levels...meaning that the astronauts could suffocate in minutes. Mission Control finally finds a bizarre procedure to knock those high levels of C02 back to the non-danger zone. It was tense as the astronauts started to cough. But eventually, the astronauts finally fix the problem...they can breathe again.Now, the geodesic re-entry is in 2 steps--very difficult. First, they do the retro-burn about 70,000 miles towards earth and their trajectory towards earth eventually goes quite good. Now, because the command module only has the heat shield, and power to the module can only have several amps, they had to separate first the Odyssey (the LEM) and the Aquarius (the service module). After Aquarius goes away from the command module, Lowell realized the big damage in the Aquarius' fuel tank.Now, the second step for the good geodesic re-entry to earth depends on the command module's heat shield as they head towards splashdown. A failure of the heat shield would mean incinerating death for the 3 astronauts. Temperatures on re-entry outside can be as high as 2000 to 3000F. The whole world was on pins and needles as the command module heated up as the craft went through the earth's atmosphere...but then, as the craft splashed down with already-opened parachutes in the ocean and word spread that the craft survived re-entry, Lowell was the real hero.As well as the two other astronauts! And even more--Lowell's mother was overjoyed about the near-disaster now coming to an end for Apollo 11 for good!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Apollo13' is the Ron Howard film about the historic disaster event of you guessed it, the Apollo 13. "Houston we have a problem", only that one problem turns into a million problems for those three astronauts who were expecting to walk on the moon that day. A fail mission then becomes a rescue mission for Houston. They must put their dorky-headed minds together and devise various tragedies to insure that the two family men and the bachelor return home. A lot of emotion excels in this desperate time both from the astronauts and the people in Houston killing themselves trying to come up with ways to conserve their power, food and oxygen. And of course we can't forget those friends and family biting their nails hoping that they can still have one last barbecue together before saying their goodbyes. Ron Howard really made me feel like this was real, and I know it was, it's just that he retells it in such a believable and suspenseful way. The terminology is solid, the visual effects are amazing but not over done, and the huge line of American actors was assembled perfectly. There's a saddening sense of loss for those astronauts not being able to walk on the moon that later becomes a beautiful sense of relief to a safe return home, which all in all adds to a very satisfying ending. If you weren't around to see the real thing, like I unfortunately wasn't, then this movie is the very next best thing for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard's best movie to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard recreates the Apollo 13 mission on the screen and transports the viewer back in time. The music, sets, hairstyles, clothing, etc. all contribute to the recreation of the early 1970's, but it never overwhelms the viewer. A less skillful director might have had a few scenes that just screamed "YOU"RE IN THE 70's! GET IT?" An explosion on the Apollo 13 rocks the ship off course and causes an oxygen leak. They have to get the leak under control, turn around, and get back to Earth, in the midst of solving a seemingly endless number of problems that crop up. Apollo 13 is a drama that takes place in space, and winds up being more suspenseful than many of the science fiction/action movies today. Just the sound of the alarms and the sight of Oxygen levels dropping are enough to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. It keeps you rooting for the good guys to come home safely even though we know how the film will end. I must compliment how educational the film really is. By all accounts the film is pretty accurate, and one can learn a lot about space travel in the 70's from Apollo 13. This film proves historical films can be accurate and entertaining at the same time. The film's greatest strength however is a stellar cast. Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris are all likable and easy to relate to. We sympathize with Hanks, who plays Jim Lovell, because he will never realize his dream of walking on the moon. Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) falls ill and has kids on the way. We feel sorry for Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) because we can't help but feel there is an unnecessary antagonism toward him because he was not originally assigned to the mission. Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) is kicked off the mission because he is exposed to the measles. He never gets the measles, and he has a great "I told you so" moment. We all sympathize with Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and the rest of mission control, who work day and night to get Apollo 13 home. Finally, there is Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlan), who can only wait helplessly and pray her husband will come back. The scene where her wedding ring falls down the drain gives a strong sense of foreboding.Apollo 13 was a much better film than Braveheart and should have won the Oscar, if not Babe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But Flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard is, without doubt, an excellent director. One of the best, in fact. And this film does go a long way towards showing subsequent generations what happened aboard the Apollo 13 in 1970. But while it does chronicle the events, it fails to show the political upheaval which took NASA by storm as a result of this failed mission and instead, chooses to focus on the heart-wrenching and sometimes played-to-death angst of the NASA wives.The arguments and disagreements which occur within that capsule are documented in the book written by Jim (Hanks's character), and are downplayed something fierce in order to allow Ron Howard his warm and fuzzy feeling; something he seems to need. While I haven't a problem with Ron's warm fuzzies, I do if they interfere with the story, and this time (Sorry Ron), they do.Other than these oversights (intentional or not), the film adequately depicts the actual events of the Apollo 13 mission. I know, because I was one of the millions who was alive, and remembers it. In spite of ignoring the (understandable and excused) virtual battle our three astronauts waged against one another in space, NASA fallout omissions, and errant warm fuzzies, I still enjoy this film.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chopped Widescreen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a High School Physics teacher and I use this film as part of my curriculum so I have watched it many, many times. I used to own the VHS version which had the sides of the picture chopped off "to fit my screen". I was happy to get the widescreen version on DVD but very disappointed to find out that the widescreen version seems to be the chopped VHS version with further chopping on the top and bottom to make it appear widescreen. There is definitely less picture on the widescreen DVD than there was on the formatted VHS. Is this normal, and is there any way to get a copy of the actual size theatrical release? The way I found out about this is by some of the goofs that appear on this site. Most were visible and evident on the VHS version but are no longer easily caught on the DVD version. For example, when the daughter is holding the Beatles album, it was easy to see what album it was on the VHS version but you get only a quick glimpse on the DVD version. Likewise, the ashtray that disappears is no longer evident because you don't see enough information. This is very disappointing and I am interested in purchasing the full size version if it exists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real space odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard is a solid if unspectacular director. He's capable of making enjoyable films, but they often feel trite and uninspired. However, with Apollo 13 he comes closet to making something that achieves greatness.But it must be said that it would take an unspeakably awful filmmaker to make a poor movie about the Apollo 13 story. All you have to do is stick close to the facts, film it and not get in the way. And I guess that's what Howard does, for his directing style is pretty anonymous and his viewpoint is narrow ? the film doesn't really concern itself with the politics of Apollo. And while in some cases that could hurt a film, here it's the right decision, because rather than try and be a critique of the space programme it's the simple story of a bunch of guys trying to get home ? too much commentary would detract from the drama.Not that there isn't the odd bit of commentary here and there. There's a good scene where the astronauts are broadcasting from their craft, not knowing that the TV networks have dumped them ? already space exploration has become boring. And there's also the scene where the media try and set up shop on Marilyn Lovell's lawn ? the media are only interested in the mission once the crew are in jeopardy. And on top of this you get a few digs at NASA bureaucracy. But aside from that, the film assumes you're in awe of space exploration and that you agree with the Apollo programme.And while the flag waving nature of the film with its patriotic music, long pauses and hushed voices is its weakness, it's also its strength, because as absurd and expensive as space travel is, it still touches something deep inside. There's something moving about a bunch of guys risking their lives to push the boundaries. And although Teflon is the greatest thing that space exploration has produced, there's a sense of wonder and pride in knowing that men have managed to break the shackles of the Earth and walked on the Moon (anyone who thinks the landings were hoaxed should be shot ? conspiracy theorists are perhaps even more worthless than Goths).Therefore there's quite a bit of emotion when Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) realises that he wont be walking on the Moon. This is his dream and its been dashed. And there's a great scene when the craft orbits the Moon. Knowing that he won't be walking on it, he refuses to look, knowing that to gaze upon it would be torture. But despite his reluctance, his resolve eventually cracks and when he turns back round he imagines what it would have been like to walk on the surface. It's a small moment of fantasy, but it brilliantly illustrates the joy that has been denied this man.Less effective is the scene where Lovell explains the lunar landing to his son. The intention is okay ? to make light of the risks for the sake of family ? but the kid is a little too cutesy. And I also dislike the scenes with Lovell's mother. She's a dotty old woman and serves as the film's comic relief ? she asks Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin whether they're part of the space programme. But the film should have either made her more believable or dispensed with her entirely.Much more effective are the scenes with mission control. Ed Harris is great as always and there are some moments of real tension. Plus the scenes with mission control show what a team effort it was to bring the astronauts back home. And I even forgave the film scenes of mass whooping, because although a bunch of loud-mouthed Americans whooping usually irritates the hell out of me, I was almost joining in. I felt like punching the air when the rocket took off and I felt like raising the roof when the crew landed in the Pacific ? finally here's something worth whooping about.Another of the film's strengths is its attention to detail. All the technical jargon, all the confusing buttons and all the convoluted procedures have a convincing air of authenticity. And it also helps that some of the scenes were shot in zero G. It allows you to concentrate on the story (dodgy effects would have been a huge distraction). And the zero G produces a couple of wonderful moments, the first being Bill Paxton puking chunks (we've all wondered what weightless vomiting would look like) and the second occurring during the television broadcast that was ditched for baseball when Paxton throws his sunglasses at the camera ? it captures the fun of space.But really the film works best as the story of a bunch of guys trying to get back home (and it's apt that one of the craft was named Odyssey, as the journey has a lot in common with Homer's epic poem). And while that means that the film doesn't have a whole lot to say on an intellectual level, it works superbly on an emotional one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable real life drama of astronaut heroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My whole family really enjoyed this film and especially, in contrast to some viewers, its more technical aspects. This entire flight was a topic I knew very little about (though I was probably a teenager at the time), so found it both an informative and gripping drama.It chronicles the ill adventures of Apollo 13, NASA's third planned lunar landing, which at the time had become routine and failed to capture the public's attention. The flight runs into potentially fatal problems when an oxygen tank explodes, precluding the planned moon landing, and the intelligent, highly stressed astronauts (as well as the Houston control team) must use all their skill, creativity, and ingenuity to avert disaster and ensure a safe return to earth.The cast does a magnificent job in recreating the three astronauts, their camaraderie and determined efforts... flight commander, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), and replacement astronaut, Jack Swiger (Kevin Bacon), and also the Houston mission control director (Ed Harris). The film captures the disappointment of crew members (especially Lovell) in being denied their exciting moon landing, so long anticipated and trained for, and also portrays the effects of this potential tragedy on their families, particularly Lovell's devoted wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan).I have little knowledge of the historical accuracy or personal lives of the astronauts aboard this Apollo flight. Some have claimed that the personalities of some of the crew have been altered; if so, I would not approve. Although based on fact with a lot of attention to technical detail, it should, nevertheless, probably be regarded as a Hollywood production, and not necessarily a documentary.Even though we know in advance the outcome, it still has a riveting plot to keep viewers glued to their seats. The movie is especially a testament to the dangers inherent in space flight even to this very day, the training and courage of astronauts, and the anxiety that must be experienced by their families, especially when something goes amiss during the flight. Personally, I found The Right Stuff just a wee bit dull, but rate very highly this movie that put the phrase 'Houston, we have a problem' into our everyday vocabulary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a Hollywood rarity when films end with the objective of the main characters is met without meting it. Like in Cool Runnings, the guys gained respect of the other competitors even though they did not win. In Apollo 13 the guys did not make it to the moon and Tom Hanks did not step foot out of his craft onto the lunar bedrock but he did win the attention so craved from the US people and those around the world. I think this movie contains a message to all of us, we do not need to reach the goals set for us by others to be happy. All in all a decent flick and a rock steady performance from Tom Hanks as Usual... This was not great for the geeks who like to find out about facts and figures but I like the fact that it really makes you feel for the guys and want them to get home safe. The little old lady is my fave character she clearly has no clue about whats going on... a solid 8/10 from me.</fullReview>

Everyone involved in this movie did an excellent job to bring the event to life, and by the end, you could well find yourself willing the astronauts on, just like Gene Kranz and the rest of the world did back in April in 1970.IMHO, the best movie Tom Hanks has been in (I found this much better than Forrest Gump), and the best movie of 1995.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is fabulous! I studied the space program in college, and I got to ride in a space shuttle simulator once. I think the film did an excellent job of showing all that goes into a space mission. The one thing that disappointed me was Chris Ellis' portrayal of Deke Slayton. I met Deke Slayton once, and he was one of those men who just seemed to have an energy field around him. He was very passionate about the space program, and he had the greatest laugh. I can't imagine that he would have seemed as mild-mannered as Ellis portrayed him during such a tense situation. The Deke Slayton in the film was far too bland for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping story professionally rendered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)I don't think it matters whether you remember the story of the Apollo 13 space mission or not. Whether you know the ending or whether you were otherwise occupied at the time in 1970, the tension created and maintained by the fine script (by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert with uncredited help from John Sayles) and the direction of Ron Howard will compel your interest. And when the resolution comes it will command your emotions.Part of the success of this movie goes to the fine acting by Tom Hanks, who is, in a professional and psychological sense, very much like those fly boys with the Right Stuff who fearlessly left our comfort cocoon here on earth and ventured into the cold, dark airlessness of space for glory and honor and maybe for proof of their manhood. Like the astronauts depicted, Tom Hanks is always on task and always delivers an arresting and believable performance.Ed Harris, who played the flight director in Houston was also excellent as was Kevin Bacon as the replacement astronaut who had to fly the ship. In fact the entire cast, especially a whole lot of people with small roles as part of the nearly anonymous support techno nerds at NASA, gave believable and compelling performances. A lot of the credit for that has to go to Ron Howard, who made sure that they all looked the way they were suppose to look. After all, they were engaged in the success or failure of the mission in the most immediate sense.I also was very much moved by the musical score by James Horner. When you have an extraterrestrial epic, you need the music of the spheres, and Horner provided that. The music was so triumphantly married to the events and to the cosmic adventure, that it inspired without drawing undue attention to itself. It is one of the most beautiful film scores I have ever heard.Although this was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it won only two, for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Perhaps the movie was considered too much of a purely commercial venture at the time (and because of the budget it was largely that of course), and perhaps Howard's direction and intention seemed very much by the book. However I think the final result turned out to be more than some thought when it was released in 1995. It is a heroic epic, with a worthy theme, professionally done. Everybody worked hard for veracity and they certainly convinced me. Nonetheless there is perhaps something missing here. Although the sheer horror of dying in the cold vacuum of space or being burned up by a too rapid descent into the atmosphere is kept very much on our minds, there is a level of psychological reality that lives within the heart and soul of the astronaut and within the astronaut's family that was attempted here but not entirely achieved.See this for Ron Howard who did a great job as director and for Tom Hanks, one of the most charismatic actors of our time, and especially for astronaut Jim Lovell who lived it and (with help from Jeffrey Kluger) wrote the book Lost Moon (1994) upon which the film was based.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apollo 13 realy is a very good film. The one thing Ron Howard knows how to do is tell a good story with double sized dollops of sentiment, 'just in case'. His solid style is equally prevalent in 'A Beautiful Mind'. The use of the Ametre, at Houston Control, as the device which shows us the precariousness of the crews situation is pure Howard. However, my only real gripe, and it's a big one, is that there is just too much exposition. If it's not from the characters asides then its from the shots of TV programmes or the O.B.s of various TV journalists. Whether this is because everything has to be explicitly revealed to an American audience or not I dont know. But what do we say to stupid people when they dont take something in? 'Do you want me to draw you a picture?'The salvaging of the Apollo 13 mission is truly a great story and with this film Howard has drawn us all a picture.</fullReview>

The "goose bump" chills that come with over sappy dialogue are mitigated with repeated viewings I find. And this film is loaded with sappiness. But once you get desensitized to the Richie Cunningham lines, like `Let's go to the moon, gentlemen,' you'll really enjoy the ride this film takes you on. Cast is great, Hanks flanked by 3 of the most prominent second fiddles in the business, Sinise, Bacon and Paxton. And the shots of mission control are just as I remembered them as a kid. Either the actress wasn't too swift, or the role was poorly written, or maybe its such a guy movie that she didn't stand a chance of holding her own, but...Lovell's wife is really a detractor, and kind of unlikable. I think the movie does a fantastic job of restirring those same emotions of utter awe at what we were accomplishing by walking on the moon. Something we haven't done since, oddly enough. These early missions were carried forth, more on grit than on technology. I'm sure each of you reading this has more processing firepower in your PC than the entire space program had at the time.

Most hard core movie critics believe that a movie's story line and plot are secondary to it's theme and they point out that Apollo 13 has a weak theme. To me, a movie's greatness is not measured by it's original theme or its outstanding plot or imaginative ending but a combination of all these to create an emotion.

		<fullReview>It's funny: even though Ron Howard has an extremely long and recognized career as a movie director and he even won his first Oscar quite recently I still consider him first of all as Richie Cunningham, the wacky star of tv's greatest comedies "Happy days" and only after that as a movie director. I know very few remembers his television past nowadays but I do. I do Richie! "Apollo 13" was certainly not one of Howard's finest achievements. It's a first rate filmmaking from start to finish but it brings nothing new to the genre of space films and it tends to be frustratingly boring. I even went to see it on the cinema and later on watch it again at least once. Watchable enough, splendid acting and stylish direction but if you want to see a really good movie from this guy, one that's not boring, try "Ransom" and you'll be more than pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, gripping and realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to find a flaw with this film, because it is very realistic and the only "weaknesses" are due directly to this realism: a lack of big moral points to make, sometimes slow plot development. Having said that, I found it quite gripping and involving on both of two viewings.Good or great performances from all involved, with a pleasing lack of showboating even from the usually loud Kevin Bacon. A real sense of team effort developed, which is very rare in Hollywood, where 90% of films feature one or two main characters saving the world (boring).This film is a fine example of how to bring a real story to life without butchering it or just using it as a set piece - in stark contrast to Pearl Harbor. I can't say it's an insanely great film, but it's pretty damn good. 8 out 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant film, and well worth watching. The special effects are excellent with few people knowing that all footage used is original to the film, and not actual footage from the expedition. Tom Hanks is as ever excellent in his role as the mission commander, with the other cast providing good support.The plot revolves around the thirteenth Apollo mission, with the intention to land on the moon. Following take-off there one or two glitches, but then as the mission is on course to the moon there is a major explosion that cripples the space craft. This sets the stage for the race against time on earth for a solution to be found, and some tense moments on-board for the crew of Apollo 13!A very worth while film, and I have watched and re-watched it time over again.

		<fullReview>I admire Ron Howard. He seems to be able to tackle any subject matter, and do it with style and originality. Is he Howard Hawks reincarnated, maybe?However, Tom Hanks is an incredibly irritating, sanctimonious s.o.b. "Gentlemen, what are your intentions?" he solemnly postures to his underlings. Maybe it's just the the way the character was written, but I get the impression that Hanks is way, way too impressed with himself. He acts as if his every word is some precious insight that is to be savored and smiled at with respect. I don't know if Jim Lovell was quite this arrogant, but if I were stuck inside a box for 7 days with that mouth of his, I'd have jumped ship, helmet or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an incredible movie of intense emotion, suspense and warmth that brings unity and appreciation for life. Absolutely brilliant acting from Tom Hanks who plays his role with an admirable coolness, and as always, completely natural. Ed Harris was magnificent in his role, and his tears at the end were modest and moving. The rest of the cast were great in support. The moments when the ship was returning to Earth (having not known the real story myself) were incredibly suspenseful due to the quietness and faces of the actors. I have rarely been on the edge of my seat in a movie like this one. Great scenes in space, gives you a view most won't experience. Good special effects, spectacular sound in the launch scene. This is a classic tale that has been very well directed. It would not be easy recreating this story but this movie has achieved that. I would have liked to have seen a reunion with family at the end for that extra "oomph" but thats just a personal opinion that doesn't need to be taken as a criticism. I recommend this to everyone at all ages, even if you know the story. This movie is hard to falter and can be watched many times without losing the emotional impact. Its a ride and you'll want to go on again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, but with a few low points.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I'll point out that I did really like this movie. Great special effects, the lead cast was quite good, and many scenes were very well done. Even in moments of utter silence, with nothing happening, the tension was still obvious. The music as a whole is quite good, but the main title theme is repeated a little too much - after all, it hardly has the impact of something like Alexander Courage's Star Trek theme. Overall, an excellent movie. But there are still many bad points. The movie is rather slow to begin with, and there are plenty of the family scenes that should have been cut. They add nothing to the movie - and in many cases they detract from it. This isn't helped by the acting from the female cast members, which is simply appalling. Surely they could afford at least one person besides a few of the top listed men who could act. Also, there are many cliches in the dialogue, and the heroic nature of these people is hammered into us far too many times. Still, I did enjoy it, but more as escapism than anything meaningful. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was an epoch that started in the Cuban missile crisis, or maybe it was the Kennedy assassination; it ended in Watergate, or maybe it was in Apollo 13. It was the age of Rock'n'Roll and Viet Nam, Monterey and Da Nang... Anyway, the 60s were interesting times. I'm an electronics engineer that works in spacecraft control systems. The film was very good from the technical standpoint, no big blunders, just some slight exaggerations, to maintain the suspense. But I was a kid when it happened and I remember those times, I think the general attitude is missing. Modern kids, who listen to Alanis Morrissette, may not understand this, but people had some strange dreams in those psychedelic years. By the early 70s everybody knew the dream had ended, we would not colonize the Moon in this century, environmental pollution was (and still is) a lethal danger, global nuclear war was imminent, you get the idea. Depending on your point of view, you were afraid that either communism or capitalism would take over the world (my uncle died with a piece of shrapnel through his heart while fighting the communists in eastern Europe, so you know what was MY fear). "Apollo 13", the film, was well made, both from the technical and the artistic point of view, but it missed the chance to capture the spirit of the final days of an age when drama was lived in real time.</fullReview>

The script is something else. So lines were kind of corny and didn't really need to be told. Like when Barbra Lovell wants to be a hippy for Halloween. Other than the script, this a thriller that keeps you interested because you can relate to the characters. It should have won more Academy Awards that it got.

		<shortDescription>A fabulous movie that relates a true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apollo 13 is exciting each time I watch it. Each piece of the movie contributes to make a riveting story even with the known ending. Effects are breathtaking (all of the launch scenes, for example, are computer-generated since the stock footage was all unacceptable).Best of all, the movie is historically accurate. Granted, Howard took some license, but not much. The biggest difference is that the astronauts on the historical mission fired the engine several short times manually while the movie version packed all the excitement into one firing. Other differences amount to minutia. For example, the historical record shows that they played "Blue Danube", as opposed to the movie's "Spirit in the Sky", at the beginning of the real TV broadcast. At other times, the details are real. Marion Lovell actually did loose her wedding ring in the shower!Acting in the movie is superb. You feel the frustration when Mattingly has to stay home with measles. You feel the excitement when Swigert gets to go in his place. You feel Marian Lovell's stress when she doesn't know what's going to happen to her husband. You feel the cold, uncertainty, and dependence on ground support on the return trip. You feel a part of the team called NASA that ultimately brought the astronauts home.Overall, Apollo 13 is a magnificent movie - well worth watching time and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apollo 13 has some excellent points to recommend it. It is one of those very rare true-life action movies that contains absolutely no violence. Suitable for all ages, Apollo 13 preserves detailed historic accuracy and presents real American heroes who are so brave and dedicated they put a lump in your throat.It is easy to tell a true story that is fascinating. But the great accomplishment of Apollo 13 is that it keeps the story dramatic from beginning to end, a place where many historical movies fail. It also has perhaps the best special effects ever put to film. They actually filmed the zero-gee scenes in NASA's zero-gee simulating airplane. Effects just can't get more special than that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a very dramatic event that got the globe coming together at the time praying that the astronauts would be okay, Apollo 13's realistic story and strong performances made it not-better-but-as-good-as the real event. Apollo 13 was supposed to be the third shuttle to land on the moon but an oxygen tank exploded and the astronauts found themselves in a real situation. Going through hell to get back to Earth, the guys finally made it and the world was happy. An interesting story but very simple. Thanks to writers William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert, the story became a complex challenge of life or death situation. Also helped by strong performances particularly from Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan, Apollo 13 became an instant classic when it came out in 1994.</fullReview>

Thanks to this movie, the books "Moondust" and "The First Man", a whole new generation of people are being exposed to the event."From The Earth To The Moon" took it to another level altogether and gave us the untold story.

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest American Films Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Apollo 13' is one of those rare movies that strives for and succeeds in showing America as the greatest nation on earth. Themes such as loyalty, honour, love, and failure are explored in the film in a very mature and moving way, without ever resorting to sentimentality.Even though we know how the events unfold and how it ends, I was still completely immersed in this great experience. One of the many strengths Ron Howard has as a film maker is in casting. With Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan, Howard has assembled a cast of truly great actors, who reflect what America is and what it stands for. I have never been so moved by an ensemble cast in this film due to their passion and love for this event.The other plaudits should go to the makers of the film. Ron Howard has succeeded in bringing out the tension on a moment by moment basis. I really felt as if I was living this event with those in the film.Digital Domain also deserves credit for the breathtaking visual effects on display. They are perhaps the biggest achievement of the company so far. James Horner is one of the top composers in the business and his score is moving, breathtaking, and spiritual. The scene where Apollo 13 goes around the moon and loses temporary contact with Houston is one of the most memorable and spiritual scenes I have ever seen. It is completely unforgettable and shows space in the most eerily beautiful way.If I was to go on about what I liked about 'Apollo 13' this review would go on and on. This film shows a hope and optimism that seems to be lacking not just in films, but also in the world today. Being from England and having lived in the USA, I have a great love and respect for that nation and 'Apollo 13' reminds me the ideals America stands for. This is without a doubt one of the greatest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, and Kevin Bacon round out the cast of the best movie of 1995. Apollo 13 was the spacecraft that found itself, with Jim Lovell (Hanks), Fred Haise (Paxton), and Jack Swigert (Bacon) inside stranded 205,000 miles away from earth with little power, and their air supply running dangerously low. All throughout this picture there are challenges that are met, while anything and everything that can go wrong, do go wrong.Apollo 13 is full of great acting and the costumes, sets, and appropriatly dated technology make this film easier to watch. There's nothing worse than watching a period film with a late 90's Mustang in the shot. Cudos to Gary Sinise for his brilliant acting as the cool headed Gene Kranz, a late scratch from the mission due to the possibility of a measles break out. With Apollo 13 all but counted out, Kranz heads a round-the-clock effort to bring the boys home. Apollo 13 is 2 hours and 20 minutes of nail-biting adventure complete with some awesome space scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent space movie based on the true events of the aborted Apollo 13 mission to the Moon. Of course for those of us who are old to remember the moon missions we already know the ending. However, Ron Howard does an excellent of making this "remake" even more breathtaking &amp; astounding than the real event!There was always the risk of Hollywood taking "dramatic" liberties with this movie, but fortunately they resisted temptation for major chances and kept faith with the whole traumatic tale.Never being a keen fan of Tom Hanks (Jim Lovell) I was really surprised &amp; delighted with his performance here. In real life Hanks had taken a close interest with the Apollo story and so in the movie he really plays his character with great enthusiasm &amp; intelligence.He is also ably supported by one of Kevin Bacon's best performances and particularly from Bill Paxton.The only troublesome acting came from Kathleen Quinlann, playing Lovell's wife. She isn't given much to do throughout the film other than to cry a bit and offer moral support to her family and friends. Quinlann is a very capable actress but I felt she wasn't given enough to do here other than play the helpless-woman role, which is a great pity.However, top honours has to go to Ed Harris as the MC chief. I've always like under-rated Harris, especially in the earlier GlennGarry Glenn Ross movie. In both films he seems to excel as the man struggling to stay in control and walk the fine line. Although in this movie he goes that little bit further with an added intensity that gives a lot more human impact to the movie than perhaps Hanks offered, who's dialogue at times seemed to drone on in a robotic-like monotone.Top marks to the special effects too, which unlike getting in the way of a good story, simply adds to the real-life drama.Possibly Howard's best movie to date and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to check on their space history.****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some refreshing aspects make it really worth watching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't find "Apollo 13" a very entertaining movie, but it's still what I would call very good entertainment. Sometimes there is this kind of annoying emotionalism, which is quite clear, as it's about both technical achievement and American history. There is that one scene I dislike most: When the pope and the people at the Wailing Wall are praying for the astronauts. I have no idea whether this really happened or not - but honestly I do not believe it.But the good thing is that I don't mind this emotionalism because of some very refreshing aspects. First what we see here are altogether very nice performances. Especially Ed Harris makes the movie enjoyable with his very fine acting. Kathleen Quinlan, who was nominated for an Oscar as well, is also very good - but you don't really notice her. Gary Sinise is almost as good as Harris and Tom Hanks also tries his best to give his character a special personality and some soul - he doesn't really succeed.Also very refreshing is the small deal of irony in this. There are many little scenes before the launch which indicate in a slightly funny way that Apollo t h i r t e e n means disaster like Quinlan losing her wedding ring. All these aspects make a not really entertaining movie extremely worth watching. I voted 7, for good.By the way...I noticed that Emily Ann Lloyd (whom you might know from "Home For the Holiday") who plays little Susan Lovell, is overacting. She's got no major importance for the story, but her overacting attracts of course attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sets, but lots of Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do hope I am not spoiling much in the sense of the plot with this comment, but I wanted to be respectful of any reader at the beginning.Apollo 13 is a technically well crafted movie with utterly realistic sets of the spacecraft and mission control. The main sequences of the mission are largely accurate, but the people plots are in my view often silly. The flight controllers in Houston were at the time some of the most able folks in this area in the world yet in the movie they are bumbling around in a way that is truly embarrassing. One of the saddest aspects was how they used this oaf from the company that built the LM who complained every time that "...it is not designed to do that..." Utter and complete NONSENSE. The true story is far better than any of the corny romance crap in the movie. I really don't think women go to movies just for this tripe anyway. Hollywood has to be more imaginative. In real life the Grumman plant in Bethpage Long Island NY came a alive during the night with men coming in off shift in the middle of the night without being asked to do so and from vacation to provide the knowledge of their little corner of the LM. Everyone knew that the LM was going to have to bring the boys back and it was the ground that made it so. The astronauts while having endure the cold and other privations as well as the disappointment for not getting to landing did relatively little in the effort to get them home. Another aspect is the one bespectacled controller who seems at a loss to solve any of the problems until astronaut Mattingly get there and saves the day with his knowledge! You gotta be kidding me! The controller they are effectively disrespecting with this fiction was John Aaron who for ALL accounts was one of two men who were really saving the mission. Kranz is effusive in his praise for Aaron in his book. There are many other matters in this disappointing movie. The problem is that when movies such as this one or Titanic and such like are made the average person often gets their history from them; flawed as it is. I have no problem with Hollywood writing movies that are period pieces and they can then have their idiot romances and such like. However, I think it behooves them to get it right, perfectly right when you call a movie Apollo 13, Gettysburg, The Longest Day, Hindenburg or whatever. It is a shame that they have multi-million dollar sets and a 50 cent plot. As an aficionado of space travel I find I can't watch the movie very often because of the mistakes and fiction. It is not funny to me. It is disrespectful to some true heroes who gave far more to their country than their government salaries would ever suggest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather straight but enjoyable drama with a good cast that could have done with a more human touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the Apollo 13 mission took off to go to the moon, the television networks generally tuned out with the attitude that it was more of the same old stuff that the public had seen before and grown tired of. To the crew it represented much more of course, being Jim Lovell's final mission and his chance to finally make it to the moon itself, an aim he intends to see through despite having one of his crew replaced at the last minute by Jack Swigert. However the networks all tune in when a minor malfunction with the electrical system results in an explosion and the loss of oxygen, sending the unit out of control. With the crew retreating into the lunar module, the ground crew scramble to work out how to get them home despite the constantly lengthening odds. At the time of release this was a fairly massive film that was talked up for all manner of reasons and not all of these are still as applicable today. One thing that wasn't really talked up was the writing and the convincing nature of the plot, not a real surprise considering that these aspects seem to be delivered without a great deal of spark or flair. I know that it is based on a true story but it is hard to fully accept all of the film as some of it seems so far fetched as to be a bit silly. I'm totally open to the idea that this could have been 100% accurate but if that is the case one has to wonder how simplified the material was because at times it feels like Lovell and his crew were just blasting their way to earth. The script is OK but never really gets that involving, instead keeping a consistent stream of memorable gruff barking but nothing that really gets close to realistic dialogue. This is not to say that it isn't engaging, because it is and it does have some degree of involvement and of course historical interest but it is not as good as it could have been.The direction is good even if the effects are not as impressive as they were a decade ago ? even some of the blue screen backdrops don't look that convincing. The decision to shoot some of film in the 'vomit comet' in order to convey the effects of weightlessness is a nice touch and does work pretty well, although naturally none of these shots can last very long and sometimes the editing of these shots with shots in the same scene set on the static set doesn't quite marry up. This is a minor complaint though and it does serve to make the film feel more 'real'. The ensemble cast are mixed and many have little to work with ? ironically though those with the least important characters seem to have an easier time just barking out gruff dialogue. It is for this reason that the film's more memorable performances come from the ground, where a lot of the action occurs. Sinise is interesting and a key part of the rescue effort while Harris (who was in space in the much better The Right Stuff) gets the memorable lines. Of course it is Hanks who was the star at the time and he does OK; he has 'the' line but mainly his performance is not helped by the material. He conveys Lovell's longing for the moon but can only do this by staring out the window wistfully every now and again. Paxton and Bacon make up the trio and both are good without ever really having a chance to excel. The ground crew are mainly very good in their minor roles but somebody forgot to give the wives etc characters and Quinlan et al are left to just occasionally look at the TV/sky with either a touch of tears or a look of hopeful resilience ? unsurprisingly none of them really made much of an impression with this thankless task.Overall this is an OK film but not anything that special. It is a glossy historical piece that lurches between convincing telling to some rather extreme moments that feel like they have been over simplified to the point of doing the reality an injustice. The cast are impressive on paper but the lack of a strong script really gives them little to actually work with, although none of them are actually bad it is possible to see that they are reaching without much help. The effects are OK but are a little dated even if the novelty of the weightless scenes is still there, but what I would have given for more of a human touch to what is otherwise an enjoyable technical product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Film on the Near Fatal Apollo 13 Mission</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard's "Apollo 13" is an innovative and interesting film that is dramatic in spite of the fact we already know what's going to happen. Somehow the suspense is kept up throughout and we can feel the tenseness and the fear of those in space and on the ground. Tom Hanks gives his usual outstanding performance and he adds to the performances of Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton. Ed Harris (in an Oscar-nominated role) is the best though, his take-charge attitude and lack of control on the ground may be the most important part of making the movie work. Kathleen Quinlan also got an Oscar nod, but her role pales to that of the men at NASA. Ron Howard's direction is outstanding, some of the film was actually shot in zero gravity and the technical effects are terrific. The film is slightly flawed in a few areas, but "Apollo 13" is still a film well worth your time. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apollo 13The worst aspect of space travel in the 1960s was African American astronauts had to sit out on the shuttle's wing.Oops, my mistake. NASA had no black astronauts at the time this drama is set.Intent on reaching the moon like his compatriot Neil Armstrong, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) heads up the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission.From a sick pilot (Gary Sinise) to his rookie replacement (Kevin Bacon) to a disinterested public, Lovell's mission gets worse by the day.But it reaches its pinnacle when an explosion aboard Apollo forces the crew into the evacuation module.With their air supply in danger, they must jury-rig a way to turnover the shuttle's engine.Based on the harrowing true story, director Ron Howard emulates the claustrophobic environment of a 1960s space capsule precisely.Furthermore, NASA really needs to helm a mission back to the moon so they can pick-up their garbage.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard's 1995 cult-classic, 'Apollo 13' is a film that dramatizes the lunar mission of the same name in 1970. Howard, is a one heck of a filmmaker! He doesn't let you down, his command over his thoughts are untraceable.'Apollo 13' is one of The Greatest True Stories, which translates into becoming one of The Greatest Films! You're gripped, dazzled and in awe of the film from start to end. It's one brave story, and bravo to these Heroes! Such stories are worth talking forever, and so are, such films!Ron Howard rules. He is amongst THE legendary personalities in filmdom today. William Broyles, Jr. &amp; Al Reinert's adapted screenplay is simply awesome! Daniel P. Hanley &amp; Mike Hill's editing is lovely. Music by James Horner, like always, is perfect.Performance wise, Ed Harris is spectacular in a supporting role. Some actors are blessed, and Harris is amongst those rare people. Tom Hanks is superb. Kevin Bacon is excellent, one of his neatest performances to date! Bill Paxton sinks his teeth into the part. Gary Sinise is hugely effective. Kathleen Quinlan is a complete natural. Jean Speegle Howard stands out in a cameo.On the whole, This is a LEGENDARY Film! Do yourself a favor by watching this Masterstroke! Two Big Thumbs Up!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's what a friend of mine thought when it was originally released!! Apollo 13 has great potential, but Ron Howard's paint-by-numbers directorial style make this a plodding, documentary-esquire TV movie. In the hands of Spielberg, Cameron or Zemeckis, say, this could have been a nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat adventure. Even the coda lacks genuine thrills because the opening credits state the movie is based on the book by Jim Lovell, Tom Hanks' character.Only good performances, particularly Ed Harris' director of operations, and a very good screenplay, filled with some great one-liners, give it appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Just A Number</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having said that, the bizarre series of events associated with Apollo 13's ill-fated attempt to reach the moon might be enough to cause anyone to become superstitious. The flight was Apollo 13; it took off on April 11, 1970 (4/11/70 - the individual numbers add up to 13) at 13:13 hours; the explosion that crippled the ship occurred on April 13 at 19:13 hours CST. It goes on and on. But it's just a number! For about a 5 year period, Tom Hanks put out a series of absolute blockbuster movies (headlined, of course, by his Oscar-winning performances in "Forrest Gump" and "Philadelphia.") "Apollo 13" has to be included in that list of great movies, although I don't think it quite reaches the height of those two. Hanks is not quite as central to this movie as he was to those Oscar-winners, although he certainly plays the lead as astronaut Jim Lovell, Commander of the mission. This really is an ensemble cast, though, featuring good performances all around, especially from Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon as Lovell's crewmates Fred Haise and Jack Swigert respectively, and from Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, who was originally scheduled to be Apollo 13's pilot, but was replaced by Swigert due to a health concern.The performances have to carry the movie, because this is such a well-known event that there's not all that much suspense involved, and the performances are all very good. The chain of bizarre events afflicting Apollo 13 seems to have been pretty faithfully recreated (right down to a typhoon warning for the splash-down area), and even given the fact that I know, obviously, how this turns out, the end is still emotional. This is a good movie - not Hanks' best, but definitely one of his really good ones from that 5 year period of real super-stardom, when no one else in Hollywood could hold a candle to him. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might Be A Gaffe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Apollo 13. It was one of the best movies about space travel ever made. It is on Bravo so many times, but I never get tired of watching it. It's one of those rare movies that you know the ending and yet, are still enthralled, enchanted and pulls you in each time. Each viewing is great. I think there's a gaffe at the end of the movie where mission control is awaiting the splash down. I think there is a space shuttle patch on the wall behind them at one angle and if that's the case well... the shuttle was 10 plus years after Apollo 13. But that's minor. Tom Hanks is a perfect choice for Jim Lovell. The mix of real footage and the redone is seamless. It earned the praise. With the Right Stuff, and Apollo 13, the movie Marooned doesn't do much anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apollo 13 is a good movie. It's well acted, offers a compelling story, and dramatizes how team work can achieve positive results. The problem with this movie, however, is that we know what happened. Apollo 13 was not an obscure historical event nor did the participants disappear into the pages of history. Hence the movie does not offer any surprises. After the several disasters associated with space exploration, it is obvious that space travel is extremely risky, still experimental and not to be taken for granted. If Hollywood insists on making movies about space exploration, however, then why not make a movie about one of the spectacular successes, like Apollo 11, or the dramatic events surrounding the flight of Alan B. Shephard in May 1961?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sad to discover that the world now remembers those space heroes thanks to a movie. But it's great to see how a movie can show with so much respect and keeping the rhythm what happened during those very long seven and something days into that tight space ship while down to earth and in the middle of the empty ocean outside our planet the technicians and astronauts tried to keep them alive. Howard's casting is almost like the casting of The Aviator. Tom Hanks doesn't look like Jim Lovell. Bill Paxton doesn't look like Fred Haise. Neither Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris or Gary Siniese. But, despite the casting, the rest of the movie is pretty accurate. Is very exact to what happened in real life. The sense of disaster movie is always there, never leaves the screen during it's almost 2 and a half hours, but is basically a human drama with realistic touch. Ron Howard uses his great heart to make us tremble and sob with the agonize tragedy of this three astronauts, and when you reach to the end and see the resolution, you just have to clap! Claps for the heroes, claps for Ron Howard. My verdict: The best realistic space movie ever made. And I mean space movie, not sci-fi movie.</fullReview>

Having grown up during the time in history when watching space launches was a family event, and NASA was the king of our technological world, I really appreciated Ron Howard's version of the Appollo-13 mission. Great cast and performances. The interaction of the characters is sincere and entertaining. The realistic special effects of the Saturn 5 launch, the docking of the Command and Lunar Modules, and life in space filled in missing information that could not be captured by the televised reports available in that day. Stays true to one of the dichotomies of the time - showing the young straight laced NASA mission control engineers, in contrast with the flower-power generation evolving around them. One of a group of movies I can repeatedly watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Survival Story turned Cinema Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In April of 1970, three men were sent into space to walk on the moon. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are true survivalists of what could have been a complete disaster. They would be the infamous crew of the Apollo 13 space mission.In Ron Howard's 1995 release of Apollo 13, Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon play the crew that would be launched from Cape Canaveral and into history. The flight that went wrong and had Lovell (Hanks) utter those famous words, "Houston, we have a problem". When a routine task aboard their ship goes horribly wrong, these three men are thrown into a life or death situation.In the shadow of the 1969 lunar landing, the first ever, these men were nobodies to the general public, until "it" happened. With media flocking the Lovell's home, wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) must muster up all the courage she has and make sure her family keeps it together. She and the whole world waits for the three men to return home safely.Flight director Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) also has the difficult job of finding a way for these boys to come home. He and his team of experts work around the clock for nearly a week to ensure the safe return of the crew. Every time something seems to be going right, there is another problem. CO2 levels run high, exhaustion, power, and the troubled heat shield are all problems the crew at Houston the crew thousands of miles above Houston confront.With so much stress and a problem arising every other minute, tension grows on board with the crew. The fact that Jack (Bacon) is replacing what would have been Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) makes the other crew members a little cautious of his skills and his performance levels. They trusted Ken, but Jack is new and since he performed the task the caused the problem, they are very suspicious of him. The men must keep it together if they went to get home in one piece.This movie shows true courage in one of the worst space accidents the world has ever seen. Howard does a great job of preserving this unbelievable story of bravery and survival. So many times movies about something that actually happened get caught up in computer graphics or try to hard to appeal to everyone when this movie uses better acting, directing, and does have good computer effects as a bonus. This movie lifts off the ground and clears the tower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Remake of an amazing true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a great portrayal of an amazing true event. It's amazing some of the lengths they went through to film it, perhaps most notably filming scenes in falling planes to simulate weightlessness. When I was a kid I always used to study space travel a lot, most notably the Apollo program. When the movie first came out I was very skeptical, and didn't think they could ever make it look like the true story, especially the launch. But when I saw it I was totally amazed at just how realistic it was. There's a few things about it that are a little bit inaccurate, like some of the patterns on the Saturn 5 rocket, and the course correction in space which in real life was much smoother. But overall it's very accurate and very dramatic. Every time I watch it, it's still an incredible story, and always an amazing reminder of the true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie - Hollywood twist on real events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was well made - and for the most part well acted. Gary Sinise and Ed Harris especially.I think Ron Howard tried to be as true to the facts that happened as possible. He lost accuracy in the dialogue, but this adventure had all the drama and excitement of anything writers could make up. Sadly, Ron caved to the mentality that everyone speaks and acts like they do in Hollywood. I remember seeing one of the astronauts commenting on the film after viewing it, and he said it was very realistic what happened in that ship, except that NOBODY ever swore during their entire mission. So much for reality. How sad is that, that we must inject profanities and swearing into an action packed, true story for no reason whatsoever. Obviously the men on that mission had higher standards than Ron Howard. Had Ron been more true to the facts this film would have been great instead of good.When directors want to inject graphic violence, profanities, and swearing into a movie (thinking the entire world is as immoral as Hollywood) they use the excuse "that's what really happened". In this case, though, that was not the way it happened. He made these decent, courageous men out to be swearing, profane men. What a double standard. They excuse filth because it is realistic - but cannot bring themselves to portray decent men with morals. These men deserved better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Physics Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that is basically the quintessential physics movie. From when the tanks explode to when it splashes down, the whole film is based upon fundamental physics and Newton's laws. The astronauts keep from firing the rockets in fear of igniting the fuel and blowing themselves up, so they let the module coast towards the moon to 1) let the force of gravity swing them back. The second physics point is that by letting the module coast, they know it will get to the moon as an object in motion stays in motion until acted upon by a force, in which case the settings of space don't allow there to be any. They then fear about burning up upon re-entry, which brings up the force of friction and air resistance that cause the heat to take place. If you are struggling in physics, specifically with Newton's laws, just watch Apollo 13 and all your problems will fade away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the movie opened on a scene that looked and played like an episode of that miserable series "Happy Days", I knew there was trouble brewing. And when the astronauts were all portrayed as boring suburban commuter dads with no apparent intelligence above the level of your average truck driver, I could tell accuracy was not a major concern of the filmmakers. As the movie's blandness numbed me into catatonia I turned off the TV and was grateful there is a movie called "The Right Stuff".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was more exciting than I at first thought when I heard about the scenario. The movie is probably too long to keep you captured all of the time, but there are moments that you can really feel the tension and stress that is pictured.

		<shortDescription>Apollo 13 is a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apollo 13 is a good, but not great, movie. With the exception of superb performance by Ed Harris, which alone is a good reason why to watch this film, it doesn't excel in any particular category, but it also does not have major weaknesses. It will keep you on the edge of your seat for the most part while telling a story of determination, courage, and dedication. Rent it, see it, but do not buy it; Apollo 13 does not hold on repeated viewings. I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am Canadian who was born in 71. I have an interest in the space program but not to the extent of learning its history. I knew that something bad happened with Apollo 13 but I didn't know what. So when I saw the movie, I was in true suspense as to what happens. The only thing I really did know was that they made it home alive.Howard does a wonderful job in detailing what life is like for an astronaut of the early days of space travel. Hanks, Paxton and Bacon deserved nominations for their portrayals of the real astronauts, both giving us a glimpse of the professionalism of the astronaut and the human side that encompasses us all.Good show Ron</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another Ron Howard movie that doesn't dig very deep...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True story adapted from the book "First Moon" by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kruger about a trio of astronauts (headed by Lovell, played here by Tom Hanks) who encounter disaster in space while on 1970 lunar mission. The public's indifference and the finger-pointing at NASA get the short shrift in favor of the hand-wringing wives--an excruciating subplot--and the outer space camaraderie (leave it to director Ron Howard to turn even the most harrowing circumstance into a warm fuzzy). Good performances and an undeniably emotional climax make "Apollo 13" worth-watching, but the film is fairly humorless, and technical without being particularly enlightening. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, you know that space research can produce benefits in terms of the spill-over effects of technological breakthroughs. But then probably even a most senseless but challenging task humanity may set itself might bring about such results. Secondly, less appealing is the idea that its motive in a conflict like the Cold War may be the quest for prestige (not that bad a prospect) and/or for a better shooting position (no 'prospect'). Thirdly, while it doesn't sound bad, a mortal being with the limitations of a lifetime's perspective understandably is just not so moved by the idea that one day our proverbial grandchildren might be able to speed off to another planet and thus make it till the grand finale of the universe in the End, thanks to space research.So, what I found interesting about this space movie is that it shows the importance of coming back more than that of going out, and that so it puts the whole debate above into a funny perspective, rather unintentionally of course. Let's just stay here, get everyone into safety on Earth, all of humanity. What a warm and pleasing thought indeed. Otherwise, the film is rather mediocre, I thought. And the schematic film score made me shake my head in disapproval every now and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 and every mission since.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some critics treated "Apollo 13" like it was the best movie of 1995. I didn't regard it as such, but it is worth seeing as a part of our country's history. As it was, I didn't even know about the Apollo 13 mission until this movie got advertised. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Kathleen Quinlan, Ed Harris, and Gary Sinise all do very well with their roles.Looking back on the history of space exploration, one notices that every mission since Apollo 11 seems to have gone wrong. Apollo 13 had its snafu, the Challenger exploded, the mission in 2003 exploded, and a mission last year had a screw-up. Maybe "I Dream of Jeannie" convinced the astronauts that they would get to have hot genies, and they could only think about that and not concentrate on their missions (no offense to "IDOJ"; I love that show). OK, so maybe it didn't work quite like that, but something seems to have gone wrong.All in all, a very well done movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the one in which Tom Hanks didn't get the oscar. It's still a great performance though and is based on the ill fated Apollo 13 mission. When you watch it you can't help thinking they were lucky to make it back to earth never mind actually surviving. You also get the feeling that Gene Kranz statement that this was Nasa's finest hour is also true. Obviously everyone knows how the film ends, but the journey there is pretty extraordinary. The special effects are extremely impressive as was the actors and directors patience because the weightlessness scenes are real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about an almost perfect Ron Howard movie about the most exciting near tragedy involving men in space? It is just a fine movie through and through. The fact that it is a true story just makes it all the better.I saw the DVD version, which has several "extras", including their techniques for simulating the rocket launch scenes. Also most instructional was the featurette showing how they used the "vomit comet" (simulates weightlessness) to shoot all the scenes of men floating in the spaceships. Very innovative movie-making.All in all one of the best movies of all time, deserves to be in the top 100.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Houston we have a problem, our movie is to long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one of those who was really happy when "Brave Heart" beat this movie out for the Oscar in 1996. Nothing against this movie or Ron Howard, but that was a vastly superior movie to this film. Of course, I do not particularly like this one all that much either as I gave it a six, it has some good stuff in it, but it is also rather long and you feel the length of it. Not in the bathroom way of say a "Lord of the Rings" movie where it is just super long so you are bound to feel the urge to go, but long in the "man it is taking forever for this film to end". The story chronicles a true event where a space mission had problems and the astronauts had to scrape their moon landing and just figure a way to get back home and it has some interesting moments. It also has way to much Tom Hanks for my tastes. He is not the only one in space yet he is the headline name so the other two astronauts are just not the focus which kind of sucks as I love both Bacon and Paxton, two underrated actors who usually do not get the bigger movies and when they do they are regulated to backup duties. For some reason Ed Harris got an Oscar nod for this film and his performance in this one is not as good as the one he had in the Sean Connery thriller "Just Cause" which got him nominated for nothing. His performance here is oddly like another performance he would have three years later in "The Truman Show" another film he mysteriously got an Oscar nod for. There is some nice space scenes though and at times you really worry about the guys in the dire situation they are in. So it is a watchable film, there is just to many times in this one that I was more worried about when it would end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Howard's glorification of America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched "Apollo 13" again last night and I have totally different points of view now, then I had back then (maybe 8 or more years ago). I set to watch "Apollo 13" with only a memory that that was a good movie. Now after all this years, I must say that I'm little disappointed. Looking at the whole picture, this is solid movie, with very good cast and some interesting moments. But nothing more. What bothered me the most is the length of this movie. It just goes on and on (it's because the movie goes on very slow). And another thing; Ron Howard's presentation of how America is great and special country. Back then people weren't send to space primarily to explore; it was a race between America and Russia. So after America's success, other mission were send in space, like Apollo 13 (to explore;in this case Moon). Apollo 13 crew will be remembered as the lucky ones. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert (he replaced Ken Mattingly) were on board and they managed to stay alive because of great help they had back on Earth. From constellation of great actors in this movie (Hanks, Bacon, Sinise,...), my vote goes to Ed Harris. He's great as Gene Kranz, chief of the operation. This is definitely not Howard's best movie or a movie that should be watched by all means, but if you love any of these actors and you can separate 140 minutes of your life; go ahead and watch it. Oh, and of course if you are American, you will feel good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find this difficult to write, as I experience the feature to be an attack against an individual, where I had hoped it to be other. I searched out my copy of the DVD as it is an Emily Ann Lloyd, companion to Annie and Molly in Annie 2, which is also of 1995. She is age 10ish and playing the younger daughter. Discover it to be a well crafted story about the Apollo disaster, with lots of Apollo stuff in it, then it gained massively in potential power. The extras in the DVD gave a lot of additional stuff that still makes the package worthwhile to me. In all sorts of ways this feature is magnificent and perfection. Except the feature itself appears to crash this aspect, deliberately, by making a smattering of technical detail to be askew. The most positive part, for me, is how people in mission control are shown. The filmmaker demonstrates very real skills at portraying the feel of most of the situation, Grumman?, as if he has a real in-tune-ness with the people there. A remarkable achievement, but that became scuppered. In some ways this feature is still so nice that when I watch it I typically have to shrug off the disaster of the deliberate flaws. * I personally interpret this to be triggered by a culture clash and a personality clash. Different understandings about taboo. From that there is a demonstration of how today's dominant intolerance ethos turns things into a hatchet job. It should be easy to interpret my reaction as an over-reaction. It can be dismissed. Downer that Emily got serendipitied into this feature. I understand her as a girl with very typical growing up hurdles to have to try to face. Someone who got channelled into features that highlighted parts of that until the year 2000, age 16ish, when her last feature was released. Oh to be serendipitied along channels that solve our hurdle challenges instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie but insulting to single people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie but I have one complaint. Two of the astronauts were married and had children. The anguish of their families was portrayed in detail. On the other hand, Jack Swigert was a single man, and the movie made it seem as though no one was concerned about his save return. According to the movie, Jack did not have a loving parent, a close sibling, or a dear friend who cared whether he lived or died. As a single women, I find this portrayal of the life of a single, childless person unfortunate. In addition, Mr. Swigert was portrayed as a somewhat incompetent playboy, when in reality he was a well educated man with an impressive resume. The fact that Mr. Swigert is dead and can not defend himself makes the situation that much worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical Ron Howard warm fuzzy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is similar to Deep Impact. It packs a lot of emotion into an okay film. The film is a little long and a little boring. There is little in the way of character development and the action is at a minimum. In essence, Apollo 13 is a disaster movie and these types of movies generally don't come out as much. Apollo 13 is based on a true story where a luna expedition experienced an explosion in space and had to be brought manually back to Earth. It is about the fear and the hope and the obstacles that are overcome to bring the astronauts back. Apollo 13 is a movie about hope. It tells us that no matter what the obstacles are we can over come it. No matter what the problem is, there is always a way out, all we have to do is trust ourselves. That is all well and good except that God is left out of the picture. Basically we believe that we are so great that we don't need God. There is a scene in the movie where everybody is praying, and a priest is present in the house, but they are only for comfort. When the astronauts are saved they forget God and praise themselves. This move reveals our instinctive superstitious nature. 13 is the unlucky number and thus when this spaceship breaks down we see it is because of the number and nothing else. When everybody prays, it is not because they want a relationship with God but because they are superstitious and believe that by doing so will help the astronauts. People don't understand prayer because it is not an answer to problems but rather it is talking with God. Yes we do ask God for help but that is because we know that he wants to help us. Prayer is more like talking to God and God is always wanting to hear from us. But prayer without belief is nothing more than superstition. Apollo 13 I found okay. It is not a movie that I would raise to the heights of brilliance, nor is it one that I will attack. I probably won't want it again because it was dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice execution of uplifting family movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I find myself getting them mixed up -- Ron Howard, Rob Reiner, Penny Marshall. Even Spielberg's heartwarming kiddie movies. They're often enjoyable viewing and they're suitable for children of all ages. Early conflicts between two people of honor are resolved. There's often a patriotic theme. Very few cuss words. The musical score tells us emphatically that this is a moving experience. Maybe not the Second Coming exactly but a dangerous trip to the moon or a damned good baseball game. And don't worry. Our side wins.This one is about a failed trip to the moon. The "failed" part of it is gotten past pretty quickly and the emphasis shifts immediately to a different challenge -- can we get the crippled craft and its stressed-out crew back to the earth in one piece? The answer of course is yes, so it turns the movie into a story of triumph instead of tragedy.I don't mean to apply too energetic a hammer to the real events or the real characters. It's pretty spooky stuff, being up there, looking at the earth when it's no bigger than a street lamp. The rest of us who tremble when we have to climb a ladder higher than the first-floor windows can only marvel.And the story itself, no matter well or poorly told, has enough suspense and awe intrinsic to it that we can't help being drawn into it.What's bothersome is the slick commercialism that seems to provide the craft and its story with its real source of power. You know ahead of time that we'll spend time with the anguished wife at home, that we'll see one endangered astronaut sharing pictures of his lovely family with the others. The reporters will becoming a nagging, intrusive nuisance. The wife will be given a line like, "If this moon landing wasn't good enough for the press, why has it become news now that it won't land?" There are a multitude of technical problem that arise when the side of the craft pops and deconstructs, and they're rushed through as if the audience doesn't really care about the challenges or how they're met. Or -- maybe not that the viewers don't care. Maybe they're too dumb to understand. The technical glitches and maneuvers seem to present challenges to the film makers as well -- how quickly can we get rid of the uninteresting metallic junk and get back to the suffering of the crew, the ground support, and the families? It succeeds extremely well in doing what it intends to do, but what it intends to do makes few demands on the maturity of viewers. It's like a very complicated jigsaw puzzle and after you put it all together you have a picture of three dogs in vests playing cards.You know what could be gripping? The real story of the Challenger disaster of 1986. With an emphasis on the groupspeak of Raytheon, Mission Control, and NASA. Maybe the hero could be Richard Feynman. You should have seen him cut through the blizzard of technocrap thrown up by the engineers and bureaucrats playing CYA at the hearings. Here they are, explaining what happened by evoking "ambient temperature values" and "minimalizing coefficients." And Feynman asks politely, "You mean when it gets cold the rubber shrinks?" And he demonstrates by dunking a piece of rubber in a glass of ice water. Doesn't that have more cinematic potential than this movie's Ed Harris shouting, "Failure is not an option"?However, the kids should enjoy this, and it's worth watching for everyone, if only because it is based on a true story. Its heartwarming qualities aside, everyone involved in an enterprise like this -- successful or not -- should be applauded. And whatever they're being paid, it's not enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dangers Of Space Flight Hollywood Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually wanted to become an astronaut as a child but soon went off the idea when I realised going to the moon would have involved sitting in a capsule that`s basically a tin can with thousands of tons of rocket fuel strapped to my ass . In short the dangers of space flight surpassed my courage and my feelings of endeavour . It takes guts to travel through space and if you get into serious trouble aboard a space craft you`re in danger of suffering a quick spectacular death or a slow lingering oneAPOLLO 13 is the Hollywood blockbuster treatment of the ill fated mission to the moon and is a testament to the courage of astronauts everywhere . The film starts with the tragic accident of an earlier Apollo mission that left three astronauts dead and then goes on to tell the tale of the Apollo 13 where an oxygen tank explodes on the module close to the moon meaning the three man crew are almost certain to suffer a slow lingering death 250,000 miles out in space . It`s a true life drama fairly well told even if it does have a few flaws . For example director Ron Howard`s camera work moves around a bit too much while having a big name star like Tom Hanks detracts slightly from the drama . It would have been totally compelling if we`d had a slightly flat directing style with unknown actors , but like I said this is the Hollywood blockbuster treatment which needs to make money at the box office , so I guess we can forgive that . Astronauts are very brave people and APOLLO 13 makes light of that fact , so it`s a success .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thus movie has unusual problems that I've never seen in a film outside of this as well as many major problems.First and foremost, there is no tension or suspense. Anyone who goes to elementary school knows that all three astronauts survive, so for all the scenes in space I kept saying "Yeah, I know! they're going to live!" This brings the film down many levelsThe plot doesn't start until 30 minutes in, it doesn't feel long but the scenes in the first half hour feel like filler. I don't need to know that Jim's wife dropped her ring in the shower!Also, it has the same problem as Super 8, the unsubtle period detail. I didn't need to know that Jim's daughter was upset that the Beatles broke up, or that she dresses as a hippie. It rarely happens and isn't as bad as in Super 8, but why can't any one in Hollywood make subtle period detail! Then again this film does have the director of the Grinch.Many scenes are done well like the scenes of just the astronauts in the ship. The moon scene would've been very good, but they had to ruin it with Jim's fantasy of being on the moon. The scenes of they're family's got irritating after a while. It doesn't help when you keep cutting from the main story of the movie to people watching TV and listening to the radio. Also what was with the son in military camp? He has no lines of dialogue and does exactly what everyone else who isn't the main character does. He didn't need to be in this movie, or at least have something to do!The box that creates the oxygen in the ship has no explanation. It would in real life, but I would like to know how a box made of tape and plastic bags can seamlessly make air out of nothing!Then there is the end narration, which sounds like it came out of a bad teen film. I'll watch this movie again maybe in a few months but until then, I'll stick with Armageddon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has some very good drama but it gets sometimes a bit to technical which makes the movie sometimes hard and difficult to fully follow.Maybe the best thing about "Apollo 13" is the wonderful cast. Especially Gary Sinise and Ed Harris are more then great. Ed Harris actually really looks very much alike the real Gene Kranz. But of course the rest of the cast is also excellent. A very well cast movie.Another great thing about the movie are the special effects. They are really superb and seem ahead of their time. Better then some of the effects that are used in science-fiction movies that are made these days.I also liked the at some times quite unusual cinematography from Dean Cundey and the musical score from James Horner.I don't know how much is true about the story but it seems that sometimes the movie is a bit over dramatized. But that's not such a bad thing since it only does good to the movie and the characters. The movie is not only just dramatic, it also is tense and exciting. Especially the ending is done great, even though you already know how it's going to end you're still on the edge of your seat. Well done Ron Howard! There also are more wonderful scene's such as the launch which is done truly beautiful, mainly because of the music and cinematography the scene it is one of the best moments in cinema history of the last decade.But like I said before, it could have done without the many technical elements, or there at least should had been lesser moments with it. Also, there is a bit too much patriotism for my taste.All in all, very well worth watching.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apollo 13 is not a bad film but it is by no means a classic in the mould of 2001. More a drama set in space than a space drama it ultimately disappoints. Hanks was the flavour of the month in the mid-nineties and seemingly appeared in everything. The film is overlong and the dialogue a little cliched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apollo 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the true story based on the main character's book, Lost Moon about the team that thought they could go to the Moon, but they were obviously going to be wrong. From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Ron Howard (Ransom, A Beautiful Mind), Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) believes that he and a team of astronauts can go to the Moon in the newest rocket, Apollo 13, I think he even promises his wife, Marilyn (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kathleen Quinlan). The team is Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon). Watching them try to achieve this mission is Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly (who was meant to be going with them), and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ed Harris as Gene Kranz. When they launch everything is fine, and then something bursts and they are now unable to reach their destination. Now they and the guys on Earth are trying everything then can to get them back home. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Visual Effects, Best Music for James Horner, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Special Effects and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Sound. It was number 50 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("Houston, we have a problem.") and it was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raise your hands, all of ye who think that Hanks and Bacon look like astronauts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the man who gave us such crap as the annoying "EdTV", the indescribably dull "Cinderella Man", the schmaltzy "Parenthood", the George-Lucas-wanna-be "Willow", the Tom-Cruise-sounding-daft-with-an-Irish-accent "Far And Away", the nonsensical it-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-real-Da-Vinci "The Da Vinci Code", and the terminally unfunny and unsexy "Splash", comes the story of three U.S. astronauts who look more like former high-school nerds than real NASA men... If you don't believe me, check out the photos of the actual Lovell, Haise and Swiggert.I heavily question the wisdom of casting Hanks and Bacon as astronauts, since NASA usually chooses real men, not pansies like these two Hollywood phonies. (Even worse, Howard originally wanted John Cusack to be the third astronaut!) If you thought that Buscemi, Willis, and Affleck were stupidly cast in the ultra-moronic "Armageddon", then check out A13. Not for a second did I manage to suspend my disbelief that Hanks is just Hanks, i.e. the pompous, overrated Hollywood bore, or that Bacon, who is an awful actor in any genre, could be anything but the man who married the "beautiful" Kyra Sedgwick. Paxton doesn't look anything like an astronaut either, but at least he is a likable presence. Harris is good, but I have to question any director who casts Gary Sinise: this man is one of the most uncharismatic, worst actors in recent years.Ron Howard is infamous for his awful casting choices. I can't think of a single movie he made in which he didn't cast according to his box-office aspirations, rather than according to who suits the roles best. Cash and fame are the sole motivators in his career. Howard is the consummate commercial director, consistently ejecting one mediocrity after another into the already dwindling-quality sub-par world of movies. The fact that his equally greedy and hypocritical Tinseltown peers love him, showering him with those meaningless little golden statuettes, only serves to prove my point.The story is good, but the casting sinks any hopes of this finally reaching the lofty ambitions of Howard: to finally make a movie that is good enough to be considered as average. I also wasn't too thrilled with the visual look of the space scenes; they have a plastic look to them; everything is shining nice and clean, as if Ron was making an AT&amp;T commercial, not a thriller. Howard also fails to recreate that elusive 70s feel.There's a funny moment in "VIP" ("Very Important Pennis"), in which a mock journalist by the name of Dennis Pennis tells Tom Hanks and Ron Howard the following: "Tom, you've made the ultimate space movie: completely lacking in atmosphere." To his credit, Howard laughed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>eventually boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was anxious to see this film because I heard good things about it and maybe I had hoped to see a movie with a little bit more action or speed. After a while it became boring and I didn't even see the ending because of that. I like SF and this was maybe a little too authentic for my taste. It's clearly more a documentary then a movie and because of that it couldn't captivate me or grab my attention. The acting performance and script where good. For people who like space-history it can be recommended but for all the others....It's a cultural artifact but too boring too see it until the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like this film although it was a fine production. My main objection was that I saw a movie called "Marooned" several years ago which was too much like "Apollo 13". A group of men were stranded in space, and a big rescue took place in both of them. Done seen it, didn't want a re-run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely Unbelievable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just ridiculous! I don't believe anything like this could ever happen! All of that moon stuff was totally faked! Ron Howard's on smack if he thinks he can fool us! He should have never left Happy Days, even though they did have Fonzie jumping a shark on water skis when they went to visit Hawaii! I think he just wanted his own spin-off like "Joanie Loves Chachi Who In Turn Loves Richie Cunningham!"Seriously though, while this movie is technically proficient, it lacks any real characterization or depth and simply leave a bland taste in your mouth. Like many of Mr. Howard's films there is no true style to speak of and it relies too much on special effects or true stories basically regurgitated in a point by point newspaper like account with attempted (but failed) sentimentality peppered throughout to try and fool audiences into thinking this is a real movie they should not be upset they paid to watch! I believe a chimp could serve as well as Ron Howard in a directorial capacity, albeit it would have to be a technically well trained chimp, perhaps the chimp from "Any Which Way But Loose" could be taught. Ron Howard does do a admirable job as a producer, though.1 out of 157 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five out of ten for "Apollo 13"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite occasional flashes of great drama and decent performances from Hanks, Sinise, Harris, and others, "Apollo 13" is all too often trapped in a sterile form that is difficult to become involved with. The film follows the real-life events of three astronauts shot into space on the title craft, its destination the moon, but trouble with the craft gives them other plans. Although the chemistry of Paxton, Hanks, and Bacon is useful, the main problem is that the viewer becomes lost within a dialogue full of space craft-NASA mumbo jumbo. Definitely no fun watching astronauts babble on about things which we have no idea what they are. Nonetheless, "Apollo 13" still has some memorable effects and a cast that wasn't entirely wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Tom Hanks fans only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technically well made film is atrocious in just about every other department. The script is hobbled by the sheer volume of clichés and since the outcome of the astronauts fate is already known to history, there isn't an ounce of suspense. Director Howard's bland direction deadens an already overlong movie, which tries to liven things up with a bombastic score and the casting of "stars" in the pivotal roles. It doesn't work. Tom Hanks addicts will probably want to see it, but this one is as bad as Howard's other thudding disappointment, Far and Away.If you want to see a good movie on the U.S. space program, see Phil Kaufman's 1983 pic The Right Stuff. Avoid this one unless you need some snooze time and wasting nearly 2? hours is your prime directive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One small step for Ron, one overrated film for mankind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apollo 13 has been so overpraised as a film even the evil Newt Gingrich would like it's hard to buck the trend, but here goes: As one of the Apollo moon mission junkies I saw this one on its release and was disappointed. Instead of the profound experience I expected of man going to the moon I got some jokes about the constellation Urine, some lines like, "Mommy, you're squishing me", and mission control cheering like football fans. We see Hank's disappointment about not making a touchdown, as well as an argument between astronauts that never happened in real life.The clichés of "Houston, we have a problem" and "failure is not an option" ring empty. To me the Apollo missions are mankind's greatest achievement and this film cheapens the experience. I hope man one day returns to the moon and onto Mars instead of spending trillions of dollars on war. Instead of this film I recommend an excellent, but hard to get documentary on Apollo 11 called, "Moonwalk One". It's shown often on NASA TV. Also you can hear the entire Apollo 11 mission on Live 365.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Houston, we have a problem. Over-rated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apollo 13 suffers from the fact that it was regarded highly as a film and is, in my opinion, very much over-rated. Apollo 13 is based on a true story about the space mission. I do believe that it was successful in getting the mainstream interested about the history of space missions and space exploration in general. In that sense, it did not fail. It also did not fail in the sense that it did capture an audience and bring about the timeless quotation: "Houston, we have a problem." Yes, they *did* have a problem, and I am speaking about the film here and not the mission.The problem with Apollo 13 is the slow pace of the film and the length of it. Yes, it is based on a true story, but that does not mean that it has to be so boring a dry. (A lot of the technical speak went over my head as a 16-year-old.) In terms of overall art direction or cinematography, the film was average. In short, it was just a very dry film and a long film to sit through. (The fact that it was rated highly and that the ending is well-known also probably did not help matters.) Overall, my personal opinion of this film is similar to the most famous quotation in the film: "Houston, we have a problem."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trust old baby-face Ron Howard to turn such a potentially interesting narrative into one of the most leaden, dreary pieces of celluloid in many a long day. Cliches pile happily on cliches as Howard manages to drain the life from every bland minute of this tiresome yarn. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Armageddon is less boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just amazed at the ratings this movie gets. Is it too hard to admit that a Tom Hanks movie can suck ? (i'm personally not a fan - more like the contrary - but that's not the point). How many more of these dull patriotic pieces of crap will we have to stand ? Where's the suspense, the fun ? Everyone can guess how it's going to end anyway: everyone applauding in the nasa control room (reminds me of the ending in Britney Spears' Crossroads !). The jokes and the characters are always the same, the music an abomination, etc. Is it because it's based on a real story that it should get better ratings than, say, Armageddon (which is exactly the same movie, just even more dumb)? What did these real-life astronauts do to deserve this ? Boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring (got me so tired I couldn't find the strength to reach the remote control).no star out of whatever</fullReview>
