		<shortDescription>The only thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing i can say is that when i left the movie theater then i had no comment to give... This movie got to me deep! I was 14 and now i am 25,and still i remember it so well and i still watch it sometimes.. Brandon Lee did a great job as an actor like everyone else, but the story about his death is totally insane, which made me worship the movie even more. What an irony. I like the movie cause it's dark, but also lighted up with true emotions..there is action, horror, love, even poetry for god sake! I have never seen so many genre's in one movie. Anyway for me it has been one of the best movies i have ever watched. And one more comment, lots of of other movies got ideas from The Crow, meaning the setting, the action, music, whatever it is the crow was their start up. I am not going to name them, Crow fans probably know what i am talking about.. My favorite quote: "Can't rain all the time" By the way the soundtrack's are awesome, The Cure's best song ever made is in it! P.S. The Crow II and III sucked, i hated it. They just ruined the conception of the first one.. totally..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Amazing Film, With A Mezmerizing Performance From Brandon Lee!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one amazing film, with a mesmerizing performance from Brandon Lee!. It's visually appealing, extremely well made, with amazing performances all around!. Loved the score, too, it fit with the film well, and there's plenty of action to go around as well. Michael Wincott is, very menacing as the main villain, and was perfect for the part. The flashbacks were very cool, however i wished, i could see more of Shelley's character. The Directiing is outstanding!. Alex Proyas does an outstanding job here, creating lots of, dark atmosphere, great use of the rain machine,cool visuals, and keeping the pace,action packed, and engrossing all the way!. The film is very violent, but not all of it is bloody. We get several knives in the chest, knife in the hand, lots of gunshot wounds, some bloody, some not, hole through hand, 2 slashings, slit throat,2 bloody impallings, sword in the neck and a crow pecks a girls eyes out. The Acting is WONDERFUL!. Brandon Lee, gives an Oscar worthy performance here, he is completely mesmerizing, creepy,kicks that ass and, just thought he was too cool, his AMAZING AMAZING performance here, will always be remembered, what happened too him was a tragedy, and i for one will never forget him!. Rochelle Davis is awesome here, and is very likable,her and Brandon, had very good chemistry and is one of the best kid actors out there!, especially since she hasn't acted since then!. Ernie Hudson, is terrific as the Sgt., very likable, and very convincing. Michael Wincott, is great as the main villain, i loved his voice, and he was very menacing!. Sofia Shinas, is very good as Shelley, however, she didn't have much screen time, but was great when on screen. Overall a MUST SEE at all costs!. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best comic book to film translation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow is an excellent tragic film made even more tragic by the real life tragedies surrounding the film (Brandon Lee's death during filming, and the fact that the story is a result of James O'Barr's personal loss of his fiancée). Based on a very dark comic book, the film has the same dark feel. The movie does deviate from the comic book in some points, but in general is fairly faithful. If you can get it, I would recommend the DVD Collector's set with the 2 DVD version of The Crow (just to see the interview with James O'Barr is worth the price).The story is a basically about revenge from beyond the grave, and how true love is forever. The movie has a good (but fairly basic) plot, excellent action sequences, and very good casting. Brandon Lee gives a good performance (not excellent, but good), as does Ernie Hudson. The supporting villains are excellent in their villainy, and you do feel better when they get it in the end. But the real star of this film is the mood and the feel. It feels gritty, bleak, and depressing, but surprisingly uplifting at the end. Alex Proyas did an excellent job of transferring this feeling from the book onto celluloid. All in all, one of the best comic book to film translations I have ever seen.You do not have to be familiar with the comic book to thoroughly enjoy this film (like you do with some other comic book adaptations).Rating : 4.5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best Gothic comic book movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic. plain and simple. Brandon Lee delivers his lines to the point they were instantly memorable after seeing the film only once. The casting of both Michael Wincott and Tony Todd was inspired as these two guys have two of the most instantly recognisable voices in the movie industry. If i could ever be a movie or a lead in a film this would be it. I was initially put off the idea of the movie as i am a big fan of the graphic novel and there was an awful lot of hype around this film on its release. this proved to be my loss as i have only seen the film on the small screen. however i now have the 2 disc special edition DVD and watched it 3 times in succession the day i bought it and must have watched it at least 100 times since. my own personal opinion is that a movie should suspend disbelief, capture the imagination which this does in spades. it is truly a film that you can lose a couple of hours watching and at the end feel like you have spent a worthwhile couple of hours. would recommend this to anybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I approached this film after reading the hype and controversy surrounding its making and release, not really expecting very much. Surprised to find it an intelligent, beautifully-filmed, engrossing and touching thriller. I'd recommend it to anyone who has a fondness for weird gothic mythological stories. I didn't find the horror aspect overdone - in fact it was believable, and the script was superior to other films of this genre I've seen. As for Brandon Lee, this really was a superb performance and it is a terrible tragedy that his life ended so abruptly. This film is a fitting memorial to what could have become a major star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so amazing, I can't remember how many times I've seen it. You don't have to be interested in a particular genre of film to watch it, because there is something for everyone in this film. Romance, action, gory bits, humour, drama- you name it, The Crow has it. The tragic circumstances surrounding this film and Brandon Lee also add to it's allure.Basically, it's about a rock star named Eric Draven, his fiancée Shelley Webster and the little girl they take care of, Sarah. When a ruthless gang of thugs viciously murder both Eric and Shelley on the night before their wedding, Eric comes back from the grave to avenge his fiancée's death by going after each member of the gang that killed her, and to say a final goodbye to Sarah.An extremely moving film that I would recommend to anyone who has a heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CROW, like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY separates those who see from those who do not! (who CANNOT). Alex Proyas will never achieve anything close to this masterpiece again and if Brandon Lee HAD to die, then there could never have been a better time and place (do not misinterpret my words or meaning here). Personally, I shall for ever be indebted to him for what he has left...a performance in a film that challenges, implores, conjures, paints. A surreal landscape of good and evil in almost equal proportions.I am no Goth, have never read the original comic strip, nor do I wish to. I simply regret watching the unspeakably pathetic and inappropriate sequels...do not make the same mistake!For all its grotesque violence, seediness and Gothic degeneracy, THE CROW is a pure love story, so pure, that even immersed within the blackest of adult fairy-tales its power cannot be dampened or lessened. Eric Draven's spiritual pursuit of those who murdered his beautiful girlfriend is less of a revenge story and more a reminder that karma balances out in the end.Perhaps the best performance, other than that of the crow itself, is from Michael Wincott, a very underrated actor, as the incarnately evil gang leader. It is the role of a lifetime for him.If I were in a position that I could see only two films again for the rest of my life, they would be 2001 and THE CROW. At no stage would I ever subsequently be able to say that I had seen EVERYTHING that either had to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, The Crow is the greatest movie of all time. Brandon Lee's death had absolutely nothing to do with it, although it was a tragedy. That movie contained everything. Action, suspense, romance, horror, sci fi. It could literally fit into any category (accept for maybe porno). The diverse cast helped a lot showing that any one can be a bad guy. If you look at it, the character of Eric Draven is everybody. He's just your average Joe Shmoe who was scraping to make a living. There wasn't anything special about him until after he died. While Crow movies after this one may have had better special affects, or been less family friendly, there was a magic that these people brought to this movie that will never be recreated. Brandon Lee's death did not sell this movie, a story that everyone could relate to did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholically beautiful comic book fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comic book movies have always fascinated me. I don't whether it's their visual style, the special effects, the performances of the actors as compared to the comic itself or the interpretation of the graphic novel's storyline by the filmmakers that interests me the most, but I've always been enthralled by a bleak story that places a tragic hero in the midst of a towering city, whose choices and actions determine the fate of himself and those around him. Often a comic book can provide the bare essentials for an excellent story, but more often, the filmmakers or producers scrap the idea of a storyline and aim primarily for the explotation of special effects. In the case of "The Crow," this is not true: this is the only film that has ever captured the true essence of the comic book it's based on, expanded upon its virtues and added its own style to complement the base storyline of the film.On October 30th, a night that has come to be known as "Devil's Night," in reference to the hundreds of fires set by dangerous gangs, Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) are brutally attacked in their downtown apartment. Shelly is raped by the gang and Eric is thrown out of a five-story window, dying almost instantly. They leave behind a close friend and younger-sister figure, Sarah (Rochelle Davis), endless rainy nights in the city, and infinite sorrow on those who knew them.Their deaths left a score unsettled, and as a result, an ancient legend becomes reality, as a mystical crow descends from the Heavens who normally carries souls to the land of the dead, brings Eric Draven's soul back to life so he can exact revenge on the men who killed him and his fiance. He dresses himself in torn black clothing, boots, and paints his face like a sad clown. He is invincible, for he is already dead, and sets out on a quest for retribution, seeking out each one of his murderers one by one. He is helped along the way by two people, Sarah and Officer Albrecht (Ernie Hudson), who stayed with Shelly until she died, against an army of arsonist gangsters led by the mysteriously incestuous Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), who is the orchestrator of Devil's Night, and inspires his troops with quotes and dialogue from Dante's "Inferno" and "Paradise Lost." With the crow leading the way, Eric Draven sets out to redeem his soul and regain his justice in a city that has never stopped raining since his death.From its opening shot right to its final seconds, "The Crow" is a depressingly gripping film. A truly fantastic and faithful adaptation of James O'Barr's comic book series, this film draws its inspiration from both the comic book and earlier films such as Fritz Lang's "Metropolis." The story is set against the backdrop of a broken city ruled by an underground society of arsonists, where the police can do nothing to stop them and the children run wild in the streets. The buildings tower high over the urban streets, overlooking a sad foundation without law, justice or order - you know everything about this world with one shot. The production design and cinematography combines to create an atmosphere in a society without hope, accentuated only further by a Middle-East inspired score by Graeme Revell, and choicy tunes by Nine Inch Nails, The Cure, Stone Temple Pilots and My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult.Director Alex Proyas claims he has never seen a sequel to his film on the basis that no one could do justice to the main character like Brandon Lee... I agree with him. Lee's performance as the vengeful soul is one of the greatest I have ever seen on film. He exhibits confidence, cunning and menace, while at the same time communicating just enough pain and depression to stay true to his character. You know what he's capable of, and at the same time his emotional weaknesses. If I can think of any flaw to this film I would mention the incestuous relationship between Funboy and his sister. It was not a subplot, thankfully, but it didn't seem necessary in a film that was already disturbing enough.Made with passion, performed with intensity, designed with precision and influence, "The Crow" is an unheralded masterpiece of the 20th Century. It is heartbreaking to think that this film almost dodged release - if that had happened, no one would ever have known the degree of Brandon Lee's acting capabilities. The man had a fiery presence and was articulate and powerful with his delivery - indeed, with one great film, he has become a martyr for the exposition of this character. 4 1/2 stars on a five star scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brandon Lee at his best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Brandon Lee did not have many films to his credit, this one turned him into a legend. With witty one-liners, and eye-popping action, The Crow was his best work ever. Whether its the scene where he embeds a crow-like design in Tin-Tin's chest, or leaves behind a fiery calling card after sending T-bird to his death, Brandon Lee left his mark. I was also impressed with the film's cinematography. With black being the picture's dominant color, I felt it was a perfect fit with it's storyline. Michael Wincott delivered an equally impressive performance as Top Dollar, the evil mastermind behind the two grizzly murders. Brandon Lee truly saved his best for last. Rest In Peace Brandon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't rain all the time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen it for about ten years and as the full moon came beaming through my apartment window late last night, it just felt right to indulge in some Proyas Gothic excellence.The question still taps away at all our doors, namely would the film be the cult classic it became without the Brandon Lee tragedy? That's a tricky one to answer because we all deep down have a morbid curiosity about us, especially with films and their stars. This is why I got a lot more from re-watching the movie after a very long period of time, namely that it may have drew many of us in years ago because of the tragedy and heart aching back story to writer James O'Barr's birthing of Eric Draven the character, but it can now enthral, thrill and shatter emotions of its own accord.The Gothic art design and the soundtrack are emo personified before such a label was invented, Lee is lithe and skillful and serving notice to what a talent we were robbed of that fateful day in March 1993. The villains are a roll call of go to guys for such roles, Kelly, Wincott, Todd, while Ernie Hudson fronts up as good cop personified. And finally Proyas, struggling with the budget even before Brandon's death, that he manages to create this world of perpetual bleakness, but still offer hope and beauty - the latter via tracking shots, pull aways and intricate frame shots of a tormented Draven, shows him to be a purveyor of considerable skills.All told, The Crow (1994) deserves to not be thought of as a cult classic, but just as a classic, period. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the deepest movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is my favorite film of all time. One factor of this film that made it so awesome had to be the casting. The acting is just superb. Brandon Lee did an excellent job of playing Eric Draven, one of the most complicated comic book characters ever. I don't think there's any actor out there that could've mastered this role like Brandon Lee did. Michael Wincott fit Top Dollar's personality so well. He can be so evil at times. The soundtrack and the score were masterpieces in themselves. All the bands chosen to appear ( ex. Stone Temple Pilots, Nine Inch Nails)on the soundtrack had a certain mood to their music that fit the movie's aura. As for the score, Graeme Revell put together perhaps one of the best scores of the 1990's. With his combination of modern musical instruments and foreign instruments and his tasteful and original use of synthesizers, he will always be one of the most talented composers. The plot of this film is so universal. it can be used on so many other levels or in so many other stories. Being brought back from the dead not to avenge yourself, but to avenge the death of your loved one. Some may think that it's cliche but this coming from the same people who watch movie like Robo Cop and think that that is good movie-making. ::shudder:: Others believe that the movie became popular for the fact that Brandon Lee passed away during the making of it. I don't think this could be farther from the truth. The movie would be just as popular as it is today even if Brandon Lee had not died during the fabrication of the film. Though the sequels that followed the film fell short of it's greatness, they will never tarnish the importance of The Crow. James O' Barr put together a story of anger, pain, and love and Alex Proyas turned his vision into a masterpiece. This movie changed my life...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this film many, many times and it always captivates me....with it's story of love and loss, revenge and betrayal......the idea that love can conquer all, even death is a strong one, and in this movie it is handled with great gravitas.Alex Proyas (as he also showed with Dark City) has a visual knack for creating a dark world, and the world of the Crow is Detroit, but it could be anywhere.......The villains are never too OTT and the poignant moments between Sarah and Eric are handled well.The real stand out for me though, is Brandon Lee's performance, and it still fills me with sadness to know, that his breakout role, was his last.RIP Brandon...The Crow is a fitting epitaph for you.DC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will infect your soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say. Each day I find myself quoting The Crow at least a dozen times. Usually people just give me strange looks. Sometimes (like when I say, "I got stabbed! I shot the sonnovabitch! I watched the bullet hole close by itself. And then my business gets blown up real good. Other than that, my day sucked!") people call security on me.This movie is a one-of-a-kind. It's grunge, it's goth, it's dark, it's funny, it's touching and it's inspiring... even if it merely inspires you to slap mime makeup on your face and walk the streets at night yelling, "I guess it's not a good day to be a bad guy, huh SKANK?!!"Seriously, as Roger Ebert said, it's an experience. Even though the plot is pretty straightforward (rockstar gets killed &amp; comes back from the grave to seek revenge), it's done in a way that keeps you riveted every minute. The same way "Peewee's Big Adventure" is just about a guy looking for his bike, The Crow takes the same approach of using a minimalist plot and coating it in heaps of style, music and surreal visuals. Except The Crow has a few dozen more murders than Peewee.What makes this film a visual feast is the way it stylistically mirrors the comic book that inspired it. Like the comic, it's very monochrome... almost black &amp; white, but with some icy tints to it. It has a very wet look to it, making it seem glossy and muted at the same time. Like another favourite film of mine "City of Lost Children", it achieves a certain vivid appearance even though the colour palette is very limited.As far as action flicks go, this is quite a literary extravaganza. Quotes from Poe's "The Raven", Milton's "Paradise Lost", Thackeray's "Vanity Fair" and who knows what else, lend an air of classiness and antiquity to the film. And of course the movie generates its own memorable quotes. Like "Greed is for amateurs. Disorder, chaos, anarchy... now that's fun!" Paired with an entertaining script full of great zingers, the acting is first rate all around. Each &amp; every character, no matter how large or minor, delivers a memorable performance. Of course Brandon Lee is the standout, playing the cold-hearted, vengeful killer but with a gentleness that makes you want to take him home to meet your folks. Conversely, the bad guys are brutal but so comic you can't help but love them.A word about Brandon's death... yes, it's true that he was killed by a malfunctioning prop gun during the apartment scene. But that reel of film was reportedly destroyed by the director. The movie still had several scenes that needed to be filmed, and the director compensated by recycling other scenes with some very interesting effects. For example, when Brandon punches the mirror, it's actually a double punching the mirror with Brandon's "reflection" (from another scene) digitally imposed on the glass. Tricks like that are not obvious, and they add a certain otherworldly feel to the movie. It also makes the film feel more fragmented and incomplete (in a good way), leaving more to the imagination. If you're like me and you hate movies that over-explain everything, the minimalistic presentation of The Crow will be right up your alley.Lastly, the music. If you were alive &amp; remotely cool in the 90s you'll love the soundtrack. The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, Violent Femmes, Stone Temple Pilots, Henry Rollins, the list goes on...If you're familiar with the director Alex Proyas, you'll recognize this as possibly his greatest work (alongside "Dark City", "Garage Days" and some great, surreal music videos like Sting "All This Time"). The feel of The Crow is also reminiscent of director Frank Miller's work ("The Spirit", "Sin City"). And although I haven't seen it, I've heard the Batman film "Dark Knight" pays tribute to this film, particularly Heath Ledger's Joker who is hauntingly close to Brandon Lee's character. If you like artsy movies, this fits right in, reminding me of Jean Pierre Jeunet ("City of Lost Children", "Delicatessen") and the darker side of Tim Burton ("Sweeny Todd"). Maybe there's even a bit of "Blade Runner" thrown in.If you get a chance, see The Crow on a rainy night with all the lights off. Lose yourself in the mood, the music and the memory of Brandon, the greatest star who never was. Halloween is coming up, so get your favourite Crow costume ready. If you live in a sheltered town like mine, chances are nobody will recognize who you're supposed to be. Although quite a few people think I'm Edward Scissorhands who is also pretty cool, so whatever...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadness is the Main Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a tacit theme of sadness that is so ubiquitous throughout the entire movie that it should have been billed as the main character. It's raised to the next level when you remember that this was Brandon Lee's breakout movie and he died making it. I never read the comic so I do not know if it was true to it, but I do know that this movie had a tone that I've never felt before. Brandon Lee is simply amazing! The set design, writing, and directing are top notch--they truly transport you to the goth underbelly of a place you don't want to be. It will clearly be too violent and dark for many viewers, but if you can get over it, you will experience a brilliant film. i've seen this movie a few times and it gets better every time I see it. My only complaint is that I did not have the luxury of seeing it in a theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic Events Make the Film All the More Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow (1994) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A year after a vicious gang murders him and his fiancé, Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) returns from the dead to seek vengeance on them. I was just twelve years old when Lee was killed while making this movie and to this day I still remember very well what I was doing when I heard the news. I was actually riding back from Florida with my parents when the news broke and by the time THE CROW hit theaters I think everyone's level of excitement and sadness was rather high since we knew Lee ended up giving his life for this film. THE CROW, visually, is quite an impressive film and it's rather ironic that the real life death of Lee fit so closely with the death of the person he plays here. This is quite an exciting film to watch but there's no doubt that the haunted and sad events surrounding the movie actually help it. I think there's a very sad feeling throughout this movie and there's no question that the death also made for a very dark and haunting atmosphere. The entire film has a very cold and strange feel to it and I personally feel that a lot of it is due to what happened. We'll never know how well the film would be viewed had the tragic events not happened but as it stands the film really delivers a feeling unlike any other movie. Lee's performance is quite good in the lead as I thought he handled the action scenes quite well but he also did a very good job with the tortured character. Ernie Hudson is as dependable as always and the supporting players fit their roles nicely as well. The set design and cinematography are both top-notch and they really help the film's feel and emotion. THE CROW somewhat made Lee a legend and there's no question that the death contributed to the myth of the movie. At least Lee went all giving it his all in a film that I'm sure he would have been very proud of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gothic comic book masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crow, is a tale of loss and retribution, love and sadness, but not without hope or it's fair share of (dark and sarcastic)humor! The main character portrayed brilliantly by Brandon Lee, is sympathetic, poetic and sometimes even philosophical, which doesn't in any way stop him from being also a total badass. The atmosphere and setting are amazing. The film manages to create a desolate urban environment, where it seems to constantly rain, and be a perpetual night. We get sweeping and awe inspiring looks of the city rooftops, and of it's dark crime infested alleyways. The supporting cast also does a wonderful job of creating despicable villains who yet doing horrible deeds manage to be entertaining and never dull, and also some innocent characters who show that not all is lost and there is hope still. Dialogue fitting the rest of the movie is never altogether happy, manages to be impressing as well. It will leave you with many memorable lines that you remember long after seeing the movie. When there are quotes of John Milton and Edgar Allan Poe, but it's the original lines that stand out the most it should say something! The action scenes are top notch, can be a bit graphic if you don't like violence, but as with the dialogue, there are many scenes that are iconic and memorable. All of it is stylized, but strays never too far from realism. Soundtrack manages to fill the movie mainly with 90's metal and grunge, which is to say with music that feels as natural in this movie as birds singing in Bambi. I am not gonna talk about the story itself, cause I want everybody to see this film. It's a milestone and a blueprint of how dark fantasy should be handled! 10/10 cause I can't think of anything that I didn't like or felt it could have been improved on in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brooding Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i remember i was in college when i first heard of this movie. I had to go through quite a few video shops to get my hand on a decent VHS tape but boy oh boy was i blown way with this flick. The dark atmosphere coupled with a banging soundtrack makes it a proper cult classic. Who can forget the scene when Brandon lee is standing at the window looking at the town with The Crow's 'Burn' track in the backdrop. It is one of cinema's most hallucinating scenes yet the movie never got the status it deserved when it got released. With time people will discover this cult classic and rediscover themselves with it. The soundtrack in its own is another classic,filled with big names like The Cure, Nine inch nails,violent femmes, panthera etc, it sure is a soundtrack to blow you away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow what a movie The Crow is.I first saw this movie when i was 10 and my older brother rented it from local video store.I was amazed by it.But strangely enough, i never appreciated it until i was about 15/16.I matured quickly.I had it on video and my machine chewed it up.After a while of searching for it, i found it on DVD cheap in a video store.This is one of the few movies to have everything you could want from a film except sex.This movie has lots of Action,Thrills,Drama,Horror,Excitement,And some one-liners.The scenes are very well filmed and you can feel all of the emotions of Brandon's character.This is rated highly in my all time favourite movies,i have seen a lot of movies over the years including every Bruce and Brandon lee movies ever made.It is tragic that Brandon,like his father before him did not get to enjoy his biggest movie success.The Crow,Rapid Fire and Legacy Of Rage are the top three movies of Brabdon lee in my opinion in that order.Bruce would be Enter The Dragon,Fists Of Fury,and The Big Boss.Brandon like his father before him died to soon.But Bruce and Brandon will forever be remembered for The Crow and Enter The Dragon.I would recommend this movie for anyone who wants an all in one film,This has it all.R.I.P Bruce and Brandon.Gone too soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Jones Transfer?...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(The summary above only makes sense to true Crow fans...)Brandon Lee was remarkable in this. My only complaint is that he died. This was his film, through and through. He worked to bring it to existence, he labored to finish it, and in the end he paid the ultimate price for his art. He will be missed.This movie is a testament to how love breaches the gap of death. It is a love story, regardless of content. Many of the sequences of the comic are not present, for valid reasons, but I kind of wish they were...perhaps the "Jones Transfer" segment I mentioned would have been good for a commercial (or two.) Who can say?..I saw this movie immediately upon release and was pleased to see it. It is a fine example of a unique spin on an old idea. More moviemakers should take the cue from O'Barr, et. al., and climb out on a limb once and a while -- and make something different. Something that might not be great, but is far the more genuine for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It rained here in Wilmington, North Carolina the day Brandon Lee died. A buddy of mine called me early that day and told me that Lee had been shot on the set of THE CROW. I thought he was joking. He wasn't; the local news channels were confirming it. Not long before, another friend of mine, from out of town, had visited and we'd tried to find the location where THE CROW was being filmed. I was already a Brandon Lee fan and I loved the comic, so I was determined to see him in the flesh. On a dark, rainy day, we searched around until we found the black crow logo with an arrow indicating that the camera crew was somewhere downtown, and set off in search of Brandon Lee. My buddy grew tired of driving and searching and suggested we take in a movie (ARMY OF DARKNESS was playing, and we were both Sam Raimi fans). I insisted we keep on searching. Downtown, we drove past a group of filmmakers on a side street and I recognized Sam Raimi himself. I urged my buddy to stop. He thought I was "full of ****." But he stopped and we got out and watched Sam Raimi shoot second unit footage for THE HUDSUCKER PROXY. Later, we saw ARMY OF DARKNESS. I never did get to see Brandon Lee. I called the offices of Fangoria magazine and told them about the accident. They didn't seem interested (this was before the internet, and there was no way for them to confirm my story, I guess). Later, when the news broke that Lee had died, I followed up with another phone call. This time around, the Fangorians had heard the news for themselves and were understandably low-key. I hung up and walked to the door and looked out. Dark clouds were rushing past overhead, and raindrops were starting to fall again. I stood there with raindrops pelting my face and I closed my eyes and, before long, I began to cry. I'd been a Bruce Lee fan and had been shocked by his death; the shock of hearing about Brandon Lee's death was just as hard to take. Not long after, at the same hospital where he had been taken, I talked to a nurse who had been there when he'd been brought in. "He was bleedin' so bad they had to change the mattress," she told me: "It was soaked clean through." She went on, but I'd already gone numb. Sometimes, I still feel that way. It's dark out, now, so I'm going to go. It feels like rain.</fullReview>

It clings to every genre of film: comedy, Action, Thriller, Romance... it's the ultimate movie. I've favored this movie since the second time I saw it... I've watched it repeatedly so often that now it is a black and white film with a little red, red! The lines are beautiful, the characters well portrayed...I also like The Crow: City of Angels though the ending was a bit... eccentric, and The Crow: Salvation didn't much live up to my standards. The Crow: Wicked Prayer would have been better if Furlong wasn't trying so hard to deliver his lines like Brandon Lee in the first film. (not I do not say original because it has yet to be remade and I doubt it ever will) All in all, if you like a wide variety of films, definitely see this one, you should not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brandon Lee, a triumph of an actor, earned his stardom from his film...and his life. I recently bought this film, knowing it appealed to many Gothic cultures and thought of this as something I may enjoy-and it was worth every penny. I enjoy perhaps every moment of this film, and it remains one of my favourites. The symbolic scene of The Crow's arrival from the grave shall remain in my head for years to come. How could I explain this film? How could I project such a legendary plot, I'll never know. The only thing I can honestly say is to see this film. Watch it just more than once and have it stay in your mind forever. Goth bless James 'O Barr for bringing us in the first place a story like this-an expanded poem in the format of a film. A horror-like film with Goth potential, anyone can enjoy ''The Crow''.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has always been a favorite of mine. I quote it more than any other movie, I watch it more than any other movie. I guess you could call it my favorite movie.The story focuses around Eric Draven, a rock star who was murdered along with his wife-to-be, Shelly, the day before his Halloween wedding. He comes back a year later to seek vengeance on those who put him and his wife through the pain they had to endure. Each of the men who murdered him are slowly stalked by Draven and The Crow that brought him back to life, who is his only link to the realm of the living.Brandon Lee gives an unforgettable performance as Eric Draven. He is convincing in his role, and you really forget that he is just an actor pretending to be this character. It really feels as if Eric Draven is a real person seeking vengeance. Rochelle Davis is another example of bringing a character to life. Her portrayal of Sarah is amazing. She really shows how to make a character come to life. You really can connect with Sarah as she feels alone in the world without Eric and Shelly. This is easily one of my favorite, if not number one on my list of favorite movies. I can recommend this movie to any movie lover without hesitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a serious guy movie. It is one of my top 10 all time movies.I anticipated this movie would be great after I watched Brandon Lees previous movie "Rapid Fire". It is set to happen all in 1 night, very few people appreciate the difficulty of shooting in near darkness. The acting and stunt-ing of Brand Lee is fantastic. The supporting cast was OK but they were not the focus point. This is one of those classic stories of hero seeking revenge. The Gothic setting for this is like Outlaw Josey Wales meets New York City at night.Like all real "Guy movies" they must meet 3 or criteria: 1. Action worth re-watching (fighting, shooting or blowing up) 2. A Hero you like (Strong silent like Eastwood, Badass like Bruce/Brandon Lee, or Tough Everyday guy like Bruce Willis) and a Villain you HATE 3. Story that ends in a "Hell Yeah" (Revenge is dish best served cold) + if there is a good soundtrack + if there is a hot chickThis movie enters in to immortality due to the fact that Brandon Lee son of a Legend Bruce Lee meet his demise in this movie.</fullReview>

Though dark and Gothic this movie resembles such terrific and strong emotion and is centered around a romantic theme as Brandon Lee exacts revenge against the ruthless band of criminals who murdered him and his fiancée after being revived from a hypnotic crow. I Can't believe that Brandon Lee died while filming this movie, I was really looking foreword to see him shine in the future. Some argue that Brandon Lee's death sold this movie but I don't buy that. If you've watched this movie it hits you, it hits you hard and grabs you in with it and you'll want to keep watching till Brandon brings down the last criminal. I can't believe what a performance Brandon Lee gave he was terrific and gripping portraying a character that everybody can relate to. Alex Proyas did a terrific job of making the movie really bleak and dark just like the comic book. A beautiful comic book brought to life I was amazed blown away and breathless by the time it had come to conclusion.Rest in Peace Brandon you have made your mark 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The taste of revenge, the dark corners, the black everywhere, the night, and a crow that fly, seeking revenge, seeking death for the murderers of a girl and a boy. "The Crow" is a masterpiece. A sad, dark and violent fable of revenge and death bought by a black bird that, sometimes, takes back to life the victims of brutal murderer so they can have they holy revenge. The movie is a little different from the original graphic novel written by James O.Barr. The novel is beautiful and my advice is to read it as soon as you can if you loved the movie. This film also remind the tragic death of Brandon Lee. Brandon was incredible acting as "the Crow". The other two movies are simply awful and cannot bring to life the spirit within the original, incredible, novel. This is an angry movie on the side of the victims. Not politically correct, not religious, but simply a movie about revenge, and it's something like a poem about love and death. I loved it. Wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crow is an action and revenge movie. Eric Draven, with his girlfriend was murdered by four criminals. But their deaths was unjust and Draven, with the help of a raven, one who connects the living with the afterlife, Draven returns to claim revenge. And the punishment can only be death.Alone, Draven takes on the entire criminal organization of crime lord Top Dollar, whose gang killed him once. And it is easy, since Draven is already dead and can't be hurt. He is indestructible and invincible. Until Top Dollar figures out that it is the raven that gives Draven his superhuman powers.Not a very entertaining story, since it doesn't get any suspense until the final ten minutes, and barely then either. Draven, with his powers, is simply to powerful. There is no threat to him. What it is is an action packed dark story. The scenery is very dark, it is always raining and the Gothic influence is heavy. Visually it is interesting, but not very good either.Had Draven been vulnerable somehow, this could have been really good. Now, ironically, it is mostly known and interesting since lead actor Brandon Lee died in an accident while filming it. Had the accident never occurred, I believe this movie would have been forgotten long ago.I feel that it is a movie one should have seen. But it wasn't very memorable, unfortunately.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After scrolling through about 6 pages of comments, I was shocked to find no negative ones at all. So I will fix that mistake right now. I gave The Crow 2/10 - 1 point is there because you can't rate a movie 0 points, and 1 point because it was dark and had a dark rock soundtrack, dark is cool. Other then that it just looked like any other B-movie shown on TV on a Tuesday night, some hero killing typical 100% evil bad guys, random cop with a moustache, random kid, all played by actors you normally see in different TV series. So its probably the tragic death of Brandon Lee that makes people rate this one highly, but to be honest - this movie is a complete failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More a romance than revenge movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, THE CROW seems to be just another revenge saga, with an added goth twist to appeal to fans of KISS and Marilyn Manson. Thankfully I was mistaken, because this is an emotional roller-coaster of a movie that is both fun and moving, violent yet sensitive. It certainly strikes the viewer as a film in which opposing values gel together quite brilliantly. And, whatever critics may say, it will always be a strangely unique movie, in which the tragedy of Lee's on-set death runs parallel to the death and rebirth of his screen character. As such the movie has a spooky, almost legendary air to it, a real one-off to a film. But Lee's death ? although deeply upsetting ? is not a good reason to watch this movie, having nothing to do with the film itself.Director Proyas (DARK CITY) keeps things dim and shadowy throughout. The film seems to take place over the length of one hellish night, so expect brooding darkness, silent alleys and many shots of Lee's surreal, mime-painted face. The plot is simple; he dies, is reborn, and takes revenge on the bad guys, but Lee's relationship with a teenage friend heightens the emotion, as does Ernie Hudson's sympathetic cop who understands the hero's inner feelings and understanding. The bad guys are mostly psychotic rather than evil, all presided over by the sinister yet suave Michael Wincott, one of my favourite underrated actors. Others such as Candyman (Tony Todd) and Sully from COMMANDO (David Patrick Kelly) flesh out the ranks of the victims. Many stunts, explosive action sequences, violent moments and shoot-outs keep the plot moving, but I found this film to be more of an appealing, romantic and deeply sad love story than anything else. Worth catching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing that a film so steeped in 90s zeitgeist also manages to feel timeless. Director Alex Proyas tells the story as a sort of Gothic tone poem, with the music and visuals creating a mood that hangs over you like a weeping sky. Brandon Lee, who was tragically killed during filming, is brilliant in what would've been a star making turn. Shifting easily between rage, compassion and humor, he transcends the typical comic book hero archetype.With its darkly beautiful visuals, pitch perfect soundtrack and excellent score, 'The Crow' remains a unique and genre defying masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brandon plays rock star Eric Draven, who, along with his fiancée is murdered by a gang of thugs who work for the city's evil crime boss (Michael Wincott). One year later, a spiritual crow brings Eric's restless soul back from the dead so he can get revenge on those who killed him and his beloved.A cult classic favorite that from a style point of view that is full of Gothic visuals and brooding melancholy, the bleak gloom is striking, all dark rooms, dirty streets and perpetual rain. The constantly-blaring soundtrack batters you into submission, the rock-Gothic feel is ideal for the underground comic adaptation.The action scenes are well put together and there are good turns from Ernie 'Winston out of Ghostbusters' Hudson as the sympathetic cop and Wincott as the ominous kingpin. As for Lee, while the co-credited choreographer obviously rocks the fight scenes, he brings an appropriately-haunting vibe to every scene he's in, nailing some key lines (like his response to Hudson's "Don't move...you move, you're dead!" order: "I say I'm dead...and I move"). Chilling us further, he eerily mused on mortality in his final interview: "Because we do not know when we will die we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. It all seems limitless." Spooky.The Crow is a cult classic that will forever be shrouded by the tragic events on set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed "The Crow" ever since the first time I watched it during the mid-1990's. And the movie is still entertaining today, and it will be so forever, as it is just a timeless movie.There are many things that work in favor of "The Crow". First and foremost the Brandon Lee legacy was fully established with this 1994 movie. But it was also the movie that snatched the young talent from Hollywood far too early, and this movie really would have been his stepping stone onto something far bigger.The storyline in "The Crow" is a solid one that is build on the foundation of a good storytelling script. The night before Halloween is known as "Devil's Night" and it sees the untimely death of Eric Draven (played by Brandon Lee) and his fiancée Shelly Webster (played by Sofia Shinas) at the hands of a gang of ruffians. A year later Eric returns from beyond the grave, accompanied by a raven, sent back to seek vengeance on those who killed him and his beloved fiancée.Director Alex Proyas managed to put the script and storyline quite adamantly to the screen in a very memorable manner. And the characters in "The Crow" were well-detailed and helped to bring the story to life quite nicely on the screen.Now, "The Crow" is not a massive CGI or special effects galore, which the movie does well without, as this is a story- and character-driven movie in every aspect.They had a rather good ensemble of talents for the cast list. Starting with the late Brandon Lee, of course, whom was well-cast for the role of Eric Draven, and it also had a very charismatic Michael Wincott in the role of Top Dollar - the boss of the ruffians. Bai Ling appears in a dark and very odd character named Myca. Ernie Hudson pulls off the role as police officer Sergeant Albrecht quite nicely.I have watched "The Crow" countless times, and will continue to watch it every now and then for as long as I continue to watch movies, because it is an entertaining movie and has a very unique dark, semi-Gothic feel to it.</fullReview>

One overlooked tragedy is the aftermath for the young actress Rochelle Davis who portrayed Sarah. Devastated by her friends death she left the movie business and what could have been a great career. I usually cannot stand child actors but she does an amazing job in this movie. As does all the other actors. Michael Wincott and David Patrick Kelly have their best villain roles in this film.

What is incredibly sad about this movie is that during one of the last days of filming Brandon Lee was accidentally shot and killed because of a firearms accident on the set of filming "The Crow." This should have never happened and it bothers me that it did. Brandon Lee could have been in all the other movies in the series and he could have been just as popular as Spider Man or Batman. He had a great acting career ahead of him and had just started acting, he died at the age of 28, on March 31st,1993. This movie is action packed and filled with drama, horror, love and poetry. It effected me even more because of the death of amazing actor Brandon Lee on the set of the movie. After his death his fiancée and others decided to finish the movie, and dedicate it to Brandon and his Fiancée, Eliza Hutton. The movie was finished with a stunt double (a friend of Brandon's) and special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American director Alex Proyas' film 'The Crow' continues to enjoy its cult film status.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Crow' was American actor Brandon Lee's last film where has left indelible marks on all scenes in which he has featured. There are numerous reasons which might have compelled director Alex Proyas to choose 'The Crow' as a bird who helps a man avenge senseless killings. One should note that the crow symbolizes the perfect harmony between a bird and a human to wage a war against injustices. A crow is the best spirit animal associated with life's mysteries and magic. Apart from beautifully choreographed action scenes, it has a strong revenge story with ample scope for drama. In one of the major subplots, viewers are able to watch how a neglected child is able to get happiness when her mother realizes the mistakes she made by ignoring her. The cult film status accorded to American director Alex Proyas' film 'The Crow' is justified by all means. In 1994, at the time of its release it was hailed as both box office success as well as many critics' favorite film.It is no wonder that there is hardly any director who has artistic abilities to direct a sensible remake of 'The Crow'.This information should be taken into account to measure the overall success of the film 'The Crow'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a two-hour long music video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But that is not necessarily a bad thing. The soundtrack to this film had shaped my adolescence even though I hadn't even seen the movie until twenty years later. In fact, most of the fun of watching it was the 90's nostalgia and to see and hear how the music was used in the film. It's almost as if there was a special block of a non-existent MTV show that catered to the goth/industrial set. The film flows like a series of music videos with its building-leaping action, surreal close-ups of the mysterious black-bird, and washed-out, sepia-drenched flashback sequences. While watching it I just remembered "DAMN, that song by Medicine is so great!" Too bad they never really took off. Truly, much of the music in this film still holds up even though I have changed drastically as a person when it comes to musical taste. Now. Let's get to the movie.Part of me as a critic really wants to target and surgically strike the painfully elementary dialogue and predictable story line but it would be unfair. To even criticize an adaptation of a comic book would be like sending a food critic to Wendy's. It's pop-culture, and typically when it comes to comics and graphic novels, the target audience is adolescent boys who wish to pass on the James Joyce and Bronte sisters melodrama. In other words, the intention is to be narratively pedestrian and simple while focusing on the tone, atmosphere and artistic prowess. It is fantasy. I'm not going to bring a gun to this knife fight.So what about the visuals and the film itself? It truly is a gorgeous film. Sweeping Hitchockian crane shots, birds eye view shots and blazing action sequences. It gracefully shifts back and forth from a gritty urban action thriller to a highly detailed romance. There is enough substance here to satisfy your inner Batman as well as your Wings of Desire. It is the perfectly appeasing date movie. If I saw it 1994, it would have been cliché. Seeing it now, I'm thinking "they don't make em like this anymore." Plus it gave Ernie Hudson a chance to show that he is more than Winston. More than the token tag-along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The city is burning on the night of Oct 30. Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his girlfriend Shelly Webster are brutally killed by a gang led by T-Bird. Sgt. Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) is first on the scene and meets street kid Sarah. The couple has been taking care of her. A year later, the crow raises Draven from the dead to exact revenge on the gang, one member at a time.This is infamous for the accidental shooting death of Brandon Lee on set. I like the nightmarish atmospheric tone of the movie. The main thing missing is a fuller performance from Lee. There is a haunted feel to it. He's not nearly menacing enough but there is a small hint of Heath Ledger's Joker. He didn't do much other than The Crow so it's hard to determine if he has the same charisma as his father. The few normal interactions are competent. This cinematic world shows some promise but it's difficult to determine whether Brandon Lee held any great promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting, timeless classic. As good as films get.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>31 Days Of Horror: Day 26Not technically a horror, I know, but Alex Proyas's The Crow is close enough to the mark, and a halloween seasonal film at that, so get off my back. Plus, it's one of the best movies ever made, period. Anyone who knows me well enough is aware that my love for this one veers close to fanaticism. Now the one thing I try not to dwell on when discussing it is the tragic accidental death of young star Brandon Lee on set, a result of a grave props error. Yes it happened, but it's not the distinguishing feature of it and if anything gives the film a haunted, otherworldy, aching vibe. Lee had a star quality that burned bright in his few cinematic outings, and he's a dark prince of fierce revenge and essential 90's grunge here, playing musician Eric Draven. On a hellish, arson plagued night before Halloween in an unnamed urban sinkhole, Draven and his beautiful fiancé Shelley (Sophia Shinas) are heartlessly murdered by a marauding band of street thugs. One year later, a mysterious crow lands on Draven's grave, a harbinger of resurrection. Draven is brought back to life for one purpose: revenge against the men who killed them. For two haunting hours, Lee is a hypnotic angel of death, thrashing his guitar at the heavens atop a cathedral when he's not laying waste to the inner city scum of a city rotting at its core, yet filled with a lived in, gritty Gothic grandeur that's a testament to the set design and cinematography. Lee had a special way with dialogue thats wonderful to hear, a brisk cadence and well spoken sincerity that stands out among the crass inbreds he interacts with for much of the story. Each of the gang members are more self destructive and psychopathic than the last: Skank (Angel David) a mumbling crackhead screw up, knife throwing Tin Tin (Laurence Mason), skeevy rape fanatic Funboy (Michael Massee) and their nasty leader T Bird, played by underrated David Patrick Kelly, who shows uncanny abilities in his final scene of reckoning and realization. Their leader is a terrifying machiavellan overlord named Top Dollar, and runs every crime outlet in town. He's played by my favourite actor, Michael Wincott with a devilish, nihilistic brutality, his trademark velvet over broken glass voice, and a sense of dark, almost Poe-esque mythology. Whether burying his face in a mound of coke, hacking off limbs of disloyal cohorts with his ornate sword collection or giving a hair raising monologue on social anarchy, he's a highlight of the film and a comic book villain for the ages. Along with his kinky sister Myca (Bai Ling, who he also bangs &gt;:), and his suave first lieutenant Grange (Candyman himself, Tony Todd) he launches an all out war against Draven, rallying every lowlife, gutter rat and junkie with a gun to find him. Meanwhile kind hearted police officer Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) is on his case as well, and young Sarah (Rochelle Davis), Eric's friend, misses him and searches the streets for someone to care for her while her deadbeat slutty mother (Anna Thompson) does drugs with Funboy. There's scene stealing work from Jon Polito as deplorably scuzzy pawn shop proprietor Gideon, the black humored comic relief of the movie. There's such an organic, fluid energy to this film, every beat hitting the mark, the editing a precise symphony of image and sound that leaves you wanting more and keeps you coming back. The ethereal score by Graeme Revell is a mothwinged lullaby of mythic proportions accented by fitting work from The Cure, and every performance is exactly and perfectly what it needs to be. Not to mention the production and costume design, setting a mood of brooding tragedy, burning romanticism, dark emotional torment and surreal Gothic characters that should have their own action figure set. There's endlessly quotable lines in the script penned from James O Barr's comic book as well, from offbeat humour, to poignant poetry and all kinds of profane and threatening utterances. It's as near to a perfect film as one can get, and hovers around in my top five of all time. A classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe me, nothing is trivial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stylish revenge fantasy film inspired by the graphic novel by James O' Barr, which in turn, was inspired by the real-life murder of his girlfriend by a drunk driver.The title refers to the crow that brings the main character, Eric Draven back to life after a year to avenge his and fiancée, Shelly Webster's murder at the hands of the city's most notorious gang members. And is, of course, the final film of the man who plays him, Brandon Lee, who was fatally injured on set by a stunt that went awry.I admit to not being familiar with Lee's previous work as it mostly consists of martial arts movies, which don't really interest me, but in regards to his performance as Eric, he was putting his heart and soul into the role and it shows.He displays all the key emotions you'd expect to see in a man who has already lost everything dear to him and has nothing else left to lose, perfectly. He plays Eric with vulnerability, sadness, rage, a thirst for vengeance and just the right amount of child-like mischievousness of someone who knows he can can basically do whatever he wants with no consequences. I couldn't do a review of The Crow without mentioning Ernie Hudson, who plays my favourite character, Police Officer Albrecht who aids Eric on his quest for vengeance. He provides the 'every man' perspective and occasional comic relief.In any other genre, having one-dimensional villains can really weaken a film but as this is a revenge fantasy it isn't necessary to know how the villains came to be or what they do when they're not being scumbags. The main villain, mob boss Top Dollar, alludes to having tragedy in his past but ultimately falls into the category of "man who just wants to watch the world burn" (to quote another movie featuring a man with a painted face who also died in tragic circumstances).The story of Eric and Shelly's relationship is told through the use of flashbacks and it's a pity we don't get to see more of them together on screen. I never had any trouble believing they were in love, it just would have been nice to see.</fullReview>

Seriously it was so devastating to hear that Brandon Lee tragically died during filming, because he was just so excellent as an actor. Even his stunts were brilliant and he doesn't need to be compared to other stunt legend like his father Bruce Lee or even Jackie Chan, he is just himself really in this. He was so young to die at 28 even! I feel this movie is very underrated because I never heard it before nor it was even gotten big awards like an Emmy, Oscar, golden globes,etc. I mean c'mon it should've!

		<shortDescription>The Crow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew about this film because of the Gothic image of the leading actor, but more so because of the tragedy that occurred on set, I had to see if it was a worthwhile watch, and directed by Alex Proyas (I, Robot; Knowing). Basically in Detroit, Michigan, poetic guitarist and rock musician Eric Draven (Brandon Lee, Bruce's son) and his fiancée Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) are to be married the day after Devil's Night, the night before Halloween, but Shelly is raped and beaten by thugs of city crime boss Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), while Eric is shot and pushed out of a window. A year later, in the cemetery, a crow lands on Eric's headstone, some of these birds have the power to bring the dead back to life, it taps on the stone, this awakens Eric from his grave, the bird guides him through the city to prepare himself. Eric, now also known as The Crow, has not only been granted life again, he has been given the ability to heal from any fatal injury, he is setting out to get revenge for the brutal murder of his fiancée. The crow leads him to the killers: knife thrower Tin Tin (Laurence Mason), drug addict and dealer Funboy (Michael Massee), car buff T-Bird (Commando's David Patrick Kelly), and the unsophisticated Skank (Angel David), he is determined to give them a taste of their own medicine. However leader and world-class crime lord Top Dollar, with bodyguard Grange (Tony Todd) by his side, will dispatch his enemies with a Japanese sword and make a joke about these kills, of course he soon learn of The Crow's invincibility and suffer the consequences of the legend and vigilante. Also starring Ghostbusters' Ernie Hudson as Sergeant Albrecht, Rochelle Davis as Sarah, Bai Ling as Myca, Jon Polito as Gideon, Anna Levine as Darla, Bill Raymond as Mickey and Marco Rodríguez as Torres. Lee has a recognisable image with the goth make up and does well as the rock musician brought back to life and getting vengeance, the tragic irony was that Lee was killed on set by a prop gun that was meant to fire a blank, this being his final performance will always be the one that everyone knows. As for the film itself, it is a simple enough vigilante going against crime lords and thugs, but being based on a comic book it is given a paranormal (almost zombie) and Gothic twist, there are just enough engaging sequences and bloody sequences to keep you going, overall it is a worthwhile action fantasy. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greek Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Revenge is sweet, especially if you have already been dead for a year. Alex Proyas has made some amazing dark films, and The Crow is no exception. The eponymous bird acts like the narrator in Greek tragedy, guiding the un-dead main character face to face with those who brutally murdered him and his wife in a dark and forlorn city full of Gothic churches, dark streets, car-swallowing rivers...The film is hyper-violent, and so it is not for everyone. Even more disconcerting is the fact that Brandon Lee (son of Bruce Lee, famous for martial arts) was accidentally shot to death during his protagonist's death scene. A mix up with an uncharged bullet getting stuck and a live blank without a bullet being fired subsequently cost him his life, with the .44 Magnum seen in the film. I was in Wilmington NC a couple of years ago, and learned that the scene was filmed there. It sent a shiver down my spine, although Wilmington is a nice little town.The Crow is a tragedy in the Greek sense for many of its themes: the love for your soul mate, the inevitable justice of revenge, the drama of the high falling. I was wavering between a 7 and 8, but in the end, the vision of this film rises to the quality of one of a film that defines or re-defines its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert! R.I.P. Brandon Lee, you will be missed but not Forgot! I absolutely liked Brandon Lee as an actor and in my opinion I think he was a better actor than his father, but martial arts wise he wasn't. I liked this film though because it shows how crazy and wild Brandon could act. It also proved how scary he could be at times. I mean the way he glares at Tin Tin as he's walking up to him is just scary and intimidating. If I was him I thing I would of ran or killed myself. Anyway this film was a typical revenge film like the Punisher but this time the character is brought back from the dead and could see through the vision of a crow. I think my favorite part of the entire film is the end fight on the roof because it is quite emotional and at the same time it is awesome! I give it a 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know Brandon Lee died during filming but still it feels like they closed a door.This is a very interesting movie that has really gotten me thinking for the past 12 hours. What would I do if I were Eric and had a short time to come back? Who would I go to? Who would I talk to? Especially with the way that Brandon Lee plays the character, its just as if I have so many new ideas that have come to life. Thats a bad thing at the same time. They opened a door to new ideas, then just stood there and didn't make anything come to life.I really like the plot and the main idea of the movie. All actors played their roles very well and especially Brandon Lee and the young girl. I mean you don't see many pre-teens that know how to act but she did an incredible job; especially considering the rarity of kid actors being of any quality above cheesy. But, like I state in my review title, it feels like this idea can be opened up to so much more and has been cut short. Yes, i know the protagonist passed away during filming and they didn't want to shove another guy in his position, but it feels like there is so much more that not only the film but the main idea. It seems as though they had cut it short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cult Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow is a film that may be best known for the death of actor Brandon Lee during production. But somehow that unfortunate death does not hamper the overall movie. This movie is a poetic film that sails like the wind and brings forth several genres including horror, action, and romance. For one, I feel like this film is a more violent reincarnation of Batman. Our main character, Eric Draven, resembles Batman in more ways than one although he is not considered a superhero. Alex Proya's first feature is about a man named Eric Draven who was murdered along with his fiancée. One year later, he returns from the dead to bring revenge to the killers, with the help of a hypnotic crow. Once a crime lord hears existence of Eric, things may get a little interesting. Brandon Lee was fantastic here in this film. As the son of Bruce Lee, he already had the acting genes and it's a darn shame he died, because he could have had a long career. Ernie Hudson was very good as the cop who takes side with Eric. Overall, The Crow is a cult classic, but one that should have been an instant classic. It's a dark, brooding film but it is also a captivating film. It's not a superhero movie, but I can't help but the call the comparisons between this film and Batman. It's a melodic action film and the tampered production luckily did not bring the film down. It is a must-see for action/horror fans.My Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the comic book created by James O'Barr. The Crow stars Brandon Lee as rock star Eric Draven, who, precisely one year after his murder, returns from the grave to take revenge on the vicious criminals responsible for the rape and death of his fiancée and his own untimely demise.The basic plot for this supernatural thriller is rather simplistic, holding very few surprises and delivering little in the way of genuine suspense, but a poetic screenplay charged with dark romanticism, a terrific cast (Michael Wincott is particularly memorable as head villain Top Dollar) and extremely stylish direction from Alex Proyas ensure that the film is far from forgettable. Proyas, a prolific music video director, nails the comic book aesthetic, delivering a stream of impressive visuals, with grandiose, sweeping cinematography, stunning lighting, and incredible set design, all steeped in Gothic neo-noir atmosphere and set to a cool alt-rock soundtrack.Brandon, son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, gives a charismatic central performance, and would most likely have become a major star in his own right had his life not been tragically cut short by an accidental shooting on the set of this movie, a fact that only goes to make the finished article an even more tragic and haunting experience.</fullReview>

Roger Ebert wrote "At times the film looks like a violent music video, all image and action, no content. If it had developed more story and characterization, however, it might not have had quite the same success in evoking a world where the bizarre reality, not the story, is the point." The story is a basically about revenge from beyond the grave, and how true love is forever. An extremely moving film that I would recommend to anyone who has a heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Crow' is one of those rare films that is tragic and brilliant all at the same time. It's a great story/action movie to start with, but has the added tragedy of being Brandon Lee's last film, as he died on set during the making.Now only is it rare for a 'revenge movie' to be so perfect, but it's also based on a comic book. Before Marvel finally cracked how to make a successful comic book adaptation with its Avengers series, it was rare for anything to live up to its source material. Here, we meet Eric Draven, a rock star who was murdered brutally along with his girlfriend, Shelley Webster. Now, one year later, a mysterious crow brings him back to life to seek revenge on those nasties who wronged him.The plot isn't anything special, but the way that it's executed is. The characters are all spot on - Brandon Lee especially, as he shows that he's more than just someone who can kick people over. But all the cast are equally excellent. You'll root for the goodies and cheer when the baddies naturally fall one by one.Then you have the whole Gothic ambiance. This may not be for everyone. On the rare occasions I hear people criticising The Crow, it's because it's 'a film for Goths.' Well, The Cure do to an excellent song or two for the film and yes, it is more than just a little moody, but I think you don't have to paint your fingernails black to appreciate this one. If you like your revenge thrillers moody, brutal and full of action, then this one's for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A missed anti-hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one movie that will be forever known as the late Brandon Lee's best movie, it is this one. Sadly, the son of famous martial arts master Bruce Lee, would too suffer from a fatal injury on set, leading to his untimely death before this cult classic was released. What's completely astonishing though, is how well this movie was put together even after Lee's death. One would almost think that Lee only had died after the filming, but not so. There were several edits, body doubles and even CGI used to make it look like Lee was in whole film throughout. For 1994, that's extremely impressive. But this isn't the only outstanding thing to this comic book movie. There's very little to nit pick about.The story is about Eric Draven, a regular everyday man who witnesses the brutal rape and murder of his wife to-be and is killed off as well. This all happens during Halloween (or Devil's Night as its called) in a crime ridden city where buildings are set ablaze just for fun. A year later, Draven is resurrected by a single crow to take vengeance upon the people who took his and wife's life that same night. In the simplest of terms, it is a revenge story, but the execution is done in such a way that gives depth to each character on screen. Alex Proyas, who begins his directorial debut here, keeps a steady pace as well. Of course, the person who carries majority of the entertainment is Brandon Lee.Brandon Lee as Eric Draven gives a performance that feels natural. His delivery of lines are not over-the-top campy, nor are they boring. His voice allows the character to sound serious or kind whenever it is needed. The costume design is also great looking as well. It matches not only the Gothic tone, but also the whole design as a comic book movie. Attempting to understand Draven's case is Sergeant Albrecht (Ernie Hudson). Hudson is one of those actors who most viewers enjoy in whatever film he stars in because of how relaxed he comes across. The main villain behind Devil's Night is called Top Dollar (Michael Wincott) who also gives a performance that is precise with his delivery. He's an anarchist, so all he wants is chaos, thus creating Devil's Night.The violence portrayed here is another strong point. There's no plotting or brooding. All it is, is pure vengeance and no holds bar. It's taking care of business with no thinking which is beneficial to this kind of revenge film. That and the dialog used throughout each scene makes the revenge feel that much more justified. What's surprising, is how it feels like this is the movie that inspired other anti-hero films to do the same kind of theatrics. For example, having an outline symbol lit by flames? The Punisher (2004) and Daredevil (2003) performed those same types of moves during their moments of payback. The Crow (1994) is still the antihero that started it all and should be given respected for that.The special effects have aged rather well too. With most of the background being dark with either black or grey, it's difficult to see what was enhanced by computer and what wasn't. The crows themselves are hard to distinguish between actor and CGI. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is neat with panning shots of the city that'll make the viewer feel like they are the crow in the sky gliding across the landscape. Wolski would later do all the cinematography for all the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The editing is also competently done considering it looks like Lee was on set for the whole movie even though he died during filming. The only thing that could've been slightly fixed was the music. Graeme Revell's score does contain a soft reoccurring theme, which focuses that on Draven's humanity and love for his wife with gentle flutes. Revell's music also contains saxophone, which is rare for an action film but it works. It makes it feel like a film noir in some senses. Yet, the score lacks any real action cues, other than tribal drums, which make it feel empty in some cases. Also, it's understood that the movie has a Gothic tone but including metal bands in a few scenes wasn't necessary either. Instead Revell could've included tunes that particularly enhanced them with more power and emotion. Other than that, there really isn't anything to truly be upset about. It's one of those rare, dark comic book adaptations that any comic book reader should watch.Although it was Brandon Lee's last film, it's one of his best. The action is dark, special effects look good and the actors pitch great performances. It's Graeme Revell's score that could use some improvement although it is still a special element to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Outstandingly Rich Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally watched The Crow, and even though I was aware of its reputation going in, I was still deeply impressed by what a rich, well-crafted and darkly beautiful film it is. Violent and tragic, but also poetic and passionate. Certainly worthy of high esteem.Like many of the best films, The Crow draws energy from a very simple, powerful theme, but does not rely on just one character. Brandon Lee is fantastic in the title role, but I was surprised to discover a terrific group of supporting players, from the police to the villains. And the same goes for the story--there are small details written into this film that add extra dimensions. That's one of the marks of a well-written film--not just coasting on a gimmick, but telling a story that is clearly part of a greater world. The Crow has this quality in spades.The one other thing that I have to mention is that, while in many ways this film shares an aesthetic with Tim Burton's Batman films, i.e. darkly Gothic set pieces and so forth, it is impossible to look at Brandon Lee and not see how clearly his character design here influenced the Heath Ledger Joker in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. It's uncanny. Beyond that, one can look at The Crow and see its fingerprints all over many other subsequent films. Very influential, this, and no doubt one of the best films of its type that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Urban Gothic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to ponder whether or not The Crow would have received such a strong cult following if not for Brandon Lee's tragic death in the middle of the filming. It certainly bestows a certain aura of gloom over the entire film, and keeping in mind that this is supposed to a dark and brutal story about lost love and need for revenge, this is in no way a bad thing.To answer my original question, yes, I think it would have become just as popular over time had Lee survived. Because it's just such a splendid film. It's also a movie that's hard to categorize. It certainly has elements of horror in it, mostly in the visuals and the general atmosphere, but calling it just a macabre horror story seems lacking. There are elements of fantasy and mystery in it, even thriller, but even those four genres don't define it completely. Luckily, over time people have come up with terms to describe it, and one of those, namely urban Gothic, for me describes it perfectly. It's a Gothic horror fantasy story given a modern setting and twist. It deals with the themes love and loss, both of which interlock. One fuels the other and vice versa. It's a story about settling scores, giving in to your need for revenge, eye for an eye, yet it treats such a theme with sadness and melancholy, keeping in mind the human underneath the monster.It's such a shame that Brandon Lee passed away so early in his career, because this film would have launched him into stardom. His performance is everything it needs to be. He can shift from a screaming madman into a lonely, heartbroken poet faster than you can blink and every scene he is in, he absolutely dominates. Luckily the villains are able to match his performance. Michael Wincott's Top Dollar is a great main villain for this film. He's just as crazed and threatening as Lee's Eric Draven, but in a completely different way. He's a monster because he chooses to be one, not because he has been driven to become one. The secondary villains are also a delightfully mad bunch of idiots, killers and nutjobs, fitting perfectly into their world.The Crow is an unforgettable experience. It switches between blazing action, subtle emotions and heart-wrenching drama with such skill that it's no wonder it has become so popular over the years. If you like dark films with mystical elements, then this is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brandon Lee is The Crow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Crow" is absolutely one of the best comic book movies ever made. This is before we have other great comic book movies such as "Sin City," "The Avengers," or "The Dark Knight" Trilogy. "The Crow" is very much a revenge story of a man who lost the love of his life and now takes on a gang of thugs for all the things that took from him. Brandon Lee is the Crow and it is sad that he died during the making of this movie, and it would've been interesting to hear his thoughts on the movie if he was still alive today. He has given an amazing performance and this is the movie that he shall always be remembered. Ernie Hudson and the rest of the other cast did great for their performance. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is beautifully shot for its style of a comic book movie. Same goes to the production design of this movie, which it does look like a cross mixture between Tim Burton's "Batman" and Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner." I do enjoy Graeme Revell's score and the songs that were selected for the movie. Alex Proyas does a fantastic job for directing this movie as well as his other movie "Dark City." There is not a whole lot more to say except that "The Crow" is dark, edgy, and entertaining. I give this movie a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than what it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The nineties. Not the best decade for comic book adaptations. Richard Donners Superman did well in the seventies and Tim Burtons Batman got the tone for the Dark Knight right near the end of the eighties. This could have been what made the studios see the potential for big bucks in turning stories of the sequential art into something a little bit more cinematic back then. Not many comic book movies made this era turned out well though. This movie however was an exception. While many other movies made this era only (or mostly) survived by being so bad that they were good, this one respected the story and tone of the work it was based on and met success. Though possibly not only for its quality, something I'll get to later.The story: Rock musician Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his fiancée Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) gets attacked and killed by a gang on a dark October night. One year later Eric rises from his grave, now undead and guided by a mysterious crow. He remembers what happened one year ago, on that fateful night, and the faces of his murderers and starts to take his revenge on them one by one until he reaches the top of the lowlifes, their boss, Top Dollar (brilliantly played by Michael Wincott).This was Brandon Lee's last movie. During filming a gun that had not been properly prepared was fired at him and what was intended to be an ordinary, fictional death scene turned out be a quite real one. Still, after a while, the movie was finished with a few rewrites and a few scenes recorded with Brandons face digitally placed on a body double. There has been some changes to the original story from the comic book, but they are small (and in some cases an improvement).The overall tone is kept and the movie respects the material on which it is based. It dares to be dark in a decade where most comic book movies at their darkest were like Batman Forever. It's not just dark "because it's cool", but because it fits the story and theme. A darkness that knows the right time to step aside and let some humanity seep in. In retrospect the story is very simple, the bad guys does not seem like more than a bunch of two-dimensional troublemakers who likes to cause mayhem for the sake of mayhem and at it's core it's an ordinary revenge story (with a bit of supernatural thrown in). But it's a little bit more than that. In the hands of someone else it could have been just another revenge-movie and nothing (or not much) more. But thankfully the writers David J Schow and John Shirley, the director Alex Proyas and Brandon Lee gave it that little extra. It's not just about revenge but also about losing and finding one's way and finding glimmers of light in the darkness. Michael Wincott's performance as Top Dollar should not go unmentioned either as it is very memorable. There is a little extra depth to his character with his doubts, thoughts about death and a scene where he monologues about how he, over the years, has lost a little bit of passion for his work. Brandon Lee does a good job at balancing between being consumed by revenge but at the same time trying to hold on to his humanity. A minor complaint about the movie would be that one of the characters at one point becomes a damsel in distress. something typical that we've seen before and something the movie, up to that point, managed to avoid. But like I said, it's a minor complaint and the actress playing her is good.One can not help to wonder if this movie could have been just as successful (or at least have a similar success) without the death of the main star. I like to think that it could. Because there's more to it than what it could have been, had it not been made by someone who knew how to give it that little extra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An atypical revenge thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is a strange looking but still beautifully made film about a rock star, Eric Draven (Brandon Lee), who's murdered and his fiancé, Shelly Webster, who was beaten, raped and later dies in an intensive care unit. The two are killed on Devil's Night, October 30, the night before their wedding by T-Bird and his gang on orders from Detroit drug lord Top Dollar (Michael Wincott). Devil's Night in Detroit, according to this movie is a night of crime and rampant acts of arson committed by gangs like T-Bird's who use arson as a way of destroying evidence and intimidating people. A year after he is killed, Eric returns from the grave to seek vengeance for his and Shelley's murders. Dressed in dark ragged clothing and Hellequin make-up, as The Crow, Eric seems to be impervious to gunshots and have near superhuman strength. He's guided by a crow, a supernatural symbol of death and perhaps salvation or transcendence, that allows him to track the movements of his enemies. Eric's death and undead mission of vengeance intersect with the lives Sergeant Albrecht and Sarah. Sgt. Albrecht was a first responding police officer who stayed with Shelley while she was in intensive care until she died. Sarah was a skater girl who's neglectful junkie mother caused her to spend much of her time with Eric and Shelley when she wasn't skateboarding. Both of them were directly affected by Eric and Shelley's deaths, and later help Eric's quest for revenge. Eric's makeup and dress were influenced by English goth rock as seen in Crow creator James O'Barr's source comic material, in particular Bauhaus lead singer Peter Murphy. James O'Barr's own loss of his fiancé to a drunk driver and love of goth rock inspired the story. Alex Proyas, a director who came to movies from a short film and music video background, does an excellent job of making Detroit look like a smoky empty industrial wasteland (which it sadly is) that was also strangely beautiful and appealing. Great entertaining film for action film who want some substance to their viewing or even Bruce Lee connoisseurs who want to see the kind of superstar potential Brandon Lee possessed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Stylish And Haunting Comic Book Adaptation And A Classic With A Brilliant,Unforgettable Final Performance From Brandon Lee(RIP).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow is an excellent,stylish and haunting classic and one of the greatest Comic Book films ever made that's filled amazing direction,a brilliant,unforgettable final performance from Brandon Lee,a great cast,thrilling Action,beautiful photography,a terrific score and Rock soundtrack. All of those elements make The Crow a Cult Classic and a powerful movie experience.Based on James O'Barr Comic Book Series and Comic Strip and set in Detroit,Michigan,The Crow tells the story of Eric Draven(Brandon Lee),a rock musician who along with his fiancée Shelly(Sofia Shinas)were assaulted and murdered by a group of thugs on Devil's Night,the night before Halloween. A year later after the murder,Eric is brought back from the grave to get revenge on the killers who murdered him and his fiancée and wants vengeance at all costs.Released in 1994,The Crow is brilliant and powerful film that came out a year after the tragic death of Brandon Lee(the son of the late,great legendary Martial Arts/Kung-Fu Icon Bruce Lee)who died on the set after an unfortunate accident while making the film. Although Brandon Lee's death loomed over the movie,The Crow became a critical and box office success and also became a Cult Film thanks to Brandon Lee's final performance and is seen as one of the best Comic Book films ever made. The Crow is an amazing film that right from the beginning pulls into a dark,Gothic nightmare that is grim and gloomy and looks like a Graphic novel coming to life with beauty and ugliness but is also a movie that is Action-packed and visually stunning and when you see The Crow the first time it will blow your mind. The Crow is a film that deals with themes such as tragedy,death,revenge and love which gives the movie a sadness that surrounds the film's atmosphere as well as the characters which gives The Crow depth and substance. Another thing I love about The Crow is the style and look of the movie thanks to the beautiful camera work and lighting by Dariusz Wolski. Wolski's photography and lighting gives The Crow a great and unique look that is in the style of Film Noir and Dystopian with rainy streets and buildings that are in the dark with the movie almost giving the film a timeless quality that combines the look of Tim Burton's Batman and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner because with The Crow you as a viewer don't know if it's the past,present or future. The Crow is also in the style of Film Noir with the characters attitudes which are cynical and bleak with no happy ending satisfaction. The main character Eric Draven is one of the best characters in a comic book film because even though Draven is back from the dead and looking for revenge he has depth and sympathy while having good(Draven's time with Shelly)and bad memories(him and Shelly's murder)which gives Draven and the film great power because what The Crow tells viewers even when you're dead a person still has a memory. Eric Draven is a character who represents the dark and gloomy tone and when he is off the screen you can feel Draven's presence because he represents violence,death and darkness. Eric Draven is a incredible character that you will never forget and is a character that will forever be a Cult icon and a classic anti hero that is timeless and for the ages. The Action scenes in The Crow are fantastic and done with a great pace and style which is fierce and at times brutal but if you are an Action movie lover the Action will have you foaming at the mouth and will keep glued to the screen with Action scenes of intensity,great excitement and explosive thrills. The ending of The Crow is amazing, beautiful and bittersweet because with the ending you will feel happy and sad for Eric Draven. A great conclusion.The whole cast is terrific. Brandon Lee is excellent and unforgettable as Eric Draven,with Lee bringing depth,sadness and charisma to the performance. R.I.P Brandon Lee,you and your acting talent were gone too soon. Rochelle Davis is wonderful as Sarah,Eric's friend. Ernie Hudsen is terrific as Sergeant Albrecht,a cop that helps Eric. Michael Wincott is amazing as Top Dollar,a local crime boss. Anna Thomson is fantastic as Darla,Sarah's drug addicted Mother. David Patrick Kelly(T-Bird),Angel David(Skank),Laurence Mason(Tin Tin)and Michael Masse(Funboy)do great jobs as Top Dollar's henchmen. Jon Polito is outstanding and funny as Gideon,a pawn shop owner. Sofia Shinas is beautiful and memorable as Shelly,Eric's fiancé. Tony Todd(Grange),Bai Ling(Myca) and Marco Rodriguez(Torres)give good performances as well. The direction by Alex Ployas is brilliant and stylish,with Ployas always moving the camera giving the film a dark and grim visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Ployas.The score by Graeme Revell is terrific,haunting and unforgettable and adds to the tone of the film. Great score,Revell. There is also an amazing soundtrack with songs by Nine Inch Nails(Dead Souls),Stone Temple Pilots(Big Empty),The Cure(Burn),Pantera(The Badge),Rage Against The Machine(Darkness),Rollins Band(Ghostrider),Medicine(Time Baby III)and more. Fantastic soundtrack.In final word,if you love Action Films or Comic Book Movies,I highly suggest you see The Crow,an excellent,stylish Comic adaptation and classic that you can watch again and again and belongs in every movie lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware the revenge of The Crow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Crow" is adapted from James O'Barr's 1989 graphic novel. It's not the first movie made by Alex Proyas (his debut was an obscure arty post-holocaust film "Spirits of the Air, Gremlins of the Clouds" from 1989) , but it's the one movie that made him famous and promised a great things in the future from Proyas . Along with "The Dark city" it's still his best movie , despite it's been almost 20 years since it's premiere. At it's heart it's a simple revenge movie told with lot of mood . It has soul and it's one of best comic book movies.Alex Proyas is a former music video director and it shows here . The movie resembles an rock video . There is a lot of rock songs in the background , the main hero is an ex-rockstar , the whole movie feels like a energetic video clip. "The Crow" is a dark movie with black and white easily dominating the screen. It's not a black and white movie , yet other colors are lifeless , well fitting with the overall mood of the movie. "The Crow" easily draws you in it's world , into this unnamed city and it's residents. The Gothic architecture reminds of Tim Burton's "Batman". The grotesque parody of clown makeup on Brandon Lee's face feels strangely familiar to Heath Ledger's joker in "The Dark knight". There are more similarities between two actors ? both movies are great , they both died in suspicious circumstances at the peek of their careers , both actors and movies gained a massive cult following.Brandon Lee gives a good performance . It's not as amazing as Ledger's and definitely not an Oscar material , yet it is obviously his best performance and proof that he had potential to become a real legend. The movie is dedicated to Brandon and Eliza. Eliza Hutton is a fiancée of Brandon . They were to have been married less than two weeks after the film wrapped. It's obvious that "The Crow" attracted attention in the media because of Brandon Lee's tragic death . The story about a youth brutally killed in his prime so ironically reflected events in real life. Keith David gives a good support as the experienced cop and friend of Eric. The action set-pieces are immensely exciting . Instead of typical summer blockbuster one ? liners we have lines like : "Mother is the name of God on every child's lips," "Little things used to mean so much to Shelly. I used to think they were trivial. Believe me, nothing is ever trivial." Quite poetic.My advice ? don't listen to all those rumors about Brandon's death or his father's , Bruce Lee death too . Just enjoy this movie . A well crafted arty entertainment. Watch this and don't waste your time on the lame sequels. I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crows RevengeThis movie begins on a dark night in Detroit. The Crow , Shelly Webster (Sofia Shenas) and Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) are engaged to be married the next day on Devils Night, Halloween, the night of fires, vandalism, and crime. Unfortunately that day never came for them. Shelly was raped and murdered for trying to get a petition to help rid the neighborhood of people that weren't contributing to society and that were making it worse. Eric was also killed. One year after their deaths, Eric came back to life as the crow to seek revenge for Shelly's death. The crow makes Eric somewhat invincible to getting hurt or killed while getting the justice that is deserved. The theme of this film seems to be revenge and justice. I feel the directors of this film, Daniel J. Schow and Alex Proyas, are trying to show that even in the darkest of times and bleakness of the night justice can prevail. One must fight to make it happen though. Although Draven was turned into the crow, he still had limitations to his invincibility. The crow followed Eric around the city and was there at the times that Tin-Tin, Fun Boy and T-Bird were brought to their final doom. If the crow was hurt Eric was inevitably hurt also. Justice doesn't always come easy and it's something we have to be willing to fight for. I'm personally attracted to this film for several reasons. One being the way justice is served, another being the love between Shelly and Eric. Eric loved her so much that he was willing to die for her and bring her death to justice; their love as to die for. This film also has a certain attraction to it because it is somewhat of a thriller. It keeps us on edge and captivated. The darkness and costumes bring a certain mysterious quality to it also. Brandon Lee's skills as an actor also bring an attraction to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film portrays a young rock guitarist who comes back from the dead to avenge the murders of himself and his fiancée. Even as a kid I always enjoyed watching it, as I found Lee's Crow to be easily watchable and I couldn't help but sympathize with the character, thanks to Lee's performance. He truly shined as the character, and captured what James O' Barr worked hard to create in his graphic novels. The atmosphere of the film was damn perfect, and even though some of the dialogue was a bit hit-and-miss(Mainly Rochelle Davis as Sarah), the cast worked and went great together. Michael Wincott as 'Top Dollar' was easily one of the best villains interpreted on-screen, and had some of the best dialogue and scenes besides Lee. To touch up a bit about Brandon Lee as The Crow, the way Lee portrayed the title character was what made the film so great, with his powerful yet gentle charismatic presence, he made one of the best superheroes to ever hit the screen. The action in the film was alright, but without the film's good performances, it might not have carried as well. The direction of the film was practically flawless, and everything clicked just fine. Alex Proyas as director of the film was a fine choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the question were put to you, would you "go gently into that good night"? What if you weren't given the choice and, instead, were left with the more grisly task of balancing the scales? Would you take it?It's Mischief Night, or Devil's Night as it's referred to in this film, in Detroit and the night before musician Eric Draven (played by Brandon Lee) and Shelley Webster (played by Sofia Shinas) are to be married. Then, thanks to their efforts to fight eviction for themselves and their fellow tenants, their home is broken into. The invaders toss Draven (Lee) through a window and send him plummeting to the ground three stories below and savage his bride-to-be. The first officer on the scene is Sgt. Albrecht (played by Ernie Hudson) and when Shelley asks about her fiancée, he spares her the truth and tells her he's fine. Then, when the latchkey kid that Eric and Shelley have taken under their wing stumbles upon the scene, Albrecht relays the lie once again. The child, Sarah (played by Rochelle Davis who also acts as the film's narrator), sees through the sergeant's reassuring fiction and departs soon after. Flash-forward one year, Sarah is visiting the graveyard where Shelly and Eric have been laid to rest and encounters a crow. After she'd left, the crow begins tapping on Eric's headstone with his beak. Then, that night, Eric emerges from his grave, shaking and traumatized. He returns to the apartment that he and Shelley once shared and finds that it is a ruin of the home he knew. While there, he begins experiencing flashbacks of the night one year before when he lost everything. Seeing the men responsible, who call themselves T-Bird (played by David Patrick Kelly), Tin-Tin (played by Laurence Mason), Funboy (played by Michael Massee), and Skank (played by Angel David). Still reeling from those memories, Eric grabs onto the frame that once held the apartment's only window and swings out and back in. He notices that he's cut himself on remnants on the window but, to his surprise, he heals almost immediately. With this new gift, he dons all black clothes, decorates his face in the style of a harlequin mask that was on the floor of his home, and sets out to seek revenge with the crow as his guide.I cannot adequately express how much I love this movie. The tone, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the antagonists. Everything about this movie is top-drawer. Fans of the graphic novel of the same name that inspired the film say that the master criminal in the film, known as Top Dollar in the novel and not actually given a name in the film, was far more ordinary than the evil genius Michael Wincott portrayed. Other critics say that the death of Brandon Lee gave this film a legacy it didn't earn, much the same way that critics claim Heath Ledger's death before the release of The Dark Knight added anticipation it wouldn't have gotten otherwise. As I was only ten when the film was first released, I was not aware of the film itself or Lee's death until much later. What I will say is that I cannot watch this film enough. Even so, if you haven't seen The Crow, shame on you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crow ? Revenge from beyond the grave on a human level and emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow is by now a cult movie. Although it's getting a bit old for some of its special effects, it's still excellent.The soundtrack, especially the music, is exceptional. It's edgy, dark, and the emotions it stirs get you in the guts. It's a mirror image of the story. The revenge theme, certainly isn't new, not even one from beyond the grave, but the angle chosen here, is quite different. It's touching.You get a great mix of action, emotional drama, ghostly romance, and human relations, often dark and twisted, other times simple or basic. The sets are very dark and strongly Gothic. The acting is not perfect, but still strong and just.There are a few mistakes, not big, but at times noticeable, like some bad sound pickups. However, they seem to make the film into some sort of archaic rendition, which really works to its advantage.I recommend it if you don't mind its age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It can't rain all the time," says Eric "The Crow" Draven.Obviously, he's not visited Seattle.Picture it, Phoenix, AZ, Black Friday, 2012. I ventured through the Fry's Electronics for BluRays when all of a sudden, I notice The Crow's on sale for $5. It's a steal for a movie I've only seen once in the mid-1990s that I recall liking. I'm so glad I picked up this film.With just a few obstacles, this movie is fantastic. Great action, good story, genuine heart, special effects well-done and one of the best cinematic soundtracks that came from the 1990s, The Crow makes for a great ride from beginning to end. And magically, it holds up solidly today.Rocker ? though that's completely incidental ? Eric Draven is resurrected from a thug-life death to avenge his sweetheart's brutal murder by means of a crow's guidance, no less.Seriously, that is the entire synopsis of this story, even though there's a little more.Now, that "more" is sometimes meh, mostly clichéd, even for 1990s standards, but it's interesting nonetheless. Especially, secondary character, Sarah (played wonderfully by Rochelle Davis,) who's yearning for a real role model, or the fantastic Michael Wincott as, ah-hem, "Top Dollar." You could also include the great graphics and at times fun dialogue.Now?here goes: I understand making this dark. The 1990s were all about the dark, but this was, for about 50%, too dark. And I'm even talking about on BluRay. I get mood and I get they were trying to cover-up the stand-in for the unfortunate incident that took Brandon Lee's life (during filming) way too short, but at times, I felt like I rolled over on the remote and turned off the TV and let the speakers guide me through the scene.In addition, the movie kinda started off a little silly, with how quickly a completely disoriented newly reanimated Draven learns to be a super-hero. And don't get me started on why (the HELL) he would quote "The Raven" as an introduction at one point. If I were his victim, I wouldn't be able to get past that when Draven asked for what he wanted.Anyhoo, it's an extremely fun movie that, despite its clichés and shortcomings, is a thrill ride with an abundance of great action sequences, an absolute killer soundtrack and one of the best movie lines of all time: "It can't rain all the time."After only seeing this once before, I still use that line to date. It sums up a lot of situations we feel are too heavy with our daily lives.And don't ask me about the Lee-less sequels?I dunno ? I haven't seen them, nor have any definite plans to watch them. I just know this was a treasure, I'm glad I got it and I can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie and can't say anything bad about it at all. I have always tried to spot the scenes in which digital effects were used to "add" Brandon into the scenes. The effects team did an outstanding job adding the various elements to the film and bring Brandon "back to life." When i learned of the tragedy I was devastated. i was even a bit scared that the film would never be released.This film is Brandon Lee's legacy. i am happy to see that it has so many fans and that the film was well received by audiences even after Brandon's shocking death. However, I am a bit fearful to hear that a "remake" is in the works? "gulp" I guess I just have to wait and see :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"People once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. But sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest. Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right." That was my original title for this review but it was declared too long.On March 31st, 1993, Brandon Lee died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. The film required a scene with a 44. Magnum. 2 crew members who were inexperienced and pressed for time decided to buy live ammunition and empty the gunpowder themselves. While test firing the gun they had heard a loud popping noise. The noise was the metal tip of a bullet getting lodged in the barrel of the gun and was left there for 2 weeks. When it came time to shoot the scene, actor Micheal Masse was given the weapon and accidentally shot Brandon Lee where he was taken to the hospital and died 12-13 hours later.The film is about rock musician Eric Draven played by the late great Brandon Lee is brutally murdered and a year later is brought back from the dead to avenge his and his fiancée Shelly Webster played by Sofia Shinas. His Targets are T-Bird played by David Patrick Kelly, Funboy played by Micheal Masse, Tin-Tin played by Lawrence Mason, the name that rhymes with Hank but starts with "Sk" played by Angel David, Top Dollar played by Micheal Wincott and Top Dollar's Sister Myca played by Bai Ling. Eric has support from Sergant Albrect played by Winston From Ghostbusters, Ernie Hudson and the 14 year old girl named Sarah played by Rochelle Davis.This is by far the best comic book movie ever made. The Gothic style and aspect are great, The acting is phenomenal, The violence is glorified and of course a great last performance from Brandon Lee. Lee haunts every frame of the movie that he is in. For some reason his death always stuck to me. Maybe it was that tragic and I could not forget it. But he will forever live on as a legend like his father Bruce Lee. A perfect last film for a great actor(Brandon Lee).Dedicatd To Brandon Lee 1965-1993.Rated R For A Great Amount Of Strong Violence And Language, And For Drug Use And Some Sexuality.1hr 37min/97min.48 uses of the F-word.****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film but give the follow ups a miss!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I followed the making of this film quite closely after the lead star Brandon Lee was tragically killed during the making of the film. It happened when a gun used to fire live rounds was then used to fire blanks during a scene with Brandon Lee. The gun wasn't cleaned and checked correctly and it was discovered that a round that had been previously fired had failed to fire correctly. The bullet lodged in the barrel and remained there until the gun was used with blank rounds. The force of the blank firing was enough to propel the bullet out of the barrel and fatally wounded Brandon Lee. This led to many changes in the use of firearms on set, sadly however these changes were too late and the movie world lost a truly great rising star.The film is ironically about the murder of the character played by Brandon Lee. He then comes back from the grave to avenge his death and the brutal rape and murder of his girlfriend Shelly by a gang.The film is a masterpiece and visually stunning. It is a very dark film and the visuals portray this extremely well. The cast includes Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson &amp; Michael Wincott. The acting is great from most of the cast with very over the top performances by the gang members and a near perfect stand out performance by Brandon Lee. Having only seen him in action martial arts movies prior to this his acting ability really stands out here and shows what potential he had.This is a really good film and knowing the background into the death of the lead actor helps to bring a sense of reality to it. However without the tragic accident this is still a great film. More fantasy than horror it has a great story that really draws you in and doesn't let go until the end.Unfortunately someone decided the film needed some very poor sequels! However a short lived TV series was made using the original characters and it was actually quite good.If you have never seen this please give it a go, it's a great film but give the follow ups a miss!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A poetic guitarist Eric Draven is brought back to life by a crow a year after he and his fiancée are murdered.The crow guides him through the land of the living, and leads him to his killers: knife thrower Tin-tin, drug-tec Funboy, car buff T-Bird, and the unsophisticated Skank.One by one, Eric gives these thugs a taste of their own medicine.However their leader Top-Dollar, a world-class crime lord who will dispatch his enemies with a Japanese sword and joke about it later, will soon learn the legend of the crow and the secret to the vigilante's invincibility.....We all know that a lot of the success of this movie is based on the tragic accident on set, but even so, this movie proved that Brandon Lee was going to be a huge star, and had the talent to rival any Cruise, Ford, or Reeves.The film is poetic and on many levels, maybe one of the greatest love stories ever told, in a bizarre macabre manner.Editing is seamless here, and there are only one or two occasions where you can see the body double, and the settings are gloomy and catch the essence of the graphic novel and its connotation.Kudos to Wincott for putting in another stunning performance as the bad guy, and it's strange that he hasn't really been in anything 'big' lately, because he too, is a great actor.The soundtrack compliments the mood, as does the brooding atmosphere during the film.Setpieces are stunning, and the final act lets it down slightly, because it reminded one of the Batman finale, a film a million miles away from this.All in all, it's one of the biggest cult movies out there, and it will always leave Lee a recognised star, just like Enter the Dragon did for his dad.Iconic doesn't even begin to describe this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but the original comic is much better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of those few people who read the Crow comic before actually seeing the film. Now, don't get me wrong, I also enjoyed this movie but I have learned it is an acquired taste, much unlike the original comic which I enjoyed the first time I read it through.The movie is bold and has a definitive dark and sharp edge to its style. Borderline pitch dark, it sets an impressive mood for the film. My major problem with it though, is that unlike the comic, the film tries to explain too much. I feel that it detracted a bit too much from Eric's anguish and despair.Of course, I am biased against the movie because I read the book first. However, I do count this among one of my favourite movies, and I can find much to enjoy in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie at a fairly young age and had no idea what was going on or what it was about. Remembering it from my childhood I decided to watch it again recently. It kept me up after watching. Brandon Lee's performance is one of legend. If you're in need of a good film this is definitely the one. The sequels to it are not even in the ballpark. Knowing of Lee's death during the filming only added to its creepy factor. This is probably one of my favorite movies ever and I recommend it to EVERYONE. There is a remake of it coming up just because of its underground success. The dark side of this movie is mixed with love and kindness. Leaving an excellent film in the aftermath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does not do the comic justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not hate this film, but I certainly did not like it for a few reasons, one being that the film was nowhere near like the comic. And before I start to sound like a crazed comic fanatic; if the comic book never existed I would still dislike this film. This movie was cheesy and not at all what I was expecting from such a creepy box cover. But the comic does exist and made me dislike this movie even more! The comic was absolutely dreadful, and I mean that in the best way possible. It was dark and depressing which was exactly what James O'Barr was trying to do. It was supposed to express the unbearable pain of Eric Draven losing the love of his life to criminals. The comic conveys this pain very well, and that makes the comic truly dark and scary. The movie, however, did no such thing.Brandon Lee did a very poor job acting as the Crow with his cheap jokes and cheesy rock session. I was appalled at what I saw when I saw Draven "rock out" with his guitar. Lee did not bring the character of the comic to life, and instead delivered lines so poorly that it made me cringe at times. I honestly am in support for the reboot because I am HOPING they can express the true darkness that is in the comic.Not all of the blame goes to Lee though. The alterations in the film played a big role also. I mean he's a rock star? Seriously? I can't believe all of the positive reviews for this saying how amazing it is and how true to the comics it is. Storyline wise it is relatively similar but the essence of the story is gone completely.I would have given this film a rating of less than 4 out of 10 if it weren't for the irony that Lee had died during this film. I say this because that irony made people feel like this movie was something so much more than a movie, and I can understand that, but it doesn't change the fact that the acting was poor and did the comic little justice. I put in this movie in hopes for a dark film that justified its positive reviews, but was left severely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't actually watch many movies more then once but The Crow is actually one of the few movies I've seen more than once. I genuinely like the movie for several reasons. I find this to be one of the best revenge tales I've ever seen. Unlike almost all other revenge flicks I've seen this one works because the characters are likable. The theme of the movie is actually tied into the unfortunate death of Brandon Lee. It also manages to capture the atmosphere of the Grunge craze that happened in the 90s. The best part about it though is that the movie manages to pull all of this off and still not seem dated. Even though I only saw this movie twice it felt better watching it the second time around rather then the first. I also like the movie more then the Comic even though the comic is solid as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eighteen years after the terribly unfortunate death of future star Brandon Lee and it still cannot be accepted any easier. Seventeen years after the release of The Crow and it remains the dark, stylish comic adaptation it was celebrated as. This film holds up remarkably well, the computer effects adding rather than subtracting from the story, which is by itself more than rich enough to carry the film. Here we have one of the most common and potentially powerful story lines in the movies: a dead soul returns to Earth (usually one year later) to exact revenge on those who put him here in the first place. However, thanks to the powerful storytelling of James O'Barr and director Alex Proyas fantastic direction, the film focuses not simply on the acts of revenge themselves but also on the protagonist's relationships with the people around him. Most effective of all is the memory element in which the resurrected Eric Draven must recall various timeless moments spent with his slain fiancée and the young girl they cared for. Here is where the film gets the bulk of its emotional material, which makes the acts of revenge at once both violent and satisfying.So much has been written about Lee's performance and the cutting short of his promising career. This is all true but to focus on this film, he creates a sympathetic, driven individual who must sacrifice his own desires to complete this mission he is sent back for. The supernatural element is effective without being too ridiculous, the set design is one of the best ever created and the acting carries the heavy scenes all the way, paving the way for a startling and satisfying conclusion. The themes may be familiar, but the style and substance with which it is presented on screen is unsurpassed. Watching this film, one cannot help but feel that heavy tone of elegiac sadness which hangs over the entire production. Of course it is because of Lee but also because of the story itself. When tragedy strikes, the best the living can do for the dead is love them. This is as emotionally powerful and moving as films get.</fullReview>

You start feeling for Eric Draven and Shelly, and even the young girl. You start to feel the anger, the hatred and the loneliness in Eric Draven. It saddens me though, to fall in love with this film only to know about Brandon Lee's tragic death. He and this film will always have a special place in my heart. I am going to seek out owning this film. I really give this film an 100/10. Thank you so much, Brandon Lee. Really. I wish you were alive today so I can tell you in person.

		<fullReview>When I first saw The Crow I were just nine years old and didn't really like it but then in the end of 2004 when i where 14 I saw it again and loved it. The crow has since been on my top 3 because it is just such a beautiful and on the same time sad and dark story. I read a lot of comics and watch all the film's based on them but to date it haven't been such a great comic film as The Crow. The film is astonishing with great acting, scenery, script and is probably Alex Proyas best film. The story is very moving and "real". So if you know are mad with all the bad comic movies like fantastic four and more give The Crow a chance, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

For my eyes and ears its a very long rock video, with some decent action sequences, and a good indicator of future movies by Proyas. The lad takes a very poor script, makes a marketable object with it, it might be bit light on the intellectual palate,(so what?who says that's automatically a bad thing?). Its still good for my money, certainly worth watching, especially for Michael Wincott's incestuous very very bad guy, he just steals the show for turning up. Damned shame about Brandon Lee, he was starting to move up in the industry and given time, may have eclipsed his old dad.</fullReview>

That's down to good writing in my book. When I saw this at the cinema, I was fighting back tears - because I knew I would never see it for the first time ever again! If Brandon Lee had not died on set, I don't see how he could ever have topped this film. He would have gone on to be a real star of course; his look, his talent and most of all his grace* would have ensured that. But this was the part he was born for, so how ironic is it that it was also the one he died for?*Watch the part where Brandon / Eric Draven walks into a room and vaults into a cross-legged position atop the table. It's so effortless most people don't even notice it, but if you or I tried the move, the result would be two broken legs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A young girl's fantasy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film is an art form, and it's open to interpretation. An interpretation of The Crow that occurred to me after watching it the other night was that maybe the whole film was Sarah (the girl in the film)'s fantasy. It always struck me as kind of shallow to just look at this as a revenge film. Because, what makes Eric and Shelley such important victims? Are there no other good people in the entire city? The clear answer to that is that what makes them the most important is their connection to Sarah. They looked after her and were her friends while her mother was off doing drugs all the time. Then on "Devil's Night," they are brutally, unjustly, and senselessly murdered by some truly evil people. Sarah runs into a cop who does his best to comfort her. The world is an awful place.Then we get the title card indicating a year had passed. This is when I think the fantasy begins. Sarah continues to live in this city, and she has now befriended the cop she met a year earlier. A crow brings Eric back to life with divine powers, and guides him along a journey to bring justice to the world by killing his and Shelley's killers. Through the eyes of a young person this is as just as it gets. But it's more than just revenge. Eric gets Sarah's mom to quit drugs and start to be a mom again. Sarah is also able to say goodbye to Eric, a person who she must have loved a lot. Her fantasy also gives Eric and Shelley a chance to say goodbye to each other, to embrace one last time, bringing some closure to such unjust, terrible circumstances. The fantasy even hints that maybe the evil in the world will stop since the top villain of the city is taken down.This is just one interpretation, of course, and there's many ways to look at the movie, but I like to look at it this way. It makes it a bit more sad; a bit more beautiful, and also gives it a deeper meaning. If you listen to the final words of the movie, it does make sense. It's taken her a year, but Sarah did end up finding a way to cope with the deaths of her loved ones, and the evil in the world around her.As far as things like its visual style and acting goes, this is brilliant. I love its dark atmosphere. This is really the epitome of the early 90's. The generation X gloom, the grunge, the dark, the angst, etc. The late Brandon Lee gives a credible performance here, hitting mostly the right notes. And the great Michael Wincott adds to the enjoyment of this movie with his performance as the villain, Top Dollar. This is one movie that really is a must-see.My rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly recommend this movie, it is my all time favorite movie, it is too bad that Brendan Lee did die making this movie from an accidental backfire from his gun, but it was surely his best movie. It contains drama, action and emotion and it is great. After Brenden Lee and his girlfriend are murdered, a crow resurrects him and he is lurking for revenge from devils night, Halloween. As Brendan goes from person to person who all assisted the murder of him and his girlfriend, he grows the need for blood and revenge bigger and bigger by each kill. It has come to a point where Brenden has lost his invulnerability and he can now feel pain. As he takes out the group in the church with little remorse and nothing holing him back, there is one more person, and now he has to save a child as well (no names, don't want to spoil to much, I highly recommend a viewing of this film). As he saves the child and kills his nemesis, he meets up with his former girlfriend while returning back to the graveyard and it is really a sad ending. BUT THIS IS ENOUGH, GO OUT THERE AND SEE THE MOVIE.</fullReview>

One year later Eric is brought back to life with superhuman strength and vision, he's looking for ultimate revenge..... and that spells death for the gang!!!A superb, dark and atmospheric action horror that i highly recommend full of wonderful performances, atmospheric scenery and haunting music.This movie easily deserves 10/10, if you haven't seen it yet, do it NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crow, The Best Movie In The 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when I saw this movie in 1994 (I was merely a junior high student), I was totally stunned and tears were in my eyes. This legendary film was filmed in 1994. During filming, Brandon Lee died on the set. I felt sorry for him. He extremely made the character Eric Draven. He put all his emotion into this role. This movie is very violent, but it is really touching at the end. I remembered at that time in the movie theater, over half people cried for the ending. Sometimes, sadness can be beautiful. This dark-Gothic-style in this movie is excellent. The director Alex Proyas did an excellent job, even better than that in his latter movie "I, Robot". After 6 years, I understood that this movie actually came from comic book. I think this could be the best movie adapted from comic book I have ever seen, even better than another movie I like "Spider Man". Actually, this story is an ordinary revenge story. However, the excellent setting, great directing, touching music and -as everyone knows- the extraordinary acting by Brandon Lee make this film become not merely a movie. I know there are lots of people crazy for this movie. Brandon Lee totally dedicated himself to this role, to this movie. This is the movie I can see again and again. This is a beautiful sad story. The is the best movie adapted from comic book during the 90's.</fullReview>

(but i wont say if he is or not) i know there are a lot of movies out there can make you cry and laugh, but this one is the only one that blends a full range of emotions and balances it out with well timed scenes and perfectly placed lines. it is too good to analyse, but i'll say this; some eccentric camera angles, quirky lighting and film noir-esquire shots make this as unusual as it is practically revolutionary. there's even the essential cheesy line in there somewhere :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A No Frills Shoot-Em Up Revenge Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of The Crow is that it's all about revenge without waiting for the afterlife. This movie is unique that it is one of few modern dark films that are shot in a noir-esquire style; like Blade Runner, Underworld, and the Matrix it reflects a bleak and terrible future riddled with crime and infamy. Brandon Lee (the son of legendary Kung Fu master Bruce Lee) plays the human behind a terrible tragedy in which he comes alive again with the help of the myth of the Crow. The film is a no-frills shoot up the bad guys without any significant martial arts (although Brandon was trained like his father ? both Lees died tragically) As with many films today, this film dabbles with the mysteries of the supernatural, where both the evil and good have some control over mysterious powers that they seem to just attain without any background. Of course, there is a host of other side characters that add to Mr. Lee's need to pursue his main goal. "You're all gonna die anyway!" RATING: 9.5/10 SPECIAL NOTE: A terrible tragedy, Brandon Lee was accidentally killed during the filming of The Crow, due to a blank shell entering his chest. The story is not unlike the Crow?he was engaged to be married but was killed on the set of the movie that would reveal his own fate?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crow was a movie of poetry, melancholy, and darkness. When most people hear the name Brandon Lee, they think "The Crow" after all, it was his last performance in cinematic history. An All time favorite.To those who have seen it often experience the Sadness that was carried with the film, and what is kind of ironic about this movie dealing with life and death is the fact that Brandon Lee was killed during this movie.I consider this movie to be an independent film, yet it still hit theaters and was rewarded as a beautiful masterpiece. The crow is not a movie to see for entertainment (though it is HIGHLY entertaining and is also considered a classic), this is a movie to experience.Reading what many others have said about The Crow, it has touched them in so many ways, as well as myself.I advise everyone to go see this movie who hasn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is my all time favorite. Everything in this movie is perfectly done, from the cast (especially Michael Wincotts and Ernie Hudsons performances, not to forget the best performance in the career of the late Brandon Lee)to the camera, which creates the sombre atmosphere for the story and the perfectly fitting soundtrack (check out the cures "burn", which even I, as a non-fan of this band, love. I can't but just praise every single picture shown and every line spoken in this movie. Maybe the plot is a little stereotype ( a Victim of a brutal murder, returns from the dead to avenge his death an the death of his fiancée), but as a modern fairy tale this movie has an excuse for having a quite well-known story-line. The only thing that lowers the enjoyment of this movie, is the tragic death of Brandon Lee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a classic! Dark and disturbing but with an undercurrent of hope throughout. Essentially the film is about revenge of a murdered man who isn't ready for death so returns from death in an immortal form. A crow is his link between life and afterlife.The Crow is a cold film but occasionally the young girl brings some warmth to the screen in particular when She becomes friends with a police officer and when her Mother cleans up and starts caring.The villains are pure evil. Of course they all die and there is a happy ending for the girl and her mother. How sweet.8/10 for this which is 2 points more than my Matrix rating. This is due to the Matrix being dehumanized and the Crow shows human emotion and certain characters personify these emotions particularly anger and sorrow. A better soundtrack too.</fullReview>

A year later... A Crow brought Eric back to life to put the wrong things right here, because his soul is unrested. Eric takes revenge on those, you have murder him and his girlfriend.Directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City-Garage Days-I, Robot) made an familiar but terrific revenge fantasy thriller. This film works well thanks to sharp cast including:Ernie Hudson, Micheal Wincott, Ling Bai, Rochelle Davis (Her only film), Anna Thomson, Tony Todd, Marco Rodriguez and Jon Polito.

To Complete the film, Dream Quest Images manage to complete the film with digital effects to make Lee seems visible in the film. It's about 20% of the film actually used digital effects to complete the film for Lee's uncompleted role. This film was a Box Office hit and went on to be a cult success on video.

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow is my favorite movie. It's a mixed bag of emotions and it just takes you on one helluva' trip. The graphic novel was written by James O' Barr as a love letter to the woman he loved, after she had died. It is one of the most beautiful and violent books I have read. There are many differences between the graphic novel and the movie, but the main story and most of the characters stay the same. The greatest thing about the similarities is that they're both written by James O' Barr. This movie is very sad, it's very violent. This is the only movie I cry during every time I see it, and I've seen it twenty times. The Crow is a masterpiece of cinema and it contains the late Brandon Lee who sadly died during the making of this film. Watch this movie, it'll be worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murdered in cold blood on "Devil's Night", a murdered rocker is resurrected by a black crow to seek revenge for the death of himself &amp; his fiancé, by bumping off the scum that committed the crime &amp; their boss who ordered the execution. Aided by a hypnotic black crow, ERIC DRAVEN (The late BRANDON LEE) is not only back with a vengeance, but remains eternal, impervious to bullets &amp; stab wounds until his mission is complete, leaving behind the symbol of a crow in some way or fashion after each murder. THE CROW is a cult film well deserving of it;s cult potential. The film is set in a dreary, dark, miserable, atmosphere that is constantly showered in rain &amp; a dirty &amp; a trash filled landscape, a crumbling, decaying metropolis where anarchy &amp; crime rules, &amp; every Devil's Night, gang leader TOP DOLLAR &amp; his thug henchmen light fires, vandalize, rape &amp; murder. All the while ruling the city with an iron fist, with the cities police force unable to make a dent in it. With all that said, the film is really just a plain vengeance story, given a supernatural twist &amp; at times asks one to believe a lot, especially the fact that Eric who has been dead a year, is resurrected but is not rotted away, in fact, he looks perfectly intact! The film is very flashy &amp; hypnotically directed by ALEX PROYAS who adds an almost MTV style energy to the film, with the hero leaping from building to building, the potential victims of the hero's seen through the eyes of the black crow that guides him. Proyas also seems to be celebrating a Gothic nihilism found in the cult comic book, with the action set pieces being extraordinary. The film is mostly bathed in darkness, of course this allows Eric's kabuki make-up to really stand out &amp; the vengeance wrecked on the killers is well deserved. ERNIE HUDSON does a good turn as a kind hearted police officer who befriends Eric.TONY TODD is interesting as one of Top Dollars main thugs. The rest of the acting is reasonably well done. The film was also followed by a TV series which was a remake of this film but was rather bland, lacking the dark goth infused, energy &amp; rainy dirty landscapes &amp; sharp direction &amp; acting this film had &amp; watered the vengeance plot line down a lot, (it was nowhere near as good) &amp; three sequels (with the last two being direct to video), but rather than touch upon many interesting idea's &amp; paths that could have been taken, they merely remade this film. The first sequel followed two years later: THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS **** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>simply put, this is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't commented on IMDb in a long time, but I just saw this and decided I had to. This is really a very impressive film, full of amazing Gothic set pieces and a simple but extremely well told story, full of style and heart, although it also has corny dialog and the simplicity can be troublesome to some people. The story is about a rock guitarist who is murdered along with his fiancé, but who then gets the opportunity to come back to life with the help of a mystical crow to exact revenge on his and his fiancé's killers. The true stand-out of the film is in fact not the storytelling style or even the over the top action sequences, but instead the acting of Brandon Lee in the title role, who as many know tragically died during shooting of the film and was digitally added or had a double for the remainder of his scenes. Knowing that Lee had passed on gave watching this movie a unique experience, as you really started to blend Lee the actor and his character into one person. I don't like that many action movies and I don't like movies with simple plots but this one is an exception. I urge everyone to see this movie and experience both the fun Gothic storyline as well as Brandon Lee's truly spectacular performance. This is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right after it was over I could not believe but that was the greatest movie I ever seen! Brandon Lee's final movie was truly and huge hit, and his acting really touched my heart (corny, but true). The story is particularly for teen Goths--as a favorite I say, so for people who don't like strong violence I suggest to keep away cause this movie is pretty scary, although I found it very dramatic. There really are some sad scenes that really put the viewer away from the killing-action, and I have to say the soundtrack is super, I had to buy it for myself, songs like from the Cure and Nine Inch Nails. But as i said a little earlier, I would recommend this movie to viewers who just want o see a good movie, loves Gothic and horror-action type films(like let's say Batman), then this movie is for you. But whoever, the movie really let me down a bit at the end, and just to say this was Brandon Lee's final movie. Rest in peace but check it out first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we sit in movie theaters today endlessly assaulted by comic adaptations many have overlooked or never seen The Crow, which is arguably the best film in the entire genre. Sure the effects are dated but the story and acting in this beautifully dark picture are leaps and bounds ahead of comic book movies today. As I just mentioned the style of this movie fits just perfectly with the characters and with the killer soundtrack that accompanies it. Some people say that this movie is overrated because of the death of Brandon Lee during shooting but honestly I first saw this movie years ago and I, first of all didn't know who Brandon Lee was or that he had died tragically due to an on the set accident. Brandon Lee in this picture simply put gives the performance of a lifetime it is just so powerful and emotional that you sometimes forget that it's a movie. It's simply not the kind of acting that is usually reserved for a comic book movie but more dramatic films instead. That is not to say the film lacks action, which there is plenty of but it's more than just that. The story is also very compelling because it poses the question to the whole audience of what they would do if they were allowed to come back, what would you do how would you view the world and all its changes since your departure and how would all your loved ones have moved forward without you? It makes you think about your own mortality because none of us know how much time we have left and we sometimes take for granted certain things because they seem small or trivial but as Eric discovers in the movie "nothing is trivial" and that's true. Under appreciated masterpiece</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved the crow, from start to finish. It was one of those movies that brought a little sadness in as well as class A action and a tiny bit of comedy in there somewhere. I wouldn't personally class it as horror (even though a lot of people do). Such a shame about Brandon lee though :(:( I actually just got the 2 disk edition, this morning in the post and am going to watch it now (the extras sound promising!) Plus its got his last TV interview on the CD. I also got the soundtrack through at the same time and it is great (Burn - The cure being my favourite chill out song of all time).

		<fullReview>Surreal dark atmosphere, that was created, combined all the characters into one storyline perfectly. Simple story spiced up with vivid characters, scenes and retorts, no extra pieces, no stereotypes which look stupid. Everything is just like a perfect melody. There is one way to make a good man be a bad man. There is one wound that hurts the most. There is one law that works in any religion and any universe: everything pays off. The Crow gave birth to many stereotypical characters, like a never-ending river of copies made with very bad xerox machine, and the worst ever TVshow, but original of it really worked. And will work for a long time ahead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love the late Brandon Lee in this movie and I find it very tragic that he was unable to continue his career. I really loved 'The Crow' because of its kind of unclear vision of good and evil. On one hand, Eric Draven is the good avenger getting justice on the druggies/gangsters, but then on the other hand, the way he does it has a slight insanity to it and he NEVER hands them over to the police. He kills them. So, the line between good &amp; evil is there, but a bit less recognizable. For those who have read the graphic novel of 'The Crow,' (which I had the pleasure of reading) it is true to the book in most ways, and the changes that WERE made were minimal. For example, the comic showed that Eric and Shelly were killed on the side of the road after they had some car trouble, whereas in the movie, they were murdered in their apartment. That didn't really bother me at all, and even if you are a strictly by-the-book person, I think it should still be okay. I recommend this movie to anyone who can tolerate excessive cursing. ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pulp Fiction? Forrest Gump? Nah, this is what should have won the Best Film Oscar in 94. The best comic book film ever made, surpassing even Batman and Superman, The Crow is one film that will remain eternal, and never age over the years. Its story may be simple, but it is executed with such style and heart that it will never become unfashionable, and although the sequels have so far been poor, this is unmissable. Action, humour, love, and a visual flare that only Burton can match, The Crow, as Brandon Lee's last film has a massive cult following and was hailed by many critics.Eric Draven, a rock musician and his girlfriend Shelley are brutally killed on Halloween by the members of a local gang. The case is never solved, but cop Albrecht stayed with Shelley in the hospital for the many hours before she died. He has gone on with his job in the stinking city, occasionally meeting with Sarah, a young girl who was friends with Eric and Shelley, whose mother is a waster and addict. One year later, Draven returns from the grave, terrified and tortured until he remembers what has happened. A Crow seems to look after him and he is invincible. He soon sets out for revenge, picking off the gang members one by one, on his way to Top Dollar, the leader. Although he tries to hide, he eventually shows himself to Sarah and Albrecht, and they work together. Soon Draven and Top Dollar square off, but The Crow has been injured, and Draven's power has gone.Never before has such a beautiful film been made. Only Scissorhands can equal this, but even it has a different style. The sweeping views of the city, a terrible place to be, are stunning, with camera angles the Matrix would emulate. The soundtrack adds immensely, both the rock songs, and the instrumental tracks, making the film all the more powerful. The acting is all immense, though understated and quiet for the most part. Lee gives his best performance and it is a remarkable one, going through the emotions of the character, as well as doing the stunts. Of course, this would cost him his life, tragically echoing the story. In fact, the story seems to have been cursed from the start, with creator O'Barr basing the story and character on the real events of his life-his girlfriend being killed and the emotions he went through. Davis as Sarah gives a strong performance too, and could have had the world at her feet, but vowed never to return to the set and has not acted since Lee's death. Hudson gives a career best, and Wincott gives his usual snarling effort, here it is superb and has not been bettered. All the other cast members are great too, the gang members each well drawn and acted to perfection.The story is told with such skill that you can't help to feel such sympathy for the characters, and Sarah's monologues are very emphatic. Draven is a strong character, getting a second chance to do things right, and saying that yes- scumbags who kill do deserve to die also. These bad guys have no redeeming qualities, and their deaths are satisfying. The script is also awesome, and their are many one-liners, and these are not stupid either, but have meaning. If their were only a handful of films from this decade which survived a war, or which could be used to show humanity, this would be one of them. Easily one of the best movies of the decade which should continue to be seen by all.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie does not appear to be all that interesting from the cover, the storyline is awesome and completely well-done. The action appears realistic and the drama is sufficient enough to bring tears to the eyes. I definitely encourage anyone to watch this movie and formulate their own opinion of it. It's beautiful (in a dark way), but that doesn't have to be a bad thing all the time. The only thing I keep wondering is why the crow always put himself in danger's way. If he was Eric's strength, he should have kept himself in hiding until he really needed to come out. Many action movies tend to lack in the aspect of drama, but this movie had the right balance of action and drama to keep my interest the whole way through. My best friend, Kristine (sexy4u) showed me this movie, and I loved it so much that it will become a part of my growing movie selection shortly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crow has to be one of my favorite comic book movies I have ever seen. Brandon Lee was excellent, hearing about his death was one of the worst things I have ever heard (in the movie biz). There are a lot of great things about this movie and for those of you that have seen this I am sure you know. Great story, acting, the dark/ rainy scenery was great, etc... There are so many "I'll get my revenge" movies but the way this movie portrayed it was totally original. This movie has good replay value also, I saw it 5 times in the theater when it came out and numerous times since I have had it on DVD. Michael Wincott also did a great job as well as Ernie Hudson. If you haven't seen this movie I highly recommended that you do. I'm not going to go all about telling you about it, that is what all the other comments are for. The deleted scenes feature on the DVD is also good, I wish they put it in the movie instead of having it as an extra. 10/10</fullReview>

A highly recommended film, however the subjects in this movie may be hazardous to the unstable. I gave this movie an 8. Perhaps a thrilling classic in film history.

Justice and particularly revenge, the real theme of the film, is a dish best served cold and it's hard to get much colder than the dead.The atmospheric soundtrack stood out as so excellent that I noticed it in the background even though the film was completely absorbing and it complemented the film perfectly.The Gothic look and feel of the whole film was superbly integrated with an alternative present day setting and every character was brought to such vivid life as to be loved or hated with passion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the only movie in which I've witnessed an entire theatre errupt in applause at the end of the movie. It left me in tears to be honest. Brandon Lee is Eric Draven. A man sent back to our world to right the wrongs. In doing so, shows his love and loss for his fiancée Shelley, gives hope to Sarah, Sarah's mother Darla and a beat cop Albrect, played by the charming Ernie Hudson. The theme of revenge has been done, but the devotion to his fiancée is touching, if not romantic. All the violence you see is excessive yet necessary. Little known fact; Brandon Lee was the person to scout out the talent for the costume designer! There are scenes missing that explain how Eric got to wear the electrical tape on his arms, leg and stomach, and there is a missing character known as the skull cowboy. You'd have to read the comic book to learn the hows and whys of those issues. This movie left me with a lot to think and talk about. The movie is haunting being that it's dedicated to Brandon Lee and his fiancée Eliza - who never got married due to the accident.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically this movie is about at as bad-ass as it gets. Brandon Lee plays Eric Draven, a young rock guitarist who is beaten and killed the night before his wedding, along with his fiancé. The next year he comes back and gets even with the guys that killed him. This movie is dark, in a way that it feels real. Instead of letting the love surpass the anger of the overall movie Lee keeps it going. Not only that, but he choreographed every fight scene, and let's be honest, the son of Bruce Lee would not steer us wrong! I would also like to point out that the cinematography is very unique too. The film makers obviously stayed away from "happy" colors. They primarily focus on black and blood red. This just adds to the the strength of the movie. The message of the movie is one that can be appreciated. While Lee's character is killing the "bad guys", he himself is not romanticized as a good guy. He is still killing, and the film makers did not try to make him look like the every day hero. Like I said, this movie is just to bad-ass for words!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crow????The best movie I've ever seen, the last film of the late great Brandon Lee, son of the legendary Bruce Lee. A dark and amazingly cool love story filled with despair, rage, and revenge.The story of a rock and roll guitarist and his fiancé's brutal and compelling murder, whose death was ordered by an evil and diabolical crime lord for living in his city. Eric Draven beaten and shot to death in front of his fiancé and Shelly Webster was beaten and raped; she later died leaving her adopted kid sister alone in a dark and cruel city. And it all happened on devil's night, the night before their wedding.A year passes, and a crow returns to the grave of Eric Draven. Eric rises from the ashes of the life he once had for justice, rage, love, and revenge.The city is dark and eerie, Eric's pain and passion as a living ghost drives him to moments of pure insanity and utter despair. The Crow shows him the way and becomes his power of invincibility in this world to punish those responsible for the great injustices he and his love suffered.The action is excellent and cinematography exquisite, the score is unmatched bringing a lot of emotion to the scenes.Included on the 'Special Edition of The Crow', The last interview of Brandon Lee. Brandon speaks of his appreciation for life and his views death and now he's gone??.Mkd10509</fullReview>

Well I can tell that I've almost seen every movie with Brandon Lee playing in it... Although he only played in (mostly) action movies he played his best part in The Crow... I watched the movie the first time right after it was released. I've always been a big fan of Bruce Lee his father but also of Brandon Lee because he didn't want people to see him like his father. Brandon always wanted to play in a non-action movie and I know The Crow is one of those... His acting in this movie is good... I know they use a lot of CGI which is done superb. Yes, the fact that he was really killed in the movie made me wanna see it more. The part where he was shot in the chest with a real bullet (Everyone who reads the storyline to know what's the movie about will know that it's about a man who returns from dead to revenge the murder of his girlfriend and himself) made a deep impact on me. As I said they did a hell of a job with CGI completing the movie... and in the end the movie was to my opinion great... The movie is dark and it totally fits the story and the acting of Brandon and the other actors... Of course there are lot more good movies maybe with better stories or whatever but for me... I think it was Brandon's best... and unfortunately also his last movie... Everybody who wants to see him acting like he never did before has to see this movie...!!! I saw it last week for the (only) 3rd time... and know 10 years later I think it movie has become even better (to understand)...I rate this movie 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the ultimate movie about vengeance from beyond the grave, good versus evil, wrongs made right, and the power of love conquering all. That last line may sound straight out of a chick flick, but this movie is anything but. This is one of the movies that influenced my way of thinking about the world when I was growing up and to this day has an unconscious effect on the way I deal with things in my everyday life. I am in no way into the "goth scene" that this movie has been attached to, but I believe that the music, the imagery, and the characters come together perfectly. The use of miniatures creates a haunting effect, and integrates flawlessly with everything else. Brandon Lee was the perfect man for the part. Rochelle Davis's performance as Sarah was superb, despite the fact that "The Crow" is the only movie she's ever been in. I can truthfully say that I haven't seen a better made movie in all of the years since "The Crow" came out in 1994. It has a special magic that I sorely miss in today's movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Crow" has some of the best miniature effects I've ever seen. The aerial views of the city were amazing, they were both realistic and imaginative at the same time.How much you like the actual story may depend on how well you like the original comic; it's a pretty simple revenge tale with a little bit of simplistic moralizing thrown in for good measure. A few of the scenes are cringeworthy in a dramatic sense, like the overly cutesy flashback scenes of Eric and Shelley.But to focus too much on the story is to miss the point. "The Crow" is all about style, and this movie is very well put together in that regard. You can't take your eyes off of it no matter what is happening on the screen. It's no surprise that the director comes from a background of rock video, and the soundtrack is a big part of the film. A few of the scenes are a bit too "MTV", but it happened to appeal to me, so that's a small complaint here. The characters are always interesting, and the action never bogs down too much. It also must be said that the CGI effects were excellent, especially for being so early.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Dramatic Actioner with a Romantic Twist...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1996 I first saw "The Crow", starring Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson, &amp; Michael Wincott. It wasn't until later that I learned of Brandon's tragic death, and the notoriety this film gained because of it.In 1981, James O'Barr's life was altered forever when the love of his life was killed by a drunk driver. Seeking to overcome this tragedy, he put all of his pain, guilt, anger, and vengefulness into a graphic novel which took him 8 years to write. "The Crow: A Love Story" was published in 1989, and immediately started a phenomenon.The film, closely adapted from the novel, tells the story of struggling rock musician Eric Draven and his fiancé' Shelly Webster, who are brutally massacred by murderer T-Bird and his gang of ruthless thugs. One year later, Eric is mysteriously resurrected by a hypnotic crow. Completely devoid of a conscience, Eric's soul has returned to seek the ultimate retribution and poetic justice...the men responsible for he and Shelley's murders must die. Then, he will be reunited with Shelley in the afterlife.Although not as dark as the novel, this film is rated "R", for scenes of violence, sexuality, sexual abuse, language, and thematic elements. At the core of this film is a poetic love story, and I would recommend it to anyone who believes in everlasting love. =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The death of Brandon Lee was a great tragedy which disheartened many fans. But before he died he left us one final piece of work, that piece of work was the goth classic "The Crow". The Crow, based on the comic series by James O'Barr, not only had great acting and visual effects but a great story-line. The story starts with the terrible murder of Eric Draven, heavy metal guitarist from a band called Hangman's Joke, and his fiancée Shelly Webster who where to be married the next day on Halloween by 5 arsonists. One year after the murder on Devils Night (the day before halloween) Eric Draven rises from the dead, with the help of a mysterious crow that gives him the power of invulnerability, to get revenge on the murders who killed him and his girlfriend. The Crow is an excellent action adventure that any hard- rock fan is sure to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lovely bit of goth that takes place in a city where fun-lovin' villains rule the streets and cops eat junk food at local diners? a LOT. A lovely place where it is always night, and always raining. But it can't rain all the time! In the beginning of the movie a tragedy takes place, a couple is murdered by the local crime scene. Business as usual, unfortunately the guy doesn't seem to stay dead, he climbs out of his grave a year later deep in sorrow and anger. Not so deep, however, that he neglects such important tasks as putting on make up and looking cool and stylish, if this guy is so good in his time of sadness, I'd love to see him in the better years. So the boy friend is alive and well and (as a slight bones) invincible. Rather then wondering what he is doing back on earth and how to get that lovely girl lying next to him out to be with him, he goes on a classy rampage to kill everyone who wronged him on that dire day. He does. As for the fun-lovin' villains, they aren't having no fun! The local crime boss is dissatisfied with life and wishes it involved more spontaneous anarchy. I can see how in his structured mob where everyone has their place, their value, their territory, and their boss a bit of anarchy could be called for. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie, it really is, but I find making fun of it a bit greater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrific, the best of it's kind. Some people complain that it lacked character development of the part of Eric Draven, the character Brandon Lee portrayed. But in fact if you dive into the movie, you will see that they build his persona well. He has a sort of rage that anybody would if they knew they couldn't be stopped from avenging the death of the most important person in their life. It's a love story in the sickest dimensions, Fantastic. Lee was terrific in his role, as was villain, Michael Wincott as Top Dollar.

		<fullReview>I have ever ever seen. I refused to watch it at first, because I thought it was a horror, but I was in the house alone one night, aged 15, and nothing else was on. The first speech by Sarah, ("People once believed...") completely bowled me over, and I sat transfixed at the overwhelming love and devotion Eric felt for Shelley. How he can be so truly, madly, deeply in love and at the same time be so coldly distant toward his murderers. I'm not sure I'm saying this properly. His relationship with Sarah, also tremendously touching, showed he was a caring, loving person on the whole, which made his one-mindedness to kill the killers easier to digest. His acts weren't just of his loving obsession to Shelley, but also of his utter rage that the bad guys were hurting another he loved. Needless to say, this film has made my ideal for love much more....exact. That film shows how love can be, and that real love is definitely forever, whenever it be sexual or otherwise</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the things that I have hated in my life is the fact that such a powerful actor like Brandon lee couldn't go on to show the world what he could do. Like his father (Bruce Lee) Brandon was killed in the filming of his breakthrough movie. The film is about a Detroit couple that on the eve of there wedding (devils night a Detroit holiday for criminals that takes place the day before Halloween) is murdered by local crime lords. A year later Eric (Lee) rises from the dead and with the help of a mysterious crow takes revenge upon his assailants. The beauty of the movie lies in less performance but honestly there wasn't a flaw in a single role in the entire film. Supported by Michael Wincott and Ernie Hudson amongst others. The set design was also a strong point. The comic book for which it was based was done in black and white so while the directors weren't allowed to film it in traditional ash can form, they really controlled the pallet and did away with most greens blues yellows and reds and kept it very gloomy to add to the feel. There is not a second of this movie that isn't worth watching. Fox's score10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something To Crow About</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as comic book adaptions go The Crow is up there with the best of them. Its a real gem and you don't have to have been a fan of the comic to enjoy and appreciate it. The film is the story of two young lovers, Eric and Shelley, who are murdered on the eve of their Halloween Night wedding by goons working for the cities main drugs baron. Exactly one year later Eric returnes from the dead to seek revenge on all the people involved in his an his fiancees demise, with the help of a mysterious crow. Then only will he be able to rest in peace. Directed by Alex Proyas who made his name directing music videos, this film is shot very much in the same way with many rapidly edited fight scenes and a mise en scene which reflects the dark themes of the piece. The film is a touching story whose underlyning themes are friendship, love and good conquering evil but shown in a way that is not covered in a sugar coated topping. With a setting that will not be dated in twenty years time, the film is stylish with an awesome rock soundtrack, featuring music by The Cure, None Inch Nails and Stone Temple Pilots to name but a few. Brandon Lee is exceptional as Eric and if he had not been tragically killed during the filming of this picture this would surely have been his big break, captapulting him to super stardom. Instead he will be remembered as a cult star in a cult movie. The audience feels great sympathy with the innocent characters and the bad guys are ones that you like to hate because they are so hideous. The good guys you like, wirh Eric's police officer sidekick, played by Ernie Hudson, supplying a few comic moments and Michael Wincott also puts in a great performance as the main bad guy "Top Dollar". As I said, this film is a cult one and is definately not to be missed. Fast action, great dialogue and top performances by it actors. I give it 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK first of all, I would like to say The Crow is one of my favourite films of all time. My first reason for liking it is because it's a great idea for a film and my other reason is because it's not just a one type genre. What I mean is, The Crow isn't a Horror Movie, It's an action, thriller, dramatic, dark, funny and a sort of Horror Movie. I always watch this movie, so if your board one night and want something to watch and there's nothing good on TV then buy/rent this film. I gave this film a 9/10 rating, and I'm always right. I also heard that the sequels to this film are pretty good, I haven't seen them yet but either way, see this film.</fullReview>

Those people just wont admit they don't understand it. This movie is like the perfect love story. It has action and dynamics. It is about revrenge for the person you love, and I mean if you were rapped and murdered, wouldn't you want some one to do that for you? I no its not right but still you can't say that isn't true love right there. Here is my opinion if you need a movie for a female and a male here it is. Just if you can't understand dark movies or violence take that last part back.* My evaluation 8 1/2 out of 10 (I Refuse to give a number over 9)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Proyas is gifted at crafting fine dark sci-fi cinema. "The Crow" is truly a great movie. There are a few things that could've been done a little better. For instance, lots of quick cuts rarely work to do anything but confuse and frustrate. But as that may be intentional, why nitpick over it?Funny that a guy whose resume consists almost entirely of cheap horror sequels could pen this movie, especially with several scenes of genuine good dialogue. But Proyas' cinematic style is what makes the film really great. He took a good story and treated it with respect, taking the time to let the character of Eric Draven develop through a succession of alternating loud and violent scenes, and quiet and contemplative scenes. It's a beautiful balance for such an intriguing character.Brandon Lee's Eric Draven has secured a place in the history of great, memorable cinematic characters, and he will forever be remembered and loved for his role in this film.8/10 stars: an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A high flying Gothic masterpiece - 91%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My flatmate buys a number of DVDs on a regular basis. Quite a lot are wrestling PPVs but sometimes, she buys an absolute gem. "The Crow" is one such film, having been seen by myself only once before many years ago on a very old TV with poor reception. But thanks to DVD, the darkness is crystal clear and the static has gone. Mind you, so has the fuzzy picture of Dutch TV and everything that entails. Maybe that's an Easter egg on the second disc!"The Crow" is famously the last film completed by Brandon Lee, killed in an accident during filming. Indeed, this film will be forever linked to Brandon just as "Enter The Dragon" will be linked to his father, Bruce Lee. Make no mistake, this movie is a masterpiece of Gothic film-making. Everything, from set design and lighting to the near endless rain and black leather costumes, adds up to make a very dark cinematic experience. The film is almost in black-and-white - colour is drained from the present while abundently vivid in flaskbacks scenes. The film focuses on Eric Draven, a rock musician killed with his fiancée on Devil's Night (the night before Halloween and Draven's wedding). He returns from the grave a year later to exact revenge on the thugs responsible, seemingly immortal and guided by a mysterious crow. The story, based on comics or "graphic novels" if you prefer, isn't this film's strong-point. The film is sold as a brooding and violent love-story and is one of the best fantasy films I've ever seen.Lee plays Draven exceptionally well. It is, as he says in an interview, an incredible role - a supremely powerful warrior whose only weakness is his emotional scars from his ordeal. He is utterly believable in an unbelievable role, though I was reminded of straight-to-video-specialist Mark Dacascos in some scenes. Other than this, the only other faults I could think of are few are far between. The over-reliance of darkness obscured much of the film's fantastic set design (the city skyline is incredible, reminiscent of Gotham City in "Batman") and some CGI is detectable, though not much. The editors did a fantastic job of completing the picture after Lee's demise and must be congratulated.Other highlights include yet another baddie appearance by Tony "Candyman" Todd and the soundtrack, a mixture of heavy rock and orchestral mood pieces. Though it is ten years old, the film feels contemporary and is probably the ultimate Goth-teenager picture after "Naked Vampire Lesbians IV" (which might even exist). I have no hesitation in recommending "The Crow" at all. As an action film, it is a little on the slow side but at least it is something different. Probably the best ever film based on a comic (sorry, "graphic novel").</fullReview>

After applying black and white face-paint and a black costume he begins his killing spree.

It's also very funny (in that black humour we smirk at but never laugh out loud at) The action scenes are also excellent and the acting is very downplayed. Lee obviously loved his character. (There's that word again. Love.)The music only deepens the feeling of the darkness in the world of 'The Crow'.

I own all of The Crow movies, even the third which was so bad I almost cried at the thought that I spent more than $5.99 on it. One good thing came out of the movie though. It brought people to Mr. O'Barr's comics. It was the first time the Gothic community had something else to read besides the Sandman comics. I guess you could call me a "comic book nerd", but if you are gonna make movies from comics they should be to the "T" or at least as much as they could possibly be."Abashed the Devil stood, And felt how awful goodness is, and saw Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined His loss"</fullReview>

And an excellently done adaptation to the screen. As a person who has always enjoyed comic book characters and gothic/victorian atmospheres, I can say fully that while it may have needed a little work in the villians department-they made a memorable film.It is not a sadistic film. It is a film about love. The lasting kind of love that we as a world don't seem to exhibit anymore. The reason it is a cult hit is because it shows someone who would do anything to avenge his fiancee's death-so that he can rest in peace with her. Not because someone died in the making of it, though anyone can see that is a part of the draw.The sequels are nothing compared to this and I wouldn't add them to my video collection but this film is one that sticks with you. </fullReview>

The music, costumes, make-up and the beautiful way that Alex Proyas directed the whole thing really impressed me. A movie to watch over and over and over. What a shame that Brandon Lee died during the filming! May he rest in peace.My rating: 10/10 (Masterpiece)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot possibly say enough about this film! The story is one of romance and vengence. It is visually appealing with its stylized view of what evil can do when it overruns an area. Brandon Lee's performance is the best have ever seen in a film. This is the type of film that once you have watched it, it sticks with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could i love this movie more?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just before we start i have gotta say this is my favourite movie of all time. It might not be technically the best, but its my favourite.I think the whole concept of " The Crow " is completly romantic. The notion that somebody could love you so much that they would return from the dead to avenge your death is the type of love every woman dreams of. I know when your watching the film that romance probably isnt the first thing you think of, but for me, that basic idea left a lasting impression on me. That and the excellent production, the amazing Brandon Lee, and the superb darkly meloncholic soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching elegy for a life cut short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was unprepared for this movie when I first saw it in 1994. The film had become more than just a film, but a touching elegy for the gifted Brandon Lee.The producers were put into a bind when during filming, Lee was accidentally killed when a cast member shot at him and the gun malfunctioned sending debris into a major artery of his body. The producers had to quickly decide if the film would be finished at all.I'm glad they finished it because it is a moving piece of work. You can hardly see the seams where body doubles and early versions of CGI were used to fill in the blanks.It is the story of Eric Draven, the rock musician who returns from the grave to avenge the brutal murder of his fiancee, Shelly. It is a stylistic wonder. And Lee shows so much promise in his line delivery and balletic grace. It is dark, and given Lee's demise, it is chilling and ironic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"...as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. You heard me rapping, right?" This movie is definitely the best possible piece of filmmaking on this planet(moment of silence for the "late, great" Brandon Lee)! SPOILERS LIE AHEAD... Here's the low-down. A rock-guitarist named Eric Draven (Lee) and his fiance Shelly Webster are murdered by Top Dollar's gang on Devil's Night, the night before their wedding. One year later, he is ressurected by a crow to seek vengence upon those who caused his death and bring the killers to justice. The darkness/goth of this film is the key to commiting it to memory. Who can forget a man strolling the streets of a post-apoclyptic Detroit wearing black and white make-up(NOT FACEPAINT)and a trenchcoat? Not any sane human. The action in this movie is also fantastic, although scarce, but what this movie lacks in action, it makes up for ten-fold in plot. The sequels were interesting all in their own, but the original bakes its own cake. Once again, kudos to Lee for a fantastic finale, and to Alex Proyas for creating the best movie the world has ever seen.Acting:10/10 Action:9/10 Plot:10/10 Music:10/10 Set:11/10(yes, it was that good) Overall rating for The Crow:10/10 MUST SEE!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crow (1994) D: Alex Proyas. Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson, Michael Wincott, David Patrick Kelly, Angel David, Rochelle Davis, Ling Bai. Exceptional gothic thriller about a rock-and-roll musician who, along with his fiancee, is brutally murdered by gang members and then rises from the dead one year later for vengeance. Lee was accidentally killed on the set 52 days into the 58 day shoot; computer technology enabled them to complete the film, superimposing his face onto a body double. The film is loud and boisterous, but the acting (especially by Lee) is terrific and the cinematography conveys the dark, Gotham City-esque mood that works so well. RATING: 9 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence, profanity, nudity, and sexual situations.</fullReview>

Since this was based on a comic book one could understand the nature of the performances and the character design (Michael Wincott resembled a comic book villain, a kind of `my devious plans will rule the world' bad guy, which was difficult to take seriously at times.) But the direction by Alex Proyas was first rate, depicting Detroit as a rainy, grungy, anarchial wasteland like the city in the comic book. Had he turned to working on the sequels they would have turned out much better.</fullReview>

See, THIS is what happens, when the director knows his sh*t, and you invest on the atmosphere - who says photography and lightning are trivial in an action flick? The result is just like the comic-book: almost looks like it (almost black &amp; white), dark, and full of energy; looks like "a beautiful nightmare". And kicks ass!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great tragic love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the great comic book series by the same name, The Crow is great tragic love story. Eric Draven is killed after witnessing the rape of his girlfriend Shelly. Dying with with that tragic moment lodged in his head he is able to come back as The Crow, not to seek vengeance on the men who killed him, but to seek justice for the love that the men destroyed. Guided by a mystical Crow, and killing the men one by one he eventually comes face to face the man who ordered the killings.The Crow stands as one of the best comics-to-film adaptation. It launched the careers of many of the star who performed on the soundtrack. Many film have copied it's dark style. It has inspired countless film like Se7en and other "dark" films. It tragically was also the last film to star Brandon Lee. Its director went on to direct the very dark and stylish 'DARK CITY' two sequals and an tv series followed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that The Crow is one of the best films ever made is an understatement. The plot is, a rocker and his girlfriend are murdered on Devil's Night. And one year later, he is brought back to life by a mysterious crow to avenge his and his girlfriends death. This film will always be linked to the death of its lead actor, Brandon Lee who was killed accidentally while on the set. The Crow also showcases one of the best performances by Canadian actor Michael Wincott. This film is a showcase of the darkside of Rock n Roll and is one of the main themes of the movie. The question I have always asked myself when I saw this film for the first time in 1994 &lt;on a Friday night btw&gt; was whether or not this film would have been as successful as it was had Brandon Lee not died. All in all this is my favorite film...and it has quickly risen to the status of Cult-hit mainly because of what happened. This is a film about Love and Justice...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were a three things that atracted me to this movie and they were.1) The whole theme of the dead coming back to life intrests me and I am always keen to see a different take on the theme.2) The soundtrack: It contains mostly Gothic/Indie music, but the whole theme of the movie seems to be based around loosely around a post-Grunge america.3) The audience it attracts: The Crow is seen as a gothic film and is seen to have been made for goths. I am semi-gothic and am always interested to see films of this nature.With all those things in mind, the movie seemed irresistable and after i've seen it, it would now be in my top 10 movies of all time.The film is often violent, but somehow seems to keep a romantic and erotic feel to it, because after all, the whole movie is based on Eric's love for Shelly. It is also filled with minor jokes, which I found amusing.The only complaint I have about this movie is it didn't seem to have enough in it.I will look foward to seeing the sequel very much, and I recomend this film to anyone!</fullReview>

Seeing his character's grave is almost foreshadowing real life. Unfortunately unlike in the movie, in real life Brandon Lee will never be back.

		<fullReview>The first time I saw The Crow was around 1996, when I was about 14 years old, had no idea what "goth" means and wasn't yet very seriously into metal music. This movie left me trembling, sitting on the couch with my mouth open and tears in my eyes. I couldn't stand up in at least half an hour! It was something totally new for me. No movie had affected me that way before and it took years before anything similar happened.Well, now seven years older and still not into almost anything that can be classified as "gothic" (goths do wear some nice clothes though) - and still The Crow has the same effect on me. There are some other movies that affect me very strongly, but The Crow is different - it was the first one. It's no longer the best movie I've seen - the third or fourth best probably - but anyway it was the first, and that's why it may always be 'special' for me. I hope so.The plot of the movie isn't very interesting - actually pretty corny. Apparently it doesn't prevent from making one hell of a movie experience. Alex Proyas did a marvellous job. The movie's got everything. The overall atmosphere of it is just beyond description. The soundtrack is great, too - even though I listen to a bit different kind of music normally.Brandon Lee is superb as Eric Draven, and I love also Rochelle Davis as Sarah. But as usually, Michael Wincott - as Top Dollar - steals the show with one of his best performances ever. For me, Top Dollar is a very significant part of the fascination about this movie. He's not just plain bad - he's got a sense of humour just like mine. Plus there's some kind of deep inexplicable sadness about him, which makes me confused: should I hate him or not? He's the bad guy, so I probably should, but... - And this is just one of the strange feelings this movie awakes in me.What a totally amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A veil of darkness surrounds this movie. Not only because of the movie itself, but also due to the death of Brandon during the making. This gives the film an extra darkness and mystery around it.The story is about Eric Draven's search as an avenger to find justice for the brutal murder on him and his wife. He has been granted a dark and mysterious power of the crow and with this he seeks justice to them who were responsible for all of the pain and sadness.The film is a pretty straightforward action movie, yet it has a certain originality and quality. The dialogue thus the script is partly the reason, as well as the original comic.Micheal Wincott (Along came a Spider) and David Patrick Kelly (Twin Peaks) were among the cast, and Ernie Hudson (Oz) playing the sidekick as Cop Albrecht.One way or another, this movie was Brandon's big breakthrough and like his father he will be remembered for many generations to come.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an old comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this in my old stuff; a review from 5 years ago for this movie...though I already commented on The Crow; I feel this may be the most honest review for it:Once upon a time-not so long ago- Halloween was something more magical. Up until the early 90's kids were happy to be frightened because it was about being alive and honest, without the fear that evil truly did reign the Earth. It was optimism and how it related to human darkness. Moreover it was about how "Goth" had come back in style, the education in literary background that came with it. There was a lot of culture behind black attire and make-up of this time- whether it was referenced to writers, music, religion, or just pure romantic love.That's where this film comes in. Its theme-"love conquers all"- is not about romance-but about true LOVE. This film is all about staying true to the essence of its theme. If you're talking about "love" during this time(1992-4), you're not talking about any "areas" around it- like romance, lover's quarrel, jealousy, self-doubt. It's not about enhancing the faces of your film's attractive leads; Brandon Lee's face is mostly covered in make-up and similarly Sofia Shinas is barely shown, but when she finally is it is only her face-she is more like an angel than an attractive woman. Point being that everything needed to make an action/horror film was there. But it's like the director wanted to show how he deliberately ignored these aspects and remained loyal to his theme.Sarah and Officer Albrecht are plot thickeners and serve to give the film a modern perspective, so they are shown as realistically as possible. But all the "bad"-guys are purposely unrealistic, they are shown as symbols for you to HATE-out of pure emotion. You don't want them in the slammer, you want their evil out of this world.This film is like a landmark in a temporary (American-I can't speak for other countries) pop culture between 1992&amp;4. Kurt Cobain's suicide, Real World London, Live, Pearl Jam's zenith of pop influence, Nine Inch Nails, STP...this is the era when some young kids today (and older folks who passed by this era) complain we took ourselves too seriously. It was right before grunge supposedly"died" and before humour and obsolete issues came back into rap and rock; before new-wave "punk". Financial gain/monetary value was shunned during this short-lived culture, because it didn't have to do with human emotion. Incidentally the "bad guys" of this film aren't out for money, just for the glory of madness, anarchy, and hate.There is a line in The Crow where Eric tells Albrecht, upon fond reflection:"Little things used to mean so much to Shelly. I used to think they were kind of trivial. Believe me-nothing's trivial."There was a little gap in pop culture history, reminding us how important love and classic literature was, and how youthful optimism and love could be combined with negative attitudes(like anger,sadness, and vengeance) to create a character everyone could identify with. This is the time when "nothing was trivial"-the "important" stuff mattered, a feeling to which music of the time consequently made a huge impact. Nothing was done without thought, so words could make you fall in love or cry.If there ever was a film that could reflect this confusing and beautiful revival of the Romantic Period, The Crow is the movie. It will take you back. This is the only film that I wish could've lasted longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful and sad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow is a dark and sad film. It tells the story of a young couple who are murdered on Halloween. The film then jumps to a year later. Brandon Lee's character Eric Draven returns from the dead to avenge his death and to "put the wrong things right". His return is made possible because as legend says a crow takes a person from the land of the living to the land of the dead, but sometimes when a terrible evil has been committed the soul can't rest. Thus the crow allows Eric to return.The film has really good acting in it, especially Brandon Lee. It is really sad to watch him knowing that he died while filming the movie. I think he could have been a really great actor and dominates the film. Ernie Hudson also does a great job as the good police man who does his best to do the right thing and help people, even though it means he gets in trouble with his boss.Overall this is a great movie. It is both sad to watch and serves as a constant reminder that life is precious and no really know how much time they have left on earth. A must see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far one of the greatest films of all time. The set design was fantastic to the last detail. The costume design was superb, the cinematography was excellent, and the acting ranged from good to great. As for the story...A man coming back from the dead to avenge he and his wife's murder at the hands of a ruthless street gang...it isn't what it first appears to be. Brandon Lee's character is not some machine gun toting, mindless zombie, but a confused man who at first dosen't even realise what happened to him. You watch as his development into the ultimate dark hero unfolds before your eyes. This film has a very dark atmosphere, which is accented by the hero, who is just as dark as the world he inhabits. Dark, yes, but evil Brandon Lee's character certaintly is not.(spoiler ahead) Other then avenging his lovers's murder,The Crow also helps a little girl and her heroine addicted mother, which gives a back drop for one of the greatest lines in film history. ( Brandon Lee holds the little girl's mother who has been neglecting her, as he uses some magick to make her body reject the morphine she had just injected, and he says 'look at yourself, your're a mother..."MOTHER MEANS GOD OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF CHILDREN'"This is more of a love story for men, who, unlike women, a more affected by the duty and honor part of being in love, where as women seem to care only for childish "romance" stuff ( Titanic). I think men more so then women would understand this timeless story of revenge in the name of the one you would ( and in this case, did) die for.</fullReview>

The soundtrack (The Cure, Stone Temple Pilots), the cast, the director, to the last person just exquisite.PS I only approve to this movie to be THE CROW. The sequels aren't even worth watching. I cannot understand how they could screw up the excellent original.

		<fullReview>While the crow should work on many levels, the underlying factor explicitly contained throughout the whole movie is the over whelming sense of horror and sheer dread when you think of what really happened to lee, during this movie. how can we consider it light entertainment when one of the scenes features Brandon digging himself out of the grave? How can we enjoy ourselves when at the end we see Draven return to a seemingly blissful eternal rest, when we know that the life of the films star was cut short just before the completion of the film? The DVD extras are even more distrubing, particularly one that features an interview with Brandon, made a few days before his death. Brandon looks happy and cheerful, and is happily relating to the camera the fun he is having while making the movie, and how it is a very philosophical movie, and it makes you ponder about life and death - how can we even watch that interview when we know what happened to Brandon? The saddest part of all is that underneath the goth make-up, brandon is unequivocally unrecognisable throughout the entire movie - for such a great star's final film, it is impossible to tell it is even him - there is only one clear shot of him in the whole film, and perhaps that is the most disturbing factor. The films final dedication, the simple 'For Brandon and Eliza' is tragic to read, because while it appears to be so short and sweet, implicitly embedded within it is the death of Brandon and the immence sorrow his fiance must have felt. This movie is almost unwatchable, because of what happened to brandon. Unless you have a fascination with sick, twisted thing, you should avoid it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1993's "The Crow" was a film that I remember seeing commercials to and never being fully in-love with it when it came out. It was dark and it was jumpy and it didn't fully grasp me as well as "Die Hard" or other action movies would. Yes, Brandon Lee died during the shoot of this film but what was the big deal?The "big deal" was when I sat down to watch the film. The gothic setting of a burnt out city (Detroit - it seems) that was the essence of decay. And yet within the essence of decay was this bright and shining love that was tragically destroyed all in the name of Anarchy.Alex Proyas, the films director, worked a cast of B-movie stars and several low-quality sets and scenes and knitted a visual masterpiece, completing the film in spite having the lead actor killed and not being able to complete his scenes (which is not new in Hollywood, but still a director challenge). Proyas deserves all the kudos in the world for his work on this film.Brandon Lee makes a memorable last-call to cinema as the shadowy, kindred soul of Eric Draven, on a quest to put right the wrongs of his murder. While watching some of his scenes, one has to wonder just where Brandon's career would have taken him after this movie came into public view?This movie is one of the cult classics that will go on for ages. Though there have been sequels to this, the original film, there will never be anything that comes close to "The Crow".</fullReview>

After reading lots of reviews on this site it seems that people just cant wait to rag on a movie. This movie has several things that are worth seeing. One is the lack of the colour blue and how that creates a 'black n white' feel to a colour movie. Had Brandon Lee not been killed during the filming, this would have been his breakthrough role. The tech challenges of finishing up a movie in which the lead actor is no longer living is an amazing process in and of itself. While the music in the soundtrack isn't my bad, I do not hate the film because of that. The acting is nicely done and the movie delivers a few fun lines such as villain Top Dollar's "Are we havin' fun or what!?" As a whole this movie works and works well. Seeing Brandon Lee screaming as he claws out of his grave leaves the viewer with a real uneasy feeling and perhaps it should be that way. This is not a movie about happy people going about their happy little lives. If you enjoy dark fantasy movies with a fun sense of humor then check this movie out. =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Love Is Forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is often classified as a horror movie, or an action movie. But that's not what it's about. The main theme of this movie is love, and how "when two people are meant to be together, nothing can keep them apart". Although violent, dark, and gritty, this film captures the strength of the love Eric and Shelly shared. Eric is the anti-hero, played brilliantly by the late Brandon Lee. His mission is simple--revenge. But along the way, love gets involved, the love for Shelly, and for his friend Sarah. This is a really excellent movie, with a strong theme. The violence puts off some people, but I think if you give the movie a chance and see how the violence is justified, you'll be glad you saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my opinion, the best film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow has got to be my favorite film ever. It has everything: intense plot, fascinating characters, dark atmosphere, fabulous soundtrack (both the songs and score, which I highly recommend) and great quotes.I love every character in the movie, even the gang members stand out individually in some way and don't come off as "just bad guys" as in the horrid sequel. Eric is a great character, somewhat crazy, tortured and sympathetic. Top Dollar makes a fantastic nemesis, he's an interesting character and has lots of great lines.Despite the dark atmosphere, the message is beautiful: true love an conquer even death. This film is definitely worth watching....over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric And Exciting Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow was probably the best film of 1994. It was dark, exciting and something very different.The late Brandon Lee played Eric Draven (The Crow) who returned from the grave to extract revenge against murderous thugs. The film succeeds on so many levels. The action is exciting and the villains are very intriguing. The pessimistic and gloomy production is helped along by a depressing soundtrack. This film really is dark.I've only seen this film once and it kind of bothered me watching it because I kept thinking about Brandon Lee's life cut short in tragic circumstances. The fact that Brandon Lee died whilst the film is in production makes it even more gloomy.All in all, I recommend this film...unless you're feeling real down in which case I would probably recommend something lighter like Mary Poppins or 101 Dalmations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**** out of five</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This is the movie that started it all, but two sequals and a TV show later this one still ranks as the best. The son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, Brandon Lee stars as Eric Draven a musician who along with his girlfriend are brutally murdered on devil's night. Draven then returns from the dead to seek vengance one his killers one by one. It is amazing how the death of Lee halfway through the film did not effect his performance in the least bit. It is just to bad Lee had to die because it would have been nice to see him come back for a sequal, he was the only actor to really get the caracter perfect. The film is very dark and disturbing, everthing has a black tint to it and it is set in a trashy slum like part of a city. Lee gives a dead on and very creepy, almost gothic performance as he violently kills off his murderes. Michael Wincott also wins the award for most unitentially hilarious line when he says " Here's an impresseion, caw caw bang f**k I'm dead." This movie is not for all tastes due to its very dark and unsettling atmosphere for for everyone looking for a good action/horror picture this one rank amoung the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The modern world of the big screen is more often than not absolute pants, and it's not everyday you get to see a modern film that truly knocks your socks off.Neither is it everyday you find one that nearly kills you it's so damn good! But 'The Crow' is, in my opinion, the finest film ever made. Brandon Lee excels in his final role, echoing his father with an eerie sense of fate. Ernie Hudson is brilliant as ever - hell this man made 'Congo' worth watching so he's bound to make 'The Crow' even better. Other members of the cast, notably Michael Wincott and Tony Todd also add their acting brilliance, but they could amount to nothing without a great script.The truth is, the script for this film is electrifying. As I write this, the site's quote of the day is from 'The Crow'. I'm reminded of great lines like 'Halloween ain't till Manyana' (if that's how ya spell it) and 'Jesus Christ walks into an inn, hands the innkeeper three nails and says - can you put me up for the night' and above all the haunting 'It can't rain all the time'.Everything about this film is superb. I watch it as little as possible because I don't want it spoiled and turned into an everyday film I enjoy. When I watch 'The Crow' I want it to be the same special movie it always has been, and for that reason, it always will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a finely directed film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As everyone already knows, actor Brandon Lee, son of Bruce, was accidentally killed during the filming of The Crow. His character in the film, Eric Draven, makes a spectacular return from the dead, making the coincidence all the more eerie. Lee actually died when hit with live ammunition during the filming of a shoot-out, but the living-dead Draven is magically healed each time a bad guy blasts him. Sticks and stones won't break his bones, and bullets will never harm him. Evidently, a double has been used to fill in the scenes that remained to be filmed at the time of the accident, but the movie is so shadowy and Lee's features so obscured by makeup that it is hard to tell what was done after the star's demise. Some computer trickery was also employed. The comic strip-inspired, action-packed adventure is quite something to see. The Crow is an art decorator/production designer's dream and should have been an Oscar contender. The MTVish direction is of the cut-and-run variety, but that is understandable when you read Alex Proyas's credits. He has directed commercials for Nike, Swatch, Nissan and Kleenex. The story is really secondary to the showy style. Draven and his girlfriend are murdered by thugs who invade their inner-city apartment. On a dark and stormy night that follows, Eric steps out of his grave and goes for revenge. Wearing black lip gloss, straggly curls and white pancake makeup, Lee looks a bit like a mime moonlighting as Michael Jackson. Accompanied by a big crow, the vengeful Eric sets about ridding his neighborhood of the resident lowlife. The dark and disturbing urban fantasy about a boy and his bird turns out to be more Death Wish than Edward Scrissorhands.</fullReview>

Each sequence is so carefully choreographed and performed so well that you find yourself believing everything that this movie tells you. In the spirit of the crow, in top dollar, in Eric and shelly. Love surviving death is a classic genre of movies, but with the twist that this movie has, it brings a new look to an old story. The crow being the light and erics eyes and the tunnel towards shelly that he slowly has to fulfil with his own dreams. i believe that this movie will last for generations, and that the story of the crow will go on forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And that quote from the film really sums it up. My favourite movie of all times. I've seen many many movies, and still none can measure up with The Crow. It's a true love story, pure and honest love, and the revenge part only highlights it. I don't agree with people/critics who said that this film was an incitement to violence. You can't say that if you've watched and immersed yourself in the movie. It's not about revenge, it's about finding peace. The crow brings Eric back, and he does just that, he finds peace. And sometimes finding peace means having to kill people (who deserved it by the way, but that's just my opinion). Anyway, this movie has it all: great actors, great directing, a fantastic atmosphere that carries all the right emotions and feelings, a must-buy soundtrack (if you listen to it really carefully, you can replay the whole film in your head, it's that powerful).And I don't think that this film would have received a less enthusiastic critic had Brandon Lee not died. It's a tragedy that he did, but that's not the reason why this movie is so great. Go see it, if you haven't. No need to read the comics before, but if you want, they're good too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie Miracle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When considering this movie, you have to keep in mind the fact that the lead actor was killed before his scenes were finished. That being the case, its a miracle this film was even completed. As for the finished product, Alex Proyas "The Crow" holds up well as a supernatural/action movie. What makes this a special event though is the unforgettable acting of the late Brandon Lee and supporting actress Rochelle Davis. They both add an emotional depth to their scenes that is sorely lacking amongt the rest of the cast. Lee's Eric Draven is a fascinating character, part frightening, part tragedy. Everytime Brandon is on the screen the movie is taken to another level. His acting is so superb, not perfect but so heartfelt and passionate, its impossible not to think about what might of been had Brandon Lee lived. Rochelle's character of Sara is surprisingly rich and filled with emotion and range. This being her first acting role, it comes as a shock that she manages to carry the film's narrative so well. Like Brandon Lee, Davis puts heart and energy into her every scene. And their acting keeps "The Crow" from becoming simply an escapist special effects film with no feeling (like "City of Angels" and "Stairway to Heaven)."All in all, the first Crow movie is both an enigma and a cult classic. It would of been so much better had Lee lived to finish his work. The recent DVD "Collectors Edition" offers a glimpse of the what that might of looked like. In one particular "bonus scene," the newly reborn Draven encounters a woman who just escaped imprisonment at Arcade Games. Lee's acting in this scene is so moving that we can only imagine how great he'd of been as the alive and well, Eric Draven sans Crow make up. The main thing is that "The Crow" got released at all. Its a great testament to the brilliance of Brandon Lee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fitting, final testament to Brandon Lee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I often wonder if Brandon Lee had not died during the filming of this movie would I feel the same about it. Probably not, because the incident that occured that March in 1993 only added to the dark allure of this film. The movie is about a man who loses his life, and has to watch the woman he loves lose hers. The movie is based on a comic book, written by a man who lost the woman he loved. Brandon Lee was about to marry his fiance, when he was killed filming The Crow. All of this only adds to the allure of one of the darkest, and creepiest films I've seen. If you haven't seen this film, you might want to read about the events that helped form this project. At the end of the film, all you can do is shake your head at the irony, and cruelty of life. There is not one scene that is not tinged with sorrow, and the essence of death. But, I understand why Mr. Lee's family agreed to have it released. It shows what could have been the beginning of a great talent. If you don't like the constant presence of death, then this is not the film for you. Even after the film is over, you are haunted by the fact that you have even seen it. The soundtrack is the brightest spot about the movie. It's great, and complements the film perfectly. If Brandon Lee's mother had not supported this film, I would not have gone to see it, because I think his death could have been prevented, and why should the movie studio profit from his death. His mother did support the film, and I know why, when I see it. The film is very violent, but that didn't bother me as much as the creepy, and ironic nature of the film. If you don't mind that, and like good music, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first of all, let me start off by saying that vladimir grozescu is totally wrong about this movie and the so called "hypocritical vigilante justice" it supposedly propagates. many other critics have said the same thing, that lee's character in this movie is despicable because he avenges the heinous murder of himself and his fiancee. i might be alone in this, but i enjoyed every second of watching these scumbags get what they deserved, and i would even go so far as to say that they didn't get it severely or painfully enough. if somehow you were resurrected and remembered that a group of thugs and predatory monsters had raped and killed the woman you loved and then yourself, i don't think you would just want to talk things over. should we act on every vengeful impulse we have? of course not. if we are snubbed by someone, verbally mistreated, ignored, we have no right to resort to physical violence--but rape and murder are different things indeed. if you shed tears over the death of these thoroughly evil, depraved animals, let me be the first to tell you that your sensibilities are a bit jaded. if i had a daughter and something like this happened to her i for one would do exactly what eric draven does in this film. that might sound amoral or cynical, but i guess some of those bleeding heart idealists like vladimir out there have to come to terms with the obvious fact that there are some situations in life that just aren't rosy red and that cannot be sugar coated. and while i agree that this movie is *slightly* overrated, i still think lee had great potential and would have matured into a much better actor than he was when this was filmed. i hardly dispute the fact that he was no robert de niro, but for an actor of his age and experience he was unusually convincing. he makes the character come to life and does so passionately. the atmosphere is appropriately dark and bleak, the story is involving and entertaining, and this is far above the average comic book film to say the least. vladimir must have pretty low expectations for movies if he recommends the subspecies films, which are utter cheese and trash and none of which hold a candle to this movie. he also recommends "the mangler", and this convinced me that he was just trying to p*** fans of the crow off by recommending other movies, since "the mangler" is undoubtedly one of the most embarrassingly bad and inadvertently hilarious failures i have ever seen. i am not a 'goth' by any means but i do find the gothic subculture interesting, and i would say that this film is an excellent example of what a gothic-type movie should be. sure, you can say that this is an MTV music video without being completely wrong, but why can't we enjoy the occasional music video movie without getting all critical and anal about it? it makes excellent use of the soundtrack and it complements the film perfectly. this movie came together well, and anyone who likes cult movies will enjoy this despite it's share of corny and pretentious scenes and lines. in short, this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very difficult thing to write about. Not least because the star Brandon Lee died whilst making this film in a stunt gone wrong.More eerie is the subject matter this film tackles - Death. Lee plays a character by the name of Eric Draven who is murdered, along with his girlfriend Shelly. He is brought back for one night, exactly a year after his death to avenge the killing of himself and his beloved.I know that the actual plot for this film is very Cliché. I know that avenging the death of your beloved is nothing new. This film however is VERY special.Does the fact that Brandon Lee died whilst making this film make it (for want of another word) better? No, it doesn't. The tragic death of Lee, and to a certain extent, the untimely death of his father Bruce Lee does add more poignancy to the film, especially his last interview in which he describes living life to the full because you don't know how much longer you have. Not knowing how many more sun rises or full moons you will have the opportunity not only to see, but to appreciate and savour the importance of.Why do I love this film? Why is this film so great? It carries a message with it. It isn't just about shooting people. It is about appreciating what you have and making the most of what you have.Eric was a guy who had found his soul mate. Brandon was a guy who found his soul mate. He was due to marry just before he was kiiled. And the tragic thing is his death SHOULD have been avoided. He was shot by an actor whilst filming his Death seen. The arms guy had gone home because they couldn't afford to pay him to stay and spervise the use of the weapons.This film almost never got completed which would have been a real shame for everyone involved, especially the movie watching public. After Lee's death the movie was suspended for 6 months. Eventually, as a tribute to Brandon, they decided to complete the movie and did an excellent job of bringing the dream to life. Lee described this movie as the only movie he has ever been proud of making. And I think everyone who has seen the movie is proud of him.I am not making my case very well but this film is special to me on many levels. The love Eric Feels. The Message he carries about death and about love. This film will blow you away.My favourite quote (from memory so it may not be perfect)'Mother is the name for God on the hearts and lips of all Children'See? This film carries many messages that have great significance to many people...Watch it, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After all the hype...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film shot to fame before release due to the untimely death of Brandon Lee. Subsequently it was launched to a frenzy of media hype, and I avoided it like the plague.Well, 6 years later I was finally persuaded to watch it. Brilliant. Fantastic. It's funny, fast and loud, dark, moody and violent (but stylishly violent). I wish I'd seen it in the cinema in the first place.Don't ask why it's good - just watch it and see.Now if someone could arrange a widescreen transfer for Region2 DVD?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the screenplay was a marvelous translation of the comic- in fact, it propels the soul of the comic to it's full potential. The screenwriter is worthy of great praises for his use of the characters, whom I believe find more depth in the movie then the original books themselves.The movie is excellent as a stand alone project, anyone unfamiliar with the books could watch and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only bad thing about this film was the tragic death of Brandon Lee during it's filming.This film stands alone not only for the comic book movie genre but for all movies.The story flows from beginning to end,the acting is flawless from Brandon's portrayal of Eric Draven to Ernie Hudson's portrayal of a semi-lost cop.The supporting cast was outstanding,the consumate bad-guy David Patrick Kelly, who hasn't played that intense a character since The Warriors and the rest of his gang added a believable nastiness to their roles and the movie.This film is not only a must see it is a must own!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Proyas's "The Crow" was an amazing piece of work. "The Crow" is on the surface a brutal and unforgiving tale of vengeance, that somehow transforms itself into a truly touching Gothic romance. And the tragedy of it all is that it was both a milestone performance and the last performance of Brandon Lee. Brandon totally commands the screen. He had true screen presence. Charismatic. Handsome. He was an excellent martial artist, who had the grace of a dancer. Lee gave Eric Draven a soul. You understand his anger and sadness. His relationship in the world of the living with Sarah (Rochelle Davis) is both touching and moving. Through Lee's performance you get that ultimately this path of violence and vengeance is really about his undying love for Shelly (Sofia Shinas). Brandon Lee will forever remain young in the movies. He would have been the next great martial arts superstars... and he would have become a gifted actor. There is sense of loss in this.</fullReview>

Read on to see what I got.!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!We open up with police investigating the murder of a rockstar and his girlfriend. The rock star, played by the late Brandon Lee, is resurrected and gets his revenge on his murderers. With the help of a young girl and a cop he fullfils his destiny.Good story, acting, and visuals. ***1/2 out of *****. Also, the sequels are weaker than the one before, but are still pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting Gothic Action (perhaps *SPOILER*)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very enjoyable, haunting movie with surreal and dark design, atmosphere, and camerawork. It's gritty, it's gothic, it's dark, and it's ominous. It takes place in a dark, foreboding urban hell somewhere, with Brandon Lee avenging the death of his fiancee by a crew of criminals. The shadowy, haunting, and surreally gothic imagery that is the most interesting part of the film includes blood running through pipes, broken down urban turrets, gray skies, small, desecated flats, circular windows, and cemetaries. A slightly surreal gothic action, ominous and shadowy atmosphere, and Brandon Lee's great performance as the Crow. The basic plot is that a group of criminals kill Brandon Lee and his fiancee on Devil's Night, and Brandon Lee rises from the grave to avenge her death. Also, a crow sees for him. The action scenes in which he kills the criminals are super cool and filmed fantastically. It has a lot of great dialogue. A truly great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. The dark mood, the action, the acting of the entire cast, the music scores by Graeme Revell, the music from "the cure" and "nine inch nails". Even if the story was a little bit simple (Eric Draven comes back from the death to avenge his loved one), i still love this film. I found it sad that Lee died during this film because in my book he was going to be the best action star of the decade. I gave this movie a 10 because I found a 6.9 a very weak rating for this perfect film. And I still can't believe that there are 227 people giving this movie a 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say enough about this film. It is one of my all-time favorite films. After reading the comic book by James O'Barr, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this film (thanks for letting me borrow your copies of the comic book, Matt!). What a pity Brandon Lee was killed midway through production...I would have loved to see more of his work. The dark nature of the film and its hero might not appeal to everyone, but for me it was right on the money. I find the movie fascinating and moving every time I view it. Yes, I said "moving" because I can feel the hero's pain and torment. Hey, how would you feel after coming back from the dead to avenge the murder of your one true love? As far as comic-book-to-big-screen adaptations go, this one gets the mood and feel of the original comics perfect. Great film. If you only see one "Crow" film, see this one. All others are pale imitations of this film's greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>tragic as it is that brandon lee died near the conclusion of the production, there was no other man that could've played eric draven. a brilliant death + resurrection + revenge + sorrow - sanity plot drives this film to the very top of my list of over 600 films seen. of course a lot went into this masterpiece besides lee. none of this would have been possible without james o barr, the creator of the crow comic the movie is based on. the directorial (to my knowledge) debut of alex proyas proved to be the most impressive one i have ever viewed. supporting cast ernie hudson(burnt out beat cop albrecht), rochelle davis (sara-the lost yet streetsmart kid), david patrick kelly (t-bird, ringleader of the gang of thugs that do draven in), and michael wincott (top dollar, the overlord of the city's crime), in his best role to date, add momentum and structure to an already spectactular story. the soundtrack was dead on as well, which combines the likes of nine inch nails, the cure, henry rollins, helmet, and pantera with the actual score composed by graeme revell. the crow is one of few films where everything came together...almost.rating- god-like. please, if you have a DVD player, be sure to buy/rent the collector's edition discs and check out all the extras that include: interview with o barr (really emotional stuff here), interviews with cast (lee, hudson, kelly...etc), deleted scenes montage (includes missing skull cowboy scene).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best, Most Resourceful Comic Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the many reviews here, I found that far too few mention the astounding resourcefulness of director Alex Proyas; yes, Brandon Lee was good (note: Michael Wincott was better), yes there is a gleeful amount of menacing action and, surprisingly, some well-rounded characters and bits of clever dialogue, as opposed to the pun-filled Batman Returns (and should go away again)...but considering the fact that this film cost 6 million dollars to make-the cheapest of the Burton/Schumacher Batman films cost 80 million-and that it maintained a level of frenetic energy to rival, and often succeed, any of the Batman films is a testament to his ability. I agree with most of what was already said here: better than average comic-adaptation with a script that doesn't go out of its way to insult the intelligence of its audience, a tragic, pensive mood prevalent throughout a story that could have easily evolved into a revenge epic ala Chuck Bronson...but the fact it was done for six million dollars is truly staggering-Proyas should have a sizeable bulk of Hollywood eating out of his hand for how well he can stretch a budget. Added note: 'Hannibal' costs 87 million; hopefully this puts Proyas achievement into perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Crow" tells the classic tale, of a man having revenge on the wrong-doers of his life. There are a few twists though. For one the man is killed in the beginning of the film, hence having to come back from the dead, helped by a crow. Now we have a classic tale, with a touch of urban legend.This guy is completely twisted in mind and soul, as he mourns for his true love, that died with him. That's a dash of romance right there. Naturally there's villian. This villian is also a bit on the edgy side of the human psyche. With remarks as "My father once told me that childhood is over the day you know you're gonna die", he's not the guy you want crashing in at your birthday-party. Although intelligent and wise, you get the feeling that him dying, wouldn't be all that bad, for the world as we know it. Madness and philosophy is added. Then there's the whole enviorment, that Mr. Proyas can create. It IS amazing. The dark world, that makes the urban streets feel unsafe, and yet interesting. Reminds me of Blade Runner, but that might just be the rain.Time to sum up, people: We have our classic tale of revenge, tweaked with urban legend, the right enviorment, romance, madness and philosophy. That's kinda shakespeare, hence the 9, I'm giving this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> I saw this film a long time ago. It really moved me. I remember picking up the comic for it too. They are both very extrodinary works. It is very ironic that Brandon Lee died on the set of a film about dying. But I am very happy Alex Proyas finally decided to release the final cut of it. One thing I have read on this site is people calling this a "gothic" film. I would have to disagree. I am not gothic in the least bit and I absolutely loved the film. One time my friend came over, and he is what you woulod call a "jock", he absolutely loved it too. About every five minutes he would turn to me and be like, "This is awesome". I have seen many of Brandon Lee's other films. I must say, they are pretty bad. I'm very happy he found a project that he was proud of doing and he had passion for. Because if he would have died on the set of any other movie he would have not been remembered as much as he is today. At the end of the tape is his last interview. You could tell he was very passionate about this film. The way he spoke of it was in a way of pure joy. And one thing that he said I love him for. He said that what really intriqued him about the film was the fact that his character was dead. He said there were no boundaries as an actor, you couldn't predict how a dead man would act.  I happen to be one of the few that enjoyed the sequels. Of course they are not anywhere near the brilliance of this film. But they are good, cheap, entertaining, raining Sunday movies. 9/10</fullReview>

It drips from beginning to end with stunning visuals and a script that that shows that someone put some thought into the story and how it would translate to the screen from the comic.Brandon Lee is brilliant and the film is fitting tribute to a great actor who suffered being sidelined as a kung fu actor. This shows how good he would have been had his life not been cruelly cut short while making this film.This film should be a benchmark for everyone trying to make an action film as its shows that an action film can have great acting, a brilliant script and be more than a collection of fight scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cool. Action packed. Sad. Memorable. Inspiring. Epic.Indeed those words describe "the Crow" very well. The story is a simple one. Eric Draven and Shelley Webster are a couple deeply in love. On the night before their wedding, they are murdered by the local mob/gang for fighting apartment evictions in their building. Eric tries to protect Shelley, but fails. Thus he has to watch his girlfriend being brutally beaten, raped, and left for dead before he is hurled out his window and killed by a deadly five story plunge.Stuff like that happens in the world often. Too often. "The Crow" asks the question...what if there were a way for the victim to gain retribution? A way for the savage monsters that killed him and the ones he loved to be brought to the harshest type of justice.Of course, everyone knows what happens next. Eric Draven, played by the great Brandon Lee, returns from the grave to seek vengeance on his killers so he can be reunited with Shelley. Brandon Lee was great in the film, showing Eric's many sides. He also is loaded with charisma. Though Vincent Perez and Eric Mabius have done the role justice, Lee was the best to put on the make-up.Also in the film, we have Rochelle Davis who gives a great performance especially for a child actor. It's heart breaking to see her when she realizes what has happened to Shelley and Eric, the only people to ever care about her. Ernie Hudson plays the cop in the movie. A good man who stayed with a dying Shelley until the very end. He provides comic relief through out the film, but is also very good. They don't rave about Hudson when they talk about this film, but he should. The villains in the film, though not the most 3D, are very good at being complete @$$holes. Especially Michael Wincott as the gang boss Top Dollar. He is certainly the best villain to grace a comic book movie.All in all, this film is the total package. Lots of action. A touch of humor. Memorable characters and images. A beautiful Love story. Always sad. Very much a classic and definitely my favorite film. I recommend this to anyone who loves movies. Don't listen to those who labels it as "gothic". The film looks dark, but it's the kind of movie almost anyone could get into.10 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the spring of 1994 I watched in amazement at my glowing television to see the news that "The Crow" - the film which claimed the life of young Brandon Lee - was to be released in May. The Crow is a visual masterpiece in which we learn that: even in times of great brutality and sorrow, love can conquer all things and survive beyond the grave. This film is one of the best adaptations of a comic book to film, some other notables being Superman and Batman. But never have the others been so raw in there presentation to the audience or as poetic. This is the story of a rock musician (Eric Draven) and his fiance (Shelley Webster) who are to be married on Halloween but with one knock at the door their lives are shattered. The Crow is the image of a soul brought back to avenge the murder of a loved one, a murder so violent that it haunts that soul even in death. This film is truly not for everyone, it is violent and boasts that it is "Darker than the Bat" in reference to Batman. The film will leave you with a feeling of closure and completion, that the actions of the evil of the world do not go unpunished.I recommend The Crow to everyone and for those who like the film I also recommend reading the graphic novel by James O'Barr. This film will make you cheer and make you angry, and in that respect it accomplishes what many thers have failed in doing and that is enthral the viewer into the world that is created by the actors and the directors of the film. Just before the credits role there is a brief note from Linda Lee Cadwell (Brandon Lee's mother) and Edward R. Pressman (the films Producer) it says "To Brandon and Eliza" for those that understand, this will be the image that will impact you the most. Happy viewing. "Sometimes, just sometimes that soul can come back.....to put the wrong things write."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What we have here is a film made ten years after it might have been done. I'm sure that this film would have become a classic if it were made on the 80's, as it shows very well the spirit of the decade.It's a great show, a video-clip perfectly directed by Alex Proyas, whit drama and impacting action scenes, helped by a fantastic BSO, which fits the story perfectly (including a beautiful theme from The Cure).The characters are well written, much more than will be needed for a film like this. The script, mix of a fairy tale and a futuristic western, is full of one-lines that give it lot of strength. The acting is as good as necessary, especially the bad boy played by Michael Wincott. The photography is great and the ambientation (the city looks a little like Burton's Gotham City) is as gothic as the rest of the film.Enjoying this film is so simple as viewing it. If you lived the 80's, you will understand why I think so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&lt;The Crow&gt; is one of my favourite films of all time. It is a perfect example of how emotion and character development can overcome all other things that may be lacking in a film. I feel the acting is perfect. Anyone who doesn't feel for Erik(and yes, Brandon's presence, fortunately or unfortunately makes that feeling for us moviegoers stronger) must have a heart made of lead. WHAT I LOVE MOST OF ALL ABOUT THE CROW (besides Brandon Lee) is the fact that people can't judge what this movie is by its "cover". Who would've thought from watching the previews and hearing the plot, that this movie will make you fall in love with the concept of "love" and "soulmates" and the phrase "buildings may burn, people die, but real love is forever." This film was strong enough to create a whole underground neo-goth scene. I remember because I was 13, and no way did those black nail polish-wearing, black-haired, teardrop-tattooed, leather-pants-wearing guys come around until after that movie. At least in the Sates. I can swear by that statement. Those reading this have probably either not seen the film or have not seen it in a long time. To either scenario I'd like to say that you need to watch this film again. Hell, *I* need to watch it again. It will restore your faith in love. Seeing beautiful Shelly and Erik together, adorable, you'll want that soulmate of your own.Good luck and take care.Sep</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that I was caught up in the irony of Lee's death, but I have to let the movie stand on its own. I was glad to see the relationship between Eric and Shelley (and even Sarah) given so much screen time. If you have not seen this movie, you should, but don't expect a hero made of goodness and light. He is moved by emotion, not a desire to do be an upstanding citizen. Watch especially for the scene in which Eric tells the cop not to touch him. This was a very emotional scene, with a painful flashback. The action scenes are good, too, and since Draven was supernatural, nobody can claim they were overdone. Usually when heroes walk or run through a full spread of bullets, Hollywood is stretching our suspension of disbelief. This movie gets around that by using immortality (or something very close to it). I hate to echo other's reviews, but I too believe that Lee would have gone on to stardom. He was showing signs of improved acting in The Crow, and obviously already had a command over his physical presence. Thank you for making this film, and for deciding to release it in spite of Lee's death. It turned out to be a monument to him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mistic and magic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a movie that has a complex feelings of drama, romance, violence, and revenge in a typical scenary of gothic atmosphere, and the main hing that completes all this negative atmosphere is the sarcastic music played with a huge sense of death. All this environment has a lot of symbolism, when his revenge begins in a halloween´s night, called the devil´s night, because he thinks that he is the evil himself but a good one, the evil of justice who will kill one by one the spirits who took his love and his life. Another symbol it is his name Eric Draven, Draven means crow in a human way of judge his personality, the crow it is the symbol of justice and balance of human actions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a brillant movie. I consider at one of the top ten movies that i like. The reason I wanted to watch this was because that the lead actor died during the shooting of the movie. But when I watched this I was amazed by the camerawork and the atmosphere which is set in the movie. The plot is that a man who was brutally murdered by a vicious gang, cames back to life to seek revenge those who killed himself and his wife. With the help of the crow, he is invincible. The late yet great Brandon Lee was so good in this movie, he could easily be mistaken for actually being The Crow. There is too much words to describe this movie, so instead I advise you to watch this movie. P.S May Brandon Lee rest in peace</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well, i only saw this film recently and i was totally blown away by it. the story-about a man (Brandon lee) coming back from the dead to avenge him and his fiancees murder was good, and brandon lee was fantastic in his role as Eric Draven. its a real tragedy that he died so young and so full of promise. the freaky thing is that Brandon Lee had to be 'literally brought back from the dead' in computerised sequences to finish the movie. he was accidentally killed in one of the 'flash back ' scenes by a gun shot by the actor playing 'fun boy'. getting back to the film, i dont believe in praising an actor simply because their dead, but it does give a certain eerie sadness to the role.the loctaion, music and supporting acting was great and i definately reccomend it. its sad, funny, stylish and action packed. it really gives us alot to think about after weve seen it, if your into that, but even not, i havent met anyone whose disliked it (yet!)if you can go see it i totally recommend it. one of the best films ive seen in a long while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite film ever!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have loved this film since I first saw it in 1996. Brandon played the character of Eric with shear precision. His role here was unlike anything he had done before (Laser Mission, Rapid Fire, Showdown in Little Tokyo). He did not use a great deal of martial arts in this film which made the fight scenes spectacular. Instead of attacking with skill he fights with raw emotion.Michael Wincott was great as yet another bad guy (Alien 4, Metro, The Three Musketeers). He was very sinister and comical at the same time, something rare among actors.Ernie Hudson was good as Albrecht. Rochelle Davis was superb as Sarah (which suprised me to find this is her only film).Production designer Alex McDowell deserves alot of credit for the set designs in this. Graeme Revell mastered another great soundtrack (The Crow : City Of Angels, From Dusk Till Dawn). Also, Alex Proyas did a magnificant job directing this. It has a dark and depressing setting which suits the story. If Pressman and Most hired Proyas to direct the sequel instead of Tim Pope it would have been alot more successful.All things considered it has to be the greatest film ever. It is a shame Brandon Lee had to die just as his career was about to sky rocket. He was a great actor. He will be missed by both the movie industry and his devoted fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetic and breathtaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the most intense cinematography and poetic irony ever. As everyone knows, Lee died during the filming, and the irony of his character returning to avenge his own death should not be lost on the viewer.It is true that the plot of the movie is not on par with "American Beauty" or "The Godfather" but Proyas' directing and Wolski's cinematography are incredible. The cast all deliver good performances with Lee's probably being the weakest, but still quite acceptable. He had trouble displaying mixed emotions, but most of his scenes were very believable in part because of directing, in part cinematography.The action scenes range from beautiful and poetic, to intense and powerful, to bloody and fast-paced. The only thing that could have made them even the slightest bit better would have been some consultation by John Woo.The character development is quite well done, although I wish we had more about Albrecht. Sarah and Darla are developed well, Eric and his love of Shelly, and even Top Dollar is shown with emotion. O'Barr's writing of the characters is very well done.I need to take a moment to comment on the score. Graeme Revell made the most incredible musical score to ever accompany an action movie. The passion and drama in the percussive action tracks and the aching strings in the introspective periods serve as wonderful punctuation to a great statement of filmmaking.Finally, the worst part about the Crow. The sequel. Do not even waste your time. The only good part of the second movie is the recitation of the English dictation rhyme about counting crows. "One for sorrow, two for joy," etc.Overall, because of a _tiny_ bit of acting and plot, I'm going to knock a half point off. My score: 9.5/10 (Round up to 10/10)</fullReview>

The Crow is certainly a brilliant film in its own kind, whether film noir or science fiction. Brandon Lee was spectacular in his final (and tragic) film.

		<shortDescription>Truly Unique Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1st. time I saw this was at a pop culture convention. It was showcasing this movie before its release &amp; James O'Barr was the presenter. He took time to suggest to the audience to look at the many styles of tone director Alex Proyas adds to the film. Those words have stuck in my memory since.On the surface, The Crow is a dark movie of revenge. Though I pride myself on seeing such a wide variety of movies, this one remains one of the most deeply moving movies I have ever seen. Perhaps it is because of the origin of the story from James O'Barr. Perhaps it is because of the aforementioned last film of Brandon Lee. Or perhaps it is because of the haunting, moving score by Graeme Revell, who is one of the most underrated modern scorers of our time (notice who did the score on 'Dark City', also directed by Proyas).Regardless, this film overflows with passion from each member of the production crew. Underneath the action, the dark characters, &amp; the gothic setting, we can feel the real story that permeates from underneath- Real love is forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brandon Lee, I really miss you. With this masterpiece, you proved that you could have really made your mark in Hollywood. You should have at least been given an Oscar nomination for your final efforts. I'm always touched by the emotional authenticity you brought to Eric Draven, so much so that I almost cried when he had to go back to the grave in the end, even though that was supposed to be. Brandon, you proved that you weren't your legendary father...you were your own creation, and for that you will always be remembered. Thank you for leaving behind such a great work of art and for giving us the only true representation of Eric Draven ever made. This was certainly your crowning achievement and as you said in your final interview "the best role (I've) ever had the opportunity to get (my) hands on in a film". You were sooo right. Rapid Fire, Showdown in Little Tokyo, and everything else you did prior to this were nothing compared to this. Rest in Peace, Brandon! I wish you could have lived longer to give us more great movies, but everything happens for a reason. This movie was the best, no question about it! In this great effort, Eric Draven and Brandon Lee will live forever in our hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crow should be, hell is a classic (you can tell by the way it is done, plus they are making tons of sequels etc.) and it rightly so is one. It has got a good and fitting soundtrack, a dark town (very Blade Runner), a determined yet ?cool' hero, freaked out bad guys (I especially like Michael Wincott, he's made some cool movies, like Alien Resurrection and Metro (OK this wasn't like a Hit, but it was better than Murphy's other sh.t, like Nutty Professor 1 + 2, Doctor Dolittle and so on)). Plus the film has got a lot of emotion (greatly brought forward by the music of Graeme Revell as well), mysticism, a few jokes and good characters. That along with the good story, the good direction plus the good cast makes this really worth a look. I only wonder what is up with that editing, was the movie edited cause it was too violent or was it just badly edited (101 Minutes was printed on the package, but the ending credits started after 90 minutes (I guess they included Brandon Lee's last interview in the running time) . Well when I'm stepping on bad things here I might just as well mention the other thing. This film was not as exciting and I wasn't on the edge of my seat, hey but no film is perfect (that's why my highest vote is a 9 out of 10).The thing I liked most about this movie was Brandon Lee (a pity he had to leave this world so early). He played a freaked and psychotic hero really good and cool. Plus he played the guitar pretty good and walked around as what most people though was supposed to be some kind of a clown. To me it was more like a dark, rock and gothic avenger, why, cause I'd like it that way. I think people who dress up like that and walk around have got balls plus they are original and I like them for that. That's also why I like Eric Draven as the Avenger. OK it looks cool too and I probably wouldn't have liked it if it would have been, like Clint Eastwoood, but what the hell.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be one of the most haunting love stories ever to come from the imagination of man.

The plotline - a man, Eric Draven, is killed by a bunch of thugs who also rape and murder his wife. A year or so later, he is resurrected to take out bloody vengeance on the scum who took his life and his lover. The film foregoes style over substance and plans for a balance of each, showing dark scenes of gothic cityscapes and darker acting from Brandon Lee, and the people around him. One of the best things about this film is the soundtrack, which has revolutionised the way an action film is presented - I advise buying the albums of The Crow because they are excellent.Brandon Lee could have been so much more if he had lived. He is a great loss to the film industry and will be sadly missed. Rest In Peace, Brandon.This movie - 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAUTION: THIS MAY GIVE SOME OF THE MOVIE AWAY SO DONT READ IT IF YOU DONT WANT ANY IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS MOVIE. The vigilante movie has been done time and time again. We have the western type, kung-fu types, cop types, etc. I could sit here and name off different sub-genres of this theme all day. As you can see they are fairly common, all variations of the same theme. The Crow is no different. It is yet another variation on the vigilante theme. This movie has somewhat of a small twist to it that most others don't have. It contains an actual story. A woman has signed a petition in her building complaining the she does not want to move as the local "Mafia" has suggested. I use Mafia as a loose term here. There is a leader or Capo in this town, he has his lackeys, nothing is done without the leaders clearance, but the thugs are twisted, sick drug addicts who smash things for fun. The other members of the building crumble under the threats of the gang. This woman and her husband do not. Because of this, she is raped and nearly killed by the members of the gang. Her husband returns home in the middle of this horrid act. In his attempt to stop the men he is throw through a glass window and plummets to his death. There is a myth that when you die a crow will carry your soul to heaven. When you die with unfinished business your soul stays with the crow in our world until you right your wrongs. One year later the man rises from his grave to avenge his wife's death. Only then can he rest in peace. This movie stars Brandon Lee, the son of the famous Bruce Lee. This is also Brandon's last movie. In once scene in the movie he is shot with what is supposed to be blanks but are real bullets. He dies and they finish the rest of the movie using computer graphics to make the stand in look like him. It's really seamless. You can't tell that it's not him. As far as the action portions of the movie go, Brandon is almost as good as his father. He does his own stunts in this movie, which makes it all that more impressive. The fight scenes are flawlessly done. You would swear they were real. Towards the beginning of the movie the Crow encounters one of his wife's rapists. The man produces knifes to throw at the Crow. The Crow catches every knife that is near to him and delivers this man his vengeance. This movie holds true to its mood throughout the whole film. It is a Gothic influenced movie. Almost all the scenes are shot at night and in the rain. The rain symbolizes the Crow's hunt for vengeance. At the end of the movie when the crow has completed his task the rain finally stops. The city is a scummy place. The waitresses in the bars double as prostitutes. The sleazy pawn shop owner doesn't think twice about taking stolen merchandise. You also get the feeling that the cops might be paid off. The good cop in the movie is suspended when the chief thinks he is "sticking his nose where it doesn't belong". The cop was only trying to solve the case of the strange Crow. In attempting to solve this case he reopens the old case of the two murders which he learns is actually why Brandon Lee has returned from the dead. These murders were done by the gang, which paid the police to look the other way. The buildings all have a gothic tone to them. It reminded me of Salem, Mass. The last scene for instance is shot on a church that could have very well been in some old European town. I have only two complaints with this film. When Brandon tries to be angry his voice comes out all wrong. He sounds much more comical then vengeful. He should have taken the quiet killer approach, like the stranger in Clint Eastwood movies. My other complaint is with one scene. Towards the end of the movie Brandon jumps down in a room full of gangsters with guns. The shoot him multiple times. Even though all his wounds heal rapidly and nearly nothing hurts him, it just seems much too unrealistic to me. See this movie late at night when you're angry with some one. It will surely help you feel better to know that at least one person gets his revenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In memory of Brandon Lee...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I would like to mention the late Brandon Lee, who died during the production of this film. I hope the memory of him will live on forever...The director of this movie, Alex Proyas, has a very inventive visual style which is very dark and gothic. He uses this style to full effect in order to get the best out of this film. The plot comes from a similarly dark graphic novel written by James O'Barr, and follows the adventures of a man who was killed by a gang of thugs and resurrected by a crow to get his revenge.The film itself is well-directed and the acting is more than up to scratch. Right from the beginning when we are introduced to the main characters, right up to the final action set piece where the bad guy, played by the ever-brilliant Michael Wincott, is killed and the hero allowed to rest in peace.Some critics said it was better than Batman, and I think they are definitely right. A perfect 10/10 film, which Proyas followed up with another amazingly eye-catching film called Dark City, which should be watched as soon as you have finished watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Proyas gothic master piece of a man brutally murdered along with his fiancee, only to come back from the grave with supernatural powers seeking revenge for their murders. This film will always be known as Brandon Lee's final and greatest screen role. Lee was accidently killed during the filming. Which only enhanced the legend of the crow and makes the film even more powerful. I've seen The Crow and it's sequel many times and can't wait for the third installment, but know that none will have the mystique of the original. Don't miss this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movies would have made Brandon Lee a huge star. The acting in this movie is excellent, the camera work is unbelieveable (especially form the crow's view) and Lee is flat out awesome. Too bad his life was cut short making this movie. The Crow is a dark journey into the (after) life of Eric Draven, who returns to avenge the death of his himself and his wife. The movie is great and so was Lee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Romantic Movie Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know most people watch this movie expecting to see a kick ass action flick....and it doesn't disappoint either, but that's not what makes this movie so great...and it's damn sure not what makes it my all time favorite. First I have to admit a few things...I am a hopeless romantic..and am fascinated with the possibility of life after death...so when the movie came along that tossed those two elements in together and mixed them up I got to say I was completely jazzed to see it. Though I gotta' admit that I was kind of regretting it too because it was a comic book movie. Luckily it wasn't the typical comic book film. This flick is the most romantic movie ever made...it shows us that a love can be so strong and powerful that one will even refuse death to be held in the arms of that loved one again. That someone can be so passionate in their lives that they will forego their eternal peace and face eternal damnation just to get revenge on those that would harm the love of their lives. The Crow could have floundered had it not been for the wonderfully soul-wrenching performance of the late Brandon Lee, he truly makes you feel the passion that his character must have felt. Brandon just seems like someone who would say to hell with death you hurt my fiance. I really can't seem to heap enough praise on this film so I will quit rambling now and allow you to go see this for yourself and fall in love again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this movie isn't Academy material, but it was beautifully made. I felt everyone who starred in it played their characters perfectly. The dark, dreary, urban setting added to the film, and set the mood excellently for the story. Even though the plot isn't too eventful, it moves rather quickly. The events unfold and come together commendably, not leaving the viewer confused at the end. I thought this movie was a classic depiction of good vs evil, and will remain a favorite of mine forever.

		<shortDescription>A towering achievement!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Crow" is probably one of the most remarkable films I've seen in a great while! It's one of the greatest technical achievements since "Batman", and it marks the peak of Brandon Lee's remarkable career, which sadly, ended before he completed the film when he was accidently killed on the set. "The Crow" is a great gothic comic book adventure, about a man who is brutally murdered and then rises from the dead to avenge his own death, and to protect those who are in danger of receiving the same fate. It is also a rather poignant love story, and it's painful to watch the flashbacks of how he was killed, and what happened to his girlfriend. This makes the villains more detestable, and makes it easier for us to hate them. The film also advocates a positive message for it's viewers. If you look at the character Eric Draven, he doesn't just kill anybody. He was killing the killers, those who earned their right to die, to be exiled from the living! It's also anti-drug film, particularly in the scene where he approaches the terrified, high-on-morphine mother who thinks he is going to kill her, but merely brings the morphine out of her body, saying to her "Morphine is bad for you." In other scenes where the characters are smoking, Eric tells them smoking can kill them, and eventually, they quit smoking. This clearly is sending an anti-drug message to all of those who watch this film. As for Brandon Lee, the son of Bruce Lee, he is amazing! He did all of his own stunts, and he brings a true edge to the character. His character is already dead, and is resurrected, and knowing that Brandon Lee died during production adds a genuinely melancholy feel to the film. On another level, Brandon Lee has been resurrected too. To complete the picture, some scenes used computer animation to bring him back to life. It's amazing, and if only they had that kind of technology in the past when the same sort of thing happened. "Brainstorm" for instance. Natalie Wood died during the production, and the released version was not quite what the filmmakers set out to make. With "The Crow", it is complete, and we now have a masterpiece of storytelling, set design, stunts, filmmaking, and the height of Brandon Lee's career!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hesitant to watch this movie because a guy I knew in school was infatuated with this movie, and I didn't want to feel gothy for watching it. After i succumbed, I was infatuated as well. It stopped at dressing like the Crow, but I still dug the movie.This movie is one of the few ever made that has everything going for it: tragedy with genuine emotion, incredible style, breath-taking images, hip dialogue, and truly kick-ass action. This is not only one of the very best action movies I've ever seen, it's also a cracking good story.Every character has personality and style, and the bad guys, while brutal, still manage to be human. One doesn't loose sight of the grittiness of the story. The Crow isn't just taking out the trash, he's risen from the dead to exterminate four human beings. It's not pretty. Not only that, but the Crow has the pleasure of show-casing one of my favorite unknown actors: Michael Wincott, as Top Dollar. No one plays a human reptile as well as Wincott. That slithery, gravely voice sends chills down your spine, I'm upset he didn't get more recognition for this movie.I also have to hand it to the director, if you read the script for this movie you see the director made some really good choices in filtering a lot of promising but convoluted ideas into a whip-cord of a movie.</fullReview>

I was sort of sickened that they would even attempt to finish this movie without him.So I didn't jump the gun and see this movie in the theatres until very late. To my surprise it was a great movie that had an excellent cast, and an excellent soundtrack. Brandon Lee's scenes are moving, perhaps more so when in the back of your mind you know this was his last film. After seeing the finished product I feel it was well done in good taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brandon Lee is one of my inspirations as a actor. He's commited, confident, dedicated, physical, and deeply moving in his acting. This movie clearly shows all these traits. Lee brilliantly becomes Eric Draven, a dead rock singer who is risen from the grave by a Crow exactly one year later to avenge his and his fiancee's murders. The scenes when he is a complete psycho, who is driven to the limits just blows you away. When he is deep he is just moving. Plus here's something for action fans. He is just a bad ass while taking care of a room full of baddies. Too bad Brandon had to die so young and when his career was taking off. Rest In Peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crow is a fantasy tale, plain and simple. You don't see many dark fantasies however. As the movie tag line says, 'Believe in Angels', and after viewing this movie, you will. The dark, twisted, violent, and sometimes funny film takes the classic film noir sense to new levels. The whole combination of lighting, or lack there off, the music, and the acting of Brandon Lee give this movie the added punch. The use of flashbacks fill in the gaps in the story, so people will not be asking too many questions. Overall, the movie makes the viewer cheer for Eric Draven and scream for the demise of the criminals. A perfect fit for anyone wanting fantasy, romance, and/or violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all of the films to ever come out based on a comic book, "The Crow" ranks among the best. Highlighted by chilling characters, wonderful direction, and a plot that can knock your socks off, it has certainly earned the right to be called one of the finest action/revenge movies ever made.The plot, actually, is very simple, but its the simplicity of it that helps zero in on the characters and their emotions that really make the film work: Eric Draven and his girlfriend are murdered, and Draven returns back from the dead, guided by a crow, to take revenge on the killers.The main reason this film works is because of the dark setting...most of the colors are either black and white, with little in between. It is symbolically important that both the good guys and the villians alike wear black and white, showing that everyone has a bit of evil inside of them. (A point which is proven by the fact that Draven, the hero, is cheered on after brutally murdering quite a number of people).The supporting cast is also excellent: Wincott is a perfect villain, with Tony Todd as a perfect, bouncer-like sidekick, and Davis and Hudson are also effective as key players in aiding Draven.Which brings us to the character of Draven himself. Played by Brandon Lee, this is one of the most complex...and fascinating...characters in motion picture history, IMHO. Relentless....pointed....unstoppable...brutal...but at the same time, scarred, bitter, and not evil. Brandon Lee handles this role to perfection, and although he was killed in the making of this movie, I think if I was to die in the making of *any* movie, this one would be a candidate. One must wonder, though...did his death cause the movie to be a better film, with the manipulations that the makers had to make because of it, hence making the dark elements much more effective?I'll leave it at that. It was the second best movie of 1994.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Halloween Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the horror-movie weakling, this is as dark and gloomy as it gets. Is this a bad thing? ABSOLUTELY NOT!! This movie is fantastic. The photography is incredible, the set design is as fitting as humanly possible, and Brandon Lee makes a surprisingly good undead. Here's the plot line. Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his girlfriend/fiancee, Shelley (Sophia Shinas) are the ideal couple with a romance that conquers all-including death. However, the local crime gang interrupts that on halloween (eve or night, I can't remember) and rapes his fiancee. When Eric comes in in the middle of this, he tries to stop them. This gets him thrown out the window and his girlfriend killed. Young, tough, and street-wise Sarah (Rochelle Davis) always looked up to Eric and Shelley, and always imagined them as the caring parents she never had. She can see right through local cop Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) when he says they're going to be OK.However, 1 year later on Halloween (eve or night) the darkest city I've ever seen in a movie and the local crime gang are in for a surprise. For, Eric Draven, surprise surprise, is back from the grave. Led by a mysterious crow (who the audience can obviously tell holds Eric's soul), Eric finds clothes and makeup to disguise his true identity. He then goes to find revenge on those who took the 2 most precious things to him-his wife and his life. He kills them one by one, now invincible because he is already dead.Each time he leaves some kind of mark in the shape of a crow (A blood painting, and a trail of lit gasoline, etc.) Albrecht vaguely remembers Eric from last Halloween (Eve or night) and meets Eric after his 2nd murder. He and Eric have the hilarious confrontation: "You move and you're dead!!!" "And I say I'm dead...and I move". Whenever anyone meets Eric, he mysteriously dissapears, until Sarah recognizes him from a quote of his and confronts him. After he kills the men he thinks are responsible for last Halloween (eve or night), he meets the real man behind the plan--Top Dollar (Michael Wilcott), who is the leader of the crime gang. Then things start to get interesting. I won't give away the ending. Brandon Lee puts on a great performance, and sadly, his last, as irony entered the situation and when he was supposed to be shot with a blank he was actually shot for real. This is probably the darkest movie I've ever seen that still managed to be a romance. A Must-see (4? out of 5, 1/2 point off for a little predictability).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had only heard one story concerning the making of "The Crow," and that is that the film's star was accidently killed by a badly loaded blank gun during one of the picture's shooting scenes. Maybe this incident brought a little more attention and praise to picture during its release than it should have had. Then again, maybe not.This is a violent, action-packed revenge horror/thriller with a little twist, the supernatural character is the protagonist. The film begins with the consequences of the brutal murder of rock-star Ernie Hudson (Brandon Lee) in his apartment, and also the assault, rape and eventual death his girlfriend Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas), this being one of the activities of a rough gang of four, motivated by the day being the eve of Halloween, named by many as "Devil's Night." The police investigate, one of them being policeman Albrecht (Ernie Hudson), who has the daunting task of explaining the news to the couple's adopted daughter, Sarah (Rochelle Davis). One year later, Sarah is now mostly in the care of Albrecht and many of the city's criminals begin to prepare for another night's demolition and arson of the city's buildings. Under the belief that a crow carries a person's soul to heaven, and that, if grieved enough, the soul can be returned to the person's body in order to put the wrong things right, the resurrected Ernie Hudson appears from the grave, ready to have revenge on the gang who killed him and his girlfriend, the leader of the gang being the truly evil Top Dollar (Michael Wincott).Some of the lines are a little too vulgar, and I'm not so sure about some of the characterisation. The film even gets a little sentimental at times, but that does not ruin the picture. The action scenes are great, one of them being a strong contender for the best shoot-em-up I have ever seen! Unfortunately, that was the scene in which Lee died. What's more, some of the photography is totally awesome. The film contains such startling and wonderful imagery which has never been seen in any other American film. So, if you want to see a film that has plenty of thrills and amazing visuals, this is the film for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Wish in goth drag thats surprisingly soars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a real surprise. It's a very dark revenge fantasy that flies on imagination and a terrific performance by Brandon Lee. Director Alex Proyas's stunning feature debut is a stylistic masterpiece based on James O'Barr's best-selling graphic novel. Although it can be dismissed as Death Wish dressed up for the kids it can't be easily forgotten. I keep going back to this movie because Lee is genuinely sweet and tragic as a hero returned from the dead to exact revenge on a gang of speed metal villians. He makes you root for him. His work here totally wins you over (which makes his actual death all the more painful for people who love movies). And the villians are among the most colorful and evil ever assembled on the big screen. Michael Wincott and David Patrick Kelly lead this band of bad guys. Each set piece that leads Eric Draven/The Crow getting revenge up the bad guy ladder is sharp and adrenalized. Proyas's camera work and cutting are truly something to behold. Ernie Hudson's is memorable as a disbelieving cop who befriends Draven. For all of the stylistic guts this movie has (it looks very dark as well) it would not have won me over so much if it weren't for Lee's poignant work which is something very unexpected in such a dark and violent fantasy. Like such films as The Terminator and The Road Warrior, The Crow rises far above its B-movie trappings into a modern mythology of sorts.</fullReview>

Brandon Lee played the lead character exceptionally well (he was killed in the making of this flick)Despite the graphic violence, drug-taking, vicious killers and rapists, the story is still great. It basically revolves around a young dude who is murdered by a bunch of pyscho maniacs. His bride-to-be is beaten violently to death. He is reincarnated to avenge both their deaths by killing the monsters responsible. The crow that follows him around is his third eye and the source of his 'immortal' powers.This is definitely not a movie for the faint of heart. We see the bad guys gettin their just desserts in the most violent ways imaginable, they are hunted down like animals and killed according to what tortures they inflicted upon our hero's bride before she died her slow and painful death. Of course, they deserve to die like animals, except our hero wouldn't even kill an animal like that!!However, despite the gratuitous violence and colourful uses of the 'F' word, there are still tender tear-jerker moments and a few humourous moments too.I recommend this flick to anybody who loves action flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'm biased. I'm one of those weird people who love most things goth. While this movie also has a comic-book flavor to it, the combination is terrific, creating a mood of death-obsession and bittersweet purity. "The Crow" is a work of dark beauty; as swan songs go, it is also a triumph for Brandon Lee, who died tragically during the filming. A masterpiece of atmosphere, this film is one of my all-time favorites. It has its faults, certainly. For those who can't lose themselves in it, those faults will be glaringly obvious. For those who can, though, they're barely noticeable, if at all. As far as I'm concerned, spotless perfection rarely equals beauty or brilliance. Perfection is frequently boring and disappears from the memory. This movie is beautiful and brilliant, and it certainly leaves an impression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film that should of launched Brandon Lee's career.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I was a fan of his father, I thought why not watch one of his son's films. So I went to my nearest video store and saw a copy of "The Crow". I heard like a few years before Brandon was killed accidentally on the site. When I went home and popped in the VCR...it was a great film.The story was great...which was based by the comic by James o'barr. The plot is Eric Draven (Brandon Lee)is a dead guy who comes back to life to get revenge from the gang that killed he and his girlfriend one year before. Later on he finds out he got these supernatural powers from a crow. I won't get too much on detail but here is what i liked about it. I loved the strong acting and the action sequence in the board room which was cool. The movie is basically made for goths but you can still enjoy the film because of the strong acting and the soundtrack. Too bad brandon died....he would of been up there just like his father was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Comic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever read the comic book that this movie was based upon. Well if you have or haven't it's pretty much a great adaption of the comic. Now the comic was black and white but the movie was color sort of, the only colors visible were warm colors i.e. fire. The flashback scene were also in color, vivid color I might add. The comics flashback were in watercolor. The comic book was a very dark and gritty comic that couldn't have been a movie if there wasn't an 'R' rating but there were a few choice things the movie chose to omit that were in the comic book. Go read the comic and you'll see this movie in a whole new light and after you do Look for James O Barr (the author, artist, creator of the Crow) in a cameo in the movie. Hint:He's the blond guy looting the pawn shop when Eric meets the cop.</fullReview>

I like the scenes where it freezes on pictures of Brandon.He made everyones life better (in the film) and he reunited a druggie mother with her rebellious daughter. The story of a rock star and his fiancee who are murdered on Halloween Eve, they were sort of surrogate parents to Sarah the rebellious teenager.It was an all time greatest film and should be in the top 10 films of all time, it was once again like many others ruined by totally crap sequels, and now a second sequel is out i feel like puking.Brandon lee was killed during this movie and they should at least pay respect to him by leaving The Crow as an original, no sequels or anything.Because of Brandon Lee`s brilliant acting along with almost every other part of the film I give this first class film a 9 and a half out of 10. it would have got a 10 if Brandon Lee could have seen how much of a hit this film was.</fullReview>

I can't say enough good things about this film. I truly believe that if Brandon Lee had lived, this movie would have been the one to push him into superstar status. His performance was outstanding and very believable. The viewer can't help notice the irony here, considering Lee's death during the filming of this movie, which adds a great deal to the appeal and "mood". All the elements blend together nicely to form a completely entertaining movie. The decadent city, the merciless gang of thugs...contrasting with the memory flashes of Eric's life and love with Shelley. A "must see" in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crow is one of my favorite films of all time. True it may be dark, gothic, but that's what I like about it. It's totally different to the usual stuff that comes out of Hollywood. Brandon Lee is excellent in the role of Eric Draven, being both violent, sensitive and caring at the same time, he must have been born for the role. It was just such a shame he had his life cut short before compeltion. I'm surprised to hear two more Crow movies are being made. I would have thought after the first sequel (which I haven't seen and have no wish to-no Brandon no sequel as far as I'm concerned) as the first sequel got terrible reviews, which didn't really surprise me because any sequel after such a brilliant first film is pointless, especially now the talented star is sadly gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly beautiful movie - both in the story and the acting of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To confine the beauty of The Crow on paper (or on a page as it may be), seems a very limited form of expression. From the first time I saw this film, I was touched deeply by the story. The love between two people is so strong that a Crow can bring one man back to avenge their gruesome, murderous deaths.The story in itself is magical. The comics that it was based on were kept true in the film, due to the devotion shown by Brandon Lee and other cast and crew members. Such a story stays in your mind and influences your thoughts forever, it's a movie that I cannot ignore.The acting was superb. The honesty, acting ability, and the fact that Brandon Lee was an almost unrecognised star made the perfect combination, Lee fitted the role perfectly. For this reason, I believe that it really IS Brandon's film. Other roles, particularly that of Albrecht, were also played with nothing less than perfection.The follow ups to The Crow, however, are simply disgusting. To say the least, they are truly an insult to the work of everyone involved with The Crow. A study of the crew lists shows that many crew members on the original movie were not even consulted in the following attempts. I find the newer attempts are simply greedy money-making ideas, with no attention paid to the simple beauty of The Crow as a complete story in itself.Stop the sequels. The Crow is a classic - Brandon's film. Why can't they leave it that way?</fullReview>

Proyas likes to dwell on romantic and majestic imagery, much like in a music video, and he loves to play with contrasts. Beautiful opera hums in the background as we see the outline of a large crow, silently traced by a burst of flames and flashing up against the black background. Although perhaps inspired by Tim Burton's adaption of the Batman-comic, Proyas has no problem defining his own style of direction. This is one of those must-see type things.</fullReview>

It would have been a shame not to have shown this masterpiece. It was by far and away Brandon's finest performance. Every time I watch this movie, it affects me in a way that no other movie can. It blends a sensational soundtrack with an oustanding performance by Lee. I just can't help but think of Brandon Lee, and how he will never do another movie.

I think what truly captured my eyes and ears in this film was the gothic undertone mixed with the brutality of Lee's murder, and his subsequent revenge. A sad coincidencethat the film that brilliantly portrayed his acting ability and screen charisma was also the movie that killed him. It adds a haunting aura to the film, bringing a reality to themore violent scenes. Taking all of the controversy of the film, however, it still stands an *amazing* work.

		<fullReview>The CrowWhen it comes to homicides in the avian empire, fowl that fly in flocks called "murders" are your most likely suspects.And while this action movie isn't about birds of prey, it is about a bird-themed spirit that preys on evil.On the eve of Halloween ? and their wedding nuptials ? an up-and-coming rock star Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his fiancé are brutally slain by a gang of thugs.One year later, Eric rises from the grave. Donned in black attire, stage make-up, and accompanied by a crow, he seeks vengeance.However, a crime lord (Michael Wincott) and his mystic (Bai Ling) desire the powers of invincibility that the resurrected Eric possesses.Based on the comic book, The Crow is a bullet-riddled ballad of retributive justice filled with colourful criminals and a striking cityscape.As for The Crow's archenemy: it's old lumber, straw and clothes configured to resemble a farmer.

		<fullReview>Having known Ernie Hudson as one of the Ghostbusters, I thought that it made sense to cast him in "The Crow". The movie is of course most famous for Brandon Lee's unfortunate death during filming. Watching the movie, it gave me a real sense of the macabre, in a less than identifiable setting full of chaos. Needless to say, it adds to the feeling knowing what happened to Lee on the set. No matter how you approach it, this is a horror movie without having to be particularly scary, and definitely one that I recommend. Watch on Halloween, right before Halloween, or during any other part of the year, and it's still equally good.Also starring Ling Bai (billed as Bai Ling).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Years Later.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>....this movie still gets to me.I remember seeing this movie in the theater at the tender age of 15. I never cry at movies, but the first (and only) time I ever did was at the end of this movie. For years, this movie haunted me; it permeated nearly every aspect of my existence. My bedroom walls were covered with posters from the film, I saved up the money to hunt down and purchase all of the comic books, and grew my hair long for the sole purpose of going out for Halloween as Eric Draven my senior year in high school. I wrote countless papers for various classes during my undergraduate study related to the film. Sometimes I feel like I know this movie better than the people who made it.It's funny how the things that are going on your life shape the way you experience the movies and music of your past. When life is good, it's easy to be over-analytical, to be hyper-critical, maybe even poke fun. I've been in this stage, watching this film and having almost no reaction to it whatsoever. However, there are times when life feels so dark and overwhelming and suddenly I'm that emotionally-vulnerable, confused 15-year-old kid again, carrying around the haunting images and music of the film in my head and trying to sort out the feelings evoked by it.And that's the beauty of this film. From the intensely angry expressions on Eric's face as he metes out his brand of justice to the tender moment he shares with Shelley before returning to the grave, this film encapsulates so many emotions; fear, rage, sadness, loneliness, hope, love, and redemption. The viewer can't help but have a bittersweet, visceral reaction to the film as we weep alongside Eric and revel in his revenge at the same time. An action-packed thriller it is, but this film really serves to remind us of how precious this life is; that every little moment we can share with those we love is to be treasured and cherished. And that when we love, we must love as long and as much as we can. Because, as Lee points out in his comments on the DVD extras, this "seemingly inexhaustible" well of life really is quite shallow, for we never really know when our time will come. This is the tragedy of both the film and of Brandon Lee's pointless death, but it can ultimately instill a sense of hope and purpose in those who heed the message.</fullReview>

The fact that "The Crow" comic was written to help the passing of the writers wife, she was killed by a drunk driver, and Brandon Lee was killed in the making of this movie. The story it's self is about death and murder. A flock of crows are called a murder. E.A. Poe's poem is about death as well. Maybe there's something behind all of this, or maybe not.

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic! Brandon Lee was amazing, thats all there is too it. He played the verge between pure madness with sorrow brilliantly. If you haven't see this move go out and get it. Seriously there is no bad acting in it. You feel Lee's pain and you you feel his anger. No one could have played Eric Draven better than Brandon Lee. The scene in the pawn shop was taken straight out of the comic book almost word for word. David Patrick Kelly is an amazing actor and he plays a good villain, as for Michael Wincott I feel he is under-rated and proves it in this film. Ernie hudson (from Ghostbusters fame) gave a spectacular performance and continues to give great performances. As for the untimely death of Brandon Lee, it was a terrible loss, but this movie has allowed his memory to live on in the hearts and minds of generations to come. This movie will be appreciated for a long time and may prove to be one of the most successful cult movies ever. The sequels i admit can't live up to the original but are worth a look and the TV series is a pleasant surprise and is one of my favourite shows. This film pulled of a knife catch perfectly and no other film i have seen has ever done that without some glitch. If you play it in slow motion you still wont find a fault. Overall this is an amazing movie that will appeal to fans of horror, action and romantic movie it even has some comedy, so check it out and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One night I was bored so I decided to watch some movies my friend lend to me. In that moment I didn't know that this night would be very special.This was the first movie which made me cry. And I've always been wondering how people can cry, while they are watching a movie. Now I know, how.I loved this Gothic style, which made "The Crow" very emotional and painful. I can remember, that someone called this a " dark fairy-tale for adults". And I agree with him.If I didn't know that this movie is actually 12 years old, I would say that it's kinda new. I can only imagine, how people acted when this movie was first shown in cinemas.Acting was brilliant, every character was so realistic. Seems that everyone perfectly knows what they're supposed to do. Expectually villains and Eric.One of my favorite scenes are when Sarah is looking for Eric in his old flat, and she screams in anger and frustration, that he doesn't care about her. But then, when she's already leaving, Eric suddenly appears and says : " Sarah, I do care." Strange, how three small words can contain such a big amount of emotions.And now I'm always remembering one of the most beautiful quotes : " If the people we love are stolen from us, the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them. Buildings burn, people die, but real love is forever." It's very sad, that this was Brandon Lee's last movie, because he really had a talent. His acting is stunning and definitely not shallow.This movie really deserves more than 7.4. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie perhaps best known for the tragic death of actor Brandon Lee. However the film itself is definitely worthy of recognition. I remember being very taken by this movie as a young child, and now several years later and find myself still enjoying this film. I can't help but to feel that it lack something though. It had great potential to be extraordinary, and yet somehow it fails to deliver fully out and ends up being just a good movie with a original idea, when it could have been so much better! Its visuals are beautiful in a depressing and sad way, with a surreal and dark feel to it. The acting from Brandon Lee is great as avenger of his wife's murder and Michael Wincott's performance as the main villain is above average, however I feel it's missing something. His character could have been portrayed better by a different actor perhaps. Ernie Hudson gives a solid performance as well as Rochelle Davis as young Sarah. Also nice work from David Patrick Kelly playing his usual role as a psycho. Overall the acting is unfortunately a bit uneven on behalf of the rest of the cast.The pacing of the film is just about right. But as stated before I do feel that some elements are missing in order for this to be a totally mesmerizing experience. I can't really put my finger on it but it lack some depth. The quite original idea that Eric Draven is brought back from beyond the grave by a crow is excellent, and how the crow works as his link to the world and his temporary immortal state. Yet I would have wished for more of a build up, so we can feel his pain and loss. Shelley is seen only in flashbacks for instance. I also feel something else could be added to the plot in order for it to grow and be a really great film.To sum up it's a good film with an original idea and quite good acting, that just simply lack something to be as great as it could have been. I still like it and definitely think it's worth more than one look. Just wished more fore it that's all...</fullReview>

While every sequel and Crow movie since this has destroyed the credibility of this film, it truly is possibly the greatest Gothic superhero movie of all time (with exception to Batman). Some of the scenes in this film are just so well done I still feel shivers when I watch them. For example The scene when Brandon Lee finally comes back to his now abandon apartment and relives his death is one of the most powerful and well edited scenes from 90's films.

		<shortDescription>Good for a Last Picture from Brandon Lee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see that the movie shows a release in 1994, but I saw the "The Crow" in New Jersey (USA) the summer of 1993. Where and when did "The Crow" come out if it was originally released (by the official IMDb date) in 1994? Why would it sit on the shelf for almost a year?It has become a cult-classic but still has not only dark humor but an estrange ending. The love story was powerful along with his friendship with the homeless little girl. I recommend it to others that want to see Brandon Lee in the movies as one of his best."The Crow" sequels sucked very much. Again Hollywood trying to capitalize on a good original screwing up those that follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mother Of All Goth Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the original comic book series in which this The Crow was based, one can see how a direct film translation would have been difficult to accomplish. Unfortunately several movie clichés have been added: A police man butting heads with his superior, a kidnapped girl, a grand finale on top of a cathedral (ala Batman, Metropolis), a buddy cop to the rescue, a villain that is killed by a hero who throws him off a very high place and onto a large pointy object. What THE CROW lacks in story is made up for with beautiful direction by Alex Proyas, stunning goth-noir cinematography, and a memorable theme by Graham Revell. This is more than your average comic book movie (do not expect a SPIDERMAN, BATMAN, or X-MEN). Here, our "hero"'s actions come from what he alone feels: pain, loss, anger, isolation, despair. His primary goal is not to bring justice to this world, his main goal is to kill those who have murdered him and his fiancé and to return to the grave where he can be reunited with her. Brandon Lee really is good in the lead roll, his presence can be felt throughout the film, including scenes filmed after his death. Had he lived he would have made an excellent action hero. Perhaps the MATRIX trilogy would have been better starring a real martial artist and a proved dramatic actor such as Brandon Lee.THE CROW has a real soul and inner life that is rare for action movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain SpoilersThey are many things to be liked about THE CROW namely; Drama - " Little things used to mean so much to Shelley, I used to think they were kinda trivial. Believe me, nothing is trivial. " The side stories involving Sarah, Albrecht and Darla's Drug Problem and well paced and acted Action - " I see you have made your decision, now lets see you enforce it " Before the days of super slow-mo, The Crow gave Eric Draven the human fighting style he fights in a very realistic fashion. Comedy - " You picked a bad day to be a bad guy huh, Skank " "I'm not Skank, that's Skank right There!. Skank Dead" " Thats Right" There is an underlying humour in this film. ________________________A highly recommended film. Beats most of the movies around today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Crow' - the final movie of Brandon Lee and his finest hour, and one of the best movies ever. Brandon starred as Eric Draven, a musician living with his fiancée, Shelley. Life for them was perfect, but on Devil's Night, everything changed. Eric was murdered, but Shelley was beaten and raped, and the last thirty hours of her life were filled with nothing but pain. Exactly one year later, Eric is brought back to seek out and gain his revenge on those responsible.The story is great, despite simplicity. The atmosphere is very dark and sad, yet also hopeful, bringing a message of eternal love. Brandon finally got to showcase his skill as an actor, as well as a martial artist, and he was brilliant as both. Despite numerous one-liners, the violent tone, and some great action scenes, Brandon was able to prove he was also a great actor.I could talk at length about how great this movie, and how much I enjoy it, but I won't. I will just re-iterate that it is an excellent movie, and urge you to see it. 'The Crow' definitely deserves a 10/10. Be warned, it is obviously not for everyone - it is the kind of movie that would scare children, and get disapproving comments from others unable to stomach the violence and drug use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie over a million times and it keeps getting better the more I watch it. It is the by far the greatest movie ever made, there will be no movie ever like it, not even close. The sequels to this film don't stand a chance next to it. Out of 10 stars I give this movie a 20. They never should of made the 2 sequels out of honor for Brandon Lee. I cannot stress on how much of a great movie this is, if you have not seen it yet, I can begin to tell you how much you need to see this movie, so if you haven't seen this movie yet, stop reading what I have to say about it, get dressed, grab your keys, get into your car, go to the nearest store that sells movies (not video rental) and buy this movie, it's worth however much the store is selling it for.

		<shortDescription>WHY IS IT SO GOOD? LET ME SAY WHY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like to think that when it comes to films i know a thing or two, i have around 300 dvds and follow and collect on a few of them, I saw The Crow in 1994, i saw it 12 times on the big screen...yes 12, why 12? well i found many things about this film to bring me back time after time, the first few times it was the action and the way it way shot that brought me back but soon i looked deeper into the story and its background, it struck on points about life and how we treat it, there are interviews with the late great Brandon Lee in which he covers this point in detail but the just been that we only have so long here and we should not take it and people for granted. The Crow was made with little money and some say this was the cause or part cause for Mr Lees death as the set should of had more people working on the checking of guns used in the film and the safety of the crew, others would go into the curse of the Lees or strange plots to do away with him, but the truth will out although i feel they have it now, just a pure accident, the low cost of this film hardly ever shows through, its shot with flair and hits all the right notes when it comes to the music which helps drive the film, the rock soundtrack by many great bands and one of the best scores by Greame Revell which has been sampled by other films. The Crow is a film that you must see, nothing can be found to fault it and its easy to see that all who worked on this film gave it there all, make what you will of those that followed but this is timeless.

		<fullReview>The Crow is one of my favorite movies as it is one of the greatest movies translated from a comic book ever made. Brandon Lee makes the role as Eric Draven as he reserects to payback the people that murdered him and his fiancé a year earlier. As he calls upon the power of the crow to assist him throughout his quest to get the leader, Top Dollar. Which led the murder on Halloween the year before. It just makes you wonder what would have happened if Brandon Lee would have lived to make more movies? I also like in the movie the way that the film is shot with the dark colors showing the true emotion of the film. It is just a superb film and I definitely recommend it for anyone who has not yet seen this cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

The acting is amazing. It's do bad that Brendon Lee died because he is amazing. The effects and action are brilliant without being overdone.The combat is so realistic. The soundtrack is a work of art. It perfectly captures the mood of each scene. The scene were lee "suits up" in his ruined apartment is arguable the best moment in cinema. The visual style of the entire film just perfectly fits. Its dark and bleek and exciting. This is one that no one can afford not to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gives the watcher the chance to use imagination.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>in the past, the crow has been given some scrutinizing reviews. and while the movie is not perfect, seeing as none ever are, the total look and feel of the movie give the watcher such a sense of what is happening to Draven. It is obvious that very little is known about the happenings on that fateful night or about eric and his future wife, but this allows the watcher room to imagine and take from his/her heart things that make it what it is. I for one took memories from my life and from past experience and imagined them much stringer in Eric Draven. This gives Eric the character that he was 'lacking' in the film. We all know that what happened was awful, there is no doubt about that. So why should we use up another hour of film explaining something we already know?All in all, The Crow is a very moving film and is full of action for those not looking for a moving experience or the poetic style of the film. I recommend it to anyone who wants to think more about the evil in todays world, grin at the almost constant yet tactful irony, and applaud as Eric wreaks havok on the evil ones.</fullReview>

This movie ultimately caused the death of the star Brandon Lee the son of martial arts superstar Bruce Lee but was it murder or accidental i am still trying to work it out but Alex Proyas won't talk about it he should get it out in the open it might resolve it all this movie is worth seeing though **********/10.

		<fullReview>This is my absolute, hands-down favorite of all time. Brandon Lee gave a phenomenal performance, portraying the immense pain and anguish of a man who had his true love taken from him and then was murdered.Eric Draven is one of the most emotionally deep characters of all time. He drives through the plot with such power and momentum, never letting the adrenaline slow. If you want to see a true artist performing a true work of art, watch Brandon Lee in The Crow. Any artist can recognize the beauty of Brandon Lee's work here. Just like his father, Brandon Lee has mastered the artless art. It is a tragedy that this was to be his final work.In addition to Brandon Lee's amazing mastery of Eric Draven, Michael Wincott is incredible as Top Dollar, the villainous leader of the gang infamous for beginning the tradition of Devil's Night.The Crow is also full of memorable scenes, and quotes. "It can't rain all the time." became a household phrase among my friends and anyone familiar with the scene will know why I adore "Mother is the name for God on the lips and hearts of all children."</fullReview>

This movie was one of the top highlights of the nineties for me, the music and the pit so well done, just like in the city that became my home, New York. In Transylvania, where I was born, stories like this are told to children, and they grow up fierce, and just, and brave; and the girls dream of a lover of the Crow's caliber!!!.... Every time I go home, I look to the roof tops and, in my heart's eye I see this love story played over and over!!!! Such sweet sorrow!!! Such satisfaction!!!! Sweet revenge!!!!

		<fullReview>Who ever said that this movie was dull an empty didn't have more than two brain cells to watch it with. I am hardly a cult member nor am I a goth. Brandon Lee was one of the greatest actors of all time, in my opinion, next to Cuba Gooding Jr. and Edward Norton. This movie is a romance-action flick depicting the lengths true love will go to justify wrongs. This man comes back from the dead to avenge his fiancé's death and his own. Now what woman wouldn't love that. The knife fights gun fights and martial arts demonstrations make up the perfect mix for an action flick as well, a big plus for the guys! A really excellent film for those with out kids, it's got a little nudity and a lot of gunfire. I've seen this movie more than a hundred times easily and every time I notice something new, so if you like love stories women, and guys if you like action and suspense...See "THE CROW"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Myth of The Crow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow opens with a voiceover reading this myth: "People once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. But sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it, and the soul can't rest. Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back, to put the wrong things right."The Crow is mythmaking at its best. Eric Draven (Lee) is brought back from the dead to avenge the rape and murder of his wife and his own murder. While filming the scene where his character is shot dead at the beginning of The Crow, in order to return to life as an immortal Jesus figure, the cap from the blank hit him and lodged in his spine, and Brandon Lee died. The way Lee's death on set at that particular moment fit into the myth of the movie is just as much to do with the cult status of this picture, as its fantastic gothic landscape, exciting story, gorgeous score and irresistable central figure.Brandon Lee, being interviewed about The Crow, was asked about death and his character in the film. He said this:"Because we do not know when we will die we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. And yet everything happens only a certain number of times. And a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood. An afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it. Perhaps four or five times or more. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless."He died not long after. This was his last interview.</fullReview>

Sure, this film looks kinda cool because it's so dark and raining every 2 seconds ... but we've all already seen Blade Runner and that gets ripped off almost as much as Death Wish!!The girl that gets killed in the beginning is a total hottie and the soundtrack (NIN, The Cure, Stone Temple Pilots, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and a GREAT song by some band called For Love Not Lisa) are the real reasons to see the film ... unless you're a dorky comic book fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Crow", which starred the late Brandon Lee, certainly was one of the best films of 1994. Brandon Lee, in case you don't know, was the son of martial arts star Bruce Lee, who also died while making his last film. The story for "The Crow" is familiar to countless people. Lee plays a murdered rock musician who returns from the dead as an invincible ghost of sorts. Guided by a mystical crow, he searches the dark streets looking for the thugs who killed him and his girlfriend.Dark and haunting, "The Crow" succeeds, despite its obviously low budget. Director Alex Proyas certainly knows how to direct a film, despite the tragic death of the films star.The camera work in this film is excellent, as is the films story. The film is also filled with countless symbolisms and many bizarre twists, such as the Crow appearing right before someone is killed (since in the film, it is seen as an omen of certain death) or each of the thugs being killed with the tricks of their trade.Not to be missed.</fullReview>

It was a real comic to film classic and perhaps dare I say it the best. Brandon Lee was outstanding in this, his presence on screen was amazing. I had only previously seen him in Showdown in little tokyo and Rapid fire and while he could obviously fight and do much of his stunt work, I was not overly impressed with his acting. In the Crow he gives his last and best perfromance in his best film and its a shame his blossoming career was tragically cut short I feel he could be one of the main action stars out here today. I liked the Crow immensly, I admitadly didn't think I would but this, like the Terminator is a true classic B-Movie which has become a cult classic and spawned inferior sequals and a sub-standard TV series that wasted the talents of Mark Dacascos.

In other words, it is a lot like genesis. Also, for many reasons i think that the crow may represent the serpent and occasionally moses. plus, there are some parts that can be played backwards for hilarity. Believe me, i should know i saw this movie over 12,000 SEPERATE instances!! including last summer.this is why i want to explain something. for me, last summer was a time of intense spiritual turmoil. for a while i was a wiccan, but thanks to this movie, my eyes were (figuratively/literally) opened. i saw for once and all that love conquers all, even those among us who were resurrected from the dead to avenge a crime or crimes.Eric is a hero to all of us! He has a message to share with everyone...regardless of your age or race. This movie is a startling glimpse into the lovely and often comical side of contemporary urban life. I do have some ideas for improvement though: 1. it would have been better if it took place on an airplane 2. a bigger role for the background of the crow...where did it come from?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are very few films that have combined the necessary elements of filmmaking as well as this offering.The elements I feel that are essential to create a movie that may achieve cult status and be respected by audiences and artists alike are a strong emsemble cast,direction, cinematography and a soundtrack that complements the theme.As for being a showpiece for goth,all elements are here-a man oppressed who after a tragedy rises against his oppressors and takes revenge in a dark and brutal manner using the forces used against him on his enemies.Pain is now his weapon.The cast is superb and everyone contributes by rendering fine performances.Brandon Lee is well suited to the main role and this time not only because of his martial arts skills.He has a strong on screen presence and although not being the most gifted actor,he is able to evoke the strong emotions of a man hell bent on revenge for the death of his fiancee.No other actor has been capable of creating believability for James O'Barrs character as is evident in the sequels.That is no sympathy call-just an objective observation.Micheal Wincott has a penchant for playing dark characters and it would be hard to imagine anyone else playing this role.The rest play well as dregs and are not too camp.The cast obviously could not do it alone and Alex Proyas mustered his team well to create arguably his best movie.I agree with other IMDB users that the sequels would have been more than mediocre with his influence.Cinematography is largely unheralded but it's role here in creating unforgettable images should not go unnoticed.The visions of a dark city were riveting and images from the crow's POV are easily remembered.Of great influence to O'Barr was music and the soundtrack is of world class.Every track has it's place in this movie.Moods are manipulated by each track and Eric's rage and deep set sadness is accentuated by the relevant track.The soundtrack CD is a definite must for all fans of the movie or of alternative music.It is easy to say that Brandon's death helped this movie achieve cult status.While this was an obvious influence especially considering the theme of the screenplay,I believe that cult status would have been achieved regardless owing to the elements discussed above.I believe that this was going to be the picture that would have launched Brandon to being a big Hollywood player.At least he had the chance to make a film like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brandon Lee delivers his best performance ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the opportunity to see "The Crow" at The AMC Hampsire Six Theatres in Hadley,Massachusetts.I found Brandon Lee's performance in the film different from his others."The Crow"is based on the best selling graphic comic that deals with the supernatural.Brandon is Eric Draven.A rock musician whom one night,along with his wife to be,is murdered by a group of vicious gang members who each Halloween celebrate Devil's Night in which they blow stuff up.A year later,Eric is brought to life with the help of a supernatural crow who throughout the film is Eric's guardian angel and his eyes.Eric is brought to life for one purpose only:Avenge his death and right what is wrong."The Crow" is one of the darkest films to come out since "Batman".The movie is Brandon Lee's best performance because I think the role he played really separated him from his earlier films.Don't get me wrong,I loved him in "Rapid Fire" and was hoping he would make some more martial arts films. I am not saying that this was Brandon Lee's best performance because it was his last. If that were the case,I wouldn't be reviewing this film."The Crow" deals with the supernatural and gives us a supernatural hero we can go for.What I liked about the film, is the fact that Eric doesn't want to be a hero.He is cursed and to remove that curse he must avenge himself and his girlfriend.The film is also about damnation which I consider really dark.After seeing "The Crow",I realized that on March 31,1993 we lost a really great actor."The Crow" is one hell of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brandon Lee becomes The Crow. No, he IS The Crow. He died for this role, and he was so in to it, he became the role of Eric. No one else could play this role and the sequels are just a waste of time.The actual film is one of the fine examples of action films in the nineties but I think that the most important thing is the love factor. The love portrayed between Shelly and Eric is excellent.</fullReview>

I sat there, knowing full well that I had school the next morning, and watched the film end to end... To say I was impressed would be an understatement.Since then I have seen the film at least 50 times (i long since stopped counting) and each time I enjoy it.The plot is a basic justice for victims affair based on the graphic novel by James O'barr.I can barely fault this film, the sets, acting (Brandon Lee's finest moment - Rest in Piece Brandon), screen play and directing are virtually flawless.The soundtrack has some great songs on it and the films score is moving.If you have a couple of hours free watch this film.10 out of 10 for me</fullReview>

The good thing about this movie is that the plot is dominant over the action scenes right until the end unlike in many other films (where the plot is a mere excuse for showing as much action scenes as possible).

		<fullReview>The Crow showcased the prodigious talents of Brandon Lee, who with out doubt would have forged his own considerable identity with this film had he not been tragically killed. A very stylish film throughout, this film established the dark brooding style that rocketed The Matrix into international success. Lee is magnificent as the reborn Eric Draven, although a little more martial arts from him would have been appreciated. Michael Wincott also turns in a great performance as the villainous Top Dollar, delivering his lines with gutteral precision and evil. Stylish costumes, lighting and cinematography complement the fantastic action sequences and fine acting perfectly, to create a truly excellent film. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hauntingly good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps its just me but The Crow has a real feeling of sentimentality running throughout the film. Maybe its because the subject of the film coupled with the tragic death of Brandon Lee make it feel almost spiritual. This could so easily have degenerated into a by the book revenge thriller, and I suppose in some aspects it is. But the dark imagery and the feeling of loss portrayed by Eric Draven in being separated from his one true love is tragic. The flash back scenes of Eric and his girlfriend instead of being corny, portray his anger and sense of loss very well.The always excellent Michael Wincott makes a great gothic bad guy, and the action scenes although simple do pack a punch. Proyas shows a real visual flair in his direction and the music score by Graeme Revell gives the film a sombre atmosphere. The final scene with Eric and Shelly never fails to pull on the heart strings. Hauntingly good. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely the best movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow is, in my opinion, without a doubt, the best movie of it's genre. It is my favorite movie. I think that the movie just has such an impact on you, it leaves sort of an emptiness in you. I feel so strongly about this movie because, since I know that Brandon Lee died, I feel that the story is real or something. Even with the errors in editing, I still give this movie a 10/10. It has an explosive cast and unique storyline. It seems that today, you can't say that about too many movies. I think that this is a modern classic. Many movies today seem to start off good, with a good cast or a twisted plot line, but in the end, they seem to spoil it by trying too hard. But this movie is what it is. Brandon Lee deserves much more recognition for this role than he got. He had such a presence on screen. Other things about this movie that I liked are that there is drama, suspense, action, it's gothic, and yet it is still a love story. And not to mention some really great lines! The soundtrack and score are really good too. I recommend this movie to everyone, except maybe like small kids or something. SO GO RENT IT!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual masterpiece, "The Crow" shines as the romance classic of its time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Crow" is one of the greatest romance films of our time, and the definitive of its own. From beginning to end, this movie is pure classic: unbelievable art direction, amazing direction from Alex Proyas, and a star turnout from the late Brandon Lee, an actor so talented he outshone his father, another late great-- Bruce Lee. It is unfortunate, because Lee could have used this film to compensate for "Rapid Fire" and become a major star. The Brandon Lee-less sequel, "City of Angels," wasn't nearly as effective or memorable as this. Accept no imitations; the original is the one you want to see. The grand scale look and feel of this film, and the mystique and darkness that surrounds it, makes "The Crow" an unforgettable experience. Why do I say the greatest romance of our time? Lee portrays the lost, grieving soul that must cope with the death of a loved one; so great is his love that he comes back from the dead to avenge her murder by slaughtering those that were involved with it. Twisted? Yes. Gloomy? Yes. Passionate? In a twisted and gloomy way. "The Crow": it's one of a kind, the best of its kind, and is a visual milestone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crow (1994)There's no question this is a vigorous, crazy-violent, youth oriented, anti-establishment movie with a heart. It's utterly romantic in an almost childish way but thank god for that because parts of the movie--more and more of it as it goes--are about exacting revenge. For me, as exaggerated and fun as it is in a way, it still only goes so far.But revenge is a good motive for action, and for bloody theatrical murder. Make no bones about it, the main character, this "Crow" person who has the worldly name Eric Draven (played by Brandon Lee) is a murderous hunk of a dude. He's an archetype of selfish lawless justice. The film is dark dark dark. The mood is dark, the lighting is dark, and the sets are made of dark things--wet pavement at night, blackish brick and empty alleyways, and dark clothes. And that's part of what works amazingly well. Amazingly. You get pulled into this nightmare of Detroit before Halloween, and if all the bad guys are like comic book awful, that's part of it, too. Thankfully it isn't too realistic. Detroit can be scary--I grew up in the outskirts, and I remember being scared for real on Devil's Night, October 30--but Detroit's nightmare isn't silly, not at all. And it's a city filled with decency, too. As one reviewer said, this makes Batman's Gotham look like the Emerald City. Not quite.It's tough to get too demanding about more ordinary things like acting, because the movie doesn't strive for realism. And it sure succeeds at avoiding it. But it succeeds also in keeping us outside of any real sympathies for the characters, except for the little girl, Sarah, who is a terrific and believable presence. Lee was obviously chosen for his body and his rock star kind of good looks (his make up is more Aerosmith than anything, which makes sense because Eric Draven is a rock star). But Lee can't act worth beans, and that's everyone's opinion. Whether you think it matters is another thing. Watch it and see. He has a following of sorts (not like his father Bruce, of course), so that might help. And it's his last film--he died at only 28 years old from an accident during the filming of the movie (a dummy or re-charged blank bullet hit him from a prop gun). Unfortunately that's part of the legend and tragedy of the movie to this day.We are overdue of a really good book overview of the comic book movies, to put their style and different intentions into perspective. Some are zany and live on their plasticky otherworldliness, like maybe the first breakthrough "Superman" movie (1978) which feels bright and colorful overall, or the Tim Burton "Batman" which isn't bright, but it's wacky. Most of these are have fakey scripts that just do the job of getting across the plot. The worst/best example of this might be the visually astonishing and ultimately boring "Watchmen" (which is a live-action animation). "Then there are the very serious seeming Nolan movies, the trilogy (so far), which tries to almost make Batman possible. The Robert Downey Jr. "Ironman" fits into that mold. And I think "The Crow" is really a precursor to these dark and realistic movies. Notice that "The Crow" precedes the first Nolan movie ("Batman Begins") by a decade. But the key difference now is that the believability of the main characters is worlds apart in the two movies--compare Christian Bale with Brandon Lee. Or just look at the scripts of the two movies. It's a wonder that "The Crow" holds up as well as it does. But it does. And it's mostly because of how it was made. Amazing, beautiful, dark visuals and moving camera and incredibly smart editing. And as one last bizarre twist--it was shot in North Carolina, not Detroit--Detroit was probably too dangerous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The themes of loneliness and loss expressed with creative artistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard a lot about The Crow, as well as the tragic story of Brandon Lee's death. But I never saw this movie until last week.What touched me immediately was the commitment of the actors to their character's emotions, particularly by Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson (the police sergeant), and Rochelle Davis (little girl Sarah). I could feel the loneliness and pain of each of these three characters. These emotions are presented powerfully when superimposed against the fantasy storyline, and that is the art of this movie. We rarely see authentic and poignant emotion like this in real life. But I think anyone who has ever experienced loss and loneliness can relate to it.There are many moments in the movie when each of these three characters are abandoned, and then one of the other three appears unexpectedly to provide comfort. They stay long enough only to provide reassurance or hope, and then they disappear. So it looks like these fallen angels are, themselves, angels to save each other.How often in real life does such an angel appear at a moment of despair? In the movie, it happens, and it happens unexpectedly, and that is when any viewer who has felt despair in their own life can feel the joy when this happens, and the sadness that it does not happen in our own real lives. This technique plays loss and hope against each other. I'll admit I cried. This movie was created by deeply felt artists.I looked up the biography of James O'Barr, the creator of The Crow. Along with Brandon Lee's death, there is indeed tragedy sweeping across the real lives behind this movie. Coincidence or not, the creators of this movie have tapped into those tragic threads of life that are so rarely touched by other movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark, textured tale of vengeance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow will always be forever remembered for the notoriety surrounding it concerning Brandon Lee's on-set death. Such a tragedy, for if he had lived, he undoubtedly would have gone on to even greater things. Because he was more than just a fine martial artist (inherited from Bruce), he had true talent as an actor too. Nevertheless, Lee's death added an additional layer of symbolism to what was an already excellent undead revenge tale. It elevates it to classic status.Although in some ways The Crow has a fairly standard revenge plot, its added considerable depth and intelligence, not only because the subject matter becomes intertwined with Lee's real life circumstances, but also because of a rich and accessible screenplay by David J Schow and John Shirley, and the excellent kinetic direction by Alex Proyas.Alex Proyas originated as an MTV director. Usually whenever I see directors branch out into feature films whose background consists of music videos I get apprehensive. About 80% of them turn out films that are all style and no substance to speak of. Joel Schumacher is a particularly guilty offender.Proyas is that rare exception where he can create an atmosphere that becomes substance. He first demonstrated this ability with The Crow, and then outdid himself with his next venture, the quite extraordinary Dark City. One of the most intelligent science-fiction films ever made.The opening shots of The Crow highlight a devastated city. The night before Halloween. Or Devil's Night as its called here. A city in flames. On this unholy night, Eric Draven (Lee) and his fiancée Shelly are both killed by a ruthless gang of street hoods on the evening before their wedding day.Even at this early stage, we know anything can and will happen. In contrast to the violence on display, a child's voice narrates. A child called Sarah (Rochelle Davis' first and only film). She tells the haunting story of how a crow can bring the dead back to Earth to conclude unfinished business.And that's what happens to Eric. The following year, Eric claws his way out of his grave. Reborn. As an avenger of the night. Ready to take revenge on those who robbed him of his life. With the crow as his guide.The Crow is one of the greatest revenge tales ever made. Second only to Sin City, an equally brilliant comic book to film adaptation. Proyas gets right into the heart of it with barnstorming regard. And delivers on every level. From the very second Eric rediscovers himself as The Crow, its just the launching pad for a dizzying, exhilarating adventure.Brandon Lee was perfectly cast. Even when he's buried under striking makeup, he embodies the role so completely that he becomes the living personification of an avenging angel. Something I haven't seen since Tim Burton's Batman.His rich, baritone voice helps no end. And Proyas does everything he can to ensure that Lee cuts a striking, intimidating figure. Some of the camera shots gloriously highlight Lee's frame against a backdrop of breathtaking sunsets and ominous city streets. When he swoops through the air and makes his presence felt, he feels like a comic book character made flesh. One that's stepped right off the printed page. Into our world.The Crow is very exciting. And the whole tone of the film is as thrilling as its possible to get from this type of story. The action scenes are handled with almost operatic reverence. And its a testament to Lee's abilities as an actor that he's not swallowed up by the gritty, neo-noir world Proyas has surrounded him with.But The Crow is not always about the next kinetically driven action scene. Some moments are more thoughtful. And allows us to plumb the psychological depths of Lee's character. His scenes with Sarah are both haunting and poignant. She was Eric's friend in life. And remains his friend in death. Davis made an astonishing debut. Almost as astonishing as Lee's. Such an assured and commanding performance from someone so young. What a shame she never had the film career she so richly deserved. Again, like Lee.And Lee's scenes with Ernie Hudson are rewarding too. He plays a police sergeant who slowly sympathises with The Crow, and eventually helps him to bring down the gang. Schow and Shirley craft some exquisite dialogue from these two characters, and its all delivered perfectly too:"Little things used to mean so much to Shelly. I used to think they were trivial. Nothing is trivial."The grand finale is worthy of epic status. A final battle between the living and the dead. All helped with Proyas' atmospheric direction, and Graeme Revell's chilling, resonant musical score. The finishing touch to a superb, modern classic.As tragic as Lee's death was, it granted The Crow a unique place in history, and afforded it an immortality. This is one film that shall never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I've seen in a while.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You see a crow winging over a scene of urban decay; the majority of the buildings are on fire. A young girl's voice says, "People once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. But sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest. Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right." Welcome to the world of The Crow, one of the most powerful films ever made. The Crow, written by David J. Schow and John Shirley and directed by Alex Proyas. Its story is simple, much like the graphic novel by James O'Barr by the same name: a man and his fiancée are killed, she is raped and tortured, and he comes back as an undead to wreak bloody revenge on the gang that did these horrible things. The execution of the plot sets it apart from similar revenge tales. Everything from the scripting, the casting, the direction, and the acting set this from a simple popcorn movie and into the realm of true art.First, the scripting. There are so many wonderful quotes in this movie that it is impossible to list them all. Each character is given its own unique voice and personality, from the lowly hot-dog vendor to and especially the mysterious and creepy Top Dollar, head of Detroit's underworld of drugs and violence; who has a penchant for saying things like, "Dad gave me this. Fifth birthday. He said, 'Childhood's over the moment you know you're gonna die,'" while gazing at a snow-globe containing a miniature cemetery.Of course, brilliant as the script is, none of these characters would have found their unique voice if not for the casting by Billy Hopkins and Susan Smith. Michael Wincott is absolutely the only person to play the Top Dollar envisioned in this film. (In the comics, Top Dollar is just a leader of a small drug ring.) Ernie Hudson was a solid choice for Sgt. Albrecht. Introducing Rochelle Davis as the world weary and cynical at thirteen Sarah was a stroke of genius, and casting Brandon Lee as the title character, Eric Draven, a.k.a. The Crow, was an inspiration.Of course casting is only as good as the actors' performance. In other roles, Lee put in less than stellar performances, but as Draven, Lee created an opus. He takes a role that could easily been played as an emotionless machine and brought depth and humanity to it. In one ad-lib scene between Draven and Albrecht, he speaks lines that sum up the whole movie: "Little things use to mean so much to Shelley - I thought they were kind of trivial. Believe me, nothing is trivial." Then, as he starts to leave, Albrecht asks if he is just going to vanish again. Draven replies with a wistful smile, "I thought I'd just use the front door," making people see and feel the aching for normalcy in this character through his inflections and body language. Wincott is at his spooky best, but, surprisingly enough, also brings a dark sensuality to his character. Hudson underplays his role, lending it a certain believable, every-man quality, as him and Sarah are the two most normal and sanest people present in this dystopian view of Detroit. Particularly note worthy is the performance by David Patrick Kelley as T-Bird, the leader of the gang that murdered Eric and his fiancée, Shelly. He became so immersed in his role that he bought a classic first printing of Milton's Paradise Lost, Book IV, costing thousands that he was supposed to read from during the murder scene to use as a prop on the film. Rochelle Davis manages to walk a fine line of fragile, youthful hope, and the expected bitter cynicism that one might find in a thirteen year old whose mother is a drug addled prostitute. She brings pathos to this character without making it syrupy and unpalatable. It is true brilliance when one considers that this is her first role.The director of this film also did a superb job. Proyas brought the best out of his actors, obviously, but special attention should also be given to the rich visual styling of the film. The graphic novel was black and white, an ambiance that Proyas achieves in his film by shooting everything in washed out sepia tones making it feel like a rich and fantastically old picture book, or like the viewer is seeing things under water at dusk. Proyas did the unthinkable in that he worked lovingly on a low-budget action flick and elevated it to art. Of course this film, like any other, has its detractors. Some say that it glorifies violence. Granted. It does glorify violence revenge. That doesn't change the underlying fact that this is a truly beautiful film, and does have another, positive message of not taking one moment for granted with a loved one, since one never knows when that loved one won't be there any more. Some say that it is a simple "bug-hunt" film. Once again, this is true. The difference is that most such films are indifferently put together and aimed at the lowest common denominator, while this film strives for and achieves a higher level than that. Finally, some might say that it was ghoulish to release a movie where the star died while filming it. I must say that at first I thought the same thing. I was drug to this movie by a girlfriend, and I entered ready to hate it. Having seen it, and Brandon's other works, I have to say he would have wanted this movie released. It is his masterpiece. I can think of no better swan-song for any actor than the job that Brandon did on this film.</fullReview>

With Such phenomenal acting by the late Brandon Lee makes this movie great, but the action pact movie with, at its time, good visual effects makes this movie powerful in more ways than one. The ending is nothing short of greatness and the music blends with this movie like it was especially made for it, and the cinematography and the colors which exempted real bright colors makes this a darker movie.

		<fullReview>The Crow sadly turned out to be Brandon Lee's swan song, but if a movie was ever befitting such an honour, this was undoubtedly it.Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) was a rock star who was brutally murdered along with his girlfriend on devil's night. One year later he is granted superhuman strength and vision so he can seek vengeance on those responsible.This terrifically dark and Gothic style fantasy is truly compelling and charged with emotion. The action is used sparingly to great effect creating some fantastic scenes that are both visually impressive and brilliantly entertaining. The story, the direction and the performance from Brandon Lee are all excellent.The Crow is a great movie 8/10 R.I.P Brandon, you're fans miss you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Crow' was one of the popular movies during my years growing up. In that time, Metallica was popular, and there were a lot of goths. This film really appealed to them because it had the whole goth, dark style, the sadness/bittersweet love, and the music appreciated so much by that audience. This film succeeded very well in capturing the hearts of the young goth in the late 1980s and early 1990s.This film would probably be best enjoyed by those who grew up with it, because I think it has so much more meaning beyond its story and visuals. Done well, this film has a little bit of everything and there isn't any reason why someone watching it today for the first time would not enjoy it.</fullReview>

I dread the day where remakes of the nineties becomes popular because i don't think anyone can ever deliver this kind of feeling and emotion. I also would like to recognize the religious similarities. Eric is Christ and he must take up the biblical quote "Vengence is Mine" and sacrifice himself to save all he loves. And finally to recognize how many unfortunate things occurred during the filming, Brandon Lee's death, the man who drove the screwdriver through his hand and the fires, it seems destined to have failed yet it only seems stronger.

The cast is incredible and the fact that this movie is not one of the 250 greatest films as voted is a real downer. In my eyes this movie is one of the greatest movies of our generation. Brandon Lee is incredible in this movie. The only cheesy part of this movie is when Eric Draven gets his memories back in the cop's apartment and shakes and falls to the ground. I believe that was just a tad overdone. Now the award for best scene is when Eric kills T-Bird and then throws the lighter on the ground igniting a fire that makes a picture of a crow. That is simply beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie in my video collection. For starters, Brandon Lee was about 29 years old when he died on the set, so young and influential like his Father Bruce Lee who is arguably the first Action Hero, because no doubt in my mind if Brandon lived on, he not only would have been the most talented, successful Actor taking over Johnny Depp, but he would be the most independent Actor in his own rite. Plus, I cannot believe this movie is not older than it is!! Made in 1994 and it still looks great, absolutely Timeless, if it was released in the box office beyond the threshold of the year 2K , the sales would hit the roof, and here is why: The music score is brilliantly composed by Graeme Revell, who also done Child's Play 2 and Bride of Chucky, and the electric Guitar sound during the fighting scenes sores up your adrenal glands and gets them pumping.The Style of the comic strip super hero is a Mosher; the twisted Gothic look that now inspires trends due to the like of Marilyn Manson, and most black metal bands that are appealing at this particular time even as I speak! That is why I am accounting that this movie is beyond it's time.Set on Devil's Night 30 October, Hangman's Noose front man musician, Eric Draven suitably played by Brandon Lee, and beautiful fiancée Shelley Webster were ready for their big day on Hallowe'en Night, but tragedy came when Shelley was Raped and beaten by vicious and invective Gang members by the names of Tin Tin, Skank, T-bird etc. Eric walks in unexpectedly and was beaten, shot and thrown from the window as he plummets a 100 feet below to his death. A cool-headed cop wonderfully played by Ernie Hudson of Hand that rocks the Cradle, and Ghostbusters fame is in charge of the case, breaks the news to 12 year old lonely Sarah who narrates the story in the Movie.Exactly one year later, with a help of a Crow, Eric Draven rose from his grave and become the psychopathic avenger, but he puts his insanity into good use to stalk the Gang one-by-one, turns Tin Tin into a "Voodoo doll", T-bird into a moving flame grilled Whopper burger, and the crack head one that "feels like a worm on a big fvcking hook" known as Skank gets a plunge from the Window and ritualistically leaves an outlined symbol of a Crow at the scene. The head leader of the Gang is Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), his half-Sister who have more than a consanguineous relationship (yep! you guessed it!) along with his comrade Tony Todd (Candyman) as they ploy and find out that a welcomed guest who has come back from the dead to greet them, has a weakness to be human by killing the Crow that guides him and to destroy Eric to allure him by kidnapping Sarah. It is up to Eric to go against all odds to save the captive Sarah and finally rest in peace.I enjoyed Superhero movies like Batman, Spiderman 1 and 2, but they lacked the witty, dark humor that realistically reflects the heart of the chaotic society where scruples don't apply, and the dialogue resembles Quentin Tarantino Style that is compared to DUSK TIL DAWN, and it is a clever movie about a deceased Victim that becomes a deadly vigilante with a scary presence in an anti-hero sense that irritates the law, unlike a geek that gets bitten by a spider, or an embodiment of a poor little orphan dressed as a bat.Better than Batman and Spidey, You are damn right!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Proyas has plenty of visual style. No one who has seen his obscure debut 'Spirits Of The Air..' or his unfairly overlooked 'Dark City' will argue with that. But what 'The Crow' needs desperately is a decent script. Great movies have been made about revenge - Boorman's 'Point Blank' immediately springs to mind - but this isn't one. There is no depth to Draven's character, no real sense of his loss, and no suspense regarding his 'Death Wish'-like path of vengeance. Apparently this movies Goth fans don't need any of this. The sight of the late Brandon Lee drenched in rain with The Cure, JAMC and NiN et al on the soundtrack is enough for them. Not for me I'm afraid. It's just a pity some more effort wasn't put into the script to give Lee and bad guy faves Michael Wincott ('Gunshy', 'Strange Days') and David Patrick Kelly ('The Warriors', 'Twin Peaks') something substantial to work with. As it is 'The Crow' is little more than a full length rock video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, this movie is very mediocre.The storyline is weak. A rock star and his fiancé are murdered on Halloween night by a gang of thugs. The rock star then returns from the dead to seek revenge on the murder and rape of his fiancé. Honestly, this plot screams cliché. The whole rock star idea is extremely cheesy and just reminds me of the rock band KISS and their dreadful costumes.The acting is decent. I feel that Brandon Lee gives off too much of a "good guy" vibe for his role. Despite being dressed up as a menacing, undead badass seeking revenge, he somehow still gives off the impression that he's a nice guy. The gang thugs seem a bit like they're trying too hard. They seem to act how they think thugs would act instead of acting like thugs. I just didn't buy it.The highlight of this film is the special effects, which were well done for 1994. Even so, they fail to outshine a cheesy plot and mediocre acting.Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't all bad, but it just wasn't good. The Crow lies out there in the vast gray area of mediocre action films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's said that The Crow of all birds is the one charged with the special mission of bringing souls to heaven once they've departed this mortal coil. But when one soul leaves behind some business that really needs finishing The Crow can bring you back. Such is the premise of the film The Crow where Brandon Lee is brought back to the mortal coil on a vengeance quest.It's a simple plot not exactly anything original from many other vengeance films with a supernatural twist. The main problem with The Crow is that if you're not a follower of the comic strip on which it is based certain subtleties of the strip probably escaped by attention. Still the film can and was enjoyed by me on a different level.The film did spawn several sequels, sadly though Brandon Lee was not in them. His accidental death in a shooting scene on the set of The Crow has passed into legend, to eerily familiar to his father Bruce Lee's death. Apparently though enough of the film was shot so that it could be released without having to be done over as was the case with Solomon And Sheba when Tyrone Power died, also on that set.I could see also that Brandon Lee even through the pasty white makeup of his undead character Eric Draven that he was quite the charismatic fellow. That The Crow sparked a television series and several sequels is a testament to Lee's performance. Michael Wincott who played the leader of the gang of thugs who killed Lee and fiancé Sofia Shinas is also memorable as is Jon Polito as the pawnshop owner.I'd check The Crow out if I could. Brandon Lee invested a great deal of character within the character and sadly his life as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gothic Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow is a Gothic masterpiece. It is perhaps one of the only action movies to have a lot of heart, and a very uplifting love story and message. There are no other words to describe it other than amazing. It is one of my personal favorites, and I loved every minute of it.Story: The movie is about rock guitarist Eric Draven and his girlfriend Shelly that get murdered the day before their wedding by a group of thugs. One year after his death, Eric is resurrected from the grave, and guided by a mysterious crow. His mission: To avenge the death of himself and his lover. While seeking his vengeance, Eric is plagued by the pain of losing his love, and constantly reminded of what he lost via flashbacks. Sarah, Eric's daughter-like friend, soon learns of Eric's return, and the film deals with her aspect of the situation as well. It sounds like a simple enough mindless action plot, but the movie packs so much emotion and power into it. The movie really exploits the power of love and friendship. Although gritty and violent, it is emotional enough to make even the biggest man teary-eyed.Direction: Alex Proyas(Dark City) filmed a Gothic masterpiece. The directing is very slick and stylish. Proyas was not afraid to make the film have a very dark and bleak look, as to really show how sad Eric is. Rain is a character in this movie, and even the rain is filmed beautifully. Proyas got everything right: Pacing, Color, Mood, and Style. Excellent stuff! Acting: Four actors stood out in my mind in this film. Brandon Lee(Eric Draven) played his part with excellent skill. He knew what he was doing. He nailed every line, and brought a real humanity to the part, which is great. It's important to be able to relate to a character, and care about it. Michael Wincott(Top Dollar) executed the part of the villain with ease. There's a definite evil in the part, as well as humanity, and Wincott knew exactly how to do it. Ernie Hudson(Officer Albrecht) portrayed the city cop quite well. Even though the part was simple enough, Hudson made it very memorable, and brought a lot of meaning to his character. One of the most amazing actors was Rochelle Davis(Sarah) This girl can act! I felt her pain and anger throughout the whole film, and that voice! Man! All the acting in the film was top-notch, but those performances stood out to me.Score: The music was powerful. It draws you in to every scene. Graeme Revell is outstanding as a composer. The music fits the mood for the film.Violence: The film is an action movie, so, there is violence. It is pretty straight forward, and quite gritty. There's plenty of stabbings, brawls, and bloody shootouts.Profanity/Sexual Themes: They are not afraid to drop the f-bomb in the film. Language is throughout, and pretty strong. There is a mild rape scene, as well as some brief female nudity.Substance Abuse: One of the characters is a morphine addict, and some others snort coke. Moderate.Overall: The Crow is an excellent action-thriller that goes into deep and powerful territory. I loved every frame, and every minute of the movie. A must-have. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie played an important part in my youth, how I grew up... at the time I saw The Crow, it was the most cathartic thing for me--Eric Draven kicked the arses of all that had done wrong, sure, the movie's bullies and criminals, but also my school bullies and the general cruelty of life.Apart from Brandon Lee's mesmerising acting, his swansong now tarnished by numerous ripoff sequels and the like, Michael Wincott gives his best as the true embodiment of evil, Top Dollar; the character that was black and white in more ways than one on the page came to life and was pure blackness, pure dark evil. Thanks to that one fantastic--and very underrated--actor, who I still cherish in my personal top ten of screen performers.So, my ten stars are out of sentimental value, but also personal taste--never was a revenge tale so beautifully told, never so uplifting, never... holding so much *hope* in the eventual sunshine--that "it can't rain all the time."</fullReview>

Themes of love, death, and revenge feature heavily, and there is a lot of violence, urban decay, and very little sunlight (not good for those of you who find dark movies hard to watch).Every aspect of 'The Crow' oozes quality: Alex Proyas' fantastic directing (a more visually stunning movie you will not find), the stunning performances by the late Brandon Lee and the menacing Michael Wincott, the fabulous sound track, the brilliant scripting ... I could go on forever.The movie does have its faults though. There are probably not enough flashback scenes of Eric Draven and Shelly Webster in better times, and there are a few inconsistencies in the plot, but these are minor quibbles and do not detract from an otherwise excellent movie.'The Crow' is going to be either one of two things for the first time viewer: an amazing experience, or your worst nightmare.Whether for you it's amazing or a nightmare, 'The Crow' has succeeded in its aim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick, Epic, Gothic, Classic and Tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on James O'Barr's popular comic book series, Alex Proyas's 'The Crow' is a timeless classic. It is superbly executed and Proyas presents the dark, frightening and cruel Gothic world very well with great sets and a wild rock soundtrack. Most of the film is set in the night and it's constantly raining echoing the tragedy of Eric and Shelly's brutal fate. The smart camera-work and quick cuts are very effective. Schow's screenplay is solid as it keeps the viewer engaged from start to end and a lot of attention is given to details. The poetic dialogues are clever with some great one-liners that stay in mind. The fast pace is also well maintained.The movie may have gained wider recognition due to the untimely and shocking death of Brandon Lee. However, 'The Crow' stands on its own as a very strong film. The theme of revenge has been used numerous times but it's the execution, acting....and pretty much everything that makes 'The Crow' standout as a whole package.Brandon Lee is phenomenal as the wounded hero. He's the heart of the film. His dialogue delivery is impeccable and he pulls off the emotional scenes with excellence. Clearly the part was meant to be played by him. The cruel irony of Brandon's death and the tragic theme of the film make it a sadder experience. It's hard to think of what really happened. Rochelle Davis is very impressive as the strong young Sarah. Ernie Hudson too is brilliant in a supporting role. This guy needs more films. Of the villains, Bai Ling stands out as the evil seductress Myca but Michael Wincott is just okay. Top Dollar needed a better actor.'The Crow' is Gothic action fantasy at its best. There have been wannabes like the disastrous 'Blade' series but none have reached the epic measures of this classic. One of the best comic book adaptations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barbed Gothic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Some films are all style - the most interesting of these invents or attempts to.That's why this one is interesting. It exists so that the character can: he brings reality to a sort of tilted world, and that world creates some bad guys and situations.This was back when edgy metal could actually be interesting, and before dopes affected barbed wire tattoos. Its a simple story: revenge, church towers, amenable black cop. And a simple style: Gothic cosmology - goodness disguised darkly, turning the wheels of natural justice. Could have been a western, and was. Before.Preteens find minor profundities in this script and latch onto them. But oddly, they overlook the clever "Bible-as-pawned-goods" notion.

		<shortDescription>No film in a million years will ever top this! A Landmark In Cinematic History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is absolutely phenomenal. Better than The Godfather, better than The Matrix and better than Die Hard! The Crow is one of the best films ever made. It is just like any other rubbish basic storyline. Man and his fiancée get killed. Man gets resurrected a year later and kills the people who murder him. But Proyas's sharp and exquisite directing and Brandon Lee's sensational role as Eric Draven (The Crow) has turned this film into one of the best films of all time! And its not just Lee who puts in a stunning performance. Michael Wincott - in my opinion a superb but underrated actor - turns in a superb role as the sadistic and menacing master criminal Top Dollar.Despite all of the violence and gore, it doesn't lead us away from the fact that this story is about true love lasting forever. Usually in films like this, they just mention the death of a loved one a couple of times and then it's forgotten and it gets boring. But in this film, Shelley (Lee's fiancée in the film) is mentioned a lot by Eric and a series of flashbacks - including the scene where she is beaten and raped by the villains in the movie, Tin Tin, T-Bird, Funboy and Skank - makes us realise just how much love they had for each other and we feel satisfied when Eric picks off each of the villains in an assortment of gruesome ways.The dark sets and characters all add to the gritty, Gothic atmosphere that just made me admire this film even more. It is also one of the only films i have seen where the cast has been chosen to perfection. If Lee was still alive today, I have no doubt that he would be one of the best actors around. R.I.P.My advice to anyone who hasn't seen this film. Rent it or buy it as soon as possible! You have no idea what you're missing.10 out of 5 Stars. Keep em coming Proyas!</fullReview>

Apart from the atmosphere, set design and photography everything is so dull and boring. Acting, screenplay, direction and every other thing about the movie are so poor and mediocre I cant help but to dislike the movie. Editing at some places seems rushed. and From Bruce Lee son you expect at least good action and martial arts skills but well what you get lifeless action and no martial arts. i amaze that i seen the same movie as the other.

		<shortDescription>Top 10 Worst Movies I Have Ever Watched!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, so before I watch any movie I always come to this site. If a movie get anything higher than a 7.3 I usually get excited. Seeing as how The Crow has a 7.5 I thought I would watch it. Little did I come to find that this movie wouldn't even get a 1/10 on my scale.What a horrible film. The acting was horrible and the story line was just bad. Brandon Lee was not a good actor and the supporting cast was extremely bad as well. The flow of the movie was awful as well leaving you hanging more than once.Maybe I'm being to hard on this film because it was made in 1993 and most movies back then were filmed the same way, but I literally fast forwarded to the end of the movie because I couldn't take it any longer.If they were to remake this film today, I believe it could be much better, but for the one I saw, it sucked!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat, dull, stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only guess at the age and experience of those who, in other reviews of this movie, have dubbed it "the best movie ever". Viewers be forewarned: it isn't, not by a long-shot.What it is: a comic-genre film - and like most film versions of dark comics, it is enslaved to rain and shadows, candlelight and eyeliner aesthetics, pseudo-intellectualism and faux-poetic moments. It suffers greatly from an unbelievable premise (murderous super bad guys run wild in the streets, doing their will) and mind-numbingly dense dialog. I watched this movie just recently for the first time - and had to check all the background material on it because I just couldn't believe it was actually shot in the nineties - it is an eighties movie in every way shape and form, hearkening back to the days of the early Cure, Bauhaus, Souxsie and the Banshees, etc.The acting is flat all around (Brandon Lee spends the entire movie with his chin on his chest, glaring menacingly from underneath his furrowed brow) and what little there is of character is two-dimensional - a comic book view of the world, juvenile and meaningless, trying desperately to be "deep".If Brandon Lee hadn't died during production, this film would be regarded as nothing more than an amusing goth fantasy - and not the goth cult classic it seems to have become. I guess I understand some people's emotional attachment to it, but back when I was being goth and under the influence of nihilist aesthetics, my friends and I read Baudelaire, Sartre and Dostoevsky. To us, a film like this would be as intellectually an emotionally fulfilling as the popcorn you might eat while watching it. The "best movie ever"? Sorry. No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>you have to be objective, this is a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stop giving this movie a high score just because of the circumstances, does it all of sudden make this movie great? You know it doesn't deserve a 7.x on IMDb. It's a stupid, worthless movie. This fails on several, if not all levels. I couldn't even finish watching this cheesy movie, half of this juvenile trash was enough for me before I finally gave up being sadistic enough to torture myself with this.This has such bad and unconvincing acting, especially by the star of the film, Brandon Lee. A movie with a poorly executed story is made even harder to watch when the star of the movie couldn't act his way out of a house with no walls (therefore no roof, think about it). His wife got raped and killed, what is he supposed to be, angry or campy? Why is he making jokes as he toys with his victims? This is like a damn cartoon for 10 year olds. If the movie didn't take itself so seriously, then I wouldn't mind that performance choice so much. Everything from the script and the dialog was formulaic. How can anyone think this is a great movie? It's not 100% horrible, but it ain't Spider-Man, it's Elektra, enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Possibly Great Movie In It's Time That Did Not Age Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really feel terrible writing this review, especially seeing everyone else raving about how great this movie is, and also, knowing about Brandon Lee's infamously tragic death on the set, but I must write on. Unfortunately, I watched this movie for the first time 10 years after it was released, I can only assume this was a costly mistake, the ruining of a legend for me. By the time it started, I knew I would be disappointed, and I was. To me, this movie was a tragic, god awful mess. Simply too melodramatic, too pseudo-poetic (psuedo as in what they tried to do did not work at all), and much too talky. Too many people explained way too many things that should have been inferred. Too many characters were stereotypes, mainly concepts represented by human bodies, and actors not doing a good job at portraying them. I know this may sound like blasphemy, but Brandon Lee, rest his soul, was not a good actor, at all. Actually quite the opposite. It looked like a terribly written movie with terrible actors, yet a big heart, that's the only good thing I could say about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and Gritty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie in 1994 or '95 it was so much better. I wonder at the workings of the teenage brain. But, just like taste buds develop and change over time so do tastes in entertainment, people, conversation, etc. Now the adult me doesn't enjoy the same movies as the teenage me. Not a problem but I will have to revisit so many of those movies I considered great (Natural Born Killers I'm talking to you).Saying that The Crow is a dark movie is putting it mildly. It was a dark and gritty setting with dark and gritty characters. The Crow is basically a tale of revenge with a touch of mysticism involved. The movies attractiveness is in the raw, dirty, dark and gritty feel to it. The setting was very akin to a Mad Max, Class of 1984, Robocop and other movies with wanton lawlessness.What escaped me before -because I was so enamored with the Crow and his dismantling of his foes- was the terrible dialog and poor acting. There were some very nice lines in there but overall it was just poor dialog. Obviously, The Crow was never popular because of its Oscar-worthy script. I think it appealed and still appeals to a certain niche of hardcore followers. It's a movie that you're either into or you're not. I was into it and now I'm not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and Gloomy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's "Devil's Night" (Oct 30th) in Detroit and arsonists are busy burning down everything they can. Meanwhile, thugs have broken into an apartment loft where a man by the name of "Eric Draven" (Brandon Lee) and his fiancé reside. They kill both. Fast forward a full year and suddenly a crow appears at the grave of Eric Draven. Slowly the body of Eric emerges from the grave possessed with only one desire?revenge on those who killed him and his fiancé. Anyway, rather than disclose what happens afterward and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that this was a dark and gloomy "comic book" movie with lots of action and pyrotechnics. Although I liked the performance of Brandon Lee at the same time I also thought he was remarkably inconsistent due largely to some weaknesses in the script rather than his acting ability. Likewise, the plot seemed to meander here and there which undermined some of overall effect. Fortunately, the supporting cast contributed solid performances and the background music was also quite good. All in all, this was a decent film and I rate it as slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow has reached an iconic high in the movie realm, mostly because it was the last movie that Brandon Lee stared him, as he Brandon died on set during the production of the film; his death was due to a gunshot. The gun was supposed to be loaded with blanks, but one life ammunition bullet was lodged in the gun that was then loaded with blanks. His death on set made the movie gross more than the producers could ever imagine and turned this movie to a cult classic.The movie is an adaptation of a comic book series of the same name, that was created by James O'Barr and it tells the tale of the life of Eric (Brandon Lee). Eric and his fiancée were attacked at their home, Eric got shot and he was paralyzed, and could only watch as Shelly his fiancée is savagely beaten and raped. The attackers finally kill Eric.But a year later Eric is resurrected by a crow, now he hunts the men that killed him and his fiancée, Eric is now an undead, unable to be killed or hurt (as long as he stays on course, which is revenge on those who killed him and his fiancée).The movie boasts of fast paced action, the movie adaption of the comic is seen by many to be near accurate. The movie's cinematography is engaging as we mostly are moving around with Eric in the night, the camera angles or light feed never make you wish that there were gotten from another shot or you needing more light. Then there is the score, the dark rocky score that brings you into the melancholy mood of Eric as you watch, the movie doesn't at any time take you to a high of good things happening then brings you back to the main dark theme Alex Proyas (the director, and also director of Dark City (1998) and I, Robot) made sure that from the get go of this movie you are introduced to a sad theme, a sad scene, a sad story and it the movie keeps to that till the end.The Crow goes places other hero movies don't want to go, no breather just darkness.The movies special effects were most rewarding and the story is very engaging a fit none of the other sequels after it has been able to accomplish, as more sequels were being released the worse the ratings they were getting, making this movie stand out the more.A remake of this said "untouchable classic" is being done, the argument is will this remake be as good as the original or is it just going to follow the way all the other sequels went. My take on this is, Hollywood filmmakers are now at the end of their rope, going back to remake movies or dragging them into trilogies just to make more money, the remake falls into this suit if you ask me (suit of not having an idea of what movie to do), because such movies like this should never be remade. That said, I will be watching the remake with high hopes, reason being times have changed, 1994 and now that is more than 18 years, enough technological advancement that could not be employed in 1994 will be used in this remake, I just hope it won't suck.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Crow," Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) comes back from the dead as a Marilyn Manson-wannabe and exacts a brutal revenge against several criminals for killing him and his girlfriend. The plot is as simple as that, but the movie plays well because Brandon Lee's portrayal of Draven as a man consumed with insanity and rage is highly original. The movie works best with those scenes where Brandon Lee is just talking to the criminals before beating them to a pulp or killing them in highly gratuitous ways that impress even the head villain. Yet this film is also less entertaining when the movie shifts away from Lee's intense lines of dialogue to the card board villains (which are as two dimensional as any of the villains in the Karate kid movies or most of the Steven Seagal films), the cops that play the role of incompetent spectators (much like they did in the first Die Hard film), and the action sequences which for the most part come straight off the assembly line of most Hollywood action pictures. "The Crow" is not a bad film, but it comes across only as a competently made picture that depends almost entirely on Brandon Lee's bravura performance.</fullReview>

It combines all of the good genre's of movies. It had action, romance and thrill. None of the other "Crow" movies are as good or even compare to the first. One thing that amazes me about this movie is Brandon Lee actually died in the process of making it and they continued production. I never would have guessed that they could do that and it still turn out to be an amazing movie. My favorite line in the movie " Buildings burn, People die, but real love is forever." This line fits in with the movie because it is centered around Devils night and there is a group of "gang bangers" who go around setting fires, Brandon lee kills the bad guys who killed his fience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Crow" may be the most important poetic effort in modern Horror. We get a romantic story from the grave that deals with revenge, rage, the occult (all about the crow), corruption, innocence, and more. All of these elements are glued together by Eric's motives in a poetic manner.The atmosphere is dark but extremely beautiful. You can feel the adrenaline in most of the important scenes. You could take a picture of almost every single scene. There's plenty of violence, amazing action sequences (the car explosion could be considered as one of recent cinema's most powerful moments), an endearing on-screen duo formed by Eric and the cop, sadness and fury when the flashbacks re-tell the story, etc.The Direction is flawless. The comic-book feeling is extraordinary and I can't think of any other movie (except for "The Dark Knight") where you can feel you are actually living the experience. The acting by Brandon Lee is timeless. Unique. The score is fantastic (loved the jazz tracks and "Big Empty" by STP). This is a poem of a movie. Watch it and enjoy the dark, touching, violent world of "The Crow".</fullReview>

It is fast paced, with great performances - mostly Brandon Lee.Brandon Lee is amazing as the Crow. He is funny, emotional, and reminds me a lot of the Joker in The Dark Knight. Especially the make-up.The Crow is sentimental, action-packed, and amazingly entertaining.</fullReview>

Everyone else in the film also did a good job in there rolls.The film is pure raw emotion, from his death, his rebirth, the revenge taken out on those that wronged him and his girlfriend, till the very end of the movie.

		<fullReview>Until recently I did not had the privilege to watch this cult classic but I must confess I was not hoping much out of it as the main star cast included a one certain Brandon Lee. But as the movie went on I realized that Brandon was truly one fine actor who before this one was not given adequate script to work on.This is a kind of movie one should gift another or even keep in his own personal collection. The cinematography was excellent and action was brilliant as did not posses that high flying gravity defying martial arts instead it was more natural.The acting is brilliant, Brandon Lee was simply superb shame that he died during filming this motion picture, I guess god is not fair in certain aspects. Rochelle Davis as a teenager was awesome, pity that she didn't featured in any other movie after this. Ernie Hudson &amp; Michael Wincott were very good in their respectable roles, Bai Ling was perhaps the only one who was wrongly cast.The story is great and the overall package was not only entertaining but also enterprising. I would give it an eight out of ten but simply because of Brendon it gets nine out of ten. Do watch this movie as it will surely deliver to your expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, a film gets a lot of appraisal if one of the main actors dies. I.E. Dark Knight. I love Dark Knight as well as Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker - But it certainly wouldn't have gotten that much publicity had it not been for his unfortunate early demise.I can almost guarantee - Even though I was too young at the time - When Brandon Lee died for this film, this film had the same deal. Well, if it did, I agree with them. This film is IMO one of the greatest I have ever seen. It truly shows that had Brandon Lee lived, he would've been an all time action star.The story is surrounding Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) along with his fiancé Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) being murdered by a gang of thugs. One year later, Eric is brought back to life by the mystic power of The Crow to avenge the lost of his love and to set things right.In my view, acting is superb on everyone's part. The scenery of a dark corrupted city is fantastic. Action is very bad ass. Progression is great as well. It's not a film that feels like it's going too long, or feels boring at all. It has a nice flow and pace to make everything about it interesting. The story is intriguing from beginning to end, and has very minimal loopholes.Again with acting, it proves that Brandon Lee wasn't just an action star, he was an ACTion star. Meaning he could pull off the character he is suppose to portray very well.If you want a film to enjoy, I definitely recommend it. Great action, directing, acting, story, pace and flow. A true classic in my books.</fullReview>

Brandon Lee I'm sorry was not the best performance out of the whole thing my personal favourite actor in this was Angel David, he plays Skank he was too hilarious when he's trying to explain that Eric was killing them all off Michael Wincott was trying not to laugh I could tell.I found out a remake of this is scheduled in 2011 Starring Mark Whalberg as Eric (I could be wrong about that). A couple of things I would like to know 1. How many people are they trying to un-impress here? 2. Why Eric? There were many others in the comic books so why him?I am not the sort that praises a movie because an actor in it has died so when I say it's a good movie believe me It's a good movie. If there is any action movie of 1994 that I would recommend to you it would be this.In memory Of Brandon Lee Febuary 1 1965 - March 31 1993</fullReview>

Eric walks from his grve to his apartment, with pain and memories of that terrible day where his fiancé was raped and murdered by a group of thugs, the day before their wedding. Soon the crow shows and leads the way to destroy the people who did this awful deed to Eric. Eric Draven being back from the dead is invincible now and one by one kills all responsible to only find a greater revelation. The Crow is a awesome movie, i watched it for the first time in 2010, even though it was released in the late 90s, i put the movie in my all time favourites, brandons acting was excellent, magnificent, there's no words to descrube. Unfortunately he was killed on set, by a shooting accident, this movie was probably landmark movie for the Lee family. Rest In Peace Brandon Lee, you are missed by thousands worldwide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent superhero film that takes every opportunity to elevate the material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the brutal graphic novels of James O' Barr, The Crow follows a murdered rock star named Eric Draven(Brandon Lee) who was murdered along with his fiancé, who was also brutally raped, by a pack of savage hoodlums on the night before Halloween. A year later, a crow brings Eric back to life as a kind of zombie in order for him to avenge the death of his loved one so that they can finally rest in peace. After putting on mime make-up and dressing himself in dark clothing, he goes out and exacts gruesome revenge He eventually comes across the drug lord and gang leader known as Top-Dollar, a decadent and incestuous monster of a man who will make his task of avenging the death of a loved one a lot trickier.One thing that I can easily say about this film is that it is one of the best looking superhero films out there, if not THE best. Forget about films like Sin City, which goes all the way into basically replicating the exact look of the comic book that it is based on. There's nothing wrong with that film, but I feel that using practical effects, lighting, and skillful photography works a lot better. I feel that it looks better, it helps bring you into the world that the film takes place in a lot more smoothly, and it incites more of a sense of atmosphere. Sin City is fine, but this is more my kind of thing. The Crow makes it a point to allow the tone of this story to shine through over everything else. It is a film that is, more than anything, about loss and about death. What I find unique about it is that it takes it's time to not get into the heavy-handed nature of it all and instead allows it to be a part of the story. I found this approach to be incredibly powerful, and also somewhat unusual. Instead of showing us these characters as how they are, we are instead treated to a kind of dignified anthem of madness and chaos. The villains in this film are just as crazy and just as deranged as those in any other action comic book superhero film, but instead of giving them a bunch of cool lines and ridiculous costumes, the film gives them personality. Sure, they are recycled personalities, but what I appreciated the most about them was that the death scenes were about as cold and as brutal as they could be without being preachy. There is a lot of death and a lot of blood, but it all works surprisingly well in establishing the bleak, dark, and sinister atmosphere. One thing that is worth noting is that this is an extremely violent film, probably the worst film I've seen or at least one of the most worst. One of the most bizarre things about this film, actually, is that it's filled with graphic, gruesome death and gore, and yet it has a sense of morality to it as well as morality based lessons about love, companionship, and doing the right thing in times of darkness. It's one of the strangest juxtapositions I've seen in film, and I'm sure that a lot of viewers probably were, or are, turned off from it for these reasons. I never let things like that bother me, however, especially if the film is a superhero film. Despite what many people say, this is an entertaining film that is full of over-the-top action, brutal fight scenes, gut-wrenching sadism, and explosive death. If you like brutal violence, this is one to check out. Brandon Lee, while he is certainly not a good actor, has plenty of charisma, and the sadistic glee he takes in dispatching his victims is quite amusing and is well-timed. He plays a character who, while not entirely interesting, is certainly very likable and quite creative. Lee's screen presence in this film is exceptional. The rest of the cast is colorful and appropriately cartoon-like. The one thing that really helps make this film work as good as it can, however, is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is filled to the brim with dirty, grimy, dark, and hard metal and industrial music from the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Stone Temple Pilots, and The Cure. It is absolutely one of the best, I repeat, THE BEST nineties film soundtracks you will ever hear. It works because this film takes place in a kind of universe that is full of disappointment and death, and that's what a lot of this music is about. It's rare to find such a perfect combination of music and mood in film, but this is one of the best examples of a nineties film that does exactly that.Make no mistake about this review. The Crow is still an action film. However, it is an action film that takes advantage of all opportunities to elevate itself above the material and works in doing so a good amount of the time. It's one of the best films of it's genre and one of the best action films of the nineties. It's not for the squeamish, nor is it for the easily offended, but it's got a lot of beautiful cinematography, a lot of good emotion, some stunning performances from the supporting cast, a lot of high quality action, and a brilliant soundtrack. When the film doesn't work, it's not overly distracting or ridiculous. In a lot of ways, it's one of the most charming films I've seen of it's type. I think that it's a very good film and that it's worth seeing. I laughed, I cried, and I smiled a lot. If anything, it's one hell of a satisfying and savage action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alex Proyas' film takes James O'Barr's fictional but intensely personal comic, and takes a step backwards from the rawness which emanates from every page of the original.As a result, the film is more accessible to a general audience. It is still very dark - both in tone and also literally - but it doesn't hurt as much as O'Barr's. Perhaps this is because we never get to know our two murdered lovers very well. Eric is simply an agent of vengeance, an engine of death. He us driven by a need to administer justice to those who killed him and his fiancée a year before, and we never really get to know much about him before his death. As a result, we never feel his pain, and this is a flaw: if the audience had a deeper emotional investment in the protagonist, the film would have been a major success. As it is, it is simply a dark, action packed mood piece.This sounds like damning with faint praise, and is perhaps a little unfair. The cast are all good, the mood is well established, and all the action set pieces are delivered well. I just wish it had gone that one step further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best romantic revenge movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie originally came out, I went to see it because I was a huge Bruce Lee fan and naturally interested in Brandon Lee. I never knew this would be one of my all time favourite movies.This is a dark movie, in fact, until the very end of the movie there is not one scene in daylight. The fact that the full movie is set at night heightens the whole experience greatly. Throughout the movie it never stops raining, which is noted in the dialogue, this only serves to increase the moody atmosphere throughout. The cinematic scenes are amazing, utilising the conditions, surroundings and music to dramatic effect. Some of the scenes are pure visual genius i.e. the battle scene in the gangsters lair with the strobes, guns, combat. The chase scene across the rooftops is great also.The cast couldn't have been more suited, Brandon is believable an obviously delivers on his action scenes. The main villain Michael Wincott's plays a perfect part also, he is rightly typecast in his other films due to his voice and appearance. The gang are great, they are believable scum, this only serves to fuel your thirst for revenge. The Cop and Sarah who are his living link to his past offer a little bit of respite from the revenge rampage. Its a shame that the young actresses who played Sarah appeared to be affected by the death of Brandon and never acted again.The soundtrack and musical score are outstanding. I was in no way into the type of music in the soundtrack before I watched the crow. I was converted through this movie. Burn by the Cure is my personal favourite, I was also introduced me to Nine Inch nails, Stone Temple Pilots, Pantera and more. Again, this soundtrack combined with the dark, violent scenes are perfectly matched at every scene.The whole of the above results in an awesome action, sentimental, dark revenge cult movie. The concept of the movie is great, the unfortunate death of Brandon is this movie morbidly contributes to the overall mystique and attraction to the film. I was genuinely that another talented Lee passed away before their prime.Turn the lights out, sound up and watch this film now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crow. An example of the a comic book which has been made into Art. Conversely, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings is an example of Art being made into a comic book.I haven't watched this one for well over 10 years. I was first struck by the resemblance to Blade Runner in the opening scene - sweeping over a dark, dismal cityscape with flames billowing from buildings. The constant rain, the trash bestrewn streets and gutters, the decaying buildings, the denizens....you can see the influence of Ridley Scott's early masterpiece here. But The Crow is no mere imitation of a work that is itself unique and insurpassable. The Crow seems more to me like a sister film, a film with similarities of visual style to Blade Runner, but a film with a spirit of its own.Brandon Lee somehow imparts an energy and a passion and a belief to the role of Eric Draven that comes across as true. On this basis it is easy to enter this world, it is easy enough to believe that this man has indeed come back from death, not as a ghost, but as flesh and blood, to exact bloody retribution on those who cruelly cut short the life of the woman he loved. For it is not so much his own death that consumes him. It is clear enough that the rage which drives him is the dark side of the bright fire of love that burned within him, while living, for his beloved.His performance gives the film its power. And while the characters are most certainly symbols, they are real too, they are flesh and blood and personalities. The film enfleshes these passions of the soul - love, rage, hatred - hatred of darkness and hatred of light.Although the setting, the city is nameless, we do not need a name and do not even wish for one. Somehow, the police procedural aspect, the typical foot-slogging, persistent and good-hearted beat cop, typically harangued and periodically bawled out by his arrogant, suit-wearing superior nicely grounds the film in a reality with which we are very familiar, if only from countless television shows of the ilk. It works well, and not for a second did I think I was looking at card-board cut-outs of people.This is a great film. It belongs, with a small minority of other films, in the realm of Art. It belongs in the pantheon, along with The Odyssey, with the Lord of the Rings (book), with Handel's Messiah, with the statue of David, with the Sistine chapel......and so on. By no means is it without its flaws, its faults. Among them, I would NOT include the straightforward plot. How many films with twisted, convoluted plots do you watch over and over and over once the mystery is untangled? On the other hand, I ask you, fans of The Crow, how many times have you watched this? It has raw power. You may know exactly what's going to happen, but you're hanging on by your fingernails to the last frame.It's beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Proyas made the film adaptation of the 1989 comic book of the same name by James O'Barr.Brandon Lee, one of the most talented guys of it's time, died during this film was being filmed. 'The Crow' actually has quite a history, the film was a huge success in it's time, this was Lee's last film, and this film has gained a cult following over the years.The moment you tune in 'The Crow' you sucked into the world of Eric Draven, who returns from the dead to avenge revenge of his and his would-be-wife's death. Alex Proyas directs the film with style, this film has soul. A roller-coaster ride! The film is highlighted with slick action sequences, Lee's memorable performance, and of course the brilliant direction. The film carries a stylish look throughout. A Masterpiece! Easily A 1994 Classic!On the whole 'The Crow' is a riveting classic. Brandon Lee is a talent we'll always remember. Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic And Gothic Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow is a film that I knew I would like before I even watched it. Directed by Alex Proyas, who also directed my favourite sci/fi flick of all time, Dark City, works his Gothic magic here and shows us that not all fantasy/comic book films have to be immature.Whenever I talk to people about The Crow, they either love it (because it's apparently the new emo thing to do, just like Darko) or hate it because it was too dark. Both of these reasons are unfair to an intelligent and well directed film.Although the idea of revenge in films has been done to death numerous times before, The Crow takes a unique approach to the subject. This is mainly due to the main character himself, who is a favourite of mine. Well acted by Brandon Lee, who tragically died on the set of the film. Much like the death of health Ledger, one can only imagine what his career would have been like if he were still alive today.Alex Proyas is someone to look out for in his future projects, his weakest film, I, Robot is still pretty decent. I think he is underrated as is this film. It's a shame that they made so many crappy sequels that the original sometimes gets thrown into that bad mix. I mean come on, Furlong as The Crow? I can't take that seriously. As it is today, this film stands out from those and many other comic book flicks. It's definitely in my top 5 comic book adaptations and in a sense it breaks that genre, well before Dark Knight did. But not many people see that.If you haven't seen this one, pick it up now. It's Gothic atmosphere, great direction and acting will draw you in. The story of love, revenge and redemption is one for the ages.</fullReview>

It was well done, except from his father's film Game of Death when the editing to it look like Bruce Lee was still in the film was badly done and shouldn't have went ahead with it's release. I heard Brandon's fiancée didn't want the release of The Crow to go ahead after what happened to him. They were both great men that I would've liked to meet and hope they're at peace.

As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is "better" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. I was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it. Who has to be withdrawn is not george lucas but the last reviewer SAMPAT GO AWAY. Cary Guffey</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brandon Lee's epic performance is left behind in this legendary movie in which he will forever be remembered as the very first "Crow." Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his fiancée Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) are killed just before they are set to be married. A year later, while visiting their graves, Sarah (Rochelle Davis) notices a crow atop of Eric's gravestone ("who are you, the night watchman?"). When Sarah leaves, the crow somehow resurrects Eric back to life. When he revisits his old place, he find himself to be invincible and paints himself. He goes on a mission to get revenge on the people who stole his life away.The plot of the movie is inspiring even though it's about revenge and murder. It makes a new hero, who is immortal, unless his crow is killed or damaged. The villains are played well and the characters are easy to hate, but you love to hate them. There is cool visual effects and memorable quotes that you'll probably be quoting for dozens of years after viewing the film.The cinematography is dark and with the constant rain you really get a feel of how the characters feel. The heroes Eric and Sarah are developed well and the friendship between Eric and Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) is wonderful due to the good chemistry. The only shame of this film is the real life death of Brandon Lee which caused him to be replaced in the sequel by a different actor and character.It's been 14 years since the movie was released, but I still love it like it was released yesterday.

Eric Draven a very mysterious character coming back from the dead to revenge those who have done him beautifully played by Lee, and a performance no one will ever be able to repeat. i was always on the edge of my seat when watching this film. my favorite scene has to be when Eric is sitting on the curb and Albrecht arrives to try and arrest him.The Film it self i believe had a great perfect story behind it, one that was portrayed to a huge success the use of sound and lighting gave the film a very real feel to it and a instant classic that will never b repeated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My all time favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I watched "The Crow" at least 30 times during the last 5 or 6 years. And it's not because I didn't had any other great movies to watch. It's because I never seen movie that has so much emotions,great acting,soundtracks, dialogs's and everything else that is needful to make, I'll dare to say it, a perfect movie. This is not just some usual "vendetta" action movie we get a chance to see very often these days. Above all, it's a great love story. And it all began with James O' Barr.I remember when I read James O'Barr's masterpiece "The Crow". From the moment I read the first page, the introduction page, I knew I have in my hands something extraordinary. The best way to express my impressions is to use John Bergins words and say that James didn't wrote just another comic book. He wrote a love letter,the most beautiful love letter I have ever read. Alex Proyas and Brandon Lee where the one's who showed their talent and managed to put this story on screen in the best possible way.I've seen a lots of different comic adaptations, but in the most of occasions movies couldn't live up to my expectations. The Crow is definitely not one of them. This is one of those movies that can be made only once (the best proof are other pretty bad sequels), but can be watched over and over again. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.Like the book,the movie shows us what it means to lose someone close to us. Just then we'll know emptiness and what it means to be completely and utterly alone. And nothing can prepare us for that day. Nothing. Brandon Lee gave us an Oscar worthy performance of Eric Draven, a man whom exactly that happened. I read that he did everything he could to make his character look realistic as much possible. And after that terrible shooting accident, it was (at least I think so) impossible to find someone who would be good enough to replace Brandon. But then Proyas and his team showed us how capable they really are and managed to film this movie to the end without making any mistake.So, I don't know how helpful my babbling was to you, but I hope I managed to convince you to watch this movie. The same goes for reading O'Barr's comic book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Genre Role For An Immortal Hero...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We'll probably never know what would've happened to the first movie in THE CROW series, if Brandon Lee were still walking around today. Unfortunately, it will forever be stained with the reputation as the film that ultimately led to his death, and because of that fact, even today it carries with it an aura of mystery and a powerful attraction for the morbidly curious. It's worth noting that it's also one helluva good-looking, well-paced Gothic drama.The graphic novel by James O'Barr, upon which THE CROW is based, was less the product of a dark and disturbed mind than the result of O'Barr metaphorically cutting himself wide open and just splattering his guts all over the pages. As a way of dealing with the shocking and untimely death of his fiancée, (yes, that really DID happen), this pitch-black drama is the result.Set in a bleakly nihilistic future, it's the story of struggling rock musician and artist Eric Draven, (Lee), and his girlfriend Shelley (Sofia Shinas), who become the latest victims of a brutal crime wave instigated by crazed kingpin Top Dollar (Michael Wincott). By the power of supernatural events and sheer force of will, Draven comes back from the dead and literally rips his way through the crime lord's minions to get to him. Of course, not a lot of this attracts the attention of local law enforcement, save the man who is probably the last good cop left in the world, let alone the entire city, Sergeant Albrecht (Ernie Hudson.) Witnessing all the carnage is a young girl named Sarah (Rochelle Davis) the narrator of the story, who together with Albrecht are basically the only friends the undead vigilante has. Directed by DARK CITY'S Alex Proyas from a pretty faithful screenplay by horror author David J. Schow and John Shirley, THE CROW was one of the innovative Gothic dramas based on graphic novels, that successfully paved the way for so many of the others that have come out since (FROM HELL, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, V FOR VENDETTA, etc.) All of them have their merit, but none have quite the oppressive feel for gloom and doom that THE CROW has. Much of this quality is due to the outstanding job on production design by Alex McDowell and the cinematography of Dariusz Wolski, whose pictures painted so evocatively with textures and shadows recall the best work of the late, great Conrad Hall.But great movies don't get that way based strictly on the technical aspects, and I do believe that if he had lived, Brandon Lee's rage-and-angst-filled performance as the anguished (and unendingly angry) Draven would've finally gotten him the notice, respect and the kind of work that he craved so much while building the foundation for his career. And because he steps up so intensely with his work, it makes the rest of the cast raise their game as well. Genre favorites abound here, from GHOSTBUSTER'S Hudson and Wincott, to DREAMSCAPE'S David Patrick Kelly and longtime vet and perennial heavy Jon Polito. Also helping it's classic cult status is a killer soundtrack that has to be one of the best "alterna-goth" collections in genre history (a close tie with RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE LOST BOYS.) This was the time when I either "discovered" or re-discovered bands such as The Cure ("Burn"), Machines of Loving Grace ("Golgotha Tenement Blues"), NIN/Trent Reznor ("Dead Souls") and Stone Temple Pilots ("Big Empty").Also cementing its eternally creepy cachet is the fact that it was one of the first movies ever to use "digital technology" to manipulate the image of an actor unavailable to "finish" his role, (the film was completed after Brandon's death.) Only the sharpest of eyes might be able to figure out where the real Brandon's performance ends and the "digital stand-in's" begins, but then again, why bother? This is his legacy, and even if it weren't, the movie deserves better than merely that kind of scrutiny.This is just one more classic that demands to become a permanent part of your library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "dark" superhero 14 years ago.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>14 years after its original release, and the movie still holds up well! This inspite of watching dozens of movies that have copied or have been inspired in different ways from Alex Proyas's excellent 'dark' superhero movie.Although the movie comes across very simple and straight forward, considering that we have seen all the movies that this pioneered, it still stands on its own for the wonderful portrayal of a back-from-dead vigilante out to avenge the destruction of his life. Brandon Lee, who died in a freak accident while this movie was shot, plays his resurrected character of Draven coming to terms with his new found powers with such fierce glee that it becomes difficult to disassociate the actor from the character. It's not that he is a good actor - it's just the physical grace he brings to his movements that makes the supernatural element of his character's presence more effective. Most of the movie plays out in the night (two nights a year apart from each other), something which Proyas had done in Dark City too before succumbing to the Hollywood machine. If seen these movies when they were released, it would be easy to be excited about the future of this promising director.The movie is a let down though when it comes to the supporting characters and the villain. As much as the Crow goes about executing his oppressors over one night, there is no sense of threat to him as he finishes them off with relative ease - although in spectacular fashion.For fans of cinema, the movie adds a lot to enjoy. It starts with a homage to Blade Runner. And references to The Crow are equally easy to find in later movies, especially in The Matrix. Or when relating Heath Ledger's Joker to Brandon Lee's Crow in a few key scenes. What a tragic coincidence that both actors died before their milestone performances were released.My rating --&gt; 3 of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie which will mark a masterpiece of cinema excellence. Coming back from the dead is an experience no one wants to have. But when it comes to losing a loved one from a crime, the results is traumatic. The Crow gives the meaning of revenge and redemption. Brandon Lee plays in his final role as Eric, a musician whom he and his fiancée are brutally murdered. He gets to come back from the dead with a help of a magical crow. The Crow gives him power and he goes out for vengeance. The effects for this movie are excellent and the storyline is unbelievable. It is quite a shame that Brandon Lee didn't get to see the results of this film. A dragon wouldn't blend in very well in this movie. It is really good and the cast are fantastic.A great movie with tragic results. 4 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darker Than The Dark Knight?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, this is easily darker than the Dark Knight. It's rated R. Even if you see the edited version, it has a darker character.First of all, the main character Eric Draven is much more of the classic knight in shining armor. All that he does, he's doing strictly for his princess. That being said, he couldn't care any less about the city he lived in.And another thing; Bruce's parents died due to desperation., not some sick maniacs who ended up raping the mother. Well, they raped Eric's fiancée Shelley then killed both of them. Now he's back from the grave and he's out for revenge.Not only is the hero darker, but the villains are as well. Out only to benefit themselves, they couldn't care less what carnage they had to do. Hell, they thought that was the fun part.The acting was superb especially for an independent film, and the cinematography done by Dariusz Wolski is on par with A list films.There's not a lot of plot. But is never important to a revenge story.I think this is the best comic book movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkly Beautiful: A Masterpiece!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow is one of those "Top Five" comic-to-film adaptations that has, proudly, won a perfect score. Not only Brandon Lee is amazing in what came to be his swan song, but also brings a more than flawless performance that will stay in the minds of cinema-lovers for years to come.I never peeked "The Crow" comic book, neither knew who created it. I just saw "The Crow" under recommendation of my girlfriend who found it the most beautiful film on earth. The Gothic aesthetics portrayed on screen are extremely accurate and the Montecristo's sense of vengeance make this a "justified" Action/Sci-Fi Drama film. Brandon Lee parted ways leaving behind him a movie that has to be claimed whether you're a comic book fan or not, the now remembered phrase: "Nothing is Trivial" has almost become a myth. The Visual Effects deployed in it are way too unreal, surreal; to the point of believing yourself in a black, but beautiful, nightmare. The environments, the facial-uplifting, the stunts and explosions seem to come from a 22nd Century motion picture. The Crow has surpassed the many boring blockbusters that have been bombarding us for the past few years.Cerebral, dramatic, fantastic and surreal are the words that can, closely, describe this wonder. Forget the sequels, see this as a one-chance opportunity to see the true meaning of your own life. And remember: It Can't Rain All The Time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best B movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies you watch for their deep, spiritual messages, and there are movies you watch for the sheer, unholy, Christ-crushing badassery they contain. If you were to guess that this movie is of the latter persuasion, you'd be correct, and what a glorious, wonderful sight this was to behold.The Crow is the B movie to end all B movies. Let's not kid ourselves; that is what it is, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's an old school, Halloweenish (the holiday, not the John Carpenter film) revenge flick with broad, straightforward, gleefully Satanic undertones and imagery - pentagrams, black coats, fire, the whole deal. It's not even exceptionally dark, either; these themes are all carried out with an exuberant sort of merriment, as if the film thrives on the dark itself. And I don't know about you, but I love stuff like this, so revisiting The Crow was a huge treat for me. The imagery I mentioned before is not really Satanic, being a mere stereotype and cliché, but it's fun, the film equivalent of running around outside on Halloween night with masks and fake weapons and the whole deal. It's a childlike fascination, and combined with the succinct, tightly woven little storyline, The Crow becomes much greater in the eyes of many like myself. There isn't anything too deep here, but there doesn't need to be. The acting is pretty subpar overall, although nobody can deny Brandon Lee's status as a Certified Badass. The whole thing has that 90s sort of grainy, underground feel to it, quality-wise, and it fits the storyline to a tee.If you only like polished Hollywood films or the "classics" of the olden days, then you won't understand my reverence for this film at all, for it isn't something everyone will agree with or even "get." This is just a damned cool movie, and all of its overblown cheese does nothing but lift it up to higher levels. This isn't a subtle or deep movie; it lays out everything right in front of you with gruesome, dark images and total sincerity, much better than the forced crap we get nowadays. The Crow is an honest, sincere little film, and I respect it for that.I don't hate anything about this movie at all, and I would say it is the best B movie ever, however bold that statement may be. The Crow is a huge, metallic spiked behemoth of a film, and it will roll over your ass like an angry battle tank. Superlative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although, The Crow may not be one of those must-see titles out there, and maybe it's a little too old, but this is a movie you just have to go and see. That is of course, if you like the idea of a man shooting criminals for being involved with murdering and raping his girlfriend. I'm not going to write a very lengthy review, but I'm just going to say this.. this movie's exciting.At first, it may seem that this movie just features a man smiling killing people and laughing every time he gets a wound and it heals, but this movie packs in a lot of humor, action, gore, and more. It doesn't feature any plot twists. In fact, the whole movie is about the man taking his revenge on others, but that's alright with me.Overall, I recommend you to buy this movie. No, not rent.

		<fullReview>Is the Crow a great film? No but Proyas' masterful directing makes it a much better one. The Crow is your standard vigilante revenge flick with some odd improvements to make it different. The story isn't original you can catch glimpses of other things in there. However I do have to recommend The Crow.The Late Brandon Lee makes his exit on a high note. The movie is all too ironic for him because his tragic death matches that of his characters all most on the dot. Lee creates an interesting character. I suspect that had he lived he could have been more than just your action star.Proyas deserves all the credit in the world. He is the driving force behind this movie. He gives a Gothic feel and the visuals and camera work are absolutely gorgeous. Tim Burton get's praised for doing half of what Proyas does. He is our greatest dark film maker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from the impeccably created landscape that the events of the movie take place in; "The Crow" works for two reasons: The villains of the piece are completely despicable, so we root for their comeuppance to be justifiably served, and also the avenger in this case is played by Brandon Lee. This perfect casting of both 'good' and 'evil' is crucial to the film's success. You could see that Brandon was such a genuine and emotionally honest performer, even though he was still just a fledgling in career terms by 1993. It helps that the lines are so clearly drawn, because we can then take total pleasure from the artfully constructed, gloomy setting.All of the main cast do well, but there is an especially wicked delight to be drawn from Michael Wincott's portrayal. On the evidence of this he deserves a much higher profile, because he's utterly magnetic at every point within the movie. All good confrontations need a memorable hero and villain - we get both here. So allow the darkness to envelop you, don't even think about entertaining any of the amateurish sequels, and let Alex Proyas and Co. take you on a gut-wrenching journey of dogged retribution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic story of love and vengeance. A rockstar (who is played by Brandon Lee) and his girlfriend (who was soon to be his wife) are unrightfully killed. Soon after the rockstar was reborn by the power of a mysterious crow. Soon after he returns from the grave he realizes that he must get revenge on those who had wronged him. When he persues his killers he discovers that he is invulnerable to harm, and this then enables him to charge blindly after his killers, leading to intense gun fights, and well choreographed close combat sequences. On the other hand "The Crow" is not only about the violence,there are emotional scenes that are not only tear jerking, but heart warming. This movie is for those who are not only action gluttons, but also for those wanting an excellent story, and an emotional ride. "The Crow" receives about a 7 for acting, a 8.5 for action, and a 8.5 for the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Gothic and oh so good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one word could describe this film it would be dark. Dark is the absence of light, and throughout much of this film..light is hard to see.It begins with the tragedy that shapes the film; a rock musician named Eric Draven and his fiancé have just been brutally murdered by thugs. One year on, and Eric Draven's soul is having trouble resting, so a crow brings him back to the real world to put the wrong things right...queue one of the best films ever made.The cityscape plays a major part in setting the scene for this Gothic film. Tall looming brick buildings line desolate, garbage strewn, rainswept streets, a pitch black soulless sky hangs overhead, gunshots and screams can be heard echoing through the night. This is one town you DON'T want to be. Then we meet the locals; drug addicts, hookers killers, freaks, thieves, pyromaniacs and thats just the nicer ones.Eric Dravens transition from frightened, newly awoken victim to face painted, high flying avenger is both energetic and powerful. The film definitely gets better and better as Eric does his stuff and cleans up the streets. The film is violent as you'd expect, but also touching in some bits, such as when Eric speaks with the cop who was as the scene when he and his girlfriend were murdered. Also when Eric appears to a lonely young girl who he used to help take care of.Brilliant heavy metal soundtrack, cool action scenes, grizzly characters, far out camera work and unique execution methods make this film one that will stay in your mind. I've seen it many times since first seeing it 10 years ago, and it doesn't loose its power.I only wish people would recognise it for what it is, instead of giving it a cult status because it was the film where Bruce Lee's son was killed by a firearm accident.</fullReview>

The thing thats different about the crow is that it is just simple action. Guy gets murdered and comes back from the dead to get revenge on the people that killed him and his fiancé. See. No questions asked about why he comes back just straight to the point no boring points in between.The crow delivers something else that other action does not maybe because it's so much more darker and is a revenge story or a Gothic black fairy tale.And don't get me wrong you don't have to be a goth to like this. This film is perfect for everyone to enjoy."Brandon you rock" P.S don't watch the sequels i haven't seen them it just spits on Brandon Lee's memory."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vigilante movies have been around for God knows how long. The idea of vengeance against those that do us wrong is a driving force in cinema. But most of the time we get a horribly predictable movie that follows a set formula. And then there is The Crow. In its own, stylized way, The Crow puts to rest all those other vigilante movies, and creates a new form, one that leaves the viewer pleased, and never disappoints.Since the first time I saw this movie, which was about the time The Crow: City of Angels was released into the theaters, I was fascinated by the look of this "Gothic tale of unrequited love and the scorn of a soul burdened by the torment of great loss." I had only seen the movie once, on HBO, but fell in love with the story. I never really got around to renting it, but if I saw it on the program schedule, I would set time aside to watch it.Now that I am older, and I own the first three (The Crow, The Crow: City of Angels, The Crow: Salvation) I have been able to view it and truly grasp the masterpiece in its entire form. From the soundtrack, to the pop culture references, and even the references in pop culture. It shows the true greatness of comics that become great movies (Sin City and Hellboy being two others.) The story and the acting are terrific and the all out vengeful nature of Eric Dravin is what captures my attention the most.Let's not forget the plethora of colorful characters with the "jolly pirate nicknames." From Tin-Tin to T-Bird, Skank to Funboy, and (my personal favorite) Top Dollar. The charismatic villains and the even more charismatic hero (anti-hero to be exact) truly shine in this masterpiece.However, this movie is also very tragic. It would be the last movie Brandon Lee would ever make. He was killed in an accident while filming. Like his character, he was to be wed to his fiancé in just three weeks after filming was to be wrapped up. He follows the mysterious death of his father, the martial arts legend Bruce Lee.All tragedies aside, one of the greatest movies ever made. Followed by an "all right" sequel and then two more, "less than mediocre" sequels after that, the original stands true. The best "Crow" movie out there. The original, the best, The Crow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crow(1994) Review: I remember seeing this in theaters. I was amazed then and still amazed now. This movie does not get old. It is tragic about Brandon Lee. He will be missed.The Crow is a great movie. We start in a truly dark and decadent city on Devil's night, the night before Halloween. The city is filled with crime and run by a powerful syndicate lead by Top Dollar. Four members of the syndicate have a night on the town and murder two innocent people. However, the death was so tragic that a crow brings back one of the victims in Eric Draven to get vengeance for him and his fiancé. Anyone who gets in his way will certainly regret it.This movie works in many ways. One is the scene when Eric comes back from the dead. This scene was so very well done. He rises and opens the casket and then has trouble with his balance and is trembling, scared, and confused. Brandon Lee is great as Eric Draven. He has the look and charisma. For what it's worth, he seemed to enjoy this role.More goods is the acting on just anyone here. The one that steals the show is Micheal Wincott in a memorable and awesome role as Top Dollar. The Directing from Alex Proyas is great too. Ernie Hudson despite being type-cast as a cop is here and plays the role nicely. This movie also has a decent and fitting soundtrack.The Last Word: Excellent. It is tragic of Lee's death. However, his final movie is his best one. This is the Crow. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some how this movie works more than it should. Your standard revenge action comic book movie is much more with the great work (sad story) of Lee (what a good action star he would have made!), the villain (Wincott- the voice pipes on that guy!) , and the director / writer. You have touches of comedy that are a nice alt. to the regular dark tale one usually gets in these films. Check out Lee's little wave as he sends one bad guy off to his death in his car, or his quick little step/dance as he shot at by the cops, and even the one liners are not that bad :). The overall film is darkly shot- some say too dark- but I would disagree it allows the directly to use the low budget he had to greater effect and sets a timeless sorrow to this world the characters are in. The action scenes are over the top, esp one where Lee's Crow character takes on around 20 of the bad guys during a "bad guy summit" = the director hits it out of the park with the editing, music, and using Lee's physical ability to make this a stand out action piece. While it is not a perfect film if one looks for one of the better comic book movies they would do themselves a service by adding this to a short list of good ones. Long Live "The Crow"!</fullReview>

It's all the more tragic that he died during filming as the man certainly had some talent which might have been able to grow more. Watching him in The Crow brings conflicting emotions to the surface; you sympathize with his violent death and vengeful existence, yet he is absolutely ruthless and sadistic in exacting punishment on his executioners.The depressed look of the city where it is constantly raining can be slightly overbearing at times, but still does an admirable job of conveying the melancholy of the environment. The supporting cast does a fine job also, even the child actor avoids being irritating.Overall, definitely one of the better comic book adaptions of the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What makes this great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had this been done by anyone else, director, cast, crew it would have sucked massively. Period. The lackluster sequels are evidence enough of that fact. On face value, the script is really just another run-of-the-mill revenge story with a supernatural bent. BUT - this would have to be one of the best movies of the 90's. I can say that now even after analyzing the f*** out of it this past year as part of school. Even after watching it a zillion times, it still sends tingles down my spine.The plot concerns Eric Draven (the late, great Brandon Lee) being raised from the dead by a mythical crow, given supernatural strength and invincibility, and sent on a mission to avenge the rape and murder of his fiancée Shelly (Sofia Shinas) by a gang of thugs. As he picks off the criminals on his hit list, he attracts the attention of the criminal kingpin Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), who becomes determined to kill him. Like I said, it is the people who cause this film to transcend the ordinary. Much of this is due to Alex Proyas, who uses an effectively stylized setting, clever editing, camera angles, etc. The villains of the piece are also excellent, particularly Wincott and David Patrick Kelly as head thug T-Bird. No Bond-style villainy is present here, these guys are evil, intimidating and cliché-free.But of course, the person who really transcends the ordinary is Brandon Lee. Lee was one of the few actors who could combine that sort of martial arts talent with acting talent, so evident here. He brings out the violent and sadistic elements of Eric, as well as the painfully human side as well. You can't help but feel sad when you realize that this was his last movie. A plus to this movie is that it has an awesome soundtrack, with stuff from the Cure, the Violent Femmes and Rage Against the Machine. A particular highlight is a Nine Inch Nails cover of Joy Division's Dead Souls.All in all, an awesome movie.</fullReview>

I am glad that they did, because he seemed ridiculous, and would have made the story unbelievable. I do not see the purpose of having him anyway. The storyline for the movie is WAY better than the comic, James O'barr doesn't know what he is talking about when he commented that in his version of the crow states that Eric Knew exactly what to do and who to go for, whereas in the movie we learn with Eric. the only thing I like better in the comic is the appearance of the crow's character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most poignant, meaningful films you will ever see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has always remained as one of my favourite films of all time.The whole film is based around Halloween, or as they refer to it in the film: 'Devils Night'. Eric Draven and Shelley Webster are brutally murdered on this night and the film follows the actions of Eric when he is resurrected a year later by a Crow to revenge the rape and death of his fiancée.This is no ordinary revenge movie though. No! It is an intricately woven masterpiece of poignancy and meaning. Brandon Lee brings a third dimension to a character that was once illustrated in a comic book. His mixed emotions in the film provide an overwhelming portrayal of a person whose whole life has been shattered unjustly by the actions of others and whose heart and soul is seeking justice. I was wrong before: this is not a revenge movie, it is about enforcing justice! Brandon Lee has the ability rip through your heart with the reminiscence of his old life and mental torture that these memories bring.James O'Barr is the real creator of this film; the man who created the comic. The emotional pain that he has experienced in his life reflects highly upon the content of this film and provides a real depth and reality to every theme that is conveyed.A masterpiece. A nosedive into the darkness of human emotion. A profound reflection upon taking justice into your own hands. A beautiful portrayal of loss and anguish. And a damn good soundtrack. It's just unfortunate that Hollywood had to bleed this idea dry with the terrible sequels that were shat out.If you haven't seen it I would advise you to stop whatever you are doing and give a careful thought to the reason why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brandon Lee stars as Eric Draven a rock star who was killed on the night before his wedding along with his girlfriend Shelly(Sofia Shinas) however a year later Draven rises from the dead and looks to avenge himself and his girlfriend's death. David Patrick Kelly, Michael Wincott and Ernie Hudson co-star in this dark yet romantic vigilante thriller. I remember reading about how Brandon Lee died on the set of The Crow and all the comparisons to his father and all that jazz, however despite Lee's tragic death, The Crow is easily his best work. (Keep in mind I haven't seen Laser Mission and Legacy Of Rage, although I have ordered Legacy on Amazon) Brandon Lee is an action star who I have always thought of as too much of a nice guy to really get down and dirty to take out the bad guys, this time this usual weakness actually becomes the film's biggest strength. Lee's nice guy approach to the madness that occupies his character works in creating more impact than usual. Also it helps that Lee speaks almost beautiful dialog when dispatching the bad guys. In fact there is one startling scene where Lee doesn't even speak and let's the bad guy figure it all out on his own, to which the bad guy says "Abashed the devil stood and felt awful goodness is..." This is a great movie. I can see why so many people like it, it is one of the few revenge movies out there that actually rise above guilty pleasure and provide a show worth seeing over and over again.* * *1/2 out of 4-(Very Good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie from the first 20 min and it only got better. It really brought out so many different feelings, and that's (in my opinion) what a movie is supposed to do. Not to mention that the whole idea of the movie is so killer. It also help's that Brandon Lee plays the lead character. God Rest His Soal. Oh and I agree that The Crow 2 and 3 sucked, big time. They have to be the 2 cheesiest movies out there. If you have ever seen The Crow then there is no way you could be a fan of #2 and 3. I don't understand why this thing is making me write 10 lines. I could talk about this movie all day long but not to myself. If you agree that The Crow is one of the greatest movies ever made you can e-mail me at cat.stormymom@hotmail.com. I wonder if this is enough lines yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I'm going to buy my own DVD of it. The acting is phenomenal, especially by Brandon Lee.This movie is about the tragic death of two young people, Eric Draven and Shelly Webster, a couple who was going to be married on Halloween. Instead, they are sadly killed by a bunch of thugs and sociopaths who were being evicted from their apartment. A year later, through a hypnotic crow Eric comes back to life to make them pay and answer for their crimes.Kudos to the cast, crew, and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up! 10 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw THE CROW when I was twelve years old and I will forever be indebted to Both Brandon lee and Alex Proyas, up until that day i was your average primary coloured movie buff on diet of star wars and kung fu flicks, then things changed never before had i seen a film so striking so perfectly created. Brandon Lee's performance hit me right in the heart, I had never seen tragedy portrayed on screen with such aching melancholy (given real resonance by all too real tragedy) I wanted to be the Crow boyhood fantasies of star ships and lazer guns dissolved and were replaced with black leather and face paint, and the movie felt real despite its fantasy trappings you could believe a man could come back from the dead, you could believe the wrong things could eventually be made right, this is down to the director he created a world which totally complemented the story and most importantly Lee's performance. i have not seen a film since that has had the same effect on me nad in my opinion never will again. The only fault I can find is the tragic loss of its star that gives the film an extra layer of sadnness.My favorite film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When people talk about how today Hollywood is finally getting comic book films right, they seem to forget this gem.The late 80's and early 90's saw the advent of Burton's "Batman" and Proyas' "The Crow". Both of these films share a lot in common. In the end, they showed fans that Hollywood could get a comic book right.....every now and then.Though drastically different from its source graphic novel in tone and story, the film manages to hold on to the "love is forever" theme of the O'Barr graphic novel.All the cast turn in great performances in spades. All the right elements clicked together from a great script written by David Schow and John Shirley, direction from Proyas, and musical direction by Graeme Revell and Jeff Most.It would be hard to mention this film without making a nod to the doomed lead actor, Brandon Lee. The film stands as a fitting tribute to where he was headed as an actor. He was not there yet by no means, but I think this film really set him apart from his famous father's shadow. As is, the film still plays well today. It was purposely not set in either a future or past world. It represents right now, no matter what year it plays. That is a mark of a very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very stylish Graphic novel adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw this originally in '94 because I dismissed it as A. a martial arts film (and I hate those) and B. adapted from a comic (and I just can't get into those) and C. aimed at a teen/ goth/punk audience (and I am way too old for that). What a mistake! Finally a decade on, a friend heard me say how much I liked Alex Proyas' DARK CITY -- a neat sci fi film with a very different story but the same kind of dark fantasy look -- and couldn't believe I had never seen THE CROW and made me watch it.I have to say that I really think this is a very fine, well made movie and none of my preconceptions were remotely correct. The art direction is brilliant, with a wonderful and creepy Gothic fantasy look, almost but not quite black-and-white, set in a mysteriously surreal "Detroit" that is in some kind of alternate universe from the real Motown. Brandon Lee is really charismatic and haunting in the role of Eric Draven, and not merely because of the tragic incident surrounding the film. He was real star material and just totally inhabits this part.After seeing the film, I did read the O'Barr comic, which is very sincere and heartfelt, but I think the filmmakers -- in what is a pretty rare event -- IMPROVED the plot and characters while keeping all of the angst and atmosphere. They totally honored the character of Eric and the basic idea of the avenger, the memories of his beautiful girlfriend, and sense of overwhelming grief that inhabits the graphic novel. Where they improved the storyline in cinematic terms is in the treatment of the minor characters and villains. They really fleshed them out, and it enriches the movie and balances the storyline well.Bookending the film with quotes from Sarah (Rochelle Davis), the little girl who narrates and observes much of the story is an example of a good idea that doesn't really exist in the comic, where the little girl is called Sherri and only appears briefly. Even more so is the expansion of the character of Top Dollar, who again is a minor episode in the comic and more of a grubby hell's angel/drug dealer -- in the film he has been transformed into a complex and compelling crime-lord. Michael Wincott is simply amazing in this part, playing Top Dollar as a kind of depraved, satanic, renaissance prince, and clearly having a great deal of fun with this role, especially some wonderful and very clever dialog. The very, very sick (but quite sincere) love story between Top Dollar and his psychic half-sister is the reversed-mirror image of the pure and innocent love of Eric and his fiancé...a very clever idea.Wonderful music, great visuals, terrific acting..."The Crow" should NOT be missed.NOTE: I bought the "Collector's DVD". Don't bother. There is NOTHING worth looking at on the second DVD, some production sketches and posters, nothing special. The director's commentary (on the first disk) is interesting to listen to ONCE, but you can get that on the single disk DVD. There is a smattering of extra footage, but nothing you will miss. Save some bucks and just get the one disk wide screen version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving piece of cinematic excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow is my all time favourite movie. Just last night I watched it for about the fifth time this week and every time I watch the film I learn something new about it and I can understand it better each and every time. The movie is excellent, the special effects at the start are a little below par, but this in no way affects my view on the rest of the movie.I was shocked to hear about the death of Brandon Lee when he was filming a flashback scene in the loft where his girlfriend (soon to be wife Shelley in the film) and himself were murdered callously by 4 evil men under the orders of Top Dollar. I was saddened that he had died so early on in his career, because this film paved the way for an excellent future career. It was very coincidentally that he played the part of someone that was to be killed, then he had been accidentally killed by a faulty prop gun.There were two main scenes in the movie that really moved me. The one where he comes out of the grave screaming because he has realised what has happened to him and the other being where he enters the loft where he and his girlfriend were killed only to be reminded of what had happened to him with the aid of moving flashbacks. No other movie has ever done this to me before and a great deal of empathy is needed for Eric and Shelley (the two victims). And as Brandon once started in his final interview no compassion is needed toward the culprits and how they finally meet their demise.The cast is excellent and without a doubt no other person for each role would be suitable other than what was set. The cast was chosen to perfection. The screenplay and how the background sound is often heard at very certain parts of the film is also brilliant. It is a film that I am proud to have in my collection and I am sure that you would love the film if you are into a love story.Alex Proyas (the director of the film) is notorious for the darkness in his films and in this it doesn't go a miss. But things soon brighten up and happiness is restored when Brandon gains revenge for their deaths. There is also a small amount of dark comedy in the film coming both from Eric (when he returns from the dead) and from the culprits which Inflict badly upon Eric.The flashback scenes are especially moving, when you see what life was like for both Eric and Shelley together before they were taken away so suddenly. Life was perfect, and they were about to be married but one thing that we learn from this movie amongst other things as that the majority of us think of life everyday as being trivial. The film also is focused on a girl (Sarah) a friend of Shelley and Eric whose mum is friendly with one of the culprits of Eric and his girlfriends demise. Eric soon sets the mother on the right path and the screen brightens up when we see this happening.Overall the movie is excellent 10/10 overall. The cast overall 10/10 and my recommendation for this film if you haven't yet watched: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was nobody else that could've played this like Lee played it...he truly was sent from Heaven to play this role...before he died. Yes, his death was tragic, all the more tragic considering the movie and the source material (ironic is a better word.) This is one of the greatest movies of the 1990's, and anyone who claims otherwise is sadly mistaken. As with most decades, it is the smaller cult films that take the cake. Clerks, Pulp fiction, The Matrix (although bigger budget), and the crow are on the list of the ten best movies of the 1990's. A ten year span and one of the best? 13 years later (almost) and still a classic? Yes it stands the test of time. Brandon Lee rules.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylistic revenge piece that soars high.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eric Draven, a rock guitarist is killed along with his fiancée just a day before their wedding by a group of vile criminals, but there was no hard evidence to pin the murders on anyone. A year later Eric is brought back from the dead to avenge the death of his fiancée and himself. While, on his quest to knock off the gang members one by one, he's also accompanied by a crow that's basically his eyes and soul to this world.I love this sensational flick! I just had to revisit it again, since it's definitely my favourite comic adaptation. What (debut) director Alex Proyas has come up with is a darkly, ultra-slick paradise with it's neo-expressionism touches that looks like its been lifted right out of the pages of the underground comic novel. I was speechless of the highly detailed world that was created because the experience is nothing short than incredible. The set pieces are simply awe-inspiring with such deftly, unrestrained direction to build up a dreamlike aurora from this visual feast. What made this picture even more intense had to be that the camera-work is left of the leash by taking you into the thick of the action with the sweeping movements that just take flight. The spirited execution makes its way into the full throttle action scenes where the raw energy smacks you hard in the gut as there's no waiting around. The story gets right into. Another prominent dimension is that the mucky universe design has a vigorous rock-punk vibe, therefore a cool soundtrack featuring the likes of The Cure, Violent Femmes and Stone Temple Pilots, balances out the mood rather finely. It gladly never goes overboard with its hard rock songs and there's a meaning for the song to be there than just chucking in for the sake of it. But the most formidable aspect in the sound department was the beautifully haunting, Gothic score. Whoa! It just carries you away with it's hypnotic embrace. The booming sound effects too gives the film some hiss and effectively surrounds you. The seductive images, lightning and sound are undeniably staged to perfection. Although, sadly the film will be best remembered for the accidental death of Brandon Lee. His powerhouse performance reeked of charisma and was vital to its success. The fire and warmth he brought to the character was just phenomenal. The rest of the cast; Ernie Hudson, Michael Wincott, Angel David and Tony Todd might've been in Lee's shadow, but they feed of his character very well. The plot is about revenge and everlasting love, no matter if there's no justice, love will always conquer all. The heartbreaking tale is pure at heart with the script being a play on words with its organic, poetic touch. The cutting flashbacks of the couple before the murder packs a powerful bite. Also the script manages to filter out some sly, morbid banter. The one and only downer about it is that the plot is rather foreseeable, but the imagination of it simply sticks in mind that the predictability of it you just sweep aside.This is one gripping comic project that comes to life with an influx of stimulating avenues. Definitely one not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all now know what happened to Brandon. That is a fact and a sad one, however, I would just like to say, this is a beautiful film and I am so glad it was completed. The soundtrack, the ambiance, everything is excellent, I loved it! In a way a fairytale Gothic extravaganza, but so engaging, it will always be a classic in my collection. Brandon is mesmorising and alluring, (my wife can comply), if watched with an open mind it is a great representation of modern values of life (or lack of). I was a great believer in Bruce and was not disappointed in Brandon, I am sure he would have continued from strength to strength and delighted us all. I am just so sad that his time was cut so short! Rest in peace Brandon, you were a legend in you're own right!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie many times and still I can not get enough of it. Yes, this shows the darker side to life, but the message is clear. DON'T MESS WITH LOVE! I wish Brandon Lee hadn't died and he was able to make more (yes, I have see the sequel but it is not the same without Brandon Lee). To say that this movie is bad is saying nothing is right within the world. Life and Love will always be connected no matter what anyone tries to do. Sarah was also a very good character to add, and I liked how no matter what was done, their was always a decent officer of the law. I liked the way each victim was taken care of based on their life. Also, by The Crow letting Darla live, he showed that he really was not a bad guy, just someone out for revenge to those that almost destroyed and them alone.</fullReview>

Love that is true will live forever. Through life and on into death. Eric shows his love so openly that it almost makes you feel the pain of loss.The acting was well done and proves that even a "dark comic" can be made into a really great film.

		<shortDescription>Brandon Lee's Swan Song</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Crow" will always be remembered not for its story of revenge from beyond the grave, but the tragic death of Brandon Lee, who was shot by a faulty gun prop (And giving conspiracy fans reason to believe that Brandon and his legendary father Bruce Lee were cursed). It's too bad, because this is an exceptional movie.Lee plays Eric Draven, a musician who is murdered on Devil's Night. His fiancée is raped and beaten before she dies in the hospital. It seems that his fiancée was trying to stop the violence in her neighborhood created by Top Dollar (Michael Wincott)and his gang. However, just because you're dead doesn't mean things are settled. A year later, Eric climbs out of his grave, seeking revenge on the guys that put him and his fiancée six feet under. All of this has to do with the myth of the crow, which carries the link between the land of the living and the dead.Eric has an advantage over the guys that he is about to kill: Nothing can kill him and nothing can harm him (When he gets shot, the bullet-holes close right up, as if they never happened). With the help of Sgt. Albrecht (Ernie Hudson), Eric goes to work.Things don't turn out completely cut and dry, especially when Top Dollar and his half-sister Myca (Bai Ling)cause a few roadblocks on the road to vengeance.Alex Proyas (Who would later direct "Dark City" and "I, Robot") created a film that is kinetic and energetic (With a soundtrack of songs from Nine Inch Nails and Stone Temple Pilots among others). A film that is fast paced, yet emotional at the same time. A fitting tribute to Lee, whose performance will be remembered for a long time.</fullReview>

It's spiritual atmosphere pulls your mind completely into it. The story in itself leaves such an impression on you, you can't recall a better movie seen than this. The music matches the grieving pain and dark nature of this film perfectly. The score is by far the best I've ever heard. Return To The Grave and On Hollowed Ground is what caught my mind more than the others.Alex Proyas really has a view of everything and he deserves an Oscar for his work. Brandon Lee's performance deserves 10 Oscars but sadly he wouldn't be there to receive it. It's his death that may have attracted media attention but it's his performance that brings Eric Draven to life. His legacy lives on in the hearts of Crowfans forever.The supporting cast try their best and really give a great performance.The sets have a dark and goth feel to it, just as the movie is.You can watch it 200 times but still can't get enough of it. So, go buy the DVD, you won't regret it at all.</fullReview>

The crow starts with the brutal murder of two lovers eric draven and shelly webster the day before their wedding (halloween). legend has it that when you die a crow carries your soul to the land of the dead. but in some cases the crow can bring that soul back to make the wrongs right. a year after they were killed eric is risen by the crow from the dead to avenge shelly. The acting is amazing and the film is legendary. its a great performance on all terms. you get sucked into james o'barr's world and watch as he tells his tale of love surviving everything... even death.</fullReview>

Lee gives an excellent performance filled up with emotion, sarcasm, energy which makes all viewers starting believing in angels. It is probably the darkest Gothic film of all time at its best and we don't know how far would Brandon Lee go if he was still alive today. Life has been so unfair for the Lee family, people say that they are cursed. I wonder when will the crow be released in a special edition DVD set. It deserves it. Brandon deserves it.

Because of the violence, drugs, and allusions to sex, it will be a long time before Draven Eric Bentley actually gets to see the movie.

I love it.The concept was a release for James o'Barr when his fiancée was killed by a drunk driver at the age of 18. For James to deal with his anger and pain he thought of what if someone came back from the dead to exact revenge for the loss of a loved one, what would they do? well thats how Eric and Shelly's story was born.I don't care what the haters say about this movie. It will always be a cult classic to me and millions of other fans of both the original graphic novel and movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just a "Goth" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some accuse The Crow of being nothing more than a cult Goth movie with nothing to offer anyone else, but in that I completely disagree.Some criticize the script for not developing the story or characters, I commend the scriptwriter for not bogging the movie down with the details we can understand without having them explicitly disseminated.Why do we need it explained that Erick Draven is upset over the murder of himself and his fiancée? That's pretty easy to understand on its own. Why must the motives of his vendetta be explained, when they are so easy to comprehend? I am grateful this movie simply got to the point, without losing the emotion.The other element where this movie shines is in the juxtaposition of the mood against the theme. The mood and the setting are black and high-contrast, with a noir-influenced design element. But the theme is hopeful and even happy, and are summed up in the movies final phrase: "true love is forever."The Crow is not the best action movie ever made, nor is it the most profound, but it is a very good movie with plenty of action and an engaging story which was very adequately acted by Ernie Hudson and the late Brandon Lee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie of all time. I have seen it over 556 times. I own it on VHS, BETA, Laser Disc and DVD. I also have the comics, action figures, the soundtrack and the soundtrack to the Crow Comic book. I have had to buy multiple copies of the VHS and DVD because I used them so much that they stopped working. I have never been able to tell anyone why this is my favorite movie and why I have seen it so many times, except that it strongly appeals to me. The scene in which Eric walks into the church and you can see the rain outside, it just moves me. The face paint, the coat, the overall sense of revenge, but how it is done. I just can't explain it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Movie was the best movie i have seen.But if a Crow brings u back to life what about a cat what can that do?The second was Good just like this one continuing off after Eric is done And when Sarah gets older and what the city is like then. Even though Brandon Lee is gone he will be missed. It would be kool if he was still alive and playing in the rest of The Crow movies.The second movie was good with Ashe the new Crow. Avenging the death of him and his son. That Crow movie was a little better because he gets a motorcycle, But he does not jump from the rooftops of buildings. it is also kool that The Deftones play in the second movie on Devils Night the night when Ashe loses his power and Sarah dies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is only one Crow....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If people base their overall opinion on The Crow based on either of its' sequels, they will miss how good The Crow starring Brandon Lee is. City of Angels was a shameful attempt by some writers and producers to capitalize on the original and the stigma attached to the film created through Brandon Lee's tragic on-set death.The Crow should have been Lee's 'breakout' film. His role as Eric Draven should have stood out for the effort Lee put into that, rather than the tragic circumstances inexorably tied to it.The Crow has some endearing qualities, and leaves some lasting impressions and images firmly implanted in memory. From the intentionally dark and dreary settings of Detroit to the soundtrack, The Crow stands on its' own as a truly great - and greatly under-appreciated - film. The story distinguishes itself in such a way, that even some unoriginality is forgiven. What I mean by that is, the revenge theme in movies was nothing new or unique. Avenging a loved one has been done several times and in several different ways. Sometimes this mechanic works, sometimes it doesn't. In The Crow, it works. In other words; some elements in the movie, though unoriginal, are still conveyed in original and intriguing ways.The Crow is original and inspired work. That's the bottomline.Brandon's role wasn't necessarily 'Oscar-worthy'..But, it was believable and presented with emotion and authority. He commanded that role, and the scenes he was in(which is most of them). He was (and is) Eric Draven. One can only guess where this role would have taken Brandon Lee had he lived. My guess is to bigger and better things...come to think of it, maybe that's where he ended up? Depending on what you believe...If you haven't seen this movie, I'd recommend at least renting it. I own the Collectors' Series DVD, and it is permanently part of my collection.Last note: Really a crying shame City of Angels was ever made, and especially given the fact it involves some of the same people from the original. They seem to thoroughly undo every bit of good they did with The Crow. Please, do yourself a favor; pass the sequels by. There is only one The Crow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this recently, bought the excellent 2 disc special edition dvd. Its a film i remember watching mainly because of a few action set pieces, i flicked through after they finished the first time round...im ashamed of what i did and what ive missed for so long. Its not fantastically made, in terms of script or screenplay ie its no damn Shakespeare (or is it...?) . What it mulls down to is love, Eric Dravens love is so strong he has to come back and avenge the death of his wife to be, his soul simply cant rest. The violence is simply eye candy, the city is absolutely incredible, stylistic yet straight forward, dark yet believable and wonderfully lit on the 2 'devils nights'.Overall a great film from the 90's that truly is a modern day love story, it saddens me that Brandon Lee died making this...but it makes me happy they finished it and that his legacy lives on through it.See this now! 8.5/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1994 film adaption of the popular comic book "The Crow" has got to be one of the best comic book adaptions around. And I don't just like it out of sympathy for Brandon Lee, when I first saw this film I did not know that he died on sight, I didn't even really know who he was, I was to young to really know any actor. Mr. Lee will be missed by many, but he left his mark in this film, and all you really need is just one thing for people to remember you by, and this is his. Well, I suppose I should get around to the standard plot synopsis.Eric Draven (Brandon Lee)comes back from the grave to avenge his death, but more importantly the death of his girlfriend. Not your standard 'Mr. nice Guy' kind of heroes, Draven sets out on his quest to avenge his fallen lover, with the help of a young girl, a beat cop, and his fine feathered friend. He shows the mercy that they showed him and his girl: None. Eric Draven has got to be one of the coolest good guys, and Top Dollar has got to be one of the coolest bad guys. And what movie wouldn't be complete without the great ending fight (of course there's a fight, what fun would it be if Top Dollar was an easy-to-defeat type bad guy). Anyhow, I really like this movie a lot, and of course, you don't have to listen to me, but I suggest that you go out and rent it, even if you have already seen it. One of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Crow" was Brandon Lee's last film. It was also his best.When Brandon Lee was accidentally killed on the set of "The Crow", the film world suffered a tremendous loss - and that's made all the more evident by Lee's work here. After showing promise in film like "Rapid Fire", Lee gave his most accomplished performance as "The Crow"'s hero - a murdered rocker who returns from the grave seeking revenge. Lee powerfully conveys rage, compassion, and palpable sadness and handles the script's gallows humor with aplomb.Lee's compelling performance as well as the film's gloomy visual beauty make it a memorable, worthwhile experience, albeit one that will forever be overshadowed by the death of a fine young actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had to describe this mope-fest (oh, I apologise, goths, I mean 'piece of art') in two words, they'd be either "egotistical pretentiousness", or simply "pure trash". I think the latter is more fitting. Here's one surefire way to tell whether you'll love "Brandon Lee's Whine-Fest" (um, I mean, "The Crow")... If you believe any word out of Trent Reznor mouth, then you're already a fan (oh, and if Reznor meant a word he ever said, he'd be with Lee right now; get it through your heads, people, Reznor's not sincere about his lyrics, and if he was, he would've followed through with them long ago). It seems there's a direct correlation between Reznor fans and fans of the "The Crow". Anyway, I suppose I'd be happier about this movie if it would have lived up to what I hoped it would have been. Also, I still can't fathom why people say they cried during this movie... wait, actually, I think I cried during this movie too. Yes, I remember now, it was near the end of the movie... when I realised I could've spent my free video rental coupon on a REAL movie. *Sniff* I tear up every time when I remember that part.Final note: "The Crow" isn't a "contemporary classic" like the user below claims (unless you're the type that also believes "Downward Spiral" is actual music). This user didn't realise "contemporary classic" refers to something watchable, so I wouldn't watch the movie based on his statement alone.Rating: 1 star out of 10Thank you for your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard of Brandon lee's death back in '93 I didn't become so shocked until I took a glimpse of the film when it got released in th UK in 1994.It's extermely tragic not to mention speechless to lose someone who's career coincidently started to shine through. Only recently I watched "Dragon: The Bruce Lee story" and I started to shed tears wishing both father and son were still alive. Lets face it Brandon Lee's performance might've not been the best, but hey at least he would've done better than the likes of Keanu Reeves. I even considered Brandon Lee for future roles in films that would've elevated him in even further than his father. Even looks that could rival some of today's leading actors' (Johnny Depp, Ben Affleck etc).The film's demonstration of Lee's performance was equivelent to a like a starter cuisine. Although sad to lose such striking actor who had very little time to blossom, we can only imagine what roles would best suit him (Cyclops: X-Men, Johnny Cage: Mortal kombat, even a perfect cast for films like Lord of The Rings. I know that might sound a few and far between, but it's matter of personal opinion).Long live Brandon Lee (The body rests, but the spirit lives on)</fullReview>

In the end the most lethal weapon is the power of love.Brandon Lee is Eric Draven, an ultra cool avenger, an angel of death and love. Risen from the grave after one year from the murder of his girlfriend and himself to set things right. He takes on the killers and washes away the scum like an urban downpour.

		<shortDescription>"The Crow" does nothing more than propagandizes hypocritical vigalante "justice".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most films I watch, I had very high expectations for this one. It's not that I expect most films to be terrible, it's just that with most films I watch I try to have no expectations so that I can watch them unbiased, and then decide for myself whether I enjoyed them or not. Well, suffice to say, I was unbelievably disappointed with "The Crow". This film was so hyped that I expected something truly special, but what I saw was pure mediocrity. From now on, I think I'll stick to not having expectations for films. Now, I know all you young teenage people who pretend you're Goths that consider "The Crow' your Goth bible are screaming "Blasphemy! How dare you insult the late Brandon Lee's acting ability" by now, but it must be said: Hollywood isn't missing anything now that is Brandon Lee is gone. He couldn't act then, and I'm sure if he was alive today, he wouldn't be any better than he was. One of the many huge problems I had with this film was its gratuitous use of filters. You know how most of the scenes in this film mainly appear to be in black and white (while still maintaining tiny hints of color)? Well, guess what, it was ALL was done with a type of a monochrome film camera filter (excluding the red-colored flashback scenes of Eric and Shelley being murdered). But I guess you never knew that (you'll learn these kinds of things in film and photography courses). Ha! How's that for all you people that hailed the first "Crow" movie a visual masterpiece (which is isn't, because any idiot can slap a filter on a camera), but panned its sequel for it's constant use for filters? You're all hypocrites; this film is NOTHING more than an overlong MTV music video. If anything, at least in the "Crow" sequel the main actor who played the character Ash played his role wholeheartedly and with pure passion (and, from what I understand, he didn't even speak English very well). It says a lot about the original film if the actor in the sequel that doesn't even speak good English does a more expressive acting job than his predecessor. Too bad I can't say Lee was engaging; he's the talkative, egoistical, stereotypical `artful' Goth that all other Goths today are judged against. That's a shame, though, because most Goths are not nearly as pretentious as Lee makes them seem. He gives Goths a bad name. Anyway, I also hated the way that Lee's character, Eric, was "playing God", in a sense. I hated the way that he thought he could do everything the villains did to him and then get away with it. Basically the film tells its viewers, "If you're not on Eric's side, then you're against him; if you're against him, then you don't agree with him, and he'll punish you for not agreeing with him and his warped sense of 'justice'". Eric acted like he was superior to everyone else, which is exactly what his killers did to him. People have to deal with these types of awful things every day of their lives in real life; you see it on the news, and you read about it in the newspaper. Death happens every day. Why can't people accept that? I'm not saying people can't lament on the deaths of their loved ones, because most people can never get over tragedies like that, but at least ACCEPT it. Eric's problem was that he couldn't accept the fact that he and Shelley died, so he went psycho and donned black leather. Why should we accept Eric's plight when he wouldn't want us (the viewers) to deal with our tragedies the same way he did? He thinks it's alright to murder his killers, but if he ever caught one of us trying to murder our own killers he'd punish us. That's the exact definition of hypocrisy. This whole film contradicts itself, and is highly hypocritical in itself, which I couldn't stand. Want REAL Gothic atmosphere films? Then you might want to check out the first two "Hellraiser" films, "The Mangler", or the "Subspecies" films. Or, if you can't stomach nasty blood and gore very much (which I quite enjoy on occasion, well actually, all of the time), then try "Beetlejuice", Tim Burton's "Batman", "Batman Returns", or even Barry Sonnefeld's "The Addams Family". My Rating: Two stars out of ten (but ONLY for a few interesting camera angles).*Side Note: Do you want an idea of how conceited and pretentious Lee really was in real life too? If so, then rent the "Crow" sequel. Lee isn't in the film itself, but after the video, there's an interview with him about making the original "Crow". You'll see that Lee has one of THE most pretentious egos ever. That is not confidence he's exuding, it's utter pompous conceit. He has all the charm and charisma that a used car salesman, or one of those late-night television infomercial hosts has (which is not a good quality to posses).</fullReview>

I was all excited to see this Brilliant piece of work, when I got something else, a piece of CRAP. This is now officially the Worst Movie i have ever seen, it replaces any movie made starring Bill Murray, and Steve Martin, for this title. I can't believe this got good reviews, i can't even believe it got reviews at all because i can't belive this is actually a movie! I kept thinking "Okay, ill give it a bit, maybe it will get better" i kept saying this until the end credits. Original?...maybe. But the acting was horrible, the set design was sappy and cheap, the script was amateur, and the characterization was the worst part of the film. It felt like i was watching a kids comic book put on film. To explain this movie to a friend, I would have to say it is like the movies "Bat Man" and "Barb Wire" combined. I am extremely anxious to here some sort of justification to this nightmare of a movie that wasted hundreds of yards of expensive film. Speaking of expenses, I probably could guarantee that the budget of this movie, was lower than the amount of spare change I could find in my couch cushions. I almost wanted to cry because this movie took 1.5 hours of my life that I can never get back. And in closing, I say this, if this is the type of movie that is going to get rave reviews from critics around the world, then God Help Us All.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated "classic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When first released in 1994, The Crow came with a lot of baggage attached. Star Brandon Lee, son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, had died during the production of the film due to a mishap with a prop firearm. The producers and director Alex Proyas, who had largely finished the film, elected to reshoot a small amount and utilize emerging digital technology to composite Brandon Lee into a select number of scenes as well as using a body double in some cases. When it hit screens in May, critical reception was largely warm. From then until now, I have stood as one of the seemingly small cadre of individuals who found The Crow, Brandon Lee's tragic passing notwithstanding, to be considerably overrated, full of style, but largely hollow at the core.For the most part, The Crow is a revenge film dressed up with mystical elements. One year after Eric Draven (Lee) and fiancé Shelly (Sofia Shinas) were killed in a violent home invasion, Draven is resurrected from his grave by the presence of a crow, which has seemingly returned his soul to him to avenge his and Shelly's murder. Draven runs into former friends along the way, including largely ignored young girl Sarah (Rochelle Davis) and police officer Albrecht (Ernie Hudson), whom he occasionally ponders life and death with. Draven's targets are a small group of criminals, led by T-Bird (David Patrick Kelley), who works for Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), the crime boss of Detroit. Draven begins working through T-Bird's crew to reach Top Dollar, but Dollar's girlfriend, Myca (Bai Ling), realizes the source of Draven's power is the crow, and Top Dollar plots to take Draven down.The Crow's key weakness is the shallowness of the characters. While it is hard to know whether some aspects of the film were affected by Lee's death and subsequent re-editing, but both Eric and Shelly are largely ciphers, revealed to us only via very limited flashbacks, but not given much depth or development. We are supposed to feel for them because the screenplay requires it, not because of any genuine interest in them. Without this identification with the victims, it is almost impossible to be involved in the film on a visceral level. There are moments when their plight is moving, but those are few and far between. The rest of the time, The Crow is not really anything special. Draven, seeking retribution for his death and loss, mows down each one of T-Bird's henchmen, using their particular vices or skills to make for stylish deaths (One is impaled on a half-dozen knives, another overdosed on a plethora of hypodermic needles filled with drugs). Some of the action sequences are well staged, but rarely are they exciting or involving.The film's villains are also a bit underwhelming. Wincott, as Top Dollar, has a terrific raspy voice that gives Top Dollar a degree of menace, but still comes up wanting as a memorable screen heavy. T-Bird and his co-horts are barely on screen enough to register, and since they are largely drug addicts, some of them flail about wildly and are almost caricatures, not characters. The film does provide some interesting moments as Eric reconnects with friends from a prior life, but those are just glimpses of a film that is more interested in sweeping camera shots and violent death scenes.The Crow is also not exactly an upbeat film. It was based on a comic series by author James O'Barr who tragically lost his family, and The Crow was an attempt by him to provide some catharsis to those events. The Crow mediates on life and death at times, but the oppressiveness of the narrative occasionally threatens to swallow it. I am hardly one to shy away from films with downbeat material, to be sure, but without the character foundation to provide support, the darkness of The Crow sometimes seems a bit much.Many gave Brandon Lee positive notices for his last performance in this film, and he is fairly accomplished in the role. While he isn't given a lot to work with, what moments of pathos The Crow offers are in many cases due to Lee's work. It was a shame and tragedy that he died so young, on the cusp of attaining stardom. The Crow was also the film that brought director Alex Proyas to the attention of American audiences, lensing the film in largely dark and dank environments, crafting an decaying urban environment that fits the narrative. Not many years after Batman, The Crow certainly appears to offer some degree of homage to the design of Tim Burton's breakthrough success. The Crow is a very stylish affair, but good looks without a strong narrative are nothing but pretty pictures.The Crow is not a meritless film, and some moments work, but for the most part it smacks of a film that attracted a great deal of attention due to the controversy surrounding it than for its substance. The Crow would go on to be followed by one theatrical sequel, The Crow: City of Angels, which would prove abysmal, and then two other, direct to video sequels that few people probably realize ever existed. The original film is the crown jewel in that franchise, but the praise is misplaced from my point of view, affection for a film that didn't really deserve it, while its lead actor actually did. The Crow is an unfortunate end to a career, and life, cut far too short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could of been more but during circumstances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't hate this film but I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed that it could of been more developed with the script but because of Brandon Lee's untimely death it came too short to what could of been a great movie to something that felt b-grade unfortunately.For example the way he exacted his revenge to the criminals he killed them straight away, if he wanted them to suffer as much as he did he would find out what they love the most and turned it against them and eventually let them die in a slow or grisly death, especially when you can't die and you can take your time. He only did this once to one baddie in a burning car.Doesn't go through to detail of him questioning why this happen and how much hate or why nobody has done any justice. But in all the ending was perfect. I wanted to see the satisfaction from the Crow and I got it, makes it more compelling that Brandon Lee was engaged as well just before he died.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent action film, but not much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow had been recommended to me by a few friends of mine, so I figured I'd give it a try. I read a few reviews online before watching it and was pretty excited. They said it was a deep movie with a lot to say. After watching it, I have no idea what the hell they were talking about. It was a pretty decent action movie, but the only depth was that revenge is good. In fact, it's so important that you might come back from the dead for revenge. That's not very deep to me. The fact that he was so mad because the love of his life was killed as well doesn't really add depth.But the real problem with this movie is a lack of tension. For the entire time he's eking out his revenge one death at a time, he's invincible. The main character who we're supposed to be worried about can't be hurt. Every fight he gets into is a foregone conclusion. It's a bit satisfying to see him get his revenge, but really, it's not very exciting, even with gratuitously large explosions. They find an excuse for him to become vulnerable at the end, but the final show down with the head bad guy doesn't make any sense plot wise. It seemed very unnecessary, I even found myself asking aloud "Why is this movie still going?"There isn't much else to say. The atmosphere the movie created was great, but it was just the same way movies have created atmosphere for decades, it was raining all the time. Blade Runner did it and did it better. The city felt despondent, but it didn't feel like that was necessary. The action was fun, but the lack of tension stopped this movie from being great. As it is, it's a decent action flick with an odd sort of ambiance and characters from a subculture. 6/10, watch if it's on TV, but I wouldn't bother searching it out.This was a snippet of my full review, read the full article at docamos.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie holds a lot of feelings for me. It was a movie that I shared with a person I loved so much back in the 90s. It's a movie that moved me beyond words. Yeah, you can say it lacks a story, but it delivers on a powerful set of sensations derived mainly from love and despair. I remember going to the movies with my mom and brother (the first time I saw it), and even my mom loved it for it's strength. Then my ex-girlfriend and I turned into our very own movie. We accepted Eric, Sarah and Shelley into our lives, and they became a part of our relationship. This movie speaks so much to you when you're deeply in love, because you feel Eric's loss. Brandon did a great job on this, so did Proyas and everyone involved. There hasn't been another comic book movie like this one, only Spider-man 2. The rest are just action flicks with great sequences.</fullReview>

After watching this film i just felt i wanted to learn more about the film and the circumstances which surrounded the filming it. I obtained the "Making of the Crow" book and read it from cover to cover that to captivated me and it is well worth a read for all those that enjoyed the film.We may never no the true circumstances in which Brandon was killed but i do know that he was aa special actor with an emotion and a passion for what he did you could tell that from the emotional portrayal of love and loss in the crow.</fullReview>

This movie wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Sure, it was very dark and gothic just the way that I like it but I think there was a lack of character development. We never really find out what the secret is behind each character and why exactly they do the things they do and also the story was fairly predictable. And there also was too much action and fighting which isn't really my style. However, it had a few beautiful moments and lines that made me like and appreciate the movie for what it is."Buildings Burn and People Die But Real Love Is Forever".

It's very beautiful yet dark film about death and justice for victims. And when you watch it, there can be no way no one could hate this movie. They may not understand. Or maybe this wasn't their kind of movie. I think this was the first movie that I could look at the violence as if it were justified. Because if I could honestly say I'd do the same thing if I were in the same situation. I can't help but cry at the end. It's very powerful. And moving.Brandon Lee's death, has to be the most disturbing fact of the movie. But I think he would look at this film today and be proud of his work. His performance is wonderful, his best, and devided him from his father's shadow. This a wonderful movie. Not a movie that you should watch with your kids. Unless you don't mind violence and sadistic, sick people. But if you watch it, believe me, you will not be disappointed.R.I.P Brandon Lee 1965-199310/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is was one of the coolest, greatest movies ever made. This is going to be a classic. And it's not just that it has a Gothic setting that makes it so intriguing. The acting is superb. Every actor and actress in this film put their best effort in the making of this movie.Caution: might be spoilers ahead'The Crow' is a simple story about a guy who comes back from the dead to avenge the death of his fiancee. He searches the city for the men responsible for her death and as long as the crow that guides him throughout the city remains unharmed, he is invincible. The key performances are Brandon Lee as Eric Draven and Michael Wincott as Top Dollar. David Patrick Kelly, Rochelle Davies, Bai Ling, and the men who play Tin Tin, Skank, Funboy, the cop, and the pawnshop owner are also riveting. Every kill Eric Draven makes is creative, and just about every line that comes out of Top Dollar's mouth makes you laugh. The songs are great. The only part about it I didn't get (I think they explained this but I didn't catch it) was the part about Bai Ling's character being Top Dollar's sister. Anyway, the reason why I think this is the best material to come out of cinema is because this is a simple plot twisted into a haunting, action-packed tale that will end with you feeling happy about renting it and very sad that Brandon Lee died during the filming.</fullReview>

The dark and depressing mood of this flick, combined with the cinematography is classical.Brandon Lee's last performance was better than in say, Rapid Fire, and we remember him now as the man who portrayed Eric Draven the only way he could have been. The crow has yet to bring back an undead such as Brandon Lee's Eric Draven.One of the great things about this movie is that Draven has absolutely NO sympathy for those that killed him and his bride to be. In many movies the hero gets soft at the last minute and hands the villain over to the cops. The Crow shows no sign of weakness instead he systematically erases those who have done him wrong!A big roud of applause for Alex Proyas The Crow and Brandon Lee may he rest in peace...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like leafing through an old high school journal, this was difficult to get through without cringing at every bad line and self-absorbed thought. I'd recalled the dialog as being fairly pretentious, even through the rosy-red glasses of fond remembrance, but nothing could've prepared me for just how poorly the whole package has aged over the last decade and a half. Try as he might, Brandon Lee never comes close to getting over the hump as a serious dramatic actor, even in a mostly-action setting, and the half-baked revenge formula he plods through does little to challenge convention. Though its unique visual identity is still a strong point and the soundtrack remains gigantic, there's really little else to celebrate about The Crow in a modern setting. For its time this was a fantastic comic book adaptation, but given the strides made in that field over the last ten years it really isn't even a fair fight any more. Let it live on in your memories; modern viewings do nothing but disturb a settling grave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrary to how it is categorized in most stores, this is a romance movie -- albeit a dark and disturbing one. The entire purpose of Eric Draven's resurrection is to avenge his and his fiancee's deaths. I've never seen a movie with such emotion and classic one-liners.Most people compliment Brandon Lee's performance, and rightfully so, but many overlook great performances by Michael Wincott and Ernie Hudson. Both of them are good as supporting characters. Wincott delivers almost as many classic lines as Lee. Hudson is the perfect choice for the police officer -- showing his versatility (who would have thought Winston Zeedmore from Ghostbusters would be the one of the four to go on to a dramatic career?).Tragic in that it was Brandon Lee's last movie, and that he died while filming it. This adds to the surreal atmosphere of the film, especially since its protagonist has been resurrected from the dead. I first saw this film with an old girlfriend and disliked it because she MADE me watch it, but I saw it again 8 years later and realized what I'd missed. Great film overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morbid, saddening, beautiful, haunting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that'll of course always be related with the tragic death of a talented young actor on the verge of his cinematic breakthrough, but, sadly enough, we also have to acknowledge that it probably never would have been so successful in case this horrible accident wouldn't have occurred, and this regardless of how well made "The Crow" in fact is. What fascinates me more, however, is to what extent Brandon Lee's premature death indirectly influenced the undeniable "softening" of the finished product? I'm familiar with the comic strips by James O'Barr and they're definitely bloodier and more violent than this film, which merely suggests a whole lot of bloody massacres but doesn't show much. Personally, I really wonder whether or not Lee's unfortunate passing away encouraged director Alex Proyas' and his producers to make their film slightly more sentimental. This is NOT a point of criticism, mind you, as I really think "The Crow" is near brilliant with an overwhelming Gothic atmosphere, wonderfully dark set pieces and a genuinely moving love story! Back in 1994, Alex Proyas' "The Crow" dethroned "Batman" as the best comic book adaptation thus far and it remained the best until Robert Rodriguez came along in 2005, with his excellent interpretation of the pitch-black comic strip "Sin City". The story is standard-horror material, with a restless soul rising from the grave to avenge the murder of his beloved girl as well as his own. But it's decorated more beautifully, with a mythical crow representing the life force of this "angel" and the ultra-grim reproduction of dangerous Detroit. It is here that rock star Eric Draven and his girlfriend Shelley were brutally murdered during "Devil's Night"; a disturbing celebration on the night before Halloween when criminal gangs set fire to random buildings. During his killing spree, Draven comes to the conclusion that the gang members that killed him are only pawns of a much larger crime syndicate. The flashbacks in which Eric relives his maudlin final moments with the love of his life are truly saddening whereas the hunt for his victims is very exciting. Apart from Brandon Lee, whose acting is really sublime, "The Crow" also features many other brilliant actors who're all scandalously underrated, such as Michael Wincott, Ernie Hudson, John Polito and even Tony "Candyman" Todd. The later sequels almost bring shame to this masterpiece, though, so avoid them at all costs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Donnie Darko, Johnny Depp and The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Crow has now achieved cult status through its legions of depressed teenager fans. Despite the film's iconic lead Eric Draven now being the patron saint of Goths everywhere, The Crow delivers an adequate slice of revenge action that is brought down just below the bar because of its hideously clichéd principal character. Sporting a skin type black ninja outfit, make up only Kiss would be proud of and Edgar Allen Poe's Raven's wimpier cousin 'The Crow', Draven (Brandon Lee's final performance) deals out painful revenge upon those that murdered him and his girlfriend one year ago. The plot plays out exactly as you would expect for a nineties revenge flik except rather than Harry Tasker kicking ass and taking names we observe Edward Scissorhands on drugs slaughtering all opposition. Its a good laugh if you want a harmless revenge film with little more than the necessary amount of substance than the dry script requires, or you may enjoy it if you are aged between 12-17 and haven't found your niche in life yet. Rest assured teens, The Crow will answer none of your questions but will only fill you with new ones such as: Wouldn't it have been nice if poor Eric Draven had only stayed dead?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, this ain't a comic book, Mr. Proyas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely use the word "stupid" to describe a film, but it just about captures nearly everything here. How else should I describe the story of a ghost who paints his face (can he?) before taking revenge for his and his girl-friend's murder, vanishes into thin air whenever he wants but has to climb stairs to reach his apartment, plays guitar in anguish, cheerfully faces bullets (he knows he's dead and can't die again) but bleeds to death in the end (so he CAN die after all!), gets shot through the stomach (rats, that one went through!), and even gets stabbed (sword went through too!). Don't get me wrong. I am not against mythological plots, but they must be presented against elaborate background plots, within sympathetic environments, and populated with well-developed characters. You can't just shove your Chimeras into viewers' faces expecting them to take a ride. Moreover, even non-sense stories are acceptable in certain places such as comic books &amp; strips. And perhaps this is where the screen-writer may have screwed things up. This movie, you see, is actually based on a comic strip, but the writer Mr. Schow utterly failed to extract credible film material from it. Shame!Other areas--acting, score, action scenes--are bad enough to not merit any commenting. Sets look like sets when they shouldn't. There was a need for moderate special effects, but they're shamefully bad. The director couldn't even manage to shoot a flying mechanical crow against a fake background. And this movie is deemed a classic!? Pffft! But hey, not all is bad! Those three stars I've assigned are for something after all. Mr Dariusz Wolski (DP) has managed to capture some beautiful images in his camera. One could just pause the movie anywhere, and there's a great chance the emerging frame would turn out a stunning picture. The lighting and background colors are very astutely chosen, and are an impressive achievement (for those who don't know, Mr Wolski is also the DP for the entire Pirates of the Caribbean franchise). Too bad though, all those beautiful pictures don't make sense when viewed in a sequence at a rate of 25 per second, which is, I presume, the objective of this film was.MY VERDICT: Unless you are a junkie, high on cocaine and practically impervious to what's going on in the world around you, I don't see how you, or anyone for that matter, can ever come to enjoy this film. If you ask the rabid followers of this movie, who prowl the IMDb comments section and ridicule and insult the detractors, they'll slap you with a childish "you wouldn't understand" answer. I agree with them, however. A movie this stupid has barely anything to understand. This movie is so bad, it's funny. Don't waste your time; leave it to the hippies.ALTERNATE WATCH: Beavis &amp; Butthead</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the original comic, only the concept of it. This is the second movie by Proyas I've seen(the first being I, Robot), and it's one of the two that's been recommended and suggested to me the most(the other being Dark City). Brandon Lee's fate was lamentable, and thoughts go to Eliza Hutton, his widow. He died making an amazing film that I'm glad was released, though it is obviously an ethical choice if it should be or not. Inspired by his own experiences, James O'Barr wrote a comic(book and strip) about this character, and Proyas and Lee brought it to life(so to speak) on the big screen. The plot is well-told and engaging. The pacing may be flawless. It never moved too fast nor too slow. The writing is good, the dialog is very well-written. There were some really cool and instantly quotable lines spoken in this film. The acting is great, if Ling Bai is perhaps somewhat flat... this may have been intentional, I'm not sure. Lee(R.I.P.) did grand in his performance, both as far as action and acting go. Wincott makes a marvelous villain, as expected. The action is awesome, pure and simple. The music, rock, really works for the film. The look and feel is Gothic and neo-noir, and it fits the theme and concept perfectly. The camera-work and editing are both top-notch. The film has scenes that could have been sappy and hokey in the hands of less talented film-makers, but they work well. A film about the strength of love, about spirit and justice. The DVD features the theatrical trailer, and a commentary track with Jeff Most and John Shirley, and it is highly informative and well worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of vigilante stories, comic books, superheroes and the people involved in making it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a brooding, dark Gothic masterpiece. Just bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I know of its origins in comic book land, but that doesn't mean the characters have to be two-dimensional. Cardboard villains and heroes. Idiotically simple-minded revenge plot. Absolutely no suspense or tension because you know Brandon Lee's character is invincible.The crow-raven conflation is silly ("rapping, rapping at my chamber door" etc.) Why not make the bird a freaking raven instead of a crow if you want to reference Poe?And the goth-rock setting is equally moronic. (Everyone knows that all Goths are pussies and afraid of any violence other than to themselves.) Brandon Lee putting on his Robert Smith makeup after rising from the dead just made me laugh out loud.I don't understand the reviewers lauding the "atmospheric" / "beautifully shot" / etc. cinematography. The whole thing looks like a cheesy 90s MTV video.I could go on. This is probably the worst movie I've seen in the last year...or more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lee's Death sold the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the people turned out to see the Crow after hearing that Bruce Lee's son, Brandon Lee was killed while filming one of the action scenes. Much like his father's tragic ending, he too had a film that was being made when he came to the same conclusion in his life. Much of the public had no clue who Brandon Lee was until he was dead. While the Martial Arts audience knew a lot about him, the typical American movie audience hadn't a clue. The same went for the movie. Not too many people knew what it was about or who the star of the film was. Because of the so called "mystery" and "conspiracy" behind his death, Brandon Lee's end made The Crow an instant Cult Classic.A story of revenge and timeless love, The Crow is an interesting film with a great supporting casts. Ernie Hudson along with others create well rounded and very dark cast which Brandon Lee does justice as the movie's star. Overall, his true life death makes the movie more real when at times, you forget about the movie's plot and know that somewhere during the movie, Brandon would have a date with death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never should have come to big screen. It was better in comics..!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie which should have never made. So predictable..! I knew what was going to happen before every other scene. Few times I wished while watching the movie that the killers should have been 1 or 2... Because in that case the movie would be much smaller. It was not at all scary. I don't know who ever said this is the character which gave competition to Batman. I said give me a break..!! Batman revenge was serious enough besides this Crowman guy isn't taking his seriously. Why does he have to laugh and make jokes while killing every murderer? And on top of that I didn't like the acting of lead character as well. Okay finally one of the reason I gave this movie 3 stars because Firstly IMDb doesn't accept less than zero rating. Secondly it has a message which is Don't smoke it will kill you. Or don't watch me it can kill you (whichever you want to take) . Thirdly Rock song in the movie..which made it a little bit bearable. I think it's a silly movie with a simple and predictable storyline</fullReview>

Film consists of a murdered rock musician coming back to avenge his death and his girlfriend's assault. Watch him kill one of the guys who had attacked him. Then watch him kill another. And another. See him rip a cheesy guitar solo from atop an apartment building. But again, at least this movie had great set designs, unlike the Death Wish movies which had almost nothing going for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie maybe five times all the way through, and i have to say that i enjoy it. But don't get me wrong, this movie is bad.....real bad. To start, the bad guys in this movie are absolutely terrible. T-Bird reminds me more of a high school teacher than a criminal. All Funboy does is sleep around. Skank is just a raving fool along for the ride. When i think about it, Tin-Tin was the only dangerous person in that group (because of the knives). Top Dollar, a criminal whose name makes no sense, is a weird dude who, what, wiggles around a sword? calls an Asian woman with huge lips his sister? kills women he sleeps with and takes out their eyes to do..what, exactly? Nothing about him either made sense or was in the least bit intimidating.The main character, Eric Draven, is (or was) a rock star with a pretty fiancée, Shelly. whenever he remembers past experiences with Shelly, he goes back to this sappy world of before when nothing could possibly go wrong and everything was set to candlelight. When he comes back from the dead, he, like other superheroes, inexplicably breaks into some makeup and paints himself to be weird. Whenever he says something, it's usually a quote of some book, and the effect is totally not there (e.g. his quote from Poe's "the Raven" in the pawn shop, or when he says "Mother is the word for God on the lips of children" to Darla - lame). And the SUBTLE interjections of humor could not possibly have occurred at more inappropriate times: when he dares funboy to shoot his hand, then laughs when it heals, it seems like he's showing off this ability that is only given to him for a single, serious purpose; and in the cathedral when he is shot, he stumbles a bit and drops an f-bomb (so badly done!)The smashing of the guitar on the rooftop was a little cheesy for my taste as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>don't watch this expecting a snuff film (they cut the scene)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a long time I have known of the tragedy that surrounded this film. An actor being killed on set for giving a wooden performance. Harsh but not necessarily unjustified. Films cost millions of dollars and poor acting can completely ruin the finished product. People have been killed for a lot less is all I'm saying. Don't expect to see the famous scene its not in the film and or special features. Disappointing!Now to the film. I found it quite entertaining in parts. Brandon Lee's character was quite a dark hero. The film was quite dark. Not to mention violent. I enjoyed the violence.An interesting observation I had was in the similarities between Brandon Lee's Crow character and Heath Ledger's Joker character. Not just in make up but in performance. I have to wonder whether or not Heath Ledger modeled his Joker on Lee's Crow. One might go as far as saying Ledger modeled everything on Lee. Right down to promoting the film by dying during the production of it. No doubt both films received extra attention due to the star dying before it hit the cinemas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching this I decided that Brandon Lee's death must be a hoax. He isn't really dead, just too embarrassed to out in public again. This whole movie is just awful. Though, I suppose the two dimensional nature of everything about the film can be traced back to its comic origins, but what's the point of making a live action film if it's going to be thinner than the paper the original story was printed on? I'd like to see a prequel detailing the rise to power of the Hell Night leader despite his position as leader seeming completely arbitrary. I got the feeling that the soundtrack sold the movie. Grunge heads went to see it because their heroes' music was in it and must have loved it because of that. Can't recommend even for a casual view, really. Total waste of time IMO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the Worst That Hollywood Has to Offer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish there were a zero rating on IMDb. The movie industry ought to have a "Toxic Waste" rating, the kind that damages our society with absolutely no chance of cleanup. Yes, I believe that The Crow is the Love Canal of movies...I can't believe this motion picture was directed by the same person who directed "Dark City." If I had seen The Crow (an earlier film) first, I would never have viewed Dark City, and that would have been a shame. The two don't belong on the same planet... They truly don't reside in the same universe. The only thing I can figure: The Crow came out of Hollywood, while Dark City came out of Australia.Regardless of what Roger Ebert says about The Crow (he called it "good" ?), to me it is the worst piece of ultra-violent dreck I have ever seen, even including "Narc," the only other film I've rated a "1" here. Both richly deserve a complete zero. I detect a pattern here: Both films' stories take place in Detroit. Moral: Never watch any film whose setting is Detroit! The Crow is genuinely scary to me, but not in the way you might imagine. I think the horribly ultra-violent spirit of the film, completely unrelieved throughout (no matter the insipid, unbelievably saccharine "good guys win" ? ending) contributed directly to Brandon Lee's death. How else can you explain something as bizarre as a "blank" movie-prop round killing someone during the filming of a motion picture? It is obvious to me that so many (way-over-the-top many) "blank" shots had to be fired at the (so-called) "hero" that this must have contributed to Lee's death. Someone said this film is a fitting memorial to Lee. Indeed. No further comment required.Even the music during the ending credits: "It Can't Rain All the Time," or whatever it's called, is nausea-producing garbage. The singer is horribly flat (pitch, that is). Just listen to it, if you dare; it is totally forgettable trash. Thank heavens it has been forgotten! I made the mistake of starting to play the comment track by the Producer and Screenwriter. I do wish English grammar allowed me to de-capitalize their titles. I think they are quite demented, totally out of touch with reality... I believe their warped view of the world has caused them to descend into the depths of self-aggrandizing insanity.People: Do not view The Crow, ever. Unless you like flirting with brain-damaging toxic waste. If you let any teenager view this film, it should be considered that you should be jailed for launching sociopathic violence on the rest of us.Thank Goodness I watched The Crow only once. I am hoping that Time Will Heal All Wounds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it for its visual style and Lee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Crow' has two interesting things. The first is Brandon Lee's final performance, since this is the movie where he was killed in the making. His performance, may be because he was killed, is very interesting. The other reason to see this movie is the visual style. With a great production design and a very fine cinematography you almost have the perfect look for a comic book movie, what 'The Crow' is. The movie is dark, may be a little too dark at times, but knows its main characters and therefore chooses this great look.Still, for me it was not enough to like this movie. There were single scenes I did like but as a whole it wasn't very good. There is no story at all. Brandon Lee is Eric. He is killed and his wife is beaten and raped and dies in the hospital as well. According to the movie a crow takes your soul after you die. When the soul is not able to rest the crow can bring you back to make things right. Eric is brought back and it is time for revenge.It is not that I always want a story. Some movies have almost no story but are great anyway. This is not the kind of movie that can realize that. I understand when people do like this movie but it just didn't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The comments saying it's a good adaptation...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>of the comic must have been written by people who haven't read the comic.*Possible* spoilers...When the producers adapted the comic to the movie, they left behind the core of the character. The major characteristic that made The Crow who he was. To describe the revenant of Eric Draven requires only one word: laconic. He was an avenging angel who said very little, and that was a big part of what made him so terrifying to his victims. He appears and they recognize him. He doesn't say much. He doesn't really seem angry. He just, calmly, proceeds to extract the full measure of justice they deserve. Nothing they do can stop him. This is the definition of a revenant. Someone who has died so wrongly that their spirit remains in the earthly plane with a single driving purpose (in this case, vengeance). Nothing diverts the revenant from that purpose and it's damn near impossible to stop it from accomplishing said purpose.Making all those long-winded speeches is, simply, something that a revenant would not do. There is no need and it distracts from the purpose.So. Go back and read the comic, it's better than the movie (which, with 2 exceptions, is always the case). It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't do justice to the source.4 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow had all the makings a of a brilliant, unforgettable movie: A great lead actor, a great concept, and a brilliant soundtrack, but somewhere along the way, it went horribly wrong.The original concept for the film (a victim rising from the grave to wreak hideous revenge on those who wronged him), had it been stuck to, would have given this movie the potential to be unforgettable. If they had stuck to it, and not heavily dragged out the storyline, I would have found the film far more captivating. It was also tainted by the hideous genre of 90's Action Films, which somehow infected the story, embellishing what could have been a good ending, with explosions and cheap stunts.Had this been made in a different time, or had a different script/story writer it could have been brilliant. Its still a great movie though, and because I so desperately want to love it, I can ignore the slander that has infected the amazing storyline! All in all...five out of ten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite comments that proclaim this movie really deep and memorable the performance by the "late great Brandon Lee (as if he was a great actor or even as good as his dad)" this movie left a lot to be desired as far as I'm concerned. Now let me say right off, if you are a fan of the comic book (or other popular Gothic literature) you probably will like the movie or at least find it more interesting then I did. But I am reviewing this movie from the perspective of an action fan / experienced movie watcher and therefore I have no particular bias towards the genre.Anyway the plot is pretty standard. Guy is wronged by criminals who kill him and his wife and he comes back a year later to seek revenge. I guess this is slightly different cause usually the bad guys only "think" they kill the guy, but this time they managed to finish him off and he comes back to life (sorta). Still it's your standard revenge/action movie plot with little suspense actually cause he is invincible so there is no chance he will get hurt. So he kills abunch of guys and the action is so so. The biggest gunfight is pretty lame actually, the bad guys just keep shooting at him and the bullets have no effect...but they never learn and keep shooting, silly criminals. It has a predictable ending and there isn't very much mystery.The movie also has managed to pack a ton of clichés that any action fan can spot. The angry police chief, the helpful police officer who comes to the Crows aid at the end (only after being suspended, cause as we all know the cop can never get anything done while actually on the force), the girl who is gonna kidnapped by the bad guys at the end, the fight on the roof (sometimes on another perilous location, but rooftop is standard), the bad guy falling off and getting impaled, the climactic fight in the rain, pretty lame chase scenes (2), vigilante hero, rainy dark city (someone said think Blade Runner, I wouldn't give it that much credit, I would say think Split Second with Rutger Hauer), flashbacks to the original crime. There are probably a few more but those are just the ones off the top of my head.Anyway the movie is not nearly as original as some of it's fans make it sound. The characters are really 2-dimensional. It's kind of funny to hear people say that the movie is deep. It's really simple, the guy is killed he comes back to avenge his girl friends death and kill the bad guys. There are some attempts to have the Crow represent a Christ like figure (palms healing, touching the crack-whore and the drugs come out of her body and she turns a new leaf in life, the whole resurrection aspect (i guess)). Still that is only a few brief scenes, and besides when you really think of it, Jesus came back to life so that he could ascend to heaven, the Crow came back so he could kill the guys who murdered his girlfriend and ruined his budding rock career (btw his guitar solo on top of the building was really moving).So in conclusion you could do better. Darkman is essentially the same movie but is more entertaining and certainly has a more interesting directing style. The action here is pretty mediocre and the results are predictable (though I admit pretty much 100% of action movies are predictable). To fans of the comic I would recommend it (I guess, though I have never read the comic so I don't know how faithful a representation this is).One more thing. I love how he (and now on this site) people quote Edgar Allen Poe (who is much more worthy of your time then this movie)and give the quote "Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping...at my chamber door". I guess for the makers of the movie they thought, "Crow, raven who will notice that it isn't the same bird? It sounds cool so let's just put it in there." Apparently not the fans of this movie.Zoopansick</fullReview>

The theory is simple, if the bad guy has a big gun then the hero gets a bigger one or a super power. The film seems to reflect that dark side of the US psyche that believes that it is descending into a final fight against evil and you should fight with every weapon at your disposal.The violence that is relatively sterile on the comic page, explodes into a completely unacceptable level without any of the humour or irony of so many other violent films. And that is the films downfall.Devoid of any humour or meaning it becomes instantly forgettable other than the fact that the star is Bruce Lee's son, and he died during the filming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why The Crow hurts artists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crow came out on HD BluRay v.2.2 over the weekend and its getting rave reviews from hundreds of papers and online magazines. I see " AMAZING!" and " HIGH OCTANE ENERGY!" amid pictures of AWESOME caped crusaders punching their way through the film's title on posters popping up everywhere.However, until about two weeks ago I had never even heard of the thing. The Crow apparently came from a comic book published a handful of years ago by Marvel. Just one of thousands of titles the publishing company knocks out every year.The Crow is one of those " I'm so smart" satires of the comic book world of characters. They try to create a world where one can simultaneously mock and love people who dress up like Batman or Superman. Where putting a ski mask over your head and fighting evil is both COOL and HILARIOUSLY stupid.There's an off putting idea out there that if you exist in a world that some people don't understand ( i.e. you draw comics for a living and people mock you) then you must work tirelessly to make them 'understand' where you're coming from. As if you can only be complete in the world where the 'clique' of society, the Pulitzer people, the Paris Hilton groupies, the Times Magazine crowd accepts you as one of their own. If Times Magazine doesn't understand you then there must be something wrong with you! Right? Right? Wrong.Artists don't need to be understood. Comic artists know that the people who read Oprah Book club novellas do not pick up the latest issues of Batman. Its common knowledge so why do artists continue to tirelessly create something that Oprah will approve of? I don't know but The Crow is exactly that.Satires like The Crow are written from the 'wink wink I think comics are dumb too' position. They feed the idea that we're ALL in the same boat of believing that Batman is a hopelessly stupid character and none of us buy his comics. We're cool, just like you. We wrote this book to prove it.To impound the idea that they're stupid they exaggerate the medium to the point of grotesque mimicry. Such as creating a bird character who kills so many people over the course of the story that the only way to make his character seem more alive is to have him use such foul language that even the most perverted pervert in the audience will throw back his head, point at the screen (book) and shout, " Can you BELIEVE he just said that?!" What is the point? The only people who truly like this film are the artists in our community who feel the need to be part of the 'It crowd' ( Yeah, comics are so dumb! I don't know why I do that for a living!), the reviewers who want to mock graphic novels because they can't understand visual arts ( 'Comics are for kids. You really do that for a living?') and the poor people in the middle who can't tell the difference ( Whoa! It was awesome! I liked it when that kid stabbed that guy in the eye and ripped out his beating heart!).The problem with The Crow is that for the thousands, probably millions of people who had no idea what The Crow was a until this movie, they will see a film where a bird man hybrid murders people without restraint or second thought. It doesn't matter that the people she kills are depicted as evil. An human being killed by a bird is not cool. Its tragic. Usually its depicted as tragic if its depicted at all.People will go away with the thought that this blatant, violent, foul mouthed mess of a film came from a comic book. Some people will be misguided enough to bring their kids, thanks to the stylized posters that look much more family friendly then they are, and they will leave the theater in absolute shock, dragging their kids with them. And those parents who probably never bought their child a comic book before will now never EVER buy them a comic.Films like The Crow just play into the media's description that comics are evil, stupid and perverse and, most horribly, all the same.What a mess. I just started to laugh every time when Brandon Lee started walk in slow motion with those aladdins pants.</fullReview>

The acting is like an after school special and the writing... well it looks like it was written by Goths. If you think this is a good piece of cinema please stop reading comic books... pick up some Paul Bowles, James Joyce or Mikail Bulgakov and open your mind. Just like these real writers, real filmmakers have names like Godard, Bunuel, Von Trier and Lynch.</fullReview>
