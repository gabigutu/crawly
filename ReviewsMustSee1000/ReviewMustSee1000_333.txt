		<shortDescription>cerebral horror at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wolf" posits that the werewolf bite is not necessarily a curse, if what you really crave is a more wild and natural lifestyle than is possible in our "civilized" society. Quite cleverly, the story is set in a publishing company, an environment that is both civilized and predatory at the same time. Nicholson gives one of his best performances of recent years here, playing against type - he's actually a nice, normal guy! Spader, on the other hand, does what he always does; he acts like a sleaze, and very good he is at it, too. Pfeiffer makes a tough, proactive heroine, and gets a much better part than you'd expect for a woman in a horror film (horror is very much a boy's genre, I'm afraid).I'm going to get snooty here and suggest that most people just don't understand "Wolf," probably because its ideal audience is quite small. Fans of Nicholson's usual drama fare dislike the movie for its horror content, and fans of violent horror dislike the movie because it's lacking in action and gore. But if you like thoughtful horror that has more brains than blood, you're part of the small group of people who'll get something out of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classy Werewolf Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a werewolf movie done with some style and some class. This may be the only werewolf-business world combination. It features effective villains played by James Spader and Christopher Plummer. I've always found Spader an easy guy to dislike, in any film.Jack Nicholson is the lead guy, however, and is refreshingly low-key, especially for him. I don't believe he ever raised his voice in this movie, acting very subdued throughout.There isn't as much action as you see in most modern-day horror movies but yet this is such an intense story that you don't lose interest. It's pretty good in the visual department, too, and it doesn't hurt to ogle Michelle Pfeiffer.Even though the profanity is pretty low for a '90s film, when it's there it's needless. They could could have done this movie, believe it or not, without any and it still would have been good. I'm not complaining. I still recommend this, but not for people who are looking for an action--packed vampire film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson is a wolf... no surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this film. It is different as a horror movie, because it really isn't a horror movie - and yet here we have a man turning into a wolf, he starts killing people at night, and we have the rabid horror music stalking our ears when the wolf is on the prowl.I like the characters, I like the slow pace and the calm moments and I especially like Jack Nicholson when Randall's senses start to come alive. He is extremely well cast for this film, I don't think many others would actually convey the animal inside like he does. Pfieffer's character is, although formulaic, a relief among all the hard-assed men of this film. The ending is a bit silly, but nonetheless odd and intriguing.Yep.I like this movie. It's fun to watch and it's great to see Nicholson act like the animal we all really think he is but don't dare to find out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wolfman Jack - 8 (excellent depiction of the corporate werewolf culture)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even in the confines of big skyscrapers, it's a dog eat dog world.Simply put, WOLF is a class act. The director is legendary. The acting is subdued yet electrically charged. To top things off, the Hitchcock style score by Ennio Morricone draws you in from the opening credits straight to the end. WOLF is such a unique installment to the werewolf tradition that it easily bursts through the bars of any category you place it in.Mike Nichols boasts a career that is a study in itself. After artistically defining a post-war generation with the Graduate in 1967, he has been very selective with his projects behind the camera. Twenty-seven years after the Graduate, the veteran Nichols rises to the challenge of weaving a wide range of adult themes into one coherent werewolf movie. Stylistically, the shots and cinematography featured in the movie hearken back to an adventurous 70's spirit that has been abandoned in modern film. The combination of quick and slow zooms, along with expansive cuts of open spaces make the 125 minute story both rhythmic and engrossing.WOLF is not the conventional werewolf movie we're accustomed to seeing, as the film is meant to induce a snicker as opposed to a scream. Although the scare factor takes a marked jump towards the end, the movie isn't really a horror movie. It focuses mostly on the canine tricks of corporate power, double-crossing, and primordial carnal knowledge. In this respect, James Spader upstages Jack Nicholson and almost steals the show.Still, there's all the good stuff that comes with werewolf movies. The curse is a contagion transmitted by a bite. Who's the monster, and what makes the monster fearsome? What happens when Jack starts to turn? How far can Mike Nichols upset our comfort level? For all those horror fans out there, the make-up team did a superb job, no doubt influenced by the disjointed transformations of the original black and white wolf-man classic.As a telltale sign of the film's sophistication, the werewolf theme is dramatically eclipsed by the true storyline ? Nicholson's over-the-hill struggles in the publishing business. In the final examination, with corporate culture in mind, WOLF tends to resemble Wall Street or As Good as It Gets more than it does the Howling or American Werewolf in London. Nichols does a masterful job seamlessly weaving canine trickery into the workplace. Jack's heightened sense of smell detects his coworker's early morning Tequila. His pointed ears pick up juicy office gossip. In addition to these scenes, WOLF introduces an innovative corporate idea ? urination and marking of territory, something that every sensible dog does when he feels like it!The only detractor from WOLF is the quick and dirty relationship between Pfiffer and Nicholson. Even though the film is billed as a werewolf movie, this relationship somewhat stands as a centerpiece. To be sure, the sparse exchanges between the two stars feature witty dialog with plenty of chemistry. But despite this potential, the relationship somehow rings hollow and gets trampled beneath the other story lines that are taking place.Apparently Sharon Stone was offered the female lead but turned the role down. To some extent, I don't blame her. The development of Michelle Pfiffer's character in the movie was an open question mark.The Pfiffer-Nicholson love story culminates in WOLF's unique ending. If you happen to catch this movie, you can frolic through the woods with Jack along to Morricone's synthesized arpeggios. Then determine for yourself whether the ending adds or detracts from the movie. It's been a quandary for me ever since I saw WOLF for the first time in 199(?).JYJimboduck-dot-com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant visuals and excellent acting create a very underrated film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when it first appeared in the cinema and I can remember my disappointment at the wolf scenes. Now, five years on, I realise what a gem this film is.The cinematography is very well done, providing slick shots throughout which still hold their own against current films. The acting is very good with James Spader oozing sleaziness with every single look, Michelle Pfieffer playing a hardened woman, and Jack Nicholson being, well, Jack Nicholson, but hairier.The opening sequence grabs you straight away, stock shocks, but they work fantastically, from then on I found myself impressed on just about every following scene.Nicholson is very good at underplaying the beginning of his transformation as he starts to discover his newly heightened senses, but he comes into his own when his powers bring him new found confidence and self assurance.Some of the wolf effects are a little cheesy, and the appearance of David Schwimmer playing a cop caused me to flash into Friends mode - he even has a friends-like line, could he _be_ anymore Ross like? Aside from these little niggles the film has an excellent love story with fantastic interaction between Nicholson and Pfieffer with some wry dialog. It's got great lighting and very good cinematography throw in a superb Morricone soundtrack and a cool ending and you've got a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unapologetic and serious modern monster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the 1940s, filmmakers attempting to make a new monster film, in the vein of the classics Dracula or The Wolf Man are often saddled with the contempt or disbelief provoked in response by contemporary audiences, leaving the end result either comedic or a camp attempt at a thriller incapable of being taken seriously or enjoyed by anyone other than caffeine riddled thirteen year olds. After numerous of said attempts, it was refreshing, to say the least, to experience a film which would normally fall under the aforementioned category, but which took its subject matter in a straightforward and serious fashion, helmed by a quality filmmaker and with a strong enough cast to properly sell some of the less credible aspects of the production. The result was Wolf, a modern werewolf film not intended as a joke or cinematic money grabber, but instead an intelligent look at the themes which thrilled 1940s audiences in a contemporary context. Director Mike Nichols should be commended for instilling his subject matter with enough dramatic intensity to appeal to an adult demographic, without forgetting the primary intent of such a film - to thrill and chill its audiences in turn. But rather than milking the audience's emotions with a series of oh so trite horror clichés, Nichols is willing to forgo outright shock value screams for a continual chilling sensation - a more subtle and ultimately more eerie touch many modern hackneyed attempts at horror could learn volumes from. Adding to Wolf's credibility is some creative and intriguing camera work, although the continued use of slow motion during dramatic points does begin to appear hokey after a while, despite working brilliantly at other points. The quality of the film is also strongly aided by a strong script, brilliantly paced between frights and character development; also a rarity considering the genre, and with just enough fleeting moments of perfectly placed comedic relief. The ever reliable Ennio Morricone contributes a wonderful score, a sublime tribute to the horror films of old without ever seeming clichéd. The filmmakers should also be commended enormously for resisting the temptation to overload the werewolf character with special effects, and take the classic makeup route instead. In an industry inundated with computer altered special effects, there is something very laudable about seeing an actual actor covered in prosthetic hair giving an actual performance, rather than a CGI created monstrosity. Whether intended as a tribute to the original Wolf Man (the facial hair designs are unmistakably familiar to Lon Chaney Jr.'s infamous antihero) or simply taking inspiration from it, the makeup works enormously well, and gives a welcome dose of nostalgia in a modern incarnation of the genre. The casting of Jack Nicholson as a modern day werewolf may have immediately come across as a very mixed blessing, inciting excitement that such an iconic actor was taking a shot at a part which seemed tailor made for him, and fear that Nicholson might simply coast by on the premise, and indulge in his tendency to drift over the top to the point of pantomime, effectively ruining the intent of the film. Thankfully, Nicholson also had the credulity to take his subject matter seriously, and emerge with a perfectly tuned performance. Nicholson channels his legendary charisma into an entirely credible character, riddled with pathos and dark menace, easily dispelling fears that his facial prosthetics might come across as laughable, and emerging with a surprisingly powerful and very serious performance. Michelle Pfeiffer gives a tremendously charismatic and entirely believable performance as Nicholson's surprisingly well written love interest - rather than being reduced to screaming and floundering around, Pfeiffer injects her character with real human emotions, taking what could have been a routine romantic lead and nearly stealing the film in one of the most impressive performances in her career. James Spader makes a deliciously slimy antagonist, and classy support is provided from Kate Nelligan, Richard Jenkins and Christopher Plummer. What might have degraded into cheap watered down horror trash culminated as an intelligent, mature and unapologetic modern monster thriller, made all the stronger by its firm, capable direction, intelligent and wonderfully paced script, with excellent performances from Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Wolf makes a wonderful modern take on the Wolf Man classic right down to the facial prosthetics, and is easily worth seeing for any fans of the genre in the mood for a horror film which refuses to patronise its audience - a very refreshing change. -8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wolfman Jack?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wolf" is not your average blood and guts horror flick. Rather it is a high budget drama with horror overtones with a top notch cast skillfully directed by Mike Nichols. Jack Nicholson stars as Will Randall a meek book editor whose life suddenly is thrown into turmoil when he is bitten by a wolf while driving home from a business meeting. Suddenly he begins to feel younger and more energetic and to have keener senses of smell, sight and hearing. But to his horror, he begins to experience memory black outs during which several tragic events occur. He gradually comes to realize that he is taking on the characteristics of a wolf. At the office, Randall has just been fired from his job by owner Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) and his place taken by the arrogant brown nosing Stewart Swinton (James Spader). Randall also learns that Swinton has been having an affair with his wife (Kate Nelligan). At that time he meets Alden's beautiful but self-centered daughter Laura (Michelle Pfeiffer) and naturally they become involved (Who wouldn't howl at the moon after spending the night with Michelle Pfeiffer?). When Randall's wife is murdered, he begins to fear the worst so he turns to Laura for help in helping him to subdue his urges. But is he guilty murder? We have to wait to find out what's really going on until the last part of the film. The performances by all cast members are top notch. Nicholson as usual stands out as the tragic, doomed Randall. Pfeiffer (who is a much better actress than she is given credit for) is excellent as Laura. Plummer is suitably oily and manipulative as Alden and Spader is really good as the over ambitious Swinton. Look for David Hyde Pierce in a small role as Randall's assistant and look real close for David Schwimmer as one of the cops who tries to arrest Randall at the zoo. An off beat but different sort of horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mature werewolf flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a welcome change from the typical werewolf flick. First off, we have Jack. Jack rules. Also, we have a good story that relates to adult life. This movie seems to pay tribute to classic werewolf films such as "The Wolf Man" with its basic formula of: Normal man, man bitten, man realizes something wrong, man discovers cool abilities, man uses abilities, man's abilities become out of control, man seeks help, man gets mystical amulet, man seeks resolution. It works very well, and this movie has great acting in it. Consider it a corporate werewolf flick, a more mature look at the beast in all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nearly perfect synthesis of realism, satire and horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Nichols is not always an inspired director but in this case HE IS ! Quite amazingly but undeniably, he manages with this gem to achieve a nearly perfect synthesis of the realistic, satiric and horror genres.The theme of lycanthropy , provided by Jim Harrison's exciting screenplay, is made all the more interesting since it applies to real life, to the soulless society surrounding us. We have an expression in French "l'homme est un loup pour l'homme" (Men are wolves to other men ) which could not be illustrated in a better way than by this somber movie. Indeed, the werewolf theme (unfortunately ) applies to perfection to our money-minded, cynical,mercantile environment.Also very interesting is the fact that lycanthropy is presented from two angles, the first violent and painful ( like in dozens of such like stories ) the second positive and exhilarating ( a much more seldom approach ). Will Randall not only suffers from the change in his mind and body but he sees his senses becoming keener, his abilities develop and his combativeness strengthened. And putting all these new qualities to good use,he turns into the dark avenger of the frustrated viewer. The dark romantic ending ( the couple becoming wolves ) avoids the trite happy end and the terror effects are very satisfactory. I particularly vibrated at the fight between Nicholson and Spader, in the middle of which poor Michelle Pfeiffer is ruthlessly brutalized.The opening sequence ( worried Nicholson driving in a beautiful but unsettling snowy landscape ) is also memorable.Nicholson, Pfeiffer, Spader and Plummer are all excellent and complement each other to perfection. Shame on those who disparage this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It feels good to be wolf - yes?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now HERE is a film to sort out the average from the anything-but-average viewer. The reviews I have read sadden me, as they suggest a respective ratio of 98 : 2If you cannot see the absolute brilliance and talent that went into this deceptively clever and involving movie, why declare your obvious limitations by writing about it? Of course it was never going to be your average run of the mill lycanthropic bite-fest. Was that ever likely with Mike Nichols directing and Nicholson starring? The film is a dedication to BELIEFS, to unseen beauty, unacknowledged links and to the predator in all of us. It is a tale of romance and magnificence. Way up there in my own personal top 50 films of all time I could never tire of watching this film and LISTENING..and this word is the key.HEARING becomes an intrinsic part of Nicholson's transformation after he is bitten by a wolf on his way home one night in upstate New York. He works as senior editor in an upmarket publishing house that is taken over by a conglomerate headed up by Christopher Plummer in one of his superb little Christopher Plummer characterisations. Nicholson's Will Randall is offered the job no-one wants by Plummer to catalyse his hoped-for resignation. The essence of the wolf however already in his blood sharpens his instincts and he takes the fight up to Plummer ultimately forcing a back-down.Of so many wonderful scenes presented, it is hard to nominate a favorite but that where he meets Plummer's daughter (Michelle Pfeiffer) stands as one of the great verbal exchanges ever put down on film. Up there with Pacino and De Niro in HEAT, Pacino and Keanu Reeves in THE DEVILS ADVOCATE, sparks just fly as the old pro shreds her veneer of impenetrable coldness and gets plenty back, all the time both unconsciously aware of something quite outside their experiences, taking hold somewhere in another dimension.My personal nomination for stand out scene, is the sequence where Will Randall, concerned and confused as to what is happening to him, consults alternative health doctor Vijay Alezias (so humbly played by Om Puri) who understands what afflicts Randall and explains to him the "nature" of the wolf and the strength it will ultimately bequeath upon him. In a scene so absolutely touching, he proffers his hand to Nicholson and explaining that he is an old man with limited time left asks "Would you honor me with your bite?" How ANYONE could watch that and not be moved to an emotional melt-down I just don't know. The utter confusion reigning then in Randall's expression when he declines is just acting on another level altogether.James Spader who is consistently one of the most repulsive of actors (maybe thats his talent?) in a litany of warped and twisted roles plays the corporate climber not just happy to take Randall's job, but his friend's wife (smallish role for Nelligan) as well. The washroom scene where Nicholson announces simply "Just marking out my territory" was worth seeing alone!Many have complained bitterly that the finale descends into a "typical b-grade werewolf movie." Jeez, they ARE WEREWOLVES for God's sake what did you expect Nichols to come up with? a fight to the death with mouse pads? The absolute last scene where Pfeiffer's eyes morph into the wolf was an inspirational touch. Easily one of HER best films!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While driving through Vermont, New England, the middle age chief editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) hits a wolf with his car. He stops the car to drag the animal out of the road, but the wolf is alive and bites his hand. He goes to the doctor, takes rabies vaccine and the doctor releases him.Will is under stress in her job since the publishing house where he works has been bought by the tough millionaire Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) and the employees are expecting downsizing. Will is supported by his wife Charlotte Randall (Kate Nelligan) and his colleague and assistant Stewart Swinton (James Spader).Raymond invites Will to a party at his manor and he offers an unwanted job position in Eastern Europe to him and he learns that he had been betrayed by Stewart, who will occupy his position in the publishing house. Will also meets Raymond's rebel daughter Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer).On the next morning, Will Randall goes to his work and learns that he has acute senses and he feels more competitive and decided to fight for his job. Further he discovers that Charlotte is cheating on him with Stewart and that Laura and he are in love with each other. But Will Randall is becoming a wolf and his transformation changes completely his life.I saw "Wolf" for the first time in 1994 and yesterday I saw this film again and I found it better and better than the first time that I saw it. The story perfectly combines drama, horror and romance, with Michelle Pfeiffer very beautiful and a great dispute among the characters performed by Jack Nicholson, James Spader and Christopher Plummer. The conclusion is open to interpretation whether the wild side of Laura Alden is transforming her or the sexual intercourse with Will Randall. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Lobo" ("Wolf")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wolf is not your average Wolfman remake, but is an outstanding film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing better than the original starring Lon Chaney. There is no two ways about it. This film is however outstanding. The plot centers on Will Randall (Nicholson), an aging, past his prime publisher, who is struggling to keep his job as Chief Editor at a publishing house which is being taken over by a wealthy investor name Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer.) His marriage is also on the skids and he is contending with a pompous, brown-nosing, sleazy protégé (Spader) for his future at the publisher. While on a business trip to retain a client on a snowy road in Vermont, Randall hits a wolf and is bitten. After his encounter and assurances from his doctor Randall notices heightened senses and finally gets a hold on what is going on in his life. Along the way he meets a mysterious and interesting woman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and seeks the advice of an alternative healer (Om Puri.) This movie is not terribly scary or really very horrifying, it portrays the wolf as being like mankind, "...evil if the person who is bitten is evil..." And in the dog-eat-dog world of business, really speaks about the urban jungle that is work and business every day. (Who are the real monsters? Werewolves? Or is it the people who wear suits and decide the destinies of people who work in corporate America?) Action comes in at points in small doses and culminates in the end with a final showdown. Overall the makeup was good; it was reminiscent of the classic, and done in the spirit of being an good homage to the original, and thankfully, it didn't come off as too campy. The dialogue was fair and what little profanity there was didn't seem necessary. Overall, a good film, I like to watch it from time to time. It will be too slow for viewers who do not appreciate a more dramatic thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetic horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw 'Wolf' at the movies when it was first released in 1994, and was left a little bewildered as to why a prominent A-list director like Mike Nichols had reduced himself by making a horror entry. Was it to get industry respect? I didn't think so. Was it for financial reasons? Who knows. Or was it just to see if he could pull it off? Whatever the reason and apart from my own bewilderment I was entertained by 'Wolf'. It is a good example of what an established director with access to big stars and studio money can do with a genre that is more used to one time directors, young and enthusiastic but amateur crews, and casts that, well, maybe nobody has ever heard of before. I think the film's success owes itself to an excellent script by Wesley Strick and James Harrison, firmly rooted in a specific time and place, that is present day New York City. The supernatural, when it occurs, is therefore not difficult for the audience to believe, as if the characters may be wishing for it in order to have some respite from their painful and monotonous lives in the everyday world. Jack Nicholson plays Will Randall, a publishing executive reaching middle age. Due to a company takeover, he is coming to accept the fact that his services may no longer be required by his new boss, a millionaire media mogul (played by Christopher Plummer). On a lonely stretch of road at night, with his car broken down Will is attacked by a wolf and bitten. This is the opening scene of the film and on the cinema screen it looks spectacular. The night photography is beautiful and the actual attack made me literally jump out of my seat. Will gains a new lease of life; he feels physically and mentally stronger; his hearing and sight become acute. He no longer accepts being thrown onto the scrap heap by his new boss and decides, after a fashion, to fight back. Romance comes his way in the form of Plummer's daughter Laura, (Michelle Pfeiffer) a sad, rich and attractive girl who finds it in her heart to nurse him as he turns into something that is no longer human. Will's plight is not that he will lose his humanity, but that he will regain his primeval need for survival in the corporate world of American business. This is not that he should survive the concrete jungle but that he save his own soul and reach a better understanding of God and the qualities that make him a unique human being. The work by Italian cinematographer Vittorio Storraro, and a distinctive soundtrack by Ennio Morricone both make their presence felt as background to the chemistry between Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Their respective emotional dilemmas as individuals are contrasted with the dreary presence of Plummer, one of those people with a great amount of savvy in business but a character who represents our collectively repressed imaginations. He is stiff, unyielding and unable to show any love for his daughter A pivotal scene where Will scares a horse with a cigar which Plummer has offered him and which he smokes, shows Plummer to be in possession of his faculties but sadly ignorant of the natural world around him. To say any more would be to give the plot away. I found 'Wolf' to be a strangely poetic experience. It's not horror of the in-your-face variety. I would call it 'intellectual' horror as I suspect it was made for the chattering classes rather than the gorehounds in an attempt to make the genre more respectable. Nevertheless it's a good film and will appeal to those who love horror movies as well as those who like to think their tastes are more discriminating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best when it's an ageing man's revenge fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a man of a certain age, I sympathise with Will Randall. There is no place for him in a newly merged business, and his protegé is not only scheming to get Randall's job but having an affair with his wife for good measure.As you feel middle-age creeping up on you, it would be wonderful if by some miracle you could regain the energy, daring and physical prowess of youth. Randall is granted this miracle, but at a price - he has to be prepared to turn into a wolf by the next full moon.The film is at its best when we see Randall taking the world by horns, asserting himself and commanding respect from people who had dismissed him as an ageing has-been (and taking a much younger lover). He even gets to literally urinate over his obnoxious rival.Unfortunately the climactic scenes become a gory melodrama straight from a Hammer film. A decent build-up of suspense and mystery is let down by a drawn-out fight between incipient werewolves.Jack Nicholson gives an excellent performance as Randall. Initially horrified by his changing nature, he comes to revel in his new powers until he realises there is no way out. Christopher Plummer exudes a refined, quiet menace as the media tycoon. James Spader makes his character truly despicable, and Michelle Pfeiffer is a touching heroine.Overall I would say this is worth watching but the early scenes are the best.</fullReview>

Maybe some of you need an academy or the AFI to tell you when a movie is truly great.This movie is the only movie about werewolves that I have ever enjoyed. The rest of them absolutely bore me to tears, as do most horror movies.Jack is great but Michelle Pfeiffer is even better. James Spader is also a stand-out. But the true star is perhaps Mike Nichols whose direction and allegory are tantalizing and sumptuous. Definitely a movie for the thinking man or woman. The script is taut and true and insightful.I wish Mike Nichols made more like this. His best movie since "The Graduate". Actually I like it more. 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had forgotten what a terrible film this was. Just re-watched it, and in the beginning, I thought maybe I was wrong, but halfway through the wheels fall off. Werewolf movies all generally tend to suck from a technical point, and frankly I can't believe anyone is commenting good or bad, when you consider, the trainwreck of a screenplay, along with the usual mediocre performances of Pheiffer and Spader. Let's give them both more roles that could go to actual actors, if we keep casting them they'll have to learn to act at some point.I see in the trivia that they had to re-shoot the third act. I have to wonder how bad could it have been? I always assumed that at least 3 directors worked on this. I can't believe it was one director.I feel sorry for Jack, who seemed be having a midlfe need to re-visit the world of Roger Corman. Had he only know that he still had quite a few great performances left.The moral of the story: If you want to revisit Corman, then revisit Corman..himself. Don't try and do camp with Mike Nichols. And truly, there is only one role suited for Spader, the re-make of the Prisoner, because no matter what the role, Spader does Patrick MacGoohan in the Prisoner. It's all he can do. The pinheads have remade every other TV show...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy, overblown werewolf effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Returning back to work after an accident, a publisher is suddenly endowed with a strange series of powers and abilities from the encounter and gradually realizes he's become a werewolf and must keep it in check before harming others.Frankly this one turned out to be quite enjoyable is problematic effort. When this one works is basically in the first half here, as this here is when it builds all the details about his affliction and condition turning into his real-life with the outburst of hair, the main change in attitude and overall personality change into being more ruthless and vindictive towards others as a result of this, and along with the sensory enhancements it paints a rather intriguing air while subtly hinting at the change. Due to this set-up, the early scenes of the transformation come off nicely as the deer attack out in the woods or jumping the hoodlums mid-change while in the park serve as fine introductions to the change, and coupled with the growing evidence really completes the picture. That also manages to make the big action- packed finale quite fun as there's a large, drawn-out brawl here through the barn and gets quite bloody as well. These here help it out, although there are quite a few problems here. The majority of these flaws here come from the film's inability to come to terms with what it wants to be, as the classy nature of this one is really troubling by holding down the true horror nature of the story. It really holds back here on the creature, both in the make-up and the creature' overall behavior as the wolf make-up is slightly haphazard with contact lenses and splotchy hair around the edges of his face being the only signifiers of the change which looks utterly lazy as a horror film while being too dark for the mainstream crowd. There's even the lame behavior of jumping around on wires for just about anything here resulting in superhuman leaps for an all-around weak main creatures that's all based on not appearing too controversial for the mainstream crowd, as if it's apologizing for being a horror film. There's not a whole lot of good will associated with a film if it doesn't accept what it really is, and is what really harms this one the most here. The last flaws here is the bland, unappealing pacing here that really doesn't offer much as this is mostly filled with utterly bland subplots, a really bland romance that unravels quite slowly that it really takes forever to get anywhere and never set-ups up too many horror scenes here in this section by keeping the whole thing downgraded in favor of these other elements that turn it away from a horror film. There here are what really hold this one back.Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence and mild violence-against-animals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the mentality of the werewolf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) hits a wolf while driving on a snow covered road. As he checks on the animal, it bites him on the hand. Will's job is in danger when the publishing house gets taken over by wealthy Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer). His underling Roy (David Hyde Pierce), protégé Stewart Swinton (James Spader) and author Maude Waggins (Prunella Scales) all vow to support him. Alden demotes him to eastern Europe while giving his editor-in-chief job to Swinton. It turns out that Swinton had pitched vehemently for the job behind his back. Will is tired and meekly accepts his fate. Then he starts to change. His heighten sense of smell uncovers his wife Charlotte (Kate Nelligan) cheating with Swinton. He starts a relationship with Raymond's daughter Laura (Michelle Pfeiffer) with Raymond's disapproval. He seeks out Dr. Vijay Alezais (Om Puri)'s help with the animal spirit possession. With his new powers, he takes revenge on Swinton and his wife. When his wife turns up dead, Detective Bridger (Richard Jenkins) investigates.Director Mike Nichols is trying to dig into the mental transformation of the werewolf character. On the surface, this could be fascinating with Nicholson being so obviously wolf-like. Pfeiffer is not winning in this sour role. Spader is as always sleazy. Plummer gives a run-of-the-mill effort. Nicholson is bitten with the opening credits and his transformation isn't as compelling as it should. Horror fans are probably bored with the first half and unimpressed with the weak effects. On the other hand, Nichols fans won't find the acting that special. Nicholson peeing on Spader is a nice move. The movie is too long. The tension and the dread isn't there. I don't sympathize with anybody here. It is fun to see David Schwimmer in a small role right before he gets Friends but not much else is fun in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical 90's Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is what's to be expected out of a werewolf movie made in the middle of the 90's. It's not a horrible movie. I thought the acting was above average and the casting was terrific. I also thought the director did a relatively decent job of developing each character throughout the story for them to sort of clash at the end.It has its downfalls as well, however. The special effects were very hokey which is understandable coming from a movie made in 1994. I also found it extremely predictable. I had every twist and major piece of this movie figured out before they ever even happened and I wasn't even watching the movie with a real clear head.Overall a decent rental if you're into these types of horror movies. Parts of it are slow, but it generally keeps a decent pace. Good movie, but nothing to rave to your friends about, that's for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson Plays a Werewolf!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone wrote a comment that ended with this passage; Yep.I like this movie. It's fun to watch and it's great to see Nicholson act like the animal we all really think he is but don't dare to find out. That sums it up pretty much. James Spader plays a tough pretty boy who gets punked by the infected Nicholson and even though I like James Spader that was fun to watch. And the lovely Michelle Pfifer was worth howling over as Jack Nicholson proved in the movie. Although the script was nothing new or spectacular the starpower brought it over really well. Also it was good to see a horror movie that didn't rely to heavily on gore and blood as so many werewolf movies do. I recommend this movie to all Nicholson fans who have'not seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much Jack and not enough Wolf.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are expecting to see a really good wolf-man film, this isn't it. It seems that directors want to put Jack Nicholson in a movie because he knows how to look weird and expecting some sort of real magic to happen. The wolf-type scenes weren't done very well because the stunt doubles didn't look enough like the actors, so this blunder pulls you out of the story. At times, you wonder who that is and then realize it must be the stunt double. The backdrop to the wolf part, with the story of the publishing company and the idea that in modern types someone would openly let their employer know they intend to take clients with them is laughable, with no mention of a lawsuit. This is lazy writing. Another example is the lazy one dimensional writing for the publisher's daughter who seems to have no life and just hangs out at her rich father's home. The daughter in her mid-30s would have more depth to her character by then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wolf is a lame movie and should have stayed away from the werewolf angle. Jack Nicholson gets sideburns and fangs and all of a sudden he is a werewolf..Thats lame. Nicholson is a publisher who is bitten by a wolf and instead of feeling pain, he feels good and discovers he can pick up scents and hear things very well. He uses this to his advantage in the world of publishing but the movie goes nowhere. It should have been a horror film..instead it's a drama with a wolf in skin metaphor and how i's dog eat dog in the world. When a full moon hits, Nicholson runs through the night and almost everyone is safe. This wolf isnt menacing at all. He has a little love affair with Michelle Pfeiffer which feels out of place. Mike Nichols could have made a way better movie. Instead we get this half baked flick in which Nicholson's stunt double should have gotten his name in the the titles. Everytime Nicholson runs. it's obvious it isnt him. *1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't do much for me, a bit of a wasted opportunity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wolf starts as New York book editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) is driving through New England when he run into a wolf, he gets out to see if the wolf is still alive &amp; it is because it bites him on the hand &amp; then runs off into the woods. Soon after Will starts to notice changes, the area around his hand wound starts to grow hair &amp; his senses suddenly become exceptional including not needing glasses to see anymore. The publishing company he works for is being taken over by Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) &amp; he is fired to be replaced by his protégé Stweart Swinton (James Spader) but the usually mild mannered &amp; meek Randall suddenly develops an aggressiveness as he fights to regain his old job...Directed by Mike Nichols the main question I ask myself after watching Wolf a few hours ago is 'why?'. The script by Jim Harrison &amp; Wesley Strick is a strange mixture of horror film, black comedy, drama &amp; romance which don't really come together that well. There's the plot where Randall is bitten by a wolf &amp; starts to turn into a Werewolf himself, there's the plot about Randall losing his job&amp; using his new found aggression to get it back, there's the cheesy romance between Nicholson &amp; Pfeiffer's character's as well as some emotional turmoil revolving around Randall's wife having an affair. At times it felt like I was watching three different films but starring the same people. According to the IMDb's 'Trivia' section the release of Wolf was delayed by about 6 to 8 months so the entire third of it could be completely re-shot &amp; I am convinced this is true as it explains perfectly why none of the story threads &amp; plot lines come together that well &amp; it just fizzles out into a standard 'bad guy gets killed &amp; the hero &amp; his girl live happily ever after' type ending which I imagine the studio heads at Columbia Pictures insisted on, it would be very interesting to find out just what the original 40 odd minute final third was &amp; what happened in it although I doubt we ever will. At over 2 hours in length Wolf is far too long, it's a tad dull as well as there's not much wolf action in it. I suppose the moral of the film is that we all have a bit of animal survival of the fittest type aggression in us &amp; we shouldn't be afraid to use it to our benefit, &amp; why not! Still, at over 2 hours this bored me &amp; not enough happened.Director Nichols doesn't do anything special here &amp; the film is rather bland, lifeless &amp; dull. There's no style here, there's nothing scary, there's no tension &amp; the tacked on re-filmed twist ending is rather predictable. As already noted by many it's ironic that some of the best special make-up effects guy's in the business at that time worked on Wolf including Rick Baker who did the groundbreaking effects on An American Werewolf in London (1981) &amp; George Lucas' special effects company ILM yet they were brought in to created obviously very low key effects that the likes of Ed Wood or Al Adamson would have done due to lack of budget. For instance when Nicholson turns into the wolf all the effect consists of is large bushy sideburns, contact lenses &amp; plastic fangs. It's all rather underwhelming &amp; uninspiring. Forget about any gore as there isn't any &amp; there's no nudity either.Apparently this had a budget of about $70,000,000 which I find astonishing, Nicholson was paid a nice tidy $13,000,000 &amp; I suppose 40 odd minutes were junked &amp; totally re-shot but even so 70 big ones sounds like a lot of money to me considering what ends up on screen. This has a decent cast including Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer &amp; James Spader while British viewers may notice Prunella Scales from Fawlty Towers (1975 - 1979) in a small role.Wolf is an inexplicably big budget horror film without much horror, it's plot is loose &amp; doesn't really come together in any satisfying way at the end. I was disappointed. But I'll get over it so don't worry. Watch a decent Werewolf film like An American Werewolf in London again instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The worm has turned and it is now packing an Uzi."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson plays a middle-aged book publisher, bitten by a wolf during the full moon, who undergoes a physical and psychological transformation just as his life seems to be falling apart around him. A different kind of werewolf movie but an interesting one. Nicholson does a good job, despite being somewhat miscast for the role of a nebbish. Once the transformation begins and this man starts to show his newfound wolf side, it's a role right up Jack's alley. James Spader is a treat as the sleazy villain. Michelle Pfeiffer looks as pretty as ever and has decent chemistry with the much-older Nicholson. The script is clever and fun. Rick Baker's low-key makeup won't please many horror fans but I think it was perfectly suited for this type of film. Really this isn't the kind of werewolf movie for the average horror fan who wants strong visuals and lots of violent action. It's not scary, either, in case that wasn't obvious. It's a werewolf movie for people who want something outside of the ordinary.I really liked this one and I gotta say I didn't expect to when I first saw it years ago. I'm not a big Mike Nichols fan. The kinds of films he made are not the kinds of films I tend to enjoy. I'm not saying they are bad films or that he was not a talented director. He made some classics that I did like to watch, although the idea of rewatching any of them is not particularly appealing to me. So, take my opinion on Nichols into account when I say that this is my favorite Mike Nichols movie. No, I'm not saying this is a better film than "The Graduate" or "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" or anything crazy like that. But I enjoy watching this movie more than any of his relationship dramas. The interesting thing is that, underneath the supernatural elements, this is a story about a man's mid-life crisis. That's exactly the sort of movie you expect Nichols to make, only this time the story is told in a less prosaic way by making it a werewolf movie with the subtext and dark humor that comes along with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A howling good werewolf movie, with Jack Nicholson as The Child of the Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"He was a killer, a thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survive." That, of course, is a description of a wild dog from the menagerie of San Francisco's great storyteller Jack London. But it can also be a successful book editor in today's wolf-eat-wolf world of big- time book publishing. In Mike Nichols' enchanted 1994 movie, Wolf, we meet a failing book editor, Jack Nicholson, who, sorry to say, would rather purr than bark. Because he's a goat staked out for the kill, meek and mild Jack is about to succumb to the claw and fang of the monsters around him -- not the gibbering ogres that hide behind bookshelves in editorial offices, and come out at night to hide author contracts, mix-up manuscripts and insert misspellings and inaccuracies in freshly proof-read books ? but assassins who can kill a career with an e-mail or fax. In his case, Nicholson has two creatures to deal with: the jackal- like James Spader, as vicious and as smiling a villain as one might find in a Grimm's fairy tale or an MBA executive program, and the nightmarish Christopher Plummer, the nastiest and most treacherous boss since Genghis Khan, the sort of corpse-eating, bone-crunching sneak who gives hyenas a bad name. Both actors are at the top of their game, and it's a delight to watch them work their nastiness.Fortunately for the Nicholson character, he gets bitten by a werewolf, and we all know what that means, kiddies.Like one of Jack London's canines on the prowl: "He became quicker of movement... swifter of foot, craftier, deadlier, more lithe, more lean with iron like muscle and sinew, more enduring, more cruel more ferocious, and more intelligent."All this without having to spend a minute on a tread mill or give up steak ("I said bloody rare!") . Sometimes there is justice in this world. As if this wasn't enough of a bonus for getting nibbled by a werewolf, he falls in love with a dirty-minded Little Red Riding Hood, the toothsome Michelle Pfeiffer. And his ill-wishers soon find out they've bitten off more than they can chew. Ingenious Mike Nichols has trapped the old werewolf legends ? as told in the Universal Pictures Lon Chaney movies ? and given them a new, giggle-filled twist. But if you have a feeling that we're not in tranquil Transylvania any more, you're right. This is New York City, where the pointy skyscrapers look like fangs against the midnight sky, and a chill wind at the stroke of 12 can suddenly come howling down Broadway. Even so, a newly minted werewolf in Gotham has appointments to keep and rivals to slay. And to do the job properly, he's now armed with useful new office skills, like the ability to hear whispered workplace gossip blocks away and a sensitive nose that tells him who's been sipping tequila at the breakfast table. However, he can't be a 9-to-fiver forever. A wolf-man needs to make time for fun, like one of Jack London's animal heroes: "But especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights, listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading signs and sounds as a man may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious something that called -- called, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him to come." As you might expect, evening is chow-down time in the Big Apple. But what happens in Central Park stays in Central Park, minus a hand or two.Blending chills, kills and giggles, Mike Nichols has created a marvelous tale for our time. And with the wondrous Jack Nicholson, who can be both blithe and bloodcurdling at the same instant, he has a creature any monster-maker would be proud of. Glorious special effects, great ensemble acting, and laugh-out-loud wit ? the sort of insightful and caustic comments that over the years Mike Nichols rewarded us with, like so many jalape?o-flavored candy bars -- make Wolf an engaging fable for grownups ... but one that you might not want to view just before bed-time; especially if you sleep with an open window with the moon shining down. (A tip of the old Davy Crockett coonskin cap to perennial best- seller Jack London, an acute observer of wild animals and wild writers, whose century-old canine heroes would do very well in modern Manhattan ... if it ever came down to the crunch.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer, James Spader, Kate Nelligan and Christopher Plummer star in this 1994 horror film. Nicholson (The Shining) plays Will Randall, an editor who soon gets bit by a werewolf. After his senses improve, he learns he's inherited the mark of the beast. Pfeiffer (The Witches of Eastwick) plays Laura Alden, a young woman he not only finds romance with, but turns out to be the daughter of his boss, Raymond (Plummer). Spader (Pretty in Pink) plays Will's co-worker, Stuart Swinton who competes with him for a higher position and Nelligan (Dracula) plays Will's wife, Charlotte who has an affair with Stuart. I've always liked this film and think it's underrated. Jack and Michelle are great in this and have good chemistry, Ennio Morricone's score is great as usual as well as Rick Baker's make-up effects. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While driving, Will Randall accidentally hits a wolf. When he gets out of his car to see if it's still alive, the wolf bites him. After this event, Will's senses begin to improve and he becomes more competitive. As he continues to change into a creature of the night, he must also deal with his former protégé Stewart trying to steal his job.The cast is all around very strong, Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer (both alumni of Batman films) have good chemistry and given these character's personalities, it's believable that they would want each other in spite of their age difference. James Spader is very good as Stewart, the character's dog-eat-dog attitude works well playing against Nicholson's more subtle confidence.The cinematography is very good, and the opening scene where Will hits the wolf has strong atmosphere. The score isn't one of Ennio Morricone's best, and it's not the kind of score that's easy to remember after you're done watching the movie, but it's still pretty good and effective during the film.My biggest issue with the movie is the werewolf makeup. There isn't enough to it, and it just makes those who wear it look like feral men rather than monsters. I was surprised to find out that the special effects were done by Rick Baker, who had done far more impressive work on An American Werewolf in London. Keeping Nicholson and Spader in makeup rather than just having an animatronic or someone in full costume was a good idea, but the way it was handled was too restricted.The first half of the movie is a bit stronger than the second half, with the slow buildup of Will's changes being the best aspect after the performances, but the second half is still good, even if the werewolves look like guys with sharp teeth and 5 o'clock shadow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wolf is a sharp turn on the werewolf genre with an almost a biting satire on the boardroom politics of corporate America. Jack Nicholson is a publishing executive whilst driving in the woods he hits a wolf at full moon and gets bit by it.Jack is rather old school when it comes to publishing, favouring the talent of his writers and honing their skills. However his new owner has grander ideas which means making more money and promoting the more duplicitous and slicker James Spader as the new head.Nicholson realizes that there is something wrong with him when the moon is full. His senses are developing with a stronger and sharper sense of vision, hearing and smell, even animal instincts.He suspects his wife might be cheating on him, Spader might not be the friend he pretends to be, he attracts the attention of Michelle Pfeiffer the daughter of the new owner and cunningly plots a coup of his own.There is a thriller element to the plot as well as satire mixed with werewolf horror. Jack actually is a nice guy here, you root for him as he turns it around on his rivals. Spader is sleazy willing to use everyone and anyone and a ethical bankrupt.Wolf is a fun and interesting film in the werewolf genre where many other films have disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Werewolf Movie as Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a brief period in the earlier nineties, Hollywood started making horror movies for grown-ups, major directors producing a series of glitzy, big budget takes on classic monster movie archetypes. The wave started with Coppola's "Bram Stoker's Dracula," continued with Kenneth Branagh's "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," and concluded with Mike Nichol's "Wolf," which had no source material to take an author's name from. (I guess "Mary Reilly" counts too but we don't like to talk about it.) It's a traditional werewolf story steeped in Hollywood drama prestige.Literary editor Will Randall's life is stale. His marriage is mostly loveless and his boss is looking to replace him with a younger, more ambitious co-worker. Things begin to change after Will is bitten by a wolf while driving in Vermont. His senses improve, being able to smell details he never noticed before. He is more energetic and physically stronger. He even winds up starting a new relationship with the beautiful daughter of his boss. However, at night, he stalks around as a half-human werewolf. And then the bodies begin to pile up."Wolf" is the werewolf movie as character study. Mike Nichols isn't much interested in bloody horror action. Instead, he focuses on how Will's predicament changes his life. At first, his new status as a werewolf improves things. His cut-throat attitudes leave him better prepare to handle his downsizing. A literal animal magnetism attracts a new woman that looks like Michelle Pfeiffer circa 1994. Their sex life doesn't suffer any. When his nighttime adventures become bloody, it weights on Randall's mind. He angsts about the murder of his wife and chewing off a mugger's fingers. In the latter half, the focus is squarely on his struggle to contain the beast within. Nichols even uses the werewolf device to indulge in some satire. Randall literally marks his territory, scaring off his younger rival by peeing on his shoes. The movie's attempt to compare the business world or modern manhood with the world of animals has little effect on the overall story.The film's strength as a character study is mostly thanks to an A-list cast. By this point in his career, Jack Nicholson had started coasting on his reputation. He's more engaged then usual in "Wolf." Amusingly, the movie puts a leash on Nicholson's typical theatrics for most of its runtime. He does a good job playing bored domestic schmuck for the film's first half. As the werewolf transformations begin to affect him more, Nicholson allows more of his typical style to shine through. It helps that Nicholson has strong chemistry with a smolderingly sexy Pfeiffer. They first trade typical barbs at first, masking their mutual attraction with hostility. It's a little unbelievable how quickly the relationship progresses but, hey, that's movies for ya'.Another ace bit of casting is James Spader as the villain. His character is a boot-licking corporate ladder climber. He clearly has no concerns for anyone but himself even if he claims otherwise. His attempts to make nice are so obnoxious that you can't help but hate the guy. These qualities play to Spader's strength as an actor. In the last act, now afflicted with the werewolf condition, Spader cuts loose, dropping smarmy one-liners while casually tearing through minor characters. You honestly wish you could have seen more of Spader and Nicholson going at each other, two hammy actors competing to see who's hammier.Those looking to "Wolf" for typical monster movie thrills are likely to be disappointed. Rick Baker created gruesome, mind-blowing werewolf transformations in "American Werewolf in London." "Wolf" is a much more low-key affair. Nicholson's werewolf amounts to contact lens, fangs, and some hair on his face and hands. It invokes the classical werewolf style while also giving you a good idea of what Jack Nicholson would look like as Wolverine. Spader's werewolf form is a little more complicated, gaining a bumpy forehead. Nichols is obviously not comfortable working in the horror genre. The one attack scene, where Jack tears loose on some muggers, is awkwardly directed. He often punctuates the werewolf scenes with melodramatic slow motion. The climatic werewolf duel provides one or two decent moment, even if a wolfed-out James Spader wielding a pair of hedge clippers is deeply goofy.Helped along by an elegant Ennio Morricone score, "Wolf" proves a decently compelling film. It has one or two interesting takes on the werewolf legend while providing some good actors with solid material. Patient horror fans might enjoy it while Nicholson or Spader devotees are bound to get a real kick out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look in the bushes! Is it a dog? Is it a cat? No, it's Wolf, brilliantly portrayed by Jack Nicholson. By day, a mild-mannered senior editor at a book publisher who eschews pop culture for quality work; a man who would never publish such trash as "If I Did It" (You did it OJ, be a man and admit it). His job is being lost to a suck-up (James Spader) to the mega-media baron (Christopher Plummer) until he discovers his new powers that came as a result of being bitten by a wolf. Discarding his wife, who is having an affair with Spader, he hooks up with the moguls daughter, the luscious Michelle Pfeiffer, who he charms in the Jack Nicholson way.Now, I have to ask here, how does Nicholson get all those great lines to woo the babes? I remember when he used that famous "You make me want to be a better man," in As good as it Gets. Well, there is an equally great one in here: "I've never loved anybody this way. Never looked at a woman and thought, if civilization fails, if the world ends, I'll still understand what God meant." I am going to have to start collecting these to try out.The film had some great acting, some great writing and great music. I was really very watchable as horror flicks go - no nasty scenes.How does it end? You know that someone has to get bitten, and someone has to get their throat ripped out, but you have to watch it to see who.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood rendition about mythical werewolf with all-star-cast and grand production design</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grisly horror , thrills and chills in this enjoyable terror film starred by an excellent protagonist trio, Jack Nicholson , Michelle Pfeiffer and James Spader . Wolf is a creepy terror movie that have you breathless . Publisher Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) suffers a car accident when is attacked by a wolf as he has turned into a werewolf . Randall is developing an extraordinary force and to be aware himself there happened more than a crash and has a horrible curse who cannot to control . Will becomes a werewolf at each full moon and has to fight to keep his job against his competitor colleague (James Spader) . Then he undergoes a dental and hirsute transformation at the night and going on a murderous rampage every time the moon is full. He increases strength , heightened senses and unnatural sexual impulse and he sprouts hair and pointy ears . Inside every man there are two people-one good, one beast . Meanwhile , Randall is accused for his wife's (Kate Nelligan) death and fall in love with the gorgeous daughter (Michelle Pfeiffer , though Mia Farrow was slated to play her and Sharon Stone turned down the female lead) of his shrewd boss (Christopher Pummer) .This exciting chiller displays thriller , drama , action , suspense, terror , werewolves fights , a love story with mysterious touches and turns out quite entertaining . It's some different but with clear references to former films dealing with werewolves . Good performances from Jack Nicholson as a notorious publisher who is bitten by a werewolf and becomes one himself and the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer along with James Spader . This was the second movie that Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer made together after The witches of Eastwick (1987) and their first since Jack played the Joker in Batman (1989) and Michelle played Catwoman in Batman returns (1992). Very good support cast plenty of familiar faces such as Richard Jenkins as Detective Bridger , Eileen Atkins as Mary ,David Hyde Pierce as Roy , Om Puri as Dr. Vijay , Ron Rifkin as Doctor , Prunella Scales as Maude , Brian Markinson as Detective Wade and special mention to veteran Christopher Plummer . The transformation of man into werewolf is complex and made by expert make-up artist Rick Baker , creator in ¨The Wolfman¨ , ¨Men in black¨ , ¨Grinch¨ , ¨Gorillas in the mist¨ and many others . The notorious screenwriters Wesley Strick and Jim Harrison provide a well-knit plot with mystery and horror , giving full rein to Mike Nichols natural talent for the genre . Jack Nicholson had been trying to get this film made with his friend, writer Jim Harrison, for 12 years . Colorful and evocative cinematography by the Italian Giuseppe Rotunno . Rousing musical score by the great Ennio Morricone who composes a sensitive as well as thrilling soundtrack ; however John Williams was originally attached to compose the music for this film .This big budget motion picture was well directed by Mike Nichols (The graduate , Catch 22, Silkwood , Working girl , Regarding Henry , Closer) , though release was delayed for 6 to 8 months to re-shoot the entire third act . It's a nice terror flick and and turns out to be an acceptable attempt to cash in the werewolf sub-genre . Rating : 6,5 Good . Better than average and worthwhile watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A serious drama about werewolves. Who knew it could work?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once had the opportunity to watch this film on TV, but there was another one playing at the same time and I had to choose between them. Despite both seeming interesting to me, I decided for the other one. A pity; I don't even remember what movie that was, but I certainly won't forget 'Wolf'.Why is this movie so underrated? I read a critic say that 'Wolf' wasn't good because 'monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience'. There, I believe, lies the motive for the much underrate of this: everyone seems to watch it expecting a werewolf horror picture, and end up disappointed when they get something different. I guess people would also be disappointed in 'The Godfather' if they watched it expecting a 'Die Hard'.The movie creates an atmosphere that is lacking in many modern horrors, and has a decent werewolf fight scene, but that's it; all in all, the drama is prevalent throughout the film. Even the werewolf point is done in a dramatic angle. People forget, but the werewolf tale is not just about a guy becoming a monster at night. It is about a man becoming an animal and slowly acquiring its traits (the night transformation being just the culminating of this). An animal is not only more feral, but also more cunning and sensitive to everything around him. An animal is not tied by our society's values/morals but by those of nature itself; this side of the werewolf is rarely put in play, not being as 'exciting'. The story of a man (Jack Nicholson) who faces a crisis in his life, struggling to keep on top of his business is what dominates this film. The werewolf aspect is subtly done in changes of his personality; he becomes more cunning, using dirty tricks in order to keep himself on power, becomes more possessive/attentive to everything and more lusty (acting on his attraction to Michelle Pfeiffer).The movie is perfectly directed. Mike Nichols, whose works I am not much of a fan (only other movie I liked was 'The Graduate'), never lets the movie fall down fully on horror territory and manages to keep the dramatic aspect engaging through well chosen shots. He is a very good drama director, admittedly.The acting is superb. Jack Nicholson as the wolfman is surprisingly subtle, never fully going in the crazy-mode he is so used to, but making his character believable (while keeping Nicholson's trademark witty and mild manners). Michelle Pfeiffer is also very good, not only looking splendid (she looks younger than she did in 'Age of Innocence', for example) but also having great chemistry with Nicholson even if their relationship never really felt very convincing to me. James Spader, too, really shines as Nicholson's machiavellian antagonist.Complete with an Ennio Morricone music, very good make-up for the transformed wolfmen, and a somewhat unique ending, this is one great hidden gem of a movie. Just don't make the mistake of expecting an horror picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2/3 of a very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of this movie, built around Jack Nicholson's slow and reluctant realization that he may be becoming a werewolf, really sparkles. Jack's performance, as a slightly grungy middle-aged everyman caught up in an absurd and increasingly frightening scenario, makes the first part of the film compelling viewing. Act II introduces the charismatic Michelle Pfieffer as a rich bad girl, upon whom Jack becomes increasingly dependent as his condition begins to spiral beyond his control. As in any good horror thriller, secrets then come to light and the unknown and previously unthinkable begin to intrude into the contemporary world.The finale, however, is a disappointing mish-mash of action thriller clichés, ie. fights, chases etc. and serves as a classic example of Hollywood's now lost capability to properly script Act III in a modern action movie. It's a shame, as it lets down a strong Act I and a pretty watchable Act II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's bark is worse than its bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wolf has some appeal, but it never hits you on a striking level Despite potential, a great director, and cast, nothing ever quite works. The acting is sub-par and the characterization feel confused. The story is an awkward mix of drama, romance, and horror, and it is never really compelling in any of these. Some scenes are better than others, but overall, Wolf is too torpid to be a good movie.From the start Jack Nicholson feels out of place, but he is not at his worst. He plays Will Randall, an aging editor close to retirement (or loosing his job) Driving home one night, he hits a wolf in the middle of the road and when he goes to inspect, he is bitten. Suddenly his life is a lot less dull, as his senses become super strong, he begins to flourish once again in work, and he develops a relationship with his boss' daughter Laura . But her life is put in jeopardy when she is forced to hide him from the police and finds herself stalked by Randall's young ambitious colleague (and rival), who has been bitten himself and subsequently has become wolf. The role of Randall requires much emotion to be convincing, and Nicholson doesn't have it. He does not even look good as a wolf. Michelle Pfeiffer plays her character with a bit more of an eccentric personality, but her character is kind of hard to interpret. Who is she, where does she come from, is she the damsel in distress or is she a tough girl who must save not only herself but her man. As for James Spader, there it is just a case of really bad acting. The script is generally well paced except for the ending, which comes about as sudden, anti-climactic, and again out of place. For the most part, Wolf is just a clumsy execution of a good premise, which reduces the film from compelling to amusing, but watch it and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wolf is a lame movie and should have stayed away from the werewolf angle. Jack Nicholson gets sideburns and fangs and all of a sudden he is a werewolf..Thats lame. Nicholson is a publisher who is bitten by a wolf and instead of feeling pain, he feels good and discovers he can pick up scents and hear things very well. He uses this to his advantage in the world of publishing but the movie goes nowhere. It should have been a horror film..instead it's a drama with a wolf in skin metaphor and how i's dog eat dog in the world. When a full moon hits, Nicholson runs through the night and almost everyone is safe. This wolf isnt menacing at all. He has a little love affair with Michelle Pfeiffer which feels out of place. Mike Nichols could have made a way better movie. Instead we get this half baked flick in which Nicholson's stunt double should have gotten his name in the the titles. Everytime Nicholson runs. it's obvious it isnt him. *1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So this really hairy guy walks into a park....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually sum movies up with one scene. With this modern day classic, I'll use two. The first would be the now required-by-law, attempted mugging in Central Park scene. If the movie takes place in New York, chances are you'll see someone get mugged in Central Park. And yeah, you guessed it, it happens in that little underpass not too far from Columbus Circle. This scene is notable for it's startling accuracy in conveying the cunning strategies frequently employed by the thousands of muggers who run rampant in Central Park. Or so you'd think. Would you think twice about approaching some guy with yellow eyes and two-inch long claws, sharp teeth and a serious hair growth problem? I wouldn't either. And neither do our muggers. This scene had me laughing hysterically. Watch and see for yourself. The second scene shows a wolfed-out Jack scampering up a large rock, clad in what looks like a Kaspar three piece suit. Then he starts howling. If you ever want to see a movie that you're positive looked better on paper, this is a sure bet. This movie is for you if you want to laugh when you know you're not supposed to be. The music is bad and I love Ennio Morricone, but it sounds like he caught a stroke while he was writing it and they went ahead and played whatever his flailing hand scratched out anyway. Watching this, I wouldn't be surprised if Mike Nichols decided to stick a hot poker up his nose and pulled out his brain. *1/2 out of ***** (strictly for the laugh value and the cool wolf eye contacts they use)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Wolf"? Try "Turkey"....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I know the title of this review is lame, but it's the best I could come up with in a few seconds to sum up the cheesiness of this movie. I mean, I expected so much more from this. But in the end, it was just terrible.Jack Nicholson plays Will Randall, a Manhattan publisher who, while on the road one night in New England (which leads to many others always asking "New England?" when he explains what happened) hits a wolf. When he tries to drag it to the side of the road, it bites him (in the only jump scene in the movie) and runs off. Needless to say, he experiences changes, and realizes (a bit too easily) he is turning into a wolf. Michelle Pfiefer plays Laura Alden, the woman he meets at a party one night whom he falls in love with after his wife Charlotte (Kate Nelligan) has an affair with his coworker Stewart (James Spader). Of course, this all sort of becomes a soap opera as Stewart gets his job, Charlotte wants to be back with Will, and Laura becomes Will's only ally. Oh, and he goes out and kills people at night, when he turns into a werewolf. It almost seems irrelevant to note that, seeing as that the movie dwells on the more boring parts of the plot for the most of the movie.This really isn't that great of a movie. The acting is okay, especially from Nicholson and Pfiefer, and the supporting cast does fine, but that's about the only strength. The music is surprisingly muddled and ineffective, seeing as that it was composed by the ingenious composer Ennio Morricone. The action is sparse, and limited to the not-that-thrilling-but-okay climax. The love story between Will and Laura is awkward, seeing as that Will seems old enough to be Laura's father. And the conclusion really doesn't seem to make much sense. So, overall..."Wolf" is terrible. It's only a shame such a great cast was wasted in something this bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated! Truly underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time I saw Wolf more than ten years ago. I barely remembered anything more than Jack Nicholson's supercool performance. So, it was nice rediscover. If you take Wolf as a serious horror film you probably get huge disappointment. But if you take it more like a satire about back- stabbing-ass-kissing-sweet-revenge world we live in today, then you'll probably get huge enjoyment out of this.The story about strife between the two co-workers in the publishing house is cleverly mixed with the werewolf story. The dialog is witty and there are many cool quotable lines (I've been offered a choice between no job and a job no one would want.)As a pure horror film Wolf fails because it goes maybe too melodramatic at times and there isn't much shocking moments in it. Though the Gothic views over nocturnal New York were very classic horror moves. But as a satire Wolf works almost perfectly. And Wolf is one of the few movies that leave some questions unsolved but I feel satisfied about it (usually I want all the answers in the end).Overall, Wolf is enjoyable drama but not so much of the horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Old Fashioned Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really miss Michelle Pfeiffer. I'll always love Jack Nicholson and even James Spader and Christopher Plummer, but where's Pfeiffer been, lately?Wolf showed classic Pfeiffer. In fact, as much as I've loved her in many projects, her turn as Laura Alden in Wolf and as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in Batman Returns are her best and most delicious roles. Sure, she was great in The Fabulous Baker Boys, The Age of Innocence, Dangerous Liaisons and even Frankie and Johnny, but these two roles are my personal favorites.The reason I bring her up first is the simple fact she stole every scene she was in, even in a movie that's extremely top notch to begin with. Nicholson was great, as always ? and I thoroughly appreciated him toning himself down roughly twelve marks to play the meek Will Randall, but Pfeiffer's multilayered and selfish, though smart, gal Laura was the best.Wolf tells the classic tale in a classic way of the "good" man who's bitten by a werewolf and becomes the like. Classic is right: this movie has every bit the 1930s-1940s feel of the "Monster Movies" I grew up on. (Okay, meaning on TV or VCR; I'm not that old.)To prove this point, they get right to the point in the opening where Will's driving down a snowy and treacherous mountain road at night and inadvertently hits a wolf ? something apparently not common in Vermont. As all characters in these types of films, he investigates a little too close and gets bitten. And so the story goes?Will immediately notices changes and his soon-to-be demotion as editor in chief of a publishing house or his melancholy wife, Charlotte (Nelligan,) isn't helping. He does, in fact, get demoted or fired, whichever way any character takes it, at the house (ha, 17,000 acre palace) of the owner of the company, Raymond Alden (Plummer.) It's there that several significant plot points occur: horses fear Will and Will meets Alden's daughter, Laura.If I wasn't already wrapped up so much in the story so far ? namely the acting, character development, great cinematography, mood and score ? I would say this is where the movie really begins: with the introduction of Pfeiffer's Laura. She was stunning and breathtaking with her looks and character intensity ? but she only enhanced the already brilliant movie.Single-minded Laura feels Will would be attracted to her, but here Will shows his true "good-guy" antics by stating he couldn't possibly be: he's married. She's enormously impressed, as anyone would be these days.But, nevertheless, Will's wife is caught both without clothes and with the new and upcoming, job-stealing Swinton (Spader) due to power, youth, whatever and this leaves the door for the romance and cat'n'mousing to begin between Will and Laura.This is all incidental to what the movie's all about: Will's wolf-man transformation. Notice how I didn't say werewolf here, because even though that's basically what it is, they never ? brilliantly, I might add ? mention that.Probably because he really is turning into a wolf. And for anyone that really knows me, that's not my favorite type of werewolf movie, where a man becomes, basically, a dog. This is sole man-turns-into-a-dog movie that I like and it happens to be my second favorite werewolf movie, behind The Howling. Why?Well, for one, it contains plenty of exciting and low-graphic "wolf-man" scenes when Will runs amok. I say low-graphic (or toned down FX) as if it was Director Nichols's intention to focus more on story than fur, and I thought that was a splendid idea. (Also, I think I remember Nicholson saying way back during promotion of this film: why add more hair to someone who already has a lot of it ? or something like that.)Another reason Wolf ranks so high is the intrigue, the acting, the story, the feel/mood, the everything was so powerful and you get so wrapped up in the surroundings, you don't really need to see a man walking around with more hair than Zach Galifianakis.And finally, you'll get your fill with a (spoiler) wolf-on-wolf UFC grand finale. That, in combination with the night stalking bits, was enough to satisfy me in regards to the man-beast I grew up with.Barely a flaw was in Wolf. Spader might have been a little over-the-top and clichéd, but thanks to him (and a little bit from Nelligan,) Nicholson shined in spades. He was so amazing in his scenes, especially when barely a word was spoken. And even when they were (Tequila!), he was equally as enthralling, entertaining and humorous.If you like the old classics, here's a gem of homage. SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** After hitting a wolf, the first one seen in the wild in the state of Vermont since 1900, with his car on his way driving home to New York City publishing house vice president a concerned Will Randell, Jack Nicholson, tries to see what he could do to help the injured canine. All of a sudden the what at first look like a dead wolf came alive and viciously bit Will on his right hand.It's later at his job that Will begins to act and even look a bit strange with what is obviously the results of the wolf bite he received. Being ultra sensitive to smells and sounds with his eyesight now improved to a super sharp 20/10 vision the mild mannered Will also becomes violently aggressive, like the alpha-wolf who bit him, in what he wants on and off the job. This all doesn't go too well with Will's co-worker and rival for his job as vice president of his book publishing firm Stewart Swinton, James Spader. Swinton has for some time tried to get Will's job by working behind his back in getting his boss Raymond Alden, Christopher Plumer, to transfer him out to the firms Eastern European-a dead end job- branch! Beside that Swinton is also having an affair with Will's cheating wife Charlotte, Kate Nellign, who's looking to improve her lifestyle by hooking with the the young and aggressive up and coming star of firm.Will who was more or less willing to go along with him being transfered to Eastern Europe now becomes more then ever determined to not only stay on his job in NYC but get back at both Swinton and his boss Raymond Alder for trying to screw him out of it!Making a shambles of Alder and Swinton's plans for him Will also gets romantically involved with Alden's strong willed and beautiful daughter Laura, Michelle Pfeiffer, who had never gave him as much as a second look. It's in Will's not being intimidated by her it's my way or the highway father that strangely attracts Laura to him as well as his new found free spirit and love for the great outdoors. It's also Will's confrontation with that back-stabbing yuppie Swinton, in the firms mans washroom, that has Swinton soon take up the same wolf-like characteristics that he has. This leads to Swinton changing for the wimpish and gutless conniver that he is to a man of animal-like strength and murderous ferocity that he's soon to become. This sudden change in Swinton leads to the inevitable life and death confrontation that he has with Will at the climax of the film "Wolf".***SPOILER ALERT*** In "Wolf" the wolfish Jack Nicholson does one of the best interpretation of a wolf-man since Lon Cheney Jr did back in 1941. In fact Nicholson does it with a fraction of the makeup-job, as well as with no computer-enhanced special effects that Cheney did it with in his staring in the classic horror film of the 1940's "the Wolfman". In the end not only Will but Laura give up on civilization and end up in the wilds of upper New York State that now seem more at home to them then where they used to reside: The Big Apple. As for Swinton his reckless attempt to both murder Will and rape Laura backfired on him with him making it possible, by his vicious attack on Laura, for the two to get out of town and live together in the wilds that they now call home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best werewolf movies ever made, although I don't think it gets due credit for that. Nicholson is perfect in this role, and the dialogue is very witty and intelligent. Michelle Pfieffer has never looked more ravishing, and her performance is one of her best. James Spader is delightfully weird as Nicholson's antagonist, and the special effects are wisely kept to a minimum, making them more effective. Rick Baker's werewolf makeup is reminiscent of another werewolf classic, Werewolf Of London. The atmosphere brings back memories of old Universal horror flicks, and the film overall is tasteful and doesn't rely on gore or shock value, very refreshing for a horror film made in the last 30 years. Kudos to all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nichols Meets Morricone Meets Nicholson Shouldn't Suck, But It Does</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson can never deliver a bad performance in a movie. I've seen countless films of his and have enjoyed him the most in every single one. In Wolf, he delivers a monologue that made me crack up and applaud. In the scene, he is sitting with Michelle Pfeiffer, who is giving him a hard time and maintaining the awkward discomfort she knows they're sharing. So he says, "You know, I think I understand what kind of person you are now. You're very beautiful and you think men are only interested in you because you're beautiful. But, you want them to be interested in you because you're you. The problem is that aside from all that beauty, you're not very interesting. You're rude. You're hostile, sullen, withdrawn. I know you want someone to look past all that at the real person underneath but the only reason anyone would bother to look past all that is because you're beautiful. Ironic, isn't it?" Aside from that line, Wolf isn't much.Mike Nichols is the gifted director of The Graduate, Primary Colors, Closer, and many others. He has always been terrific at drum-tight pace, telling cinematography, and drawing whirlwind performances from his actors. Wolf is a handful of mud spattered on his pearly white resume. If it were another director, maybe someone with a more modest body of work, then it wouldn't reflect that badly. But when Mike Nichols is using the blurry, startling slow motion that you would normally see in some Z-list direct-to-video thriller, not to mention other terribly campy techniques, and having a screaming, crying elk eaten by Jack, it's like Rembrandt painting stick figures.Ennio Morricone's score doesn't help matters. I think he really fell off during the 1990s. Possibly the greatest film composer of all time, his lesser scores are in a way infectious and moving, but they have some recurring part that is almost unbearable. His score for Wolf is a prime example. It has a slow, building drama in its orchestral sound, but the effect is interrupted, once again like mud on the sparkling surface, by a jittering synthesized sound reminiscent of the sounds made by the gadgets and gizmos in a mad scientist's lab on a really bad old sci-fi film.Christopher Plummer, another fine British actor whose American accent is impeccable, Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays herself and plays her well, and James Spader, a brilliantly drunk-with-pride villain, all add a little. Wolf is not a terrible movie, but by the standards it sets with its promising credentials, it's a breach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOLF is worthwhile just to watch JACK NICHOLSON have fun with the character of a man who has been bitten by a wolf and begins taking on the abilities (and some additional hair) of the keenly aware animal. He shows with a flair of his nostrils that he's assuming a new self awareness and sense of smell that comes with developing animal traits. That takes up about the first half of the movie.It's when the plot goes into overdrive that we get into trouble. We witness him outsmarting a phony co-worker (JAMES SPADER, who seems to specialize in being nasty), and watch how he manipulates his boss (CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER) with his new skills.It's a fascinating idea but doesn't get full development in the screenplay once the wolf has made its mark on Nicholson. Instead it becomes increasingly apparent that the writers were running low on ideas and the story was getting just a little too preposterous for comfort.Still, if you're a JACK NICHOLSON fan, you owe it to yourself to see this one. MICHELLE PFEIFFER makes good eye candy but not much else can be said about her acting skills here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leave it to Mike Nichols to put a new spin on werewolf movies (as it was, when we first watched "Wolf", we didn't know that Nichols was the director; when his name appeared, my parents explained that he did "The Graduate"). Driving home one night, editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) accidentally hits a wolf. Getting out of his car to look at it, he gets bitten. What happens over the next few days is what makes the movie unique: Randall's senses of smell and hearing become very strong, just like they would be for a lupine. And then...well, you can probably guess what happens.What also distinguishes "Wolf" from other such movies is that it's not all about blood and guts, although there is some violence. It's more about how Randall deals with these changes in himself, wondering how long he can hide it from everyone. Also, a wrench gets thrown in the works because of what happens in Randall's personal life: he gets fired from his job and starts having an affair with his boss's daughter (Michelle Pfeiffer).All in all, this is a triumph for all involved. It's no surprise that Mike Nichols does a masterful job directing. Nicholson is mysterious and sardonic as ever, and Pfeiffer is better than usual. James Spader really gives the feeling of a yuppie, brought in to replace Randall. Also starring Christopher Plummer and Kate Nelligan, and even a very young David Schwimmer.Anyone ready to howl at the moon?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will there ever be a sequel ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having seen the movie many times because I thoroughly enjoy it every time I see it on cable,I have to ask myself that most obvious of questions-will there ever be a sequel? I have read all of the comments and not one person mentions that often dreaded word. Why is that? The movie was released in 1994-12 years ago-and since then Nada on a sequel. Does Mike Nicols want to direct the sequel to this marvelous film? Is Michelle Pfeiffer too busy with her children and other film projects to even want to do the sequel or is she merely biding her time until the right script comes a knocking on her front doorstep? After all, the ending of the film leaves the door wide open for a sequel- and a very good one too, I hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An publishing executive gets bitten by a wolf and starts experiencing life changing characteristics - however this might have its sideline advantages!What a strange film this is. Utterly bizarre in that it seems to want to mix boardroom politics with cheap horror stunts to the point that you wonder if you are not watching two separate films side-by-side!Michael Pfeiffer plays the big bad publishers daughter and this being a movie she naturally finds balding late middle aged Jack irresistible. After a few parts where she seems to be trying sadly she is slipping back in to her old zombie state again. Let me tell you something darling, not trying and crows feet don't mix. Just ask Glenda Jackson. I am not sure what this is supposed to be and I am not sure why it was made. The werewolf part seems almost incidental to the central plot and you wonder if it is just a novelty item thrown in to disguise what it really is - a very dull boardroom struggle film. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had not seen this movie for a few years. I couldn't remember much, but today I gave it a try and boy... What a blast! Maybe I was too young then (I'm 24 now) or else, but the thing is I absolutely love this film!!!!!. This a classic werewolf tale told for adults. There are no cheap tricks, no wooden acting, no unnecessary gore. This movie has a great cast, a stylish direction and a marvellous script. In a way is a Marvel comic for the adults brought in it's full glory to the screen. A man beaten by an animal and getting his powers (Spider-man anyone?): sharp smell, great strenght, well... you get the picture. Nicholson and Pffeifer make such a great couple. The lines they throw at each other are just wonderful (the kitchen scene is outstanding). Plus we have a Morriconne score...What else can we say? An overlooked gem! Comic-book buffs check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The thinking person's horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatness of Wolf is that it dares to examine the bitter conflict between age and youth in modern society within the context of the classic werewolf story. The result is a creative, thought-provoking film with superb acting and fascinating characterization.As a horror fan, I always appreciate seeing a genre film that boasts intelligence and does not scare its audience away with excessive violence. Some critics have complained that the same story could have been told with greater emotional impact had the werewolf action been excised, but I disagree. The physical transformations are symbolic of the psychological theme of the story - that our civilization has become so corrupt and inhuman that the only way to reclaim our souls is to return to nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is about chance to change.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply a great movie. I think most of us can relate to Nicholson's character, a character given chance to do things a bit differently.Sure, it has fantasy elements in it (the title does give you a hint), but basically it's still a story about man past his prime, middle-aged man, standing up for his rights. Reclaiming his spot in society. Grabbing for his chance to change, chance to revenge foul deeds and not go quietly into the night.The movie is very inspirational and Jack Nicholson plays the part to the perfection. So, embrace the wolf inside. Make the change!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ouch. Is it a postmodern Hollywood critique, a la Cronenberg of A History Of Violence? I mean, it's got James Spader in it, hasn't it? Well, no this is the last line of critical defence for this truly abysmal movie. Actually the acting is a fine example of blinkered Californian professionalism - Nicholson and Spader perform beyond the call of duty - and we get a couple of one-liner cameos from: future stars - Allison Janney is a posh party guest and David Schwimmer an NY cop; and untouchables - Prunella Scales has a quick scenery-nibble.The rest of the film is the very definition of risible. From misguided sequences involving Bambi's grandchildren to a whole host of technical fudgery that can't be tolerated nowadays: wobbly snap zooms, studio shots that don't dovetail with their location, co-opted footage that sticks out, ugly crossfading, obvious body doubles, Wonderwoman-style slo-mo... eurgh.These days you'd get away with all of that if the film had something in its content that showed the team had its artistic priorities elsewhere. But the existential implications are diluted and confused and the twist in the tail woefully mishandled. Rubbish. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Jack Nicholson is no Lawrence Talbot. In a way that's too bad because the original wolfman was trashy fun. This one is more ambitious and expensive, and it kind of loses its way.The first half is a treat, and is witty too. Nicholson plays his schleppy character, someone without daring or imagination. It's no wonder that his wife is bored with him and his boss is firing him. Not that he's doing a bad job as editor-in-chief of a prominent New York publisher, just that he shows no guts.After being bitten by a wolf one night, he begins to notice slight changes in his appearance and his character. (He checks it out with a doctor but otherwise treats these changes kind of nonchalantly, if you ask me.) For one thing, he sleeps most of the day and works best at night. His sexual appetite returns and he begins to get frisky around his wife again. It would be interesting to know a little bit more about the details of THAT. He can smell alcohol on someone's breath from several feet away. He can hear conversations on the other side of a window across a wide hallway. He walks more quickly, speaks more forcefully, and is overall more animated, so to speak. He even gets a neat-looking growth of new hair across his balding forehead, and he as he pauses to look admiringly at himself in the mirror, patting his belly with satisfaction, beaming at his new hair, he remarks, "And by the way, I'm not only the president of the Men's Hair Club. I'm also a member." His level of aggression rises too. He outwits the nefarious subordinate (James Spader) who's been plotting to replace him, and he blackmails his boss into rehiring him and giving him even more authority. And after sloughing off his unfaithful wife, he meets and mates with the boss's lovely daughter (Michelle Pfeiffer), who looks half feral on her own.The scheming and exploration of Nicholson's new personality are the best-written part of the movie. The rest of it gets kind of screwy, as if the writers had begun to run out of steam. Nobody seems able to determine what kind of movie this is supposed to be. Nicholson's wolfiness turns dangerous. He may have ripped the throat out of his errant wife during a gibbous moon. We KNOW he's chased down a deer and eaten the thing alive because he wakes up covered with blood, in an unpleasant scene.After he bites Spader, Spader begins to turn into a werewolf too, only uglier and meaner than Nicholson's werewolf. The two werewolves get into a dogfight over Pfeiffer and Spader is about to win when Pfeiffer appears on the scene and shoots him and kills him. (Where'd she get the silver bullets from -- the Lone Ranger?) Nicholson has now turned permanent werewolf and after a few friendly growls of thanks in Pfeiffer's direction he hustles off alone to join the rest of the werewolves in the forest. Somebody -- I forget who -- has also bitten Pfeiffer, which is understandable, and then she begins to morph into a wolf and leaves to join Nicholson in the woods where, presumably, they will live happily ever after and produce litter after litter of pups doggy-style.I can't help it if the second half of the movie sounds a little nutty. It has suddenly turned into a half-hearted horror movie with slashing fangs, a woman threatened with rape, Nicholson shaking frantically at the bars of his cage, a dead body in a pool, and similar inanities.None of the performances are at fault. Nicholson is pretty convincing as he gradually morphs. And Spader is great as the loyal friend who turns out to be a backstabbing phony. Too bad their efforts are put into a scenario that devolves into something that makes less sense than Lawrence Talbot's predicament.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can never go wrong with this movie's all-star cast and unique storytelling, film-making that reminds me a lot of a classic Stephen King picture. Jack Nicholson performance is well oiled, and does a fairly good job as the subhuman being. Jack's Eastwick co-star Michelle Pfeiffer rejoins him as a aloof and loveless woman who has manages to open her heart to the character and you can definitely see their Eastwick chemistry is not lost. The only thing that misses the mark slightly about the movie is Laura's brother. It is explained a little that he was a borderline schizophrenic and committed suicide.This is an excellent movie. Jack Nicholson has always been one of my favorite actors, and he was the perfect choice for this role. James Spader and Michelle Pfeiffer are captivating as well. Notice Michelle's yellow eyes and heightened sense of smell at the end of the movie. The action is non-stop and the special effects and wolf make-up are first-rate. Watch this movie and have a howling good time along the way.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The demon wolf is not evil, unless the man he has bitten is evil...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wolf" by director Mike Nichols can best be described as a werewolf movie for a mature and adult audience. And the director also managed to pull off an entertaining movie without resorting to gore, visual transformation into a werewolf and of course without young men running around without shirts.The story told in this 1994 movie is about Will Randall (played by Jack Nicholson), an aging publisher who finds himself bitten on the hand by a wolf that he accidentally hit with his car. And as young publisher Stewart Swinton (played by James Spader) snatches a job position from Will, he finds himself fighting for his job and also fighting a personal battle against the beast that starts to emerge within him.It is a nicely told story that progress in a good pace and it is helped along quite well by the performances by the cast ensemble, as well as the characters in the movie being quite detailed and nuanced. Jack Nicholson was really well-cast for this movie, given his charm and appearance. And James Spader also did add something good to the movie. Furthermore, then the cast list also included talents like Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Plummer, Richard Jenkins and David Hyde Pierce.I was especially impressed with how well the movie turned out to be, despite lacking the traditional transformation scenes from human into werewolf, which is usually seen in the werewolves movie genre. There were some scenes where there was a slight change from man into something more bestial. And that worked out so very well in favor of the movie. And it made the character look more bestial and added a good flavor to the movie.All in all, "Wolf" is not your average werewolf movie, and if you want a werewolf movie which offers more than just gore and visual effects then "Wolf" is a good choice. It does cater to a more mature audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not your typical werewolf flick, where out of luck publisher Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) has to deal with younger co-worker Stewart Swinton (James Spader), who snatches away both his job and wife. However, Will's energy and senses become stronger after being bit by a wolf. More than just a story about a human turning into a monster, the plot deals with the competition between Stewart and Will and the unlikely romance between Will and his boss' daughter, Laura Alden (Michelle Pfieffer), which gives this horror film a more unique story.The acting was good, especially the spellbinding Michelle Pfieffer and the calm yet cunning Jack Nicholson. Sound of Music star Christopher Plummer gave a nice co-star appearance. But, while the film's momentum goes fairly quickly, I thought the film lacks humor and overall charm, and I didn't find the overall horror elements of the film riveting. The drama of the film is good, but the horror doesn't quite grab your attention as other more conventional horror movies do.Grade C</fullReview>

Michelle Pfeiffer gives a good role and atmosphere is carefully created. but the basic tool is the imagination of public. because seems be a well - known story in another form. but something is deeply different. and that detail is the source of special manner to create tension in this case, a form of mixture between old Hitchcock and new Stephan King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released during the early summer of 1994, "Wolf" is an interesting werewolf tale about a an aging editor-in-chief of a publishing house in New York City -- Will Randall, played by Jack Nicholson. He gets bit by a wolf on the way back from Vermont and starts experiencing strange changes. Meanwhile he loses his high position in the company and is replaced by his ambitious protégé, Stewart (James Spader). And problems with his wife (Kate Nelligan) make him ripe for the affections of Laura Alden (Michele Peiffer), who's the daughter of the new owner of the publishing house (Christopher Plummer).As you can see, "Wolf" takes the werewolf legend and places it in modern New York, so don't expect the more Gothic ambiance of werewolf films like "Wolfman", "Curse of the Werewolf" or "Red Riding Hood". Also, don't expect the grotesque transformations of those films and others, like "An American Werewolf in London" and "The Howling" because "Wolf" plays that down. Yet this is still very much a werewolf yarn with the horror elements associated with it.The film adds a new twist to the werewolf legend: The bite of the wolf affects the person differently, depending on whether they're good or evil. As such, Will Randall's changes are positive for the most part. Even a certain horrific incident isn't actually a bad thing if you reflect on it (the clash in central park). Another character is infected by the curse and the changes are much different."Wolf" works so well because of its emphasis on character. This is not a mindless horror flick; it's a drama with horror touches. Will is a worthy protagonist in which the common man can relate. You can't help but root for him and this shows the difference between "Wolf" and most other werewolf flicks: The werewolf is the protagonist. This has been done before, of course -- for example, "Howling VI: The Freaks" (which is a quality installment in that non-series) -- "Wolf" just ups the ante in this regard.Michele is effective in her role and she certainly has a striking face, but she never tripped my trigger as far as allurement goes. She's just not curvy enough for my tastes. Still, she's very good in the role.James Spader's character is sort of puzzling. In some ways he's likable and seems to show some character, but he keeps contradicting this.Sometimes I couldn't help smirking at some of the werewolf antics, but -- hey -- it's a werewolf film, not "Terms of Endearment".FINAL ANALYSIS: Yes, "Wolf" is a worthy addition to the werewolf genre, but it takes the subtle route and focuses on story &amp; characters above the typical horror trappings, which is good or bad depending on what you're in the mood for. As for me, I like it.The film runs 125 minutes.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Nicholson and almost always can get by just watching him in whatever. This movie is weird though! Some of the dialog is so forced, stilted. It almost skips or staggers at some points. Very slow. It's unusual and what I can't figure out is HOW they got Jack to do it or WHY.Without spoiling it there is this one scene in the woods involving a deer that I just kind of watched in disbelief. I know it was the 90's but still.Then of course there is Michelle and her and Jack were really great together as you would expect and you can overlook that he's obviously old enough to be her dad and so on based just on how great the two of them are.But still I'll say (as a reviewer earlier) that I am one of those poor souls who is just to dumb to "get it" as far as this movie goes. Campy weird almost like a spoof on a horror movie at moments (I'm not a horror fan trust me) Then at other moments real dark and serious. It's almost like the movie couldn't make up it's mind what it wanted to be.If you like Jack watch it. Michelle is hard not to like so watch it. You like werewolves and want to see a superstar playing one, watch it. Have a few laughs with someone you know. It'll make for a strange evening.Yours FattyZ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timely spin on the werewolf story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOLF is, for the most part, a fun and engaging riff on the classic werewolf tale about an ordinary man who finds himself bitten by a wolf and before long ends up howling at the moon. It's slightly overlong, but benefits from great casting in the form of Jack Nicholson, who perfectly channels his lead's wolfish nature; out of all the actors working in Hollywood, Nicholson is the one you can truly believe has a bit of the devil in him.What I liked about WOLF is that it avoids being hokum for the most part. I like B-movies as much as the next guy, but it's nice to see something different and I loved the way this film explores the beast in man theme in a corporate environment. Watching Nicholson's developing rivalry with a slimy James Spader is particularly fine, culminating in that memorable gross-out scene in the men's bathroom.It's not a perfect film by any means, and some of it does drag a bit. The scriptwriters clearly didn't know what to do with Michelle Pfeiffer's perfunctory love interest and her presence is a little gruelling on the viewer's patience. Still, the excellent Spader helps to make up for that, and there are nice, if minor, parts for Prunella Scales, Eileen Atkins and Christopher Plummer. There's a lot of comedy, too, which works a treat.Rick Baker's special effects are a mix of good and bad. Nicholson's wolfman makeup is decent, but the animatronic wolves look like they belong in a little kid's film rather than an adult movie. And director Mike Nichols is clearly better at handling the dialogue than he is the action - all those slow-mo shots of actors jumping through the air gets a bit silly after the umpteenth time. Still, this is a highlight in a decade that was virtually defunct of decent werewolf movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michelle Pfeiffer in Wolf . Howl Howl Howwwlllllllllll !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wolf isn't your stereotypical werewolf horror picture; it's more a murky mystery with romantic tendencies. Wolf takes it sweet time progressing forward through its story although it still remains captivating throughout its slower pace. It teeters on the edge of boredom, and isn't overly interesting, but it stays good. Wolf has a very alluring aura. Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are strong and in their prime. Nicholson has reached a point where this lead role isn't overly demanding to him, not too vital towards his career, so he really allows his acting ability to rest easy, not acting all too strenuously. Through this he acquires some added strength, but in totality it's a far lesser performance as is often the case when actors attempt to explore their abilities in similar manners. Oddly enough, something strangely similar is going on with Michelle in her role. She too seems at ease, more comfortable in this part than usual. She looks like she's having a good time. Is perhaps Michelle in her own life arriving at the very cusp of some newly enlightened happiness? Or am I just detecting that undeniable sexual chemistry between she and Jack? Probably the chemistry. Whatever it is, it works, making for two rarefied performances. Jack plays the wolf in Wolf, but Pfeiffer is the one who appears primal. (Grrrowrrrrrrrrrr) When Michelle Pfeiffer comes on screen, Wolf gets a lot better, a whole lot better. All of the best parts are the scenes with Pfeiffer. Wolf has an entirely different feel when Michelle's on screen and she gives the strongest performance, steals the limelight, and manages the show on her own. She'll heighten your senses, alright. Everything that happens in this movie outside the moments between Nicholson and Pfeiffer seem faded as if from some separate realm, yet are still very serviceable. Wolf's mesmerizing. It's one good ass movie. I would love to see Wolf II starring Michelle Pfieffer, considering she turns into a werewolf. Where the hell is that movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After publishing executive Will Randall is bitten by a wolf, his life begins to change. First his mood changes, and his sense of hearing and smell go into overdrive. Will has become a werewolf and he has an appetite for human blood. His friend Laura wants to help, but she doesn't know what Will is yet. If Will's new problem wasn't enough to keep him occupied he must also contend with Stewart Swinton who is out to get his job.....It's another genius piece of casting, Nicholson as a Wolf. He has he features already, and the transformation is astonishing, even now nearly twenty years later.It's a great companion piece to watch with Coppolas' Dracula and Branaghs' Frankenstein, adult and mature horror movie that go for character study rather than scares.When we first meet Will, he's lethargic and almost finished, something Nicholson hadn't really done before. It soon changes, and he's given full reign to go bananas.Pfeiffer seems a little wooden in this, but soon comes alive during the final act, which is brilliant and haunting.Spades almost steals the film from everyone as the slimy sleaze all, and is really unnerving during his final scenes, the make up on him is awesome.Accompanied with a beautiful soundtrack by Morricone, Wolf isn't just a film about a Wolf, it's a film about a man redeeming his life and libido before his time is up.Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watched a lot of films concerning werewolves. In general not really creature flicks. This is, obviously, something of a different take on such, and it is certainly an admirable attempt. I just, I don't know, maybe it missed the mark. There is clearly going something on beyond the whole turning(which is handled fairly well, and this more or less succeeds in making something like that at least relatively believable and possible to take in for those not usually into that kind of thing... and those who might shy away from this thinking it'll be the typical entry, don't worry, you can tell the impact the director as well as its star had on this). Maybe that's the problem... in the end, Nichols doesn't know quite what to do with the wolf. The drama is interesting and reasonably engaging, but beyond that... well, some of it is good. If you look beyond what, at least to me(I am open to the possibility that it's just Mike's style that doesn't appeal to me), comes off as uninspired camera-work(those zooms serve more to distract the viewer than emphasize) and half-hearted editing that occur more often than not in this, it does have some to offer. Slow-motion never really works in this movie, in my opinion. The score is fine. The acting is pretty much flawless. The effects vary, though they're seldom all that convincing. Nicholson(who was just about perfectly cast) is his usual cool self, and I would not at all have minded more Hyde Pierce. The plot isn't bad, and definitely has moments. That describes the humor, what minimal amount there is, as well. There is a bit of violence/gore, and a moderate amount and tone of language. Those seeking horror will probably be underwhelmed, and the people expecting something else may be shocked by some of the content. I recommend this to folk in either or both groups who consider their open-mindedness to be of notable extent. Fans of Jack Nicholson and/or Mike Nichols may also want to grant it a chance. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Werewolf as Viagra (*SPOILER*)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is a good movie, not great but appealing because it follow s the genre formula to a T (checkout Universal's Wolfman1941) however, it manipulates the formula to deal with thematic issues of old age and difference.The movie starts with Jack Nicholson driving through the snow (an ironic twist on the Shining as the beginning of that movie starts with a road journey and ends with a snow scene). He hits a wolf and starts to check out whether or not the wolf is dead or not. It isn't. It bites Jack and runs off to join the pack that Jack now notices surrounding him. Jack drives offJack Nicholson plays Will Randall, an ageing editor at an old publishing house recently taken over by a tycoon (Christopher Plummer). He feels that he is going to be thrown on the scrap heap for a younger man but doesn't know who his replacement will be. It could be James Spader, his protege or David Hyde Pierce (breaking free from Niles) someone who seems to live in his office.Not only this but his marriage seems to be on the rocks, a suggestion that sex is the main reason, and the feeling that his wife is looking elsewhere for fulfilment.However, the wolf seems to have given back Jack his 'joie de vivre' again and at the same point Jack meets the daughter of Plummer, played by Michelle Pffeifer, just after finding out that he will be replaced because he is just not ambitious enough.The wolf spirit and Michelle Pffeifer seem to turn the clock back for Jack both symbolising his determination to LIVE not just exist. This draws parallels to Mena Suvari in American Beauty and (oddly enough) the young calf adopted by Billy Crystal in City Slickers. The odd thing is that all this does takes place in a Werewolf movie and the movie doesn't sacrifice the generic formula, a great achievement. Instead of seeing a man turn into a beast, we see a man revitalised (I will not draw any parallels to Viagra... no matter how tempting) and a suggestion that man should not deny too many of his animalistic urges.There are a few problems in this movie which detract from it. The ending is confused, as the actions of Michelle Pffeifer do not realistically reflect her fear of Jack earlier in the film. The other thing I have to say is the final showdown is nothing but disappointing there appears to be some confusion over whether to make the werewolves beasts or hairy men. I think that script re-writes are the problem here as I feel that the ending suggests that Michelle is actually the wolf at the beginning which bites Jack Nicholson but does not make this too clear.An enjoyable film that certainly re-uses a cliched formula to good effect but do not expect too much from the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Wolf-man Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wolf is not your average run of the mill movies concerning werewolves. The movie is reminiscent of the old Lon Chaney, Jr. film 'The Wolf Man (1941)' yet two stories are nothing alike. 'Wolf' is a unique kind of wolf-man film. It's nothing like 'American Werewolf in London' nor is it like the movie 'Bad Moon'. Wolf is a one of a kind werewolf movie that you would have to watch in order to get the full grasp of it's unique style and story.I love this movie - it is one of the best werewolf movies I have ever seen. And it is one of best movies that Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer has ever made - in my opinion. Both film stars are outstanding in this film. 'Wolf' is better than the comedy-drama 'The Witches of Eastwick' (which stars both Nicholson and Pfeiffer). - and I enjoyed WoE too.This is such an underrated but good werewolf film. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson movies are usually really good. But this is one that really didn't satisfy me. For its credit the beginning of the movie is actually pretty decent, but then it slowly goes downhill. It would be better if the movie focused more on horror then on romance between Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Despite good performances from Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer it doesn't really help this movie muchOne of the big problems is James Spader. Spader doesn't do anything that really stands out and it doesn't seem like he should have been cast in the role of the main antagonist . He isn't a bad actor but I don't think he fit this role at all.The Rest of the cast is pretty decent not really much else to say about that. But some of the characters don't have much too them especially Jack Nicholson's Wife in the movie played by Kate Nelligan. Nelligan doesn't give a bad performance but her character just kinda disappears and eventually *Spoiler Alert* is killed off, i honestly wish she had more of a purpose. Another problem is the movie is that it doesn't feel like a horror movie at all, the fact that Jack Nicholson is becoming a werewolf doesn't make it anything more then a Drama-Romance mainly set in the workplace. Overall I didn't really like it after the first hour after that the rest of the movie falls pretty flat. My Rating 4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Wolf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wolf- a thriller/horror/drama film that stars the two biggest movie stars in Hollywood back then: Michelle Pfeiffer and Jack Nicholson. The setting is fairly simple, a business man gets bitten by a wolf, who slowly changes into a werewolf, and along the way starts a romance relationship with his boss's daughter. Aside from fighting his wolf side taking over, he also has to juggle his business career and stop an employee form taking over. Wolf had never been in my interest but nowadays I like to watch werewolf movies and so I, Indiana Wolf, started an adventure for watching as much werewolf theme movies as I could. And years later, my search brought me to Wolf. The film is not what a action fan would expect because it is more story-driven rather than action-driven. I am grateful to watch a decent Werewolf film without stuff blowing up every second, so my warning to action fans is "Don't expect a Wolfman to pop right in your face!". The acting from Jack Nicholson is fairly exceptional and, in my opinion, he was the best actor in the whole film. Michelle Pfeiffer didn't satisfy me mainly since her role was such a big, fat cliché. She sucked more crap than James Spader did in this film. In relation to James Spader, he is a one of those guys who you love to hate in films, with the exception of Stargate, and this film has proved nothing but just that. The only reason I can stand him is because I know that he will eventually die for his shitty acting at the end of the film. The special effects are very unrealistic ad it is hardly used very often but when it is used, like the scenes where Jack Nicholson's character slowly changes into a werewolf or the part where he fights James Spader's character at the end of the film, the result is pretty unconvincing. The fights aren't choreographed properly because it looks like they are just jumping around biting the air. The ending was alright as well but I hated it when Pfeiffer's character revealed herself as the new werewolf, I absolutely hated it. The powers that the wolf-bitten get are quite amusing and fun to watch. Worn down and out of luck, aging publisher Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) is at the end of his rope when a younger co-worker snatches both his job and wife out from under his nose. But after being bit by a wolf, Will suddenly finds himself energized, more competitive than ever, and possessed with amazingly heightened senses. Meanwhile, the beautiful daughter of his shrewd boss begins to fall for him - without realizing that the man she's begun to love is gradually turning into the creature by which he was bit.My two favorite scenes were: the part where Laura Alden meets and finds out that Stewart Swinton is also a werewolf after being bitten by Will Randal. The other "great" scene was........mmmm........see, this just proves that the film will leave your mind after 30 minutes......I guess the first scene where Will gets bitten was quite good as well.</fullReview>

The lighting on her face is just superb.Jack Nickolson isn't really acting, he's just showing his true face.All that said, this isn't a werewolf movie. It's really about the heightened awareness of an animal, which is marvellously portrayed early on in the "tequila" sequence. And the recognition of one wild thing to another (Nickolson &amp; Pfieffer).Just a love story, then; "another vodka and tonic".For all you other wild things out there, you've just got to love the ending.</fullReview>

Supporting cast includes memorable performances by Kate Nelligan, Om Puri, Richard Jenkins and David Hyde-Pierce. The Animatronics being the worst part of the film, this film could stand a simple revision in CGI to make it a more thrilling ride. The story is simple but elegant in a world of publishers, writers and editors with wolves thrown into the mix. This is a definite watch for me when the moon is right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-appreciated take on the werewolf theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are quite a lot of werewolf movies out there and most of them just repeat the old pattern: Guy gets bitten, guy changes, guy turns, were guy goes postal, were guy gets killed. Wolf is a heck of a lot more. It's the tale of a struggling man of a temper a little to mild for his own good, who finds through the bane a new chance of standing his ground and eventually meets the special lady. We also have a great adversary who you really can hate. A spineless, backstabbing rat with an aggravating Yuppie face. And Michelle Pfeiffer in her prime, giving a fine performance. She looks truly stunning in this one. The fights are well choreographed and nicely executed. Along with the chase sequences they give a good animal look at the whole process and give the movie a richer look. It's a good story with great actors and a satisfying conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look in the bushes! Is it a dog? Is it a cat? No, it's Wolf, brilliantly portrayed by Jack Nicholson. By day, a mild-mannered senior editor at a book publisher who eschews pop culture for quality work; a man who would never publish such trash as "If I Did It" (Youdid it OJ, be a man and admit it). His job is being lost to a suck-up (James Spader) to the mega-media baron (Christopher Plummer) until he discovers his new powers that came as a result of being bitten by a wolf. Discarding his wife, who is having an affair with Spader, he hooks up with the moguls daughter, the luscious Michelle Pfeiffer, who he charms in the Jack Nicholson way.Now, I have to ask here, how does Nicholson get all those great lines to woo the babes? I remember when he used that famous "You make me want to be a better man," in As good as it Gets. Well, there is an equally great one in here: "I've never loved anybody this way. Never looked at a woman and thought, if civilization fails, if the world ends, I'll still understand what God meant." I am going to have to start collecting these to try out.The film had some great acting, some great writing and great music. I was really very watchable as horror flicks go - no nasty scenes.How does it end? You know that someone has to get bitten, and someone has to get their throat ripped out, but you have to watch it to see who.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light on Horror, Heavy on Drama, Wolf Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the writer of "Arachnophobia" and director of "Catch-22" and "The Birdcage" we have a tale of love, betrayal and canine appetite.Jack Nicholson hits a wolf on his drive through the woods and when he stops to check on it, he is bit. As his senses become more acute, he also learns that his protégé, James Spader, is usurping his job and sleeping with his wife. Nicholson fights back and lands a new lady (Michelle Pfeiffer) but things come to a head when Spader, too, begins to feel the curse of the wolf.If you rented this film because you wanted a horror film, you might come out disappointed because the gore is at a minimum and the entire plot could have been written and filmed without the wolf elements. You'll get some cool werewolf action, but that is not really the driving point of the film.However, if you're into dramas with James Spader and the ferocious (even without lycanthropy) Nicholson, you found a good one. As Nicholson's life becomes destroyed, does he sit back and take it? Of course not. As always, he becomes the master of his domain (in a slightly less insane way than many of his films).Spader is handsome, charismatic and powerful as the usurper intent on taking every last shred of Nicholson's life. While physically less imposing than Nicholson, his wolf persona is equally as fearsome. Nicholson delivers everything you've come to expect from the man with a few surprises thrown in.Pfeiffer is a more secondary character (Nicholson's love interest) but is actually the most unpredictable and dynamic. Her motives are unclear, and you may not know from one minute to the next if Nicholson can trust her. This increasing sketchiness culminates later in the film lending the relationship a level of suspense necessary for a good drama.The pace of the film is a bit slower and maybe a few minutes could have been cut, but if you're in a patient mood you might appreciate the build-up and suspense generated. Just don't go in expecting something the film isn't, or you might be let down. Also, there's a small appearance by David Hyde Pierce ("Frasier"), if you like that.</fullReview>

The writers did a great job of concentrating on how his senses become more and more acute as his transforms into the "wolf". James Spader's role is okay, but not too impressive. He is much better as an attorney in "Boston Legal". Michelle plays a sophisticated rich girl who finally meets the man who really understands her, a.k.a, Jack the "Wolf".

		<shortDescription>Nicholson's Hungry Like The Wolf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wolf" uses an interesting concept: that the corporate world is just as bloody as the animal kingdom.As the film opens, Will Randall(Jack Nicholson)is driving home and hits a wolf. While he's looking at it, he gets bit. What he doesn't know yet is that his life has changed the moment he's bitten. Randall is the top editor at a book publishing company which was just acquired by Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer). He is married to Charlotte (Kate Neligan), who is puts him down for not being to stand up for himself. His protégé Stewart Swinton (James Spader)acts like he's supportive, but is after his job. It is during a dinner at Alden's estate that Will is fired and his job given to Stewart. It is also during this dinner that he meets Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer), who seems to be unhappy with her lot in life.Then things get interesting.Will's encounter with the wolf gives him benefits: his sense of smell is so strong that he can smell alcohol on a guy's breath, even though he had drank it hours ago;his sense of hearing picks up conversations where his co-workers are talking about him;his sense of eyesight is so sharp that he no longer needs his glasses. It is also his new heightened senses discover that Swinton is having an affair with his wife. No longer a weakling, he retaliates by turning the tables on Swinton and getting him fired. Even Laura takes a liking to him (She doesn't like her father and neither does he, so they have that to build on).However, Will cannot contain the wolf. When the full moon rises, he transforms (There's a beautiful but creepy scene in which he hunts a deer). And things get even more complicated when his estranged wife winds up dead. Did he do it, or is there another wolf in the fold? Director Mike Nichols does an interesting interpretation of the werewolf mythology: it clearly benefits Will to be a wolf because he is no longer a weakling. The power allows him to become stronger in every way. He is able to survive in the corporate world by being an animal.All the performances are good. Spader is playing his usual smarmy, wormy self (Seems like a curse, just like the curse of the wolf!), but in this film he does it so well that you can accept him becoming a wolf: After all, Swinton IS "a wolf in sheep's clothing." He seems charming, loyal and sincere, but he will eat you alive to get to the top. The battle between Will And Stewart is what is faced in the modern world day after day: the old must fight the young in order to survive.The film drops in a few spots, but it still manages to keep you interested in the outcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of excellent talent gets wasted in this uneven movie that crawls around like it was given a tranquilizer early on. Publisher Jack Nicholson gets bitten one late evening by a wolf and immediately becomes a crazed creature of the night in the process. He realizes that his cannibalistic instincts are not only dangerous for himself, but also those around him (notably love interest Michelle Pfeiffer). Also along for the ride is co-worker/super jerk James Spader (appropriately slimy as always). Director Mike Nichols (no idea why he did this picture) tries to create an intelligent thriller that mixes with romantic, horror and supernatural elements. The entire combination is more dizzying and confusing than alluring. Nicholson's possibly interesting characterization is eliminated fast in favor of silly situations and a transparent tone. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who thought the ideas that originate from the werewolfconcept are starving must see this movie from Mike Nichols (the man who will be forever immortal with "The graduate")as it's quite different. We follow Jack Nicholson who seems to have no luck in life when he's at age, getting fired (they send him to East-Europa to start a new career) and his wife that is cheating him with his collegue who's after his job. A man would like to chance...which happens the day he drives over some wolf. The animal bites him and the rest is history as they say as soon Jack will be a wolf too and it's time for some unforgettable revenge.... Well, that's the movie in a nutshell and it would be a complete stinker if it wasn't for the gracious performances of Jack Nicholson who is just born for these roles (they even don't have to use a lot of make-up)and as always Michelle Pfeiffer is a grace too. Very mediocre movie that is above its standards because of the cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This thing I was most impressed with was the research done. I mean you have to dig pretty deep to find the "rule" about new werewolves fealing pain and weakness during sunsets. While the plot was a bit lacking, Jack was superbly cast as Will. It stays to the traditional rules of werewolfs, including the bit about sunsets, that were's sleep a lot durning the day, increased aggression, acute sences and that they become full on wolves at the end of their transformation. The only rule that they broke was the one that Will would stay a wolf. Werewolves were feared through out history for their ability to shift from one to the other.. not because they would stay a wolf. I know this sounds cheesy and I would be the only one to actually watch, but if it was done right, it would make a much better TV movie in which they had time to explore what Will has become after his first month as a wolf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful metaphor, dramatic suspense, better than average in the genre of the werewolf.As a metaphor for the "inner animal" in us all, and a rant condemning the ethics of corporate America, this movie makes its point in a most entertaining and creative way.As a Michelle Pfeiffer movie, this is about the best thing she's ever done. But we love her movies, anyway. At some point during the movie, someone in my house said, "Better not mess with her! That's CATwoman!" Although this is not the part for which she is best known, it is perhaps her best portrayal to date. Nicholson. Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast as the lead wolf. I have always considered him to be rather wolfish, so when I saw this production for the first time, I was delighted to see him so brilliantly placed. The director here intended this movie to be a socio-political statement concerning the publishing industry's habits of publishing what sells, over what is intelligent, well written or even literate. It was also a rant against the ethics of corporate America; how easily one's livelihood is snatched from beneath them. But most of all, it was a strong comment concerning the need to tap into your inner animal and be aggressive in times of trial and/or tribulation. He was saying, "Don't turn to a God and let it all fall away! Stand UP and take control! Take what you need from your life, rather than taking what comes!" And he makes that statement in a most creative and intelligent manner.All that having been said, on the surface, this is a most excellent werewolf movie. It sticks to the rules, thrills, and entertains its audience. James Spader was quite good as the bad guy; a role in which I never considered I would like him. I won't go into the story line, but if you are a fan of the werewolf genre, you will enjoy this movie.At least, we did.It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A promising beginning and a good performance by Jack Nicholson, who finally gets a role that justifies his chronic scenery-chewing, falls apart in the final reel into a mundane good wolf-vs-bad wolf showdown. Along the way the film has some interesting things to say about animal acts and assorted b**tardry in the corporate boardroom. Leave aside the werewolf stuff and this becomes an interesting story of a regular guy pushed beyond his limits, finally prevailing by drawing on the mongrel within.Michelle Pfeiffer tries hard, but someone should have told her that wasted boozy drug fiends don't usually look quite so gorgeous. A bit more grit perhaps. A couple of years later, Courtney Love might have had a better crack at this role.James Spader invests his latest wierdo role with about as much menace as a home cladding salesman, and Kate Nelligan is sadly wasted in a small role.The film has plenty of visual style and also looks good in B&amp;W, giving it a nice noirish feel.

		<fullReview>I usually love Werewolf movies, but "Wolf", fails completely. A better script and better acting from Nicholson might have made this work. Nicholson under-acts through the entire film. Whether he is a man or a werewolf. And he was too old even in 1994 for a part as physical as this one. Watching him jump high and fly through the air looks ridiculous and it is way too obvious that most of those scenes was performed by a stunt double. I don't know what annoys me more, that we never see Randall kill anybody (the deer doesn't count) not even his own wife, or that Randall stay good through the entire film. Nicholson is great at playing psychopaths. He should have mentally changed. As he became more and more a werewolf, he should have become more and more evil and cold. Spader gave a more convincing performance, because his character: Stewart was a douche-bag from the beginning and he had the pshysique and age to be a convincing werewolf. Pfeiffer was mostly just annoying. Considering Rick Baker made the still impressive special effects makeup on there much older: An American Werewolf in London and on Wolf, the makeup on Wolf, is a let-down. I want gore and horror, when i see a movie about werewolfs, but this movie was never scary at all. Seeing Randall howling against the moon is laughable, not scary. If it wasn't for the language, this could have been a PG13 movie. There is almost no blood at all. I expect more than this from an R-rated horror movie. A lot more!!</fullReview>

OK it started out interesting with Jack getting attacked by some wolfs at night and I felt who else to play the part better of a wolf-man that Jack himself. However my spirits sank when I saw the result. When he turned into the wolf (if you want to call it that) he looked more like someone who needed a shave rather than some wolf creature. OK so he had better hearing and could ease drop on his co-workers which made for some fun but when I saw Jack running around on all fours howling at the moon I was laughing my head off. He looked silly and he must have wondered why he even took this part. I was thinking about some of the most classic films he ever did like Five Easy pieces, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Last Detail, Easy Rider and The Shinning. What made him go from that to this film? Who knows...I still love the guy but this film was embarrassing to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wolf in Jack Nicholson's clothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've come to realise something about Jack Nicholson. He's only good when the part is made for him. Roles that spring to mind include The Devil in The Witches of Eastwick, or The Joker. Two performances where his manic energy was perfectly attuned to the characters written for him. But if he's put into parts not really suited to him, then its not a pretty sight. And I'm thinking of Jack Torrance in The Shining here.In the case of Wolf, the role of a man taken over by animal urges couldn't be more perfect for Jack Nicholson. So its all the more unusual then that he chooses to downplay emotion for the role. Its a bold move, but is it a successful one? Well, when Nicholson cut back on the histrionics for About Schmidt, it was a gamble that paid off. The story of a lonely man who suffers in silence was made all the more remarkable because the man was Jack Nicholson. But I think this only works to variable effect in Wolf.Wolf comes from celebrated director Mike Nichols. A man who dabbles in fantasy cinema from time to time, Wolf was Nichols' attempt to bring the whole werewolf ethos into the 90s. He's not quite as successful as he would be much later on when he adapted Angels in America into an absolutely superb mini-series, but Wolf definitely has its interesting moments.Nicholson plays an ageing book editor bitten by a wolf one night. He slowly begins to sense the changes within himself. Becoming more assertive in his business dealings. Sleeping the day away. Lots of energy at night. And when he gets involved with the daughter of a ruthless publisher, he's not sure how long he can be with her before he loses himself to the wolf completely.Mike Nichols has made a conscious effort to avoid the familiar expectations of the genre. Instead of the usual horror show, most of the story takes place within the real world surroundings of board rooms and bedrooms. In an interesting move, Nichols equates animal instinct with office politics. Nichols explored office rivalry before in the excellent Working Girl, and tries to blend the same approach with the wolf story. To interesting effect.James Spader does what he does best as an ambitious, ladder climbing snake who's after Jack's job. The rivalry between the two, Spader's slick finesse versus Jack's animal magnetism becomes an impressive contrast. In fact its this aspect of the film that really shines. They provide an edge the film may not have otherwise had. It doesn't get any sharper than the scene when Jack announces he's marking his territory...literally by peeing on Spader's expensive shoes.Its when the film outright addresses Nicholson's lycanthropy that Wolf misses the mark. I think because Nichols never really does anything particularly original with it. The scene where Jack murders a deer in cold blood makes an impact, but its nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before in a thousand other werewolf movies. The makeup work from the usually great Rick Baker is surprisingly unremarkable. Just tufty sideburns and yellow contacts. That could be anyone who's just woke up from an all night bender. Its disappointing because Baker provided the astonishing transformation effects for An American Werewolf in London.Also Jack's relationship with Michelle Pfeiffer is not as compelling as it should be. Its nice to see the two of them reunited again, after co-starring seven years previously in The Witches of Eastwick. But Wolf never quite explores the dark seductions of power TWOE did so well. I sensed a lot of missed opportunities here. Pfeiffer could have become fascinated by Jack's wolfish side instead of just mildly bemused by it. She's always at her best when playing femme fatales with an edge, like Catwoman, or the witch Lamia in the underrated Stardust. But Wolf never grants her that chance until its too late.As for Jack Nicholson, I kept waiting throughout the film for him to open up and play to the gallery. But he surprisingly never does. He's not sleepwalking his way through the part. But considering what a larger than life actor Nicholson is, you're wondering why he refuses to cut loose and hang from the rafters. Sometimes when he does the temptation to turn off is great. But I would have liked to see Jack give in to his animal side. It would have given the film some much needed fire. As it is, Wolf is an at times painfully slow film, and all because Jack never sinks his teeth into the part with relish.There's a good twist involving James Spader that I don't want to spoil. But the ending feels conventional really, even if it follows things through to their natural conclusion. Still, Wolf is certainly not a failure. Jack never goes for the role like you think he should. But Wolf brings some interesting dimensions to the werewolf genre, even if it never reinvents it.</fullReview>

That cannot be how it went down.I can suspend my disbelief as well as anyone, but this movie is ridiculously bad. Anyone who would classify the writing as "clever" or any other synonym of the word must be related to those who made this film, because the writing is horrible. Granted, there are many werewolf films and similar movies of the horror genre that are much less thoughtful with even worse writing, but that certainly does not mean that since this one is better that it is good.The only thing that saves this movie is the acting. There are some good scenes. The interaction between Nicholson and Pfeiffer is good, as would be expected. The predictability of the plot combined with the poor writing, however, really hamper this movie's chances of being good. If you're a die-hard Nicholson fan, or if you want a werewolf flick that is a little different, then check this one out. If you want a good, well-written movie, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, for the Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wolf" starts out very well. The send-up does honor to the old werewolf formula. Nichols brilliantly sets the fable in the backstabbing world of New York publishing during a hostile takeover. And the wolf-bound protagonist is an aging publisher, in the process of losing both his job and wife to a younger, duplicitous colleague. This works very well for the first 2/3 of the movie. Then, as in a similar effort for vampires, "The Lost Boys", the wheels fall off. It appears that the director doesn't know where to go with the plot, and the conclusion is botched. At the movie's end, the viewer is left feeling that this was one that got away. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Howler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Try as he might, Mike Nichols can't keep his Wolf from becoming a silly and frenetic howler, a bad joke or, at the very least, a shaggy dog story. Lots of good actors and atmospherics, but nothing to sustain the movie.I knew I was in real trouble with Wolf when the character of a police detective was introduced, played by Richard Jenkins. Jenkins is an easily recognizable character actor, but he is a one-note wonder. He plays one guy, an officious, incompetent prick and I let out a frustrated harrumph when I saw him. I figured Nichols and his casting director were playing really safe with this guy as a nosy cop.The movie has the makings of a great lycanthroper. There's the built- in canine menace of Jack Nicholson--and he looks great here, late '50s, but still reasonably lean and youthful--and Michelle Pfeiffer plays the darkest side of herself, a beautiful woman who hates her beauty because it makes her a target for men who only want arm candy. I enjoyed Christopher Plummer, James Spader, and and Kate Nelligan, a woman who I've gotten the palpitations from ever since I saw her in Eye of the Needle.There's so much talent here that I found myself physically angry as Nichols, who has done brilliant work and, in the same breath, been responsible for the ludicrous Day of the Dolphin. He keeps jerking his knees, turning the movie into a dog and pony show (think of the horses in Pfeiffer's stable) by relying on Rick Baker's makeup work and not concentrating on the human drama of Nicholson's character becoming more predatory and animalistic and less professional.There should have been more scenes of Jack stealing roast beef off his secretary's sandwich and less gore. Humor with menace almost always trumps the wolfman grabbing a screaming deer and tearing its throat out.Oh, well. I guess it was a passable two hours, with Nicholson pissing on Spader's shoe and telling him he's marking his territory, Pfeiffer slowly letting her heart open, and Nelligan being confronted by her husband, barely covered by her lover's evening gown.But none of these things are enough to make up for the silliness of Nicholson sprouting fangs and muttonchops and finding a victim's fingers in his sport jacket.It's enough to make you a cat person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie had an interesting take on werewolves. More of a deeper meaning. Not so much people changing and killing, but how one man randomly gets bitten and how his whole life changes. The cast was interesting but had its up and downs. Jack Nicholson played a decent character and werewolf. Michelle Pfeiffer was just OK. Some of the close ups on here made her look; not real. Then you have James Spader who I enjoyed the most. Something about his character really fit with him and I enjoyed his performance. The rest of the cast was OK except for David Hyde Pierce. To me, it didn't seem like this was his type of movie. Not his fault, just a bad casting choice. But he is a good actor. The story to the film was interesting, but wasn't solid. This includes a pretty cheap uneventful ending. I will have to say that I enjoyed the make up for werewolves. That when you are a werewolf you are in complete form, but when you are first bitten you are more of a were-person. So overall it was a nice film, just not too exciting for a horror type film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corporate culture as an eat-or-be-eaten world . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In wolf, the legendary Jack Nicholson plays Wil Randall, an aging editor who is being forced, as he puts it, to "choose between no job, and a job no one would want" by the millionaire/maneater (Christopher Plummer - two legends for the price of one!) who just took over his publishing house. On top of this, he finds out that his "protegee" Stewart Swinton (James Spader of the movie "Secretary" and TV show "Boston Legal") is really a back stab -er- biter, stealing both his place in the revamped publishing house and his wife (lovely Kate Nelligan).There is one hitch, however - prior to these shenanigans, Wil was bitten by a wolf after hitting the animal. (He got out of his car and went up to the seemingly dead creature but was attacked when he tried to touch it). And now, Wil is hungrier (and not just for food), no longer needs his glasses, and - this might be most advantagious to someone working in a cut -er- bite-throat corporate office) he can overhear conversations that would be out of a normal person's hearing range.What about increased sense of smell, you ask? Well, that's how Wil discovers his wife's betrayal. He not only has a more sensitive nose, he can apparently identify people by scent, and he recognizes Stewart's smell on his wife's coat. Suspecting the obvious, he goes to Stewart's home, and sure enough, there they BOTH are, and it clearly ain't no business meeting. So ends Wil's marriage.But, in the interim, Wil has met the daughter of the Plummer character, Laura (ridiculously beautiful Michelle Pfieffer), and his separation from his cheating wifey opens up the possibility of new romance, which does indeed bloom.Wil also becomes more aggressive in defending his job at his publishing house, eating up his would-be superiors and Stewart like a wolf would eat a kitten.Wil, incidentally, has bitten Stewart (finding Stew and his wife together triggered his first real wolf-like reaction) and thus infected him.It all comes down to a climactic "battle of the wolfmen", with some thrills, chills and romance along the way.Worth a watch most definitely.Cheers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film might get a better rating if it was viewed as satire rather than horror, because it is actually a very funny film -- taking the dog-eat-dog world of publishing, so to speak, to a new level in the climactic scene. Nicholson's typically sardonic performance and Pfeiffer's wry role -- not too mention the abundant screen charisma between the two of them -- make it a compelling watch. The script, too, deserves favorable mention, for its wit and intelligence. Rarely has the buzz expression "Bite me" been used to such literal effect. In the end, one is left with the feeling that many of us would benefit from a little more wolf in our character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As visually thrilling as the action itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>although we can all guess jack Nicholson would play a werewolf easily, I was half-expecting this movie to be considered "better than average," but after analyzing the film, i can say it is both visually beautiful and well-put together with the script.the best aspects about this film are its well-spliced scenes for how the camera captures the image and for the pace of the story. Nothing was too fast or too slow, yet for a mid 90's film i feel they could've touched up on the special effects. Then again, you can argue that the spfx were kept down to the amount they were to pay homage to the original "the wolf-man." The style in which this movie was filmed sort of reflects off David Cronenberg's masterpiece "The Fly," which shows the protagonist transform from man, go through a phase of power and domination, then ultimately end up losing himself (although not as severely with Jack Nicholson as with Jeff Goldblum) Aside from some minor flaws, its safe to say this film was very well put-together. definitely a movie that should be noticed as more underrated than necessary, and one to surely check out at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson has a lot of fun with the part, though not too much; Nichols makes a solid Hollywood horror/thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the story in 'Wolf', that doesn't deal directly with the werewolf side, is fairly routine. The corporate intrigue at the book-editing firm that Jack Nicholson's Will Randall works at- is close enough to being standard that it might be pretty easy to read through. Of course, he has his one opponent-acting-as-buddy played by James Spader, and his boss played by Christopher Plummer with some level of respect but not much patience for his older publisher Randall. But the corporate/business side of the story, much like Randall himself, gets a big booster from the main subject, it being a wolf. He gets bitten on a night where he's got car trouble, and he goes home thinking he'll need some rest. But it suddenly turns him into a much more ambitious and take-no-s*** worker ready to one-up his younger upstart. And, he also starts to drift from his wife in the process, for his boss's daughter (Michelle Pfieffer).It of course turns into a film with plenty of action and (as a given from Rick "Werewolf in London" Baker) impressive jobs done in the make-up department, but Nichols is quite smart to let the film be seemingly about one thing, and then shifts right into the other without too much trouble. Nicholson, too, shows a great deal of perfect restraint in some scenes, which lets room then when he starts to slip further into his wolf-ness. Like with the Shining, though to a slightly tweaked psychological degree, Nicholson has a character that's flawed at first, but fairly normal and even-tempered. Then the 'something' soon kicks in, and a real nail-biter takes shape. Some of this is the purely lustful (he is, after all, a 'dog'), and also that of the mind with the mind-set of the wolf. It's also an entertainment spectacle that isn't ever too campy or self-conscious, but just an A-list horror-show where the competition between Nicholson and his adversary thickens, the romantic intrigue becomes bigger, and all through it there are still a few genuine laughs to have. Maybe my favorite scene, that balances the dramatic/character-side and the underlying humor, is the bathroom scene, "I'm marking my territory." It's a good ride, is what I'm trying to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected this to be pretty cheesy, and watched it only because I'm on a Spader kick. It's actually a really witty comment on both the corporate world and our concept of monsters: unlike the usual Hollywood treatment of this genre, this movie asks what effect a transformation has on a character when you consider his personality *before* the transformation: how does a werewolf bite affect a basically good and decent man as opposed to someone who is already a sleazebag? Even the chemistry between Pfeiffer and the much-older Nicholson was effective. I thought at first pairing them was the usual Hollywood casting director wishful thinking, but they made it work and consistent with what we know about their characters.</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast in this film, although I don't know if he'd ever sign in this film if it'd be made today. The beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer is another reason to see this film, and she develops a rather shallow character into something very interesting.

The result is a creative, thought-provoking film with superb acting and fascinating characterization.As a horror fan, I always appreciate seeing a genre film that boasts intelligence and does not scare its audience away with excessive violence. Some critics have complained that the same story could have been told with greater emotional impact had the werewolf action been excised, but I disagree. The physical transformations are symbolic of the psychological theme of the story - that our civilization has become so corrupt and inhuman that the only way to reclaim our souls is to return to nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best werewolf movies avoid making the wolves that much different from humans. Dog Soldiers pitted a pack of werewolves against a squad of soldiers (both led by 2 alpha males....hmmm).In wolf we delve into the mind of the wolf. Jack Nicholson (who else) is becoming a werewolf, and guess what, it makes his career in the corporate world take off. It is basically wallstreet with more hair.But the wolf will consume the man, and really that is the weakness of the story so we leave the boardroom for the Forest (or at least central park). Can the man conquer the wolf, or does the man want to be the wolf and revel in the savagery. In many ways the plot is closer to a vampire movie than a werewolf story. It is an above average werewolf movie that would have been more suited to the 1980s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With "Wolf", the master Mike Nichols slyly disguised a profound, spiritual and existential masterpiece as a commercial Werewolf film. The deft frame is suspended within Nichols' standard interpersonal journeys- love, career, loss, etc. and beneath that lies a glorious story of human choice. "Wolf" is a film that forces one (Jack Nicholson) to reassess themselves in the face of colossal wavering factors- love, health, career, family. Perhaps it is very personal for me as I was raised by wolves, but I really love this film, particularly when explored as a metaphorical vehicle. Ennio Morricone's score is unquestionably one of the finest compositions of the final decade of the 20th century. Not simply genius or inspired- a work that rises above other greats. That good. Brilliant amazing genius. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best of Mike Nichol's later movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A werewolf movie starring Jack Nicholson? Sounds great! But what's that? Set in a publishing company? How is that going to work? Well, the truth is it works surprisingly well. Nicholson plays an editor who is being replaced by a younger, more ruthless man at his company. At first he's ready to simply accept it with quiet dignity, but as he's been bitten by a wolf the night before, he begins to undergo some radical changes and suddenly finds himself having the energy to fight for his position at the company and for the love of his boss' daughter. However, he also finds that he has the urge to hunt and kill at nighttime, and becomes terrified of the monster he carries inside. It's really an intelligent little story about a kind of mid-life crisis which was appreciated by the likes of Roger Ebert and various other respected film buffs.However ... critics aside, this isn't exactly a very popular movie. Most people just find it dull and uninteresting, with elements of several genres thrown together in a big mess. I can kind of see where they're coming from ... it's a little dull in places, and probably could have been cut down by at least fifteen minutes or so, but to be honest I was never that bored watching it. Wolf is much more intelligent than most werewolf movies, and does have a few interesting ideas and metaphors that haven't really been done before in werewolf movies. The ending is a little peculiar, and in a completely different tone to the rest of the movie, but it's made up for by a pretty cool twist.The reason Mike Nichols is such a hit-and-miss director is because he seems to make films that he cares about, which aren't necessarily aimed at a particular audience. Generally they do seem to find one somewhere, though, and I expect there are plenty of people out there who will enjoy this film as much as I did, or even more. Jack Nicholson is great as always. There are moments of that old hilarious, energetic Jack that we saw a lot of through the seventies and eighties, but mostly it's the sombre, ageing character that he often gets cast as these days. He does both of them very well, and I don't think anyone else would have been more suited for the part. James Spader is good is the slimy villain of the story, and Michelle Pfeiffer is her usual confident femme fatale character.Though it may not be everyone's cup of tea, Wolf is a smart, fairly enjoyable twist on the werewolf genre.</fullReview>

The big houses, The city scape, the lead female characters, Randal's job. The soundtrack even uses some jazz. And they never make it seem stupid by saying "Werewolf" instead they talk around the word.*Warning: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* The FX by Rick Baker are done very well. The subtle use of application effects instead of masks makes Jack Nicholson look 20 years younger. Everything about this movie is smooth. The end fight scene has one or two dodge wire stunts and rubber pitch forks but thats cool.The movie is definitely one of the better werewolf movies not just for its theme but its characters. If you want just a balls-out werewolf movie you might have to rent some of the more recent films like the shoddy 'Van Helsing'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes turning into a werewolf for Jack Nicholson to finally get his life back together. A middle-aged schlub on his way out at a major NYC publishing house, he suddenly manages to pull it together and fight for his life again. First two-thirds of the movie is very fine, with Nicholson excellently portraying first a tired wimp, then a man who's reinvigorated, then a man who's p***ed off, then a man scared of what he's becoming. The corporate machinations are amusing and it's satisfying to see Nicholson fight back. Final third of the movie is much more conventional in nature, far more predictable, and far less good. Pfeiffer is beautiful but showing her age here, Spader does one of his best slimy two-faced roles, Om Puri has a nice bit as an absent-minded expert in animal possession. Can in no way be considered a "good" movie because of the script issues, but this is one of my personal favorites, one of the few movies I actually own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~Bram Stoker's Dracula and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein were grandiose Gothic remakes (not to mention great films) while The Mummy was remade as an Indiana Jones adventure. Wolf was neither. While the aforementioned three were epics, Wolf stayed true to its own roots (The Wolfman) and told a down to earth story about a regular guy having a bad week. In Dracula we get Gary Oldman and in Frankenstein we get Robert DeNiro. In Wolf, we get Jack. Nicholson is at his best with these kinds of eccentric roles. He was made for them. Pfeiffer is gorgeous as his anchor and love interest while James Spader is brilliant as his nemesis. Spader was also bred for his role in the film and he can really get under my skin sometimes. Rick Baker's old school make-up is another charismatic asset of the film. Nicholson is never hidden under any prosthetics and there is never any reason to do so. Nicholson is an extraordinary actor and he performs the part well enough without gobs of make-up. I gotta say that this is a great movie, not just a horror movie. The story being told here is just good, old fashioned revenge. Nicholson really goes for the throat and I love watching every minute of it.</fullReview>

Who can better play a wolf than somebody who actually looks like a wolf. MIchelle Pfeiffer is irritating, her character is a complete bitch that does nothing right except for shoot the bad wolf in the end. James Spader is here to save the day! He gives his character the best treatment and portrays the bad wolf in such a colourful and charismatic way that he makes Nicholson fade away in comparison. Spader is one of those chamelion-like actors that the world doesn't really recognise. Among others are Tim Roth, Gary Oldman and Christian Bale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Better Stories I Have Seen In This Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're not into the whole "werewolf" genre, then you might as well pass on this movie, but if you are (or are at least open-minded about it) you will find in this a very enjoyable, star-studded movie with a good storyline that holds your attention to the very end, and includes enough twists along the way to keep you guessing. Jack Nicholson (who is always worth watching) plays publishing executive Will Graham. Driving home one night through the Vermont woods in the light of a full moon, Graham hits a wolf. Believing it to be dead, he starts removing it from the road, only to be bitten for his efforts. Hardly an original premise, I agree (but how much originality can there be here? I mean, the guy has to be bitten or you don't have a werewolf story!) Getting back home, Graham has to deal with a fight for his job against an ambitious young executive (Stewart Swinton, played by James Spader), a collapsing marriage to his wife Charlotte (Kate Nelligan) and with his own growing realization that there's something frighteningly wrong with him. For example, he wakes up one morning lying beside a stream covered in blood (that would get my attention.) Meanwhile into his life comes Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer), his boss's daughter, and the two begin a romance.(Some Spoilers Now Appear)I really liked this movie. I have watched it many times, and never cease to enjoy it. Besides the good cast and story there are other impressive things about this movie. Some beautiful wilderness shots, and I especially appreciated that they didn't go overboard on the werewolf makeup. Nicholson was always Nicholson and Spader was always Spader. The romance between Will and Laura, however, seemed a bit contrived. Nicholson is a lot older than Pfeiffer. The two worked well together, mind you, as they had some years before in "The Witches Of Eastwick." The difference was that in the previous movie you weren't supposed to take their relationship seriously. It was a joke. In "Wolf," it's deadly serious stuff. I was also a bit confused at the end. Laura also becomes a werewolf. The transition seemed to happen quite quickly for her, since she could only have been bitten during her battle against Stewart (if she had been a werewolf previously she wouldn't have been so afraid of Stewart - nor would she have been startled at Will's appearance after the fight - and presumably she would have transformed during the fight.) And yet by the next morning (even though she shows no signs of a bite wound) she's displaying signs that it seemed to take Will much longer to display (perhaps women become werewolves faster than men?)Aside from that, though, this was all good fun for those who enjoy this kind of movie. I'd rate it as an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The negative comments about this film have tended to come from people who mistakenly believe it is a werewolf movie. It simply isn't, not just according to me, but to the screenwriter, Jim Harrison. It is actually based on the Inuit belief that one way to recover from severe illness is to inhabit the body of an animal. In order to become a wolf, a human must already contain "the analog of the wolf." (Jim Harrison, Off to the Side) The film is both an exploration of inner wildness and a diatribe against corporate trends in publishing and the marginalization of individuality and good taste in popular culture. Harrison claims it is based on an actual episode of lycanthropy he once experienced in his cabin.Jim Harrison is one of America's finest authors, a quadruple threat as a novelist, poet, screenwriter, and essayist. His films (Wolf, Cold Feet, Revenge, Carried Away, and the brilliant Legends of the Fall) are so diverse that you have to go to the drama, comedy, horror, and action racks in a video store to find them all. He's a national treasure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great retelling of the werewolf tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was great because it lets you see both sides of good and evil through the eyes of a werewolf. The plot line of Jack Nicholson becoming a werewolf parallels how his company is merging and his wife is having an affair with his friend. The writers and the director truly did a great job of showing how Nicholson slowly and painfully becomes a werewolf and how Michelle Pfeiffer cares and loves him. In a way, it becomes a Beauty and the Beast story as well. I would definitely give this film 8 out of 10 because of its great performances and the great how great it is written.</fullReview>

After Will is bitten by a wolf, he becomes more passionate towards his wife, and fights to keep his publishing job with more spirit and verve. So that's all it took, huh? We already knew Jack was part wolf, so he gets to indulge it here, which is great. Michelle Pfeiffer is way too young for him, but that's never stopped Hollywood OR Jack before.

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie a lot. I don't think it set any records for spectacular drama, but Mike Nichols seldom fails to deliver an interesting film. But the reason I liked it was for several individual aspects which added-up to complete enjoyment. The main characters were all engaging, and likable despite some of the negative traits which were often exhibited. Nicholson was in a role which displayed his patented look to perfection, and Michelle Pfeiffer is pleasant to view in any role - and played the rebellious, independent rich girl, also to "perfection." Spader does smarmy and unctuous as well as anyone, the best since Dabney Coleman, and you like him all the more for it. Kate Nelligan, Christopher Lee, David Pierce, and all the other supporting cast performed well, also. There are some movies where all of the performers "chew the scenery" perhaps a bit more than necessary. This picture has this feature, but where it could be annoying, again is an asset here. The early scene where Nicholson rebuffs Pfeiffer's assumption that he is interested in her and is probably going to make an unwanted pass (which we know she would really might welcome) is priceless. This displays his persona to perfection. This is a film which I hope will be one of those more appreciated as time passes than it has been since production ("The Dirty Dozen," although an entirely different genre, is an example of this).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tis a sad, sad state of modern horror these days......I sincerly believe that two things are giving this movie a rating which it doesn't deserve.1) the Damn Edited-for-tv version which cuts the very heart and soul out of the movie. For example, when Will goes to seek answers and finds an amulet, there is a well-scripted, beautifully acted sequence with the "shaman" that adds context and beauty to the concept of the "demon wolf". Indeed the Shaman sees it as a gift, and wants Will to "share". But if all viewers have ever seen is the tv version, this scene is little more than 90 seconds long and butchered to death.... (damn tv execs....)2) People have the mistaken belief that another classic Horror movie can never be made.. This movie deserves to stand tall with the original Dracula and Frankenstein movies in terms of the set design, cinemtography, acting, theme presentation, and use of secondary characters. This is a movie which uses SUPPORTING actors in ways that arn't usually done. Christopher Plummer, Prunella Scales and David Pierce lent more support to "Jack, Michelle and James" then is generally seen today.This is NOT a shock-horror movie, and is not for the "Scream" audiences..9 out of 10</fullReview>

Chiefly, this is because Jack Nicholson, whom I generally hate, gives a fine performance. Unlike most movies where Nicholson plays an arrogant, egotistical, megalomaniac, his character in this film is quite different in that he is sinister and tragic. I was expecting to hate this movie, but was pleasantly surprised.James Spader was good, as he generally is in most serious roles. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the wolfman story that is well directed and well acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Werewolf Film, With 2 Amazing Performances From Jack Nicholson And Michelle Pfeiffer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great werewolf film, with 2 amazing performances from Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer!.It was great to see one of my favorite actors and actresses in the same film together, and the film has great effects,however it is slow paced, so some viewers, may get impatient, however i found the pace perfect, and engrossing!. It's a great werewolf film, and definitely one of the better ones out there (since i am not a fan of werewolf flicks), however i like a few and this was one of them. One of the main reasons this movie works, is the excellent chemistry between Nicholson and Pfeiffer, and it also helps, that it has a strong script and perfect pacing as well. This is one of the best werewolf movies i have seen in ages, it's a must watch!. The Direction is very good. Mike Nichols the veteran does a very good job here, with excellent camera angles, some really cool shots, creating some creepy atmosphere, and keeping the film at a very good pace!, very good job. There is a bit of blood. someone spits out blood,bloody wolf attacks,gory attack on a dear (hated in totally unnesscesary),2 severed fingers,a couple bloody slashings,pitchfork in the shoulder, and a few bloody gunshot wounds. The Acting is FANTASTIC!. Jack Nicholson is AMAZING as always, and is phenomenal here, he plays crazy like no one can, has excellent chemistry with Michelle Pfeiffer, was extremely convincing, and was tons of fun to watch!, Jack is one of the best actors of all time as far as i'm concerned (Nicholson rules!). Michelle Pfeiffer is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS and is amazing here, she is absolute fantastic in the acting department, her character was unpredictable, and damn is she sexy!, she is especially awesome in the end all dressed in black with (spoilers), werewolf eyes!. James Spader is great as the weasel, and did his job extremely well. Kate Nelligan does her job well as the cheating bitch. Christopher Plummer adds class in his scenes, and did what he had to do perfectly, wish he had more screen time though. Overall i highly recommend this werewolf film!, it's one of the best out there. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the better horror films of the last decade. I was very surprised when I saw this movie, because I had never heard of it before. But after viewing it, I was amazed at the creative nature of a movie that I had never heard of before. Yes, I know, the werewolf scenario has been done a million times before, but when you throw in Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer, Richard Jenkins, James Spader, Ron Rifkin, Edward James Olmos and Christopher Plummer...you have a great movie!The film starts out slow like how most movies do, but this film takes time developing the characters and letting you get to know them before it gets into the main horror story. There are some very good performances, which are mainly what save WOLF from its mediocre plot and story.There were some very bizarre scenes and some scenes which actually made me jump once or twice. This is Jack Nicholson's best horror flick since THE SHINING and I was glad to see him back out and looking scary. The makeup effects in this film were wonderful as the werewolf designs are done very well. The end of WOLF was very surprising and I must say that I did not see it coming. If you want a new twist to a classic horror fable idea, then this is the right film to pick. WOLF gets 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't the werewolf theme used up by the early 80's at the latest? Apparently not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect much from this film. Actually, the only reason that I watched it was because I am a huge Jack Nicholson fan, and I was surprised at how well-done the movie was. Jack Nicholson plays an editor named William Randall who kind of lets people walk all over him, and when he gets bitten by a wolf on a lonely road one night, he becomes an entirely different person. You might even say that the "Jack Nicholson" in Will Randall was brought out by the wolf. Michelle Pfeiffer was also very impressive as Laura, Will's reluctant lover and, eventually, fiancee. The werewolf makeup was particularly impressive, and even the stunts and special effects were worked out very well.However, I think that this was probably one of the last films in which colored contact lenses could have been used to draw anything other than a bored response. Ironically enough, however, they are also the reason that this film seems to be very dated when watching it only 6 years after it was made. Colored contacts are so old and cliched by now, mainly because any fool can get them, that they are just not effective in the movies anymore.Despite that, I have to say that I recommend Wolf, it was a very well-made and entertaining movie, and the story is excellent. It is one of those rare films that really has no slow points. It is not necessarily non-stop action, but your attention is held firmly throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but no classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This modern lycanthropy thriller directed by Mike Nichols and starring Jack Nicholson as a mild-mannered book editor who grows fangs and excessive body hair when the moon is full, is one of the sillier films to which these two cinema legends have lent their talents, but it's not as silly as it might have been. I do not get the impression that Nichols and Nicholson are contemptuous of the horror genre and, as others might do, pad their tale with pretensions meant to suggest that "Wolf" isn't a horror movie at all. "Wolf" IS a horror movie, alright, though not a completely successful one.Rick Baker's makeup makes Nicholson look like one of the all time worst Elvis impersonators, but there is some effectively eerie atmosphere on display here, and Ennio Morricone's score is his best in some time. The great composer's work here isn't as memorable as "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" or "Once Upon a Time in the West," but it's not instantly forgettable like his scores for "Disclosure" and "In the Line of Fire." Morricone's flute dominated score suggests he's done his homework for this assignment by actually giving a listen to Hans J. Salter's eerie work on 1941's definitive werewolf movie, "The Wolf Man," a score later readapted by Frank Skinner for Universal's series of 12 Sherlock Holmes films in the same decade. Morricone avoids the heavy handed, crashing rock and roll that one imagines most of his less talented colleagues would favor for such a film, and instead creates a mood of mystery rather than violence."Wolf" is no classic, but it doesn't bite either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Jack was both the making and the unmaking of this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not worth two hours of your time. I can't believe i kept watching after the one hour mark. This is like Witches of Eastwick: it had so much potential, it was a good idea, but carried out poorly. The reason both these movies went wrong, ironically, was also the best thing in them: Jack Nicholson. The only reason both these movies got made was Jack agreed to do them, which means the movie goes ahead regardless of the quality of the screenplay, which in both cases was why these movies were weak. Kurosawa once said that even a great director can't make a good movie out of a bad screenplay. About five minutes in i noticed some of the actors were giving false performances. I watched and watched, and realised that they were choking on these lines they'd been given to say. I put subtitles on and started really listening to the dialogue, and realisd how ridiculous it was! The screenplay has terrible dialogue and develops poorly.(spoiler)One of the worst examples of this terrible dialogue also links in with the lack of realistic development. Jack tells Michelle Pfeiffer that he's been bitten by a wolf and he thinks some of the wolf's powers have transferred onto him, and that he feels great, and she says: "Whatever it is, if its making you feel great, you should just accept it." What a joke! She doesn't say "you think the wolf has given you wolfish super powers?" and laugh, she acts like he's not nuts! Its totally acceptable for the transformation to happen to Jack, but its not okay for Pfeiffer to act like this happens every day! The fantastic element has to be reacted to realistically. Which brings me to the second major thing wrong with this movie: Michelle Pfeiffer. Who keeps hiring her! She's not an actress! But this time its not all her fault - its the writer's. You want more evidence? Jack bites James Spader on the hand (at this stage he's still human and hasn't had the transformation propre, but he's been bitten by the wolf. Nobody does that! Nobody bites another person! Spader reacts as if a rabid dog has lashed out at him. He acts shocked and springs back, but he doesn't act incredulous and say "He BIT me!" Nicholson walks around the office sniffing like a cartoon character. When a regular person wants to smell something, they don't jilt their nostrils up like that, so why would someone with a super-human sense of smell do it? So the audience know he's got wolfish smell. Its ham-fisted.As i said, however, Jack is the best thing in this (aside from music by legendary Ennio Morricone). Jack looks very cool as a werewolf, and aside from his performance being too slow, he has fun with it, with the little growls he does while he's in human mode. Like playing the devil in Witches of Eastwick, this was a role he was born for. His face just says "wolf." I only wish he'd only said yes if major rewrites were done.Its not trashy, its classily done with nice photography, clean direction, good actors (except for Pfeiffer), great music, but like Kurosawa said, nobody can save a movie from a bad script.Curio: watch out for Mrs Fawlty from Fawlty Towers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wolf is somewhat of a secret and under appreciated treasure in my opinion. I really do love this movie, it had a great story and terrific actors. Jack and Michelle just have such a sizzling chemistry and was perfect for on screen romance, their love making scene was just so sexy. The story also has some good scares, I loved James Spader as the villain, he's just perfect and so charismatic, those eyes were absolutely hypnotizing. Not to mention, Wolf doesn't have big fancy special effects, it mostly plays on our minds along with the story. It was very intelligent and well played.Will is a married man who seems to have it all put together career and life wise. One night while he is driving in the middle of a huge snow storm, he finds a wolf, the wolf bites him and he's having symptoms of animalistic wildness. To top this off he gets passed over for his promotion and looses his wife to the smooth under taker, Stewart. But he ends up meeting, Laura, a beautiful young lady and things start to look up when he's getting his way, only now he's waking up to find body parts in his pockets. But he also learns that there's a new wolf in town when he finds out about a murder of someone he knew and wonders if the wolf is taking over.Wolf is a very cool and excellent horror movie, like I said the cast was just perfect and the sets were very haunting. The ending just rocked, it's one of my favorites actually, but I'm not gonna tell, just because this is a movie you'll have to see. This is one of the top werewolf movies that I would recommend to people, it's just a fun flick to watch and if you are a fan of Jack, Michelle, or James, I know you will fall in love with it.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't exactly like a proper horror film where you will possibly jump or be shocked by some material, because it is quite slow, it is predictable, and it has big name stars, from director Mike Nichols (The Graduate, The Birdcage). Basically middle-aged book editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) is one night driving on a snowy road at night, and he hits a large wolf, who wakes up and slashes him on the hand. A little while later he seems fine and is back to work, and attending parties, where he meets the attractive Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer). Soon though Will starts to feel different, he feels younger, better sense of smell and hearing, and gets more aggressive, particularly towards the man he discovers has been having an affair with his wife, Stewart Swinton (Secretary's James Spader). Eventually, at full moon, Will turns into what he was hoping to avoid, a vicious howling werewolf (that doesn't take or rip his clothes, makes a change). Ripping Stewart also makes another werewolf, and they both clash towards the end fighting for Laura. In the end, Will (as a werewolf, unprotected by a special bracelet) runs off, and Laura is now alone, and the final shot sees her eyes go green, so it's obvious she's one too. Also starring Kate Nelligan as Charlotte Randall, Richard Jenkins as Det. Bridger, Christopher Plummer as Raymond Alden, Eileen Atkins as Mary, Frasier's David Hyde Pierce as Roy, East Is East's Om Puri as Dr. Vijay Alezias, Fawlty Towers' Prunella Scales as Maude and David Schwimmer as a Cop. As I mentioned it is predictable, but the performances are good, and Nicholson looks like a man who would turn into a werewolf (with narrow eyes, curved eye brows and that hair line). Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE Jack Nicholson transforming into a werewolf...I had to see this ! Although he is my all-time favorite actor and although werewolves are my favorite kind of horror creatures, I was rather careful with my expectations towards this movie. After all, it's a typical Hollywood film and they usually blow a good myth. But I must say I was pleasantly surprised by it. A lot of credits goes to the actors though. Jack is terrific of course, characters like this are made especially for him. Michelle Pfeiffer is darn good too ( by the way : is it me or wasn't she never as beautiful as in this film ??? ) and finally I must admit James Spader did a great job as well. Normally I'm not a big fan of his but the role of young, ambitious wolf is great. ***SPOILERS*** On his way home, Jack has a little accident and gets bitten by a wolf. The next few he finds himself going through several changes in his behavior and appearance. And, like that isn't enough, he hears from his boss ( he's a publicist ) that he's likely to loose his job. He gets the chance to move to another country but that's out of the question in Jacks' opinion. And when he thinks it's just can't get any worse, he finds out his wife is cheating on him...with the young yuppie who stole his job !!!! One positive point for Jack, he got to know the lovely daughter of his boss and finds some comfort with her. But meanwhile, his "animal behavior" keeps getting worse and it's almost impossible to hide his transformation for her..." ***END SPOILERS****You certainly don't have to be a horror buff to enjoy this movie. The make up effects are very good and life-like but not shocking or something. The whole love story gives this film access to all movie lovers. Overall, a very enjoyable film with outstanding actors and a good plot.</fullReview>

Music: Spotted. 1990's Cinema: False. Homemade. The good: Teaching cinema to amateurs. Rear that.
