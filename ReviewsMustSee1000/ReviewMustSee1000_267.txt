		<shortDescription>Yet another movie that would have been better off without a trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny English starts off a little bit like Bean: For some reason, wildly constructed, Rowan Atkinson ends up in a position that is far beyond his capabilities. Where Bean turns from Museum Guard to Museum curator impersonator, Johnny English turns from male Monneypenny-alike mission planner to James Bond replacement.Sort of.In a Bean kind of way, of course. Now that is where comparison with Bean should stop: Johnny English talks, for one thing, and doesn't just gesticulate around like a bit of a moron. And while he still causes a lot of trouble and shines in his incompetence, he manages to be far more charming and far less annoying than Mr Bean is in a 90 minute movie. Expect lots of visual humour, but also the odd moment of funny dialogue (the "making love" dialogue scene is quite hilarious)The plot is standard Bond fare: A French tycoon is up to no good, stealing crown jewels and trying to become king of.... England, oddly enough. There is a Bond girl, played by Natalie Imbruglia and sharing more similarities with Sophie Yeoh's butt-kicking bond girl than with the more traditional damsel in distress. But unfortunately, there is no equivalent to Q, nor to M and the movie is a bit too much of a one-man show.How does it fare then? On the laughter front it was quite satisfying, easily outmanoeuvering the once-too-often repeated Austin Powers, putting anything recent by Leslie Nielsen to shame and being an altogether fine Bond spoof. There is lots of slapstick (including the disgusting kind), but the movie manages to be less over the top and closer to Bond than to old National Lampoon / Mel Brooks movies.Altogether the movie was pleasantly surprising - better than Bean (which isn't too hard, to be honest) and Austin Powers (although it is a different kind of spoof). Still not brilliant, but a good dose of old-fashioned entertainment. Pity the trailer gave away quite a lot of the best bits.Plus, the bad guy was supposedly French, what more could you ask for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silly as hell, but funny as anything! Rowan Atkinson once again shows the world his talents - impeccable comic timing, style, a little bit of cheekiness, and superb acting. This movie is a personal favourite of mine, and I reckon it is perfect to watch anytime you feel low or need some cheering up. The man who brought you Bean (1997), now brings you Johnny English, a parody of James Bond. I loved Bean, and I love this one just as much, if not more. Ignore the pathetic critics that rate this as crap, because it most certainly isn't. It is a piece of comedy that you will not regret seeing - I recommend this to anyone. Heck, even my grandmother liked it! (And that's saying something) Seriously, if you haven't watched this, you really need to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Funny Parody of 007 Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) is a bureaucratic employee of the British Secret Service, who dreams to be a charming agent. His dreams come true when all the British agents die, due to the lack of security in a funeral where he was the responsible. Johnny English, with the support of his assistant Bough (Ben Miller) and Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia), fights against the evil Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovitch), a powerful French who wants to be the king of the United Kingdom and transforms England in a great prison for all criminals of the world. This silly story is a very funny parody of 007 movies. Rowan Atkinson is very hilarious, as usual, and it is impossible not laughing with his stupidities. The singer Natalie Imbruglia is very beautiful, the unknown Ben Miller is the efficient assistant of Johnny English, and John Malkovitch, with a ridiculous French accent, complete the funny cast of this comedy. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): `Johnny English'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A clumsy daydreamer by the name of Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson), who works for the Secret Spy Agency. When all the British Top Spies are killed, they asked Johnny to take over the case to investigate a mysterious rich evil french man by the name of Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich). Johnny's only help is from his loyal partner (Ben Miller) and a beautiful, mysterious spy woman (Natalie Imbruglia) could help bring Sauvage to Justice.Directed by Peter Howitt (Anti-Trust, Laws of Attraction, Sliding Doors) made a entertaining comedy that spoofs the films of James Bond and The Naked Gun Trilogy. Atkinson is a delight and Malkovich is at his silliest role to date (He seems to have a real good time in this movie). The film's plot is surprisingly good but you wish, there is more laughs at times. Atkinson's fans won't be disappointed.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (Also sharp in Pan &amp; Scan transfer) and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD Extras are Deleted Scenes, Behind the Scenes Featurette and more. Kids will probably enjoy this more than the adults. Written by Neal Purvis (The World is Not Enough), Robert Wade (Die Another Day) and William Davies (Twins). (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't stop laughing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allthought I wouldn't rate it as a well thought artistic piece of art in the cultural aspect (such as a Kubrick movie, for example) Johnny Enlighs is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. If you are in the mood for a good laugh out of a not 100% stupid movie, then, only then, its a must see. I saw it a year ago and I still remember Johnny's face and actions. I must admit that really stupid movies make me sometimes angry, this is not that kind of movie that has no sense at all, it has a clear setting, and a great cast (perfect cast if you're talking about Johnny's selection). Probably better than the Mr. Beans, "Johnny English" is a must see for those who laugh easily. Another very important hint: don't watch it alone. Watch it with someone who makes you laugh. The last hint: if you don't laugh, probably Blockbuster® gave you "Lost Highway" instead of "Johnny English", a pretty uncommon mistake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't a big fan of Rowan Atkinson and didn't have a lot of expectation out of this film, but it really cracked me up. First of all, you need to understand "Johnny English" is not a British version of "Austin Power". I found "A.P" ridiculous in general and didn't always appreciate their jokes. But Johnny English is one of those better made spy topic comedian films.The best approach of watching this movie is to see it without a lot of expectation and I assure you that you will have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Patchy but likable Spy Spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The talented Rowan Atkinson expands his character from a series of TV adverts shown in the UK in the late 1990's onto the big screen.So does the transfer from two-minute sketches adapt successfully into feature-length narrative? The answer surprisingly is quite well,although the film does have flat spots and gags that somewhat misfire.The plot and incidents that take place are an obvious mixture and borrowing from the NAKED GUN and AUSTIN POWERS series of parodies,but what is refreshing is that the character of Johnny English is mostly free of the occasional mugging that was witnessed in the above films,and also Atkinson's MR BEAN creation,which was of course wordless but did sometimes engage in some rather messy slapstick.There is some messy slapstick here,but Atkinson's interpretation is closer to his greatest comic character of Edmund BLACKADDER,with his sometimes cynical and sarcastic tone,though he has traits of bumbling incompetence like Mr.Bean,though not total idiocy which makes English more sympathetic.A lower budget than the AUSTIN POWERS series means there are fewer elaborate set pieces,but some scenes work very well and there are some witty exchanges of dialogue.There's decent support from Natalie Imbruglia,Ben Miller and Tim Pigott-Smith,but John Malkovich is the most amusing as the villain with his cod French accent.It is encouraging to see a comedy which underplays it's scenes these days,rather than performers shouting and screaming in a desperate bid to force laughter out of an audience.That said,some scenes in the film don't always come off,perhaps because they are understated too much,but the best bits are very funny(especially the final scenes)and further sequels with this character would be most welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's certainly not a great movie, but to say it's vastly superior to the Austin Powers series is to pay it too small a compliment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not just that the jokes are funnier (there's one explicit poo joke, which is one too many, but still: it's just the one) or that Rowan Atkinson is a far better performer than Mike Myers, or anything comparatively trivial like that. No. The real difference is that "Johnny English" has its heart in the right place. Part of this difference is the fact that it has a heart at all.English, unlike Powers, is not just a blank space in which the screenwriters can insert gags. He's a character. And there's more to the character than just clumsiness and pomposity. English is endearing because he's manifestly no fool. We know more than he knows, we see the banana skin immediately in front of his feet which he invariably fails to see, and in a way it's his fault he fails to see it himself, but his failure to see it is always something other than a failure of intelligence. He's easy enough to humiliate but, for some reason, hard to hoodwink. It's refreshing, too, that we're allowed to feel for him - when, for instance, he's dismissed from the case. We see Johnny English being devastated, not Rowan Atkinson trying to be funny.Sure, it's not what it could have been. It's funny without being brilliantly so, and the satire (what there is of it) is on the blunt side. But these merely negative failings aren't enough to kill a film. Its biggest problem may be bad timing. When the script was being written, the anti-French sentiment must have seemed quaint and amusing, harmless because unreal; nobody could have predicted, surely, the sickening wave of hatred (the fact that it was all planned by the likes of Rupert Murdoch does not, alas, make the hatred any less real) that was shortly to sweep over the English-speaking world. Any joke about the French now has a sour taste at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing but Mr.Bean with lines..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmm....what can be said about this film? I was amused many places, but the plotlines were so predictable you could tell all the things meant to be funny was about to happen, way before the climax of the amusement took place...sad, very sad....Johnny English is a strange character - he has his moments where he seems a little intelligent and he has a big talent for coming up with excuses, but apart from that, he is immensely stupid - stupid to a point where the fun stops. I know Rowan Atkinson spoke out that English was completely new character of his, but it is NOT - take Mr. Bean, add speaking lines and you've more or less got Johnny English. If he HAD to repeat his old characters, I would much rather see an agent of the Edmund Blackadder caliber! THERE would be something to have fun with!I'd say that this is NOT one of Atkinson's better moments, and I actually think the picture is stolen by his agent male partner, of the flick - the rookie (I forget his name). He is toned down a lot but he is the one that made me laugh at several places, amongst others the lines "Are you coming over here in a minute, sir?". Won't spoil anything, but if you've seen the movie you know what I refer to.But, if you're an Atkinson fan, like myself, go and see it. It's not horrible, but it's not fabolous either! Around average, nothing more, nothing less..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some fun, some dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies peppered with those occasional gut-busting scenes that we have come to expect with a comic actor on the order of Atkinson, but is substantially more full of a lot of disposable humor in the form of English's bumbling; for example, going to the wrong building, going up the "poop shoot," Sauvage's coronation (which is probably the best/worst example of this) etc. It comes across as strained and ultimately worthless for comic effect. I despise the kind of humor that is stretched much too far to be funny. It is so telegraphed that mid-way through the movie you can invariably anticipate exactly WHAT he is bumbling into and whatever vague humor it had is butchered. It becomes excruciating. I would, however, enjoy seeing this turn into a screen franchise for Atkinson--IF (and this is a big IF) they give him a solid screenplay to work with. The plot and characters were all fine--even Malkovich's purposefully ridiculous French accent (and clearly John M. is slumming for a few bucks in this one)--but the movie lacked vaguely consistent humor. The bumbling James Bond-ish character is a one-noter--Atkinson would be funnier in funny SITUATIONS (I daresay mini-"Bean"-type scenes peppered throughout the movie) that are not strained to reveal merely how bumbling and stupid he can be (yes, by 15 minutes into the movie we GET how bumbling English is - don't spend the entire movie explaining it to us again and again). Comedy is tough to write and tougher to execute on - but Atkinson has the chops to handle it. He just needs the right material. There were a few gem moments and enough "chuckle humor" to make this a worthy rental. Imbruglia is respectable as his female counterpart -- and none too tough on the eyes. She could be an excellent female lead in a franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This James Bond spoof, headed by British comedian Rowan Atkinson, was okay....a fair amount of laughs but not enough to add this film to my collection. Atkinson reminded me a bit of Benny Hill, a more famous English comedian who also doesn't speak much but lets his actions and facial expressions garner his laughs. Both are likable guys.John Malkovich plays a Frechman here and his accent is pretty good. He seems to be always playing strange roles.There really isn't a whole lot to say about this film. Except for a very funny toilet scenes, much of it isn't that memorable. Just a lightweight hour-and-a-half of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amusing moments along with embarrassing in this first entry about secret agent Johnny English with a likable Rowan Atkinson , role of the accidental spy who doesn't know fear or danger in this comedy spy-thriller . In his initial adventure, the most unlikely intelligence officer in Her Majesty's Secret Service must stop a group of international conspirators led by a mean French (John Malkovich) before they eliminate the monarch of England and cause global chaos on the Great Britain . Johnny English, a British secret agent who dreams of rising beyond his menial job within the MI-7 organization, is hired to protect the Crown Jewels after all the other agents are bumped off. When the jewels are stolen, he eventually uncovers a plot to replace England's Queen with what the British fear the most : a French monarch . And since her nation has such close ties to France , Pegasus (Tim Piggot Smith) head of MI7 instructs secret agent Johnny English to retrieve the robbed crown jewels and directing the investigation. On the way he runs into the suspects . With one shot at redemption, he must employ the latest in hi-tech gadgets to unravel a web of conspiracy that runs throughout a ambitious French successor . With mere days until a coronation , one man must use every trick in his playbook to protect us all. For Johnny English, disaster may be an option, but failure never is. This first installment is a passable and average comedy because the formula is well known with 'The Pink Panther' series. It stars clumsy Rowan Atkinson as one man show accompanied by a sympathetic Ben Miller .¨ Johnny English¨ release was the first part of series as the inept and bungler secret agent from MI-7 . The movie gets entertaining and hilarious moments here and there. This slapstick picture contains amusing , funny scenes , fresh and diverting moments but also flaws and gaps . Rowan Atkinson steals the show parodying the ordinary international secret agent , James Bond-alike , including his ordinary faces , grimaces and gestures . Appears as secondaries some prestigious British actors as Tim Piggot Smith , Ben Miller , Kevin McNally and two gorgeous women as Tasha De Vasconcelos and Natalie Imbruglia . The actors seem to enjoy themselves immensely giving funny interpretations . Lively and atmospheric music by Ed Shearmur . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Remi Adefarasin . The film is regularly penned and directed by Peter Howitt . Several chuckles and gags , the result of which is one acceptable first entry . The flick will appeal to Rowan Atkinson fans who plays stunningly the highly unorthodox agent. Followed by ¨Johnny English Reborn¨ (original title) that maintains the slapstick franchise with Rowan Atkinson , Gillian Amstrong , Rosamund Pike , Dominic West and directed by Oliver Parker . Johnny is back in action and returns to the role of the accidental secret agent who doesn't know fear or danger in the comedy spy-thriller 'Johnny English Reborn' . In the years since MI-7's top spy vanished off the grid, he has been honing his unique skills in a remote region of Asia , now that the world needs him once again, Johnny English goes into the action .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New-age hilarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JOHNNY English is a comedy, pure and simple. It makes no pretensions to complexity, beauty or scriptwriting prowess, but is entirely devoted to the entertainment of the viewer. Such comedies are becoming increasingly rare nowadays, and this fine example deserves all the accolades it receives.Rowan Atkinson rules the screen in his customary manner as Johnny English, a bumbling British bureaucrat who is transferred to MI5 after unwillingly causing the death of one of its top agents. Assisted by a beautiful and sassy Interpol officer (Natalie Imbruglia), he does battle with Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich), a nasty French business tycoon who has his eyes on the British crown. This is a unique performance from Atkinson, meshing the best comedic attributes of his best known characters into a coherent whole. Johnny English has all the rib-tickling sardonic wit of Blackadder and the unpredictable slapstick skill of Mr. Bean, and comedy fans of all tastes are sure to find something to their liking in this character.Aussie songbird Natalie Imbruglia, however, proves that she's a much better musician than an actress. She's not bad, but she fails to reach the high threshold set by her co-stars. I have not seen any of her other films, so I don't know whether this is a reflection of her skills, or whether she was simply miscast. Regardless, her incongruous performance detracts from the dialogue somewhat, leaving the movie feeling a little unbalanced. She looks great, though! "Mad" John Malkovich is characteristically quirky and extremely convincing as the villain - his French accent has improved out of sight since THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK. Providing a good background performance is Ben Miller as English's sidekick Bough, his consistent, pervasive dry humour a good foil to Atkinson's exuberance.JOHNNY English requires no particular attitude or mindset whatsoever. It is a comedy, pure and simple, and an excellent one at that. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silly slice of spy spoofery - 68%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there was an award for "Best Film Based On A Barclaycard Commercial" then surely this would win hands-down. Sadly, there isn't but before the idea has time to sink in, it would be a shame to totally dismiss this film as a pointless, shameless cash-in. While it is rarely gut-bustingly funny, there are still plenty of reasons why this film is so much better than Rowan Atkinson's more famous creation, "Bean". Just remember not to take it too seriously and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.Atkinson plays MI7 agent Johnny English, a bumbling spy in the Inspector Clouseau mould who dreams of being just like James Bond. When he is suddenly promoted, his first task is to guard the recently renovated crown jewels but to his horror, they are stolen. English suspects that "greedy Frenchman" Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich) is behind the theft and working alongside his trusty sidekick Bough (Ben Miller) and beautiful Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia), English battles his superiors and his incompetence in order to bring Sauvage's schemes to a halt.It isn't exactly difficult to spoof a spy film - even "Die Another Day" had a good chuckle at itself - but Atkinson's rubber-faced idiot takes things into straight-up slapstick and it works. Atkinson really knows how to deliver an out-standing comic performance as anyone who has seen the TV show "Blackadder" will testify. It's not quite to those giddy heights but "Johnny English" is a perfectly good platform for his particular brand of chaos. Opposite, Malkovich hams it up as the villain but he gives the impression that this film is somehow beneath him. As for Imbruglia, it's safe to say that she looks and sings better than she acts but given that the last substantial acting part she had was in the Aussie soap "Neighbours" a decade earlier, perhaps it's not that surprising. The plot is rather weak, it has to be said, but "Johnny English" is not to be taken seriously. It's a funny, silly film that is a great time-passer but not exactly one that stays with you.While it isn't exactly difficult, "Johnny English" is a much funnier film than Atkinson's previous outing "Bean". Instead of the silent, gurning fool, English is a genuinely funny character cursed by his own incompetence and yet somehow oblivious to it. It's not the biggest or best film of its type but it is a fine alternative to the Austin Powers films. It also feels made for an audience beyond the UK, a suspicion backed by a claim by a Bulgarian bartender I once worked with that this was the funniest film he'd ever seen. I wouldn't go that far but you could certainly do much worse than "Johnny English". Trust me, it's far funnier than the forth-coming "Capital One movie" in production...**Not actually in production, thank God</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Worst Brit Comedy You Will See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics were unkind to this and I got the impression it was down to two reasons:1 ) The character Johnny English is based on a character that appeared on credit card adverts in the early 1990s . you get the gut instinct that character development isn't something that applies to characters appearing in adverts 2 ) Bond spoofs are old hat and weren't all that funny in the first place So I was sat there at Christmas thinking I'd be watching something with all the appeal of 37 day old turkey sandwiches but I was fairly impressed . Okay I wasn't rolling around the floor with tears streaming down my face but I've always liked Rowan Atkinson's arrogant portrayal of Edmund Blackadder and the character of Johhny English is just as similar to Blackadder as it is to Mr Bean . I will grant you the jokes are hit and miss or predictable like the scene where English infiltrates the villains HQ and finds an old man : " What did they do to you ? " " They took some of my blood "" The b@stards " Of course you can see the pay off long before it appears but that still doesn't stop it from being amusing when it doesNo doubt a lot of pretentious John Malkovich fans were left stratching their heads wondering why he was slumming it in JOHNNY English but if you've enjoyed anything Rowan Atkinson has been in you'll certainly find this comedy very watchable</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hideous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSAs a recent legend of British comedy, Rowan Atkinson deserves respect. As both "Blackadder" and "Mr Bean", Atkinson was superb, unfortunately in "Johnny English" he fails hideously to launch another character.When the entire super-spy contingent in Britain is killed, fool Johnny English is brought in to fill the gap. Teaming up with associate Bough (Ben Miller) and Australian agent Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia), English must use all his limited wits and cunnings to defeat the evil frenchman, Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich) and save the country's monarchy.The key problem with this film is just how awful the jokes are. Occasionally a joke might click, but more often than not, the jokes fall ridiculously flat. The biggest sign of just how bad this film is, happens to be Malkovich's performance. John Malkovich is perhaps an actor more known for his name than his acting. Famous for having a Kaufman film named after him, Malkovich has stared in some decent features. Ultimately however, in "Johnny English", this respected actor manages to give us a tedious accent which grates on the nerves and is incredibly annoying.As well as the flaws with Malkovich's part and the lack of decent humour, the film fails in that other members of the cast are incredibly annoying. As another agent, Imbruglia is hideously bad and reminds us why "Neighbours" stars turn to music (and ultimately should stay in music). Along with this, Rowan Atkinson is awkward with such a limited catalogue of jokes.To summarise, "Johnny English" is awful. With awful jokes and bad acting, this film never really had a chance. Certain stereotypes never help this argument and ultimately this film never deserves to have been made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very painful - I laughed so much!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I think my One Line Summary says it all really. Johnny English is one of the best British Modern Comedies to be made in a long time. While not very original, the movie takes the material that made Mr. Bean and James Bond so good, and combined them into a 90 minute comedy that never once fails to impress.But what made this film so successful? Firstly, one has to admire Rowan Atkinson's talent. He keeps this movie together and stops it from becoming tiring and tedious. He is probably one of the best actors in the United Kingdom. I applaud his performance. I did enjoy the performances of the rest of the other cast too. It was nice to see different actors and actresses play lead roles rather than casting the same faces over and over. Secondly, the set pieces were superb. * SPOILERS * The truck chase was very original, the scene in the Hospital and the Crowning Ceremony had me in stitches! I must also mention the musical score. While I am not a huge fan of Robbie Williams, his theme song "A Man For All Seasons" did suit the movie very well. The rest of the score, composed by Edward Shearmur, was very exciting. It was nice to see a contrast in tempos. For example, the truck chase action score was very upbeat and exciting, while the love theme was a beautiful swing in Waltz time. I look forward to hearing some more of his work in the near future.So, how about a sequel? As much as I would like to see one, I think it is better all round that one is not made. If more are produced, I can see the Johnny English character slowly fading from our minds as a character who was once very funny and enjoyable to watch. Please don't go down the same road as Austin Powers!As a last note, I recommend you do see this movie. Fans of Rowan Atkinson and James Bond will go mental for it, as will all comedy lovers!And remember, the name is English - Johnny English. A Bloody Mary please, not too spicy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great spy spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny English is a great comedy that makes fun of virtually every aspect of super spy thrillers, from the car to the female secret agent who eventually falls in love with the protagonist. The movie concocts a ludicrous plot as a vehicle for the gags that will ensue, and it integrates these gags into the plot quite well. They got the right man for the job, too. Rowan Atkinson is excellent at portraying the completely incompetent Johnny English, who's sidekick, Boff is actually a better agent than he is. Yes I know, the whole sidekick-better-than-hero thing has been used before, but without Boff, the plot probably would have never advanced because English fumbles literally EVERYTHING he does on assignment. So Boff is to just move the film along while English's job in this film is to provide the laughter.One of the things that makes Johnny English such a great spy spoof is because the character himself, at first glance, looks and acts like he's a real secret agent, unlike Austin Powers who looks and behaves like an idiot. English is serious about doing his job, and very confident that he's the best, which is why when he screws up everything its hilarious to see how he reacts and tries to correct his mistakes. One great part is (Spoilers) how he never, ever fires his gun because everytime he does, it breaks! The mood of one of those scenes is great. English is being fired at by a thug, and this fast, action packed music plays. The whole thing plays out like your standard hollywood gunfight, then when English leans out to fire, the top slide of his gun falls off, yet the action music keeps playing.(End of spoiler)Another excellent aspect of Johnny English is how many of the gags carry over in several scenes. This means that a lot of the gags in the movie don't just come and go; they will have some significance later in the movie that will add to the hilarity. Finally, Johnny English is also an excellent comedy because it never has to rely on sex jokes, which in many films these days, are not so subtle because they're so effortlessly made, yet they make the general audience roar with laughter. Johnny English uses some clever, original jokes that are extremely funny. Many will not like this film because it lacks sex jokes, and will simply dismiss it as being corny (which is ridiculous), but if you like a great spy spoof starring Mr. Bean himself, this is truly excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's damn silly, like it should be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) is put in charge of security at a gathering for all the British secret agents, things go badly wrong and he is suddenly the last of his profession left alive. When the crown jewels are mysteriously stolen, he and his sidekick, Bough (Ben Miller) must investigate. The prime suspects are the French entrepreneur (John Malkovich) and the beautiful Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia), he must find the guilty party and save the nation's pride.Rowan Atkinson is simply funny by design, it doesn't seem to matter what role he has to play, or what script he has to deliver; he just always entertains. Malkovich clearly enjoyed his role as the evil villain, and delivered a typically great portrayal; albeit as a very shallow character, and finally Natalie Imbruglia does a great job of looking sexy throughout.Full of sustained and silly humour, this spy spoof is pretty good entertainment, and should satisfy most Rowan Atkinson fans adequately.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing slap stick movie but not more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch the first Johnny English with my son cause he likes Mister Bean a lot and me of course too. The other reason is that actually they show Johnny English - Reborn at the theaters. I really expected more but the story was very simply built. The action and spy scenes were well executed but all a copy from other thriller movies. The funny scenes were therefore good and original. I had to laugh very much at times. The actors especially John Malkovich delivered a credible role as the future King of England. It worked for an entertaining evening but not more. It deserves a good 6.5/10.If you like Rowan Atkinson in other movies so don't miss "Mr. Bean's Holiday". You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rowan Atkinson does about as good of a spy he can do in "Johnny English," and while the film provides enough laughs, some of the story and jokes just fall flat. In a miraculous turn of events following Agent One's surprising death, every last one of the other English spies are killed in an explosion. All except one, that is. Johnny English at long last gets his chance to live out his dream as spy extraordinaire, saving the day and wooing the women. The fact that English is clearly out of his element and utterly clueless is pretty much expected.While the plot seems decent enough for an actual spy movie, some of the problems are pretty glaring. A lot of the jokes are seen coming from miles away while the plot twists are also very predictable.Don't get me wrong, the film is an admirable spoof of spy films and I found it to be pretty funny. There just seemed to be too many breaks in the comedy and too many predictable, cliched scenes for me. This is probably a pretty good movie for kids who like comedy and spy films as it is pretty tame (except for the painfully unfunny "crawling up through the toilets" scene).Overall it is ok, nothing great but not too bad.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of "Black Adder" yet I hate with a passion "Mr. Bean." This film has elements of both, but seems, at least for me, to be heavy on the former. The plot is completely absurd and completely appropriate.The slapstick moments don't work too well since Rowan Atkinson isn't an action star (which is why I hate "Mr. Bean'). It's what happens after the action that got the most laughs from me. SPOILER: There is a "sketch" involving Our Hero using truth serum in one weapon and a super muscle relaxer in another. Unfortunately, the weapons are identical. The results are very funny, just not laugh out loud funny. John English's character is best described as a retarded Inspector Clouseau. Clouseau's superior's lack of confidence - largely undeserved - English more than makes up in near-total incompetence. English is a lot luckier, though.I am glad I didn't spend $20 (me and my date) to see the movie at the theater. It's not worth it. But it's not too painful a DVD rental, provided you don't pay more than $3.50 for it. See it once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Johnny English" is a pretty funny movie but at the same time is not a good one either. There are certainly a number of funny moments thanks to Rowan Atkinson who's comic inventiveness comes through nicely. A few highlights included the car chase sequence and the climax where everything goes wrong for English. But for the most part, the script of this film is weak. You can see this first of all in the silly story, which is just a series of connected comic scenes. But you can also see it in the Johnny English character. I don't think it was a very creative one being modeled too closely to Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau. The filmmakers certainly should have parodied the Bond films a bit more, since the only thing this film shares with that franchise is the MI-7. One Bond element this film really misses is a threatening, diabolical villain, which Pascal Sauvage isn't. He's a pretty flat bad guy overall. He also doesn't have a grand, evil, scheme to attain his goal (which the Bond villains do) making his plans rather boring. Overall, "Johnny English" is worth a look if you're just looking for some mindless fun. Otherwise, look elsewhere.Star Rating: 2.5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSRowan Atkinson stars in another Mr. Bean style role as 'Johnny English' a bumbling secret agent whose task it is to rescue the British crown jewels after they are stolen by a corrupt Frenchman (John Malkovich) who intends to crown himself King of England after forcing the Queen to abdicate. On his way he gets himself into all sorts of mishaps like getting covered in poo and gatecrashing a hospital until he manages to prevent the crowning in Westminster Abbey with a raid which saves the country from becoming a worldwide prison for the world's human rubbish. 'Johnny English' on the whole is wonderfully funny with Rowan Atkinson providing many laughs and John Malkovich's ridiculous French accent make this a must see for all those who liked 'Bean' or the Mr Bean TV series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this spoof of James Bond films, starring the ever-hilarious Rowan Atkinson as the title character. I am a bit biased, being an Atkinson fan--which seems to be an acquired taste, if you ask some folks--but "Johnny English" turned out to be a much better film than I expected it to be. Several things strike you...the quality of the stunts, the authenticity of the sets and props (the Aston Martin was quite a nice touch!), and most notably the restraint with which the characters are rendered by their actors. Having watched the dreadful "Spy Hard" starring Leslie Nielsen just a few days before this flick, it really put "Johnny English" into perspective as a well-made farce. John Malkovich obviously has fun with his froggy French character, Pascal Sauvage; Natalie Imbruglia makes one think that acting is her prime profession. Maybe the reason I liked this one so much was its uncanny resemblance to one of the early Pink Panther films, "A Shot In The Dark", especially in the way English interacts with his sidekick, Bough. Overall, a very well done film, restrained (for Atkinson) but very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightweight &amp; hit and miss (just like Johnny English himself)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1 POSSIBLE SPOILERThis must one of few films based on an advert. To call the adverts for the popular brand of British credit card flimsy and lightweight would be kind and they were only 30 seconds long! This is a 1hr 30 min version of those adverts. There is no doubting that Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius but his role is something we've seen before. It's like watching Bean in a tux and feels recycled. He has funny moments but the jokes are repeated or signposted so far in advance, you feel like your 2 steps ahead of the film makers. Ben Miller, an actor British TV viewers may not even be aware of plays Bough, English's sidekick. The "brains" behind the operation but somewhat underwritten and a definite second fiddle to Atkinson.This leaves us with Natalie Imbruglia, who I haven't seen act since her illustrious days as Beth in Australian soap opera Neighbours. She's not bad but does resort somewhat to figure hugging outfits and riding a motorcycle and some of her delivery is somewhat forced. Last, but not least John Malkovich as Pascal Sauvage - a good chance for some French-bashing, which is sadly the fashion at the moment. Malkovich looks like he is enjoying playing the OTT comedy villain.Whilst it is quite funny and will keep younger audiences quite entertained, it falls short of really laugh-out loud comedy. On a further note, Peter Howitt may want to review his choices of job - Antitrust, Thunderpants and this are not the great beginnings of a fruitful directorial career.Overall, a lightweight comedy which is perfect for young audiences as bad language is kept to a minimum - in fact, I don't remember any major occurances but audiences mid-teen onwards will find this film too easy to second guess in all aspects and not funny and engaging enough despite the short run time. Which is a shame as Rowan Atkinson can be really funny. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very surprised at how funny Johnny English is. This film does not sneer at secret agents. It is not really a parody. It reminds me of those "Road to" movies of Bob Hope in which comedy is weaved with intrigue. It is also like the Pink Panther series and perhaps most like Get Smart television series.Austin Powers is totally different because Austin does not even try to be a story it is so far out. Austin is also much more a parody and is more an attack on things. Johnny English has a lot of style and actually has some very good action scenes too.Johnny's side kick is the wise straight man here and adds stability to the film. The English girl is also very good and plays her part straight and reminds me of agent 99 in Get Smart. What helps this film is that every person acts as if this is a regular spy film and so when Johnny English does something funny it works so well.There are many funny scenes and the audience was laughing very loudly at many scenes. Every time he tried to use his gun it fell apart. A funny scene was when he tried to give an elaborate description of the theft of the Crown Jewels. I would have given this film a 10 if it had not been for the 30 second scene in which Johnny was doused with sewage in a large pipe. Also the naked shot of a Cardinal's rear was unneeded. These gross out scenes only total about one minute of this entire movie. In general this film is not gross humor. It is just plain funny and fine for all ages. I gave it a 9. My 3 daughters loved it.Also this film does not attack the English at all or parody them. It actually has quite a reverence for the Queen. This film is thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atkinson Does Sellers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Rowan Atkinson. I've watched all of the Black Adder series several times over, laughed over every single Mr. Bean episode, and almost coked on my popcorn during the Mr. Bean movie. Yep, I generally can't get enough of Rowan Atkison.This movie was... OK. The pacing was very uneven and the story totally formulaic. This is ostensibly a spoof of James Bond, but it seemed more like Rowan Atkinson as Inspector Clouseau. Much of the film seemed inspired by the Pink Panther series. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, just an observation.Atkinson is a very funny man, and in this film he does three tremendously funny scenes. They would have done Clouseau proud. The rest of the movie does leave a lot to be desired, though. Something is missing. There's a lack of chemistry between Natalie Imbruglia and Atkinson that comes through in their scenes together. The character of Bough, English's incredibly earnest "sidekick," is a little too cliched. He constantly saves the day and comes up with excuses for English's bumbling.John Malkovich's French accent is somewhat grating on the nerves. The first scene in which we hear his character, Sauvage, speak at length plays out rather poorly and takes a good deal of the steam out of the film's sails.This movie has its moments, but I think its appeal will be mainly to Rowan Atkinson fans like myself. If you go into the film watching for his physical humor and generally silly mugging, you won't be disappointed. Those who don't know Atkinson's other work probably won't find much in this movie to keep them in their seats... but try and stick it out for the muscle relaxant/truth serum switcheroo scene. If you've paid to see this movie and miss that scene, you definitely haven't gotten your money's worth. I can't believe there's anyone who wouldn't find that scene one of the funniest on film in a long time, though.</fullReview>

This film is funny, in a Pink Panther way and opens itself to a series of "Johnny English" films.Parts are really funny and other parts you'll find yourself saying "Oh, no!" Finally a comedy that you can laugh at. Note: This is not one of the greatest comedies of all time, but it has potential and delivers much of the time.

		<fullReview>Better than I thought it would be. A lot more subdued than say, Austin Powers, but still kept up a decent comic pace.One major plothole, though. Pardon an American's understanding of the line of succession, but if Queen Elizabeth the Second abdicated, wouldn't the throne then go to Prince Charles? I was of the belief that if a monarch abdicates, they only give up their position on the throne, not their entire line's right to it. You'd pretty much have to pull a King Ralph scenario before the entire house of Windsor has no heirs to the throne and have to find a French claimant.Anyway, John Malkovich does a good job at looking both mildly annoyed and amused at English's antics. Maybe it isn't acting... it pretty much sums up my feeling toward the film, both slightly annoyed and amused.Not the greatest comedy ever by any means, but it has its moments. Quite a few good laughs in this. I give it a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We got to a Universal Studios screening of Johnny English last night... will be very interesting to see how its droll English humour will play in Peoria.You have some very subtle funny Brit humour going on, and then there is the flat out hilarity of Bean. His self-effacing and bumbling got on my boyfriend's nerves. Everyone else is doing a spy comedy and here is this buffoon in its midst. Boyfiend calls it Jar-Jar Binks syndrome.Oh wait, is his name Johnny English this go-round? He's still Mr. Bean. Will an American viewer even *get* the British Civil Service humour of this pic? The whole French/English polarity and all the Brit pageantry, well presented but will it play in Peoria?We also saw Garage Days this week and it was gut-wrenchingly funny. This film was titter-funny by comparison, but whatever the film lacks, it more than makes up for in budget. It was certainly well-done. The soundtrack was great - the filmography top notch, the sets were fantastic, the art direction was great. Character names like Carlos Vendetta give a clue.I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it, but was thinking that John Malkovich doesn't *do* bad films, but sorry to say he phoned this one in. By the middle of the flick he was just doing classic Malkovich -- with a French Accent.The best part was the obligatory blockbuster chase scene. Credit to this team for making the chase scene FUNNY. Truly really funny.In summation: if you love bathroom humour, don't miss this. If you love a film where you can see things coming, and enjoy films that are meant to be fun for the whole family, come on in. No blood, few swear words, many shots fired but no visible carnage. It was funny. OK I am being harsh. It was funny. But, whatever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny English: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three types of British comedy. There's the snooty unfunny type (Gosford Park), the funny one-liner type (Murder by Death), and pure slapstick (Johnny English). There's no humor in Johnny English that isn't slapstick. And shoot me, I fell for it! I laughed when English interrupted a funeral, I chuckled whenever English didn't realize something, and, by Jove, I even cracked a smile when he was climbing up through a public latrine. It's no Austin Powers, but Johnny English does its business (no pun intended) as yet another spoof of the spy genre and making us laugh.Rowan Atkinson, who you may remember as the voice of Zazu in The Lion King or the narcoleptic from Rat Race, makes this work. No one else's bumbling (and I mean BUMBLING) enough to take on the roll of Johnny English. Although he's a bad actor, he portrays the right amount of camp to pull off this role. It's because of Atkinson that this movie was a huge hit over in its country of the United Kingdom. If it had been someone else, the wacky charm of English wouldn't work.The lame brained plot had bumbling English as the lowest agent at MI7. However, when everyone else is killed, he's the only man for the job of protecting the crown jewels, and, of course they're stolen. He thinks that Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich) (where DO they get their names?), the man who donated money to help restore the jewels, did it, but doesn't have proof, so he goes and tries to prove it. Along the way, the obligatory love interest is Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia, her movie career may be like her music career: a one-hit wonder).I could live on slapstick humor. Although at times it's crude (see opening paragraph), and there are quite a few lulls, with some jokes going on for too long, Johnny English is a great example of a non-summer summer movie. It's foreign, it's PG but not completely aimed towards kids, it doesn't have huge stars, it isn't animated, and it's pretty funny. It's a breath of relief from the barrage of action sequels we've been getting.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for comic nudity, some crude humor, and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Bond he isn't, but he's also not Inspector Clouseau. Instead, Rowan Atkinson is `Johnny English', Secret Agent `1', a sort-of hybrid of the suave Roger Moore, and the bumbling Peter Sellars. While the film has some fine moments of comedy, it doesn't quite hit its target on overall creativity or ingenuity. This really isn't Atkinson's fault, but more that of the filmmakers, none of whom have ever made a comedy before.As is the case with `secret agent' movies, the overall framework of `Johnny English' follows the traditional spy-thriller formula. Here, English is a lower-grade agent with her majesty's secret service, but when a bomb kills literally all other agents, he is the only one left to be assigned the responsibility of guarding the crown jewels of England. After they are stolen, his job then is to recover them. The villain is Pascal Sauvage, played by John Malkovich, a very distant descendent of French royalty, who owns the largest and most successful prison construction and management company in the world. His plan is to dethrone the Queen of England, take her place as the new king, and exercise the little-known rite of reclaiming all the land in the UK in his own name. What does he plan to do with the island-nation? Turn it into a huge prison that would house all the criminals of the world.Uh. Right. Well, anyway, the film's framework mirrors the 007 spy-thriller, including the plot, the gadgets and the female counterparts; this isn't surprising, since the screenwriters are Robert Wade and Neal Purvis, co-writers for the last two Bond films, `Die Another Day' and `The World is not Enough.' The star of the film being Rowan Atkinson, you'd think that there would be more `Mr. Bean' style comedy, since this was his signature caricature for which most people know him. To his credit, Atkinson portrays a more intelligent agent than the simple-minded Mr. Bean, and his natural comedic abilities extend beyond what we've seen from him before. In one scene involving his mixing up two drugs, a truth serum and a muscle relaxant, I was in tears laughing for a good five minutes, even though the entire skit was predictable and not very creative.While Atkinson's work was well done, `Johnny English' doesn't really overcome its downsides: the comedy feels inconsistent, the plot line is sloppy, and the supporting characters don't compliment Atkinson's style of humor. Unlike Peter Sellar's `little yellow friend', Kato, in the Pink Panther series, Atkinson's `straight man', Bough, is more of prop than a catalyst to the antics. These and other problems are more due to the fact that the director, Peter Howitt II, and the aforementioned screenwriters, have never made a comedy before. They are just too inexperienced to best exploit Atkinson's talents or the finer details of comedic cinema.It's hard to recommend `Johnny English' overall, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it for the bits and pieces that were fun. I do hope he tries again, though. He definite has more promise than I'd expected.</fullReview>

Rowan Atkinson is just a very talented comedian, and you can sometimes in Johnny English see a little from Mr. Bean and his character come back, but that gives the movie a little extra. I haven't laughed that much since "Rat Race". I was kind of afraid that it was going to be a very un-funny movie because of the bad critics on the Internet and in the (Dutch) newspapers, but there aren't just no not funny movies in this film. I laughed my longues (longen in Dutch) out at the scene were Johnny English is climbing in the tunnel at the island of John Malkovich's character, and then al the pee (I don't really know the exact English word for it, but in Dutch you can call it 'stront') comes over him.

		<shortDescription>There seems to be a spate of secret agent spoofs doing the movie circuit at the moment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson starred in the American spoof, I Spy, which was screened in Te Awamutu in February. Now it's the turn of rubbery-faced English comedian Rowan Atkinson to take on the role of bumbling secret agent Johnny English in this far superior spoof of the Bond movies, directed by Peter Howitt. The film sees the bumbling Johnny English promoted to the role of secret agent after his lack of security training inadvertently causes the deaths of Britain's other secret agents. After Britain's crown jewels are stolen by the lunatic Frenchman Pascal Sauvage, played with a comical French accent by American actor John Malkovich, English stumbles upon a plot where the Frenchman will turn the UK into a gigantic prison colony after being crowned king. Only English, his subordinate Bough (Ben Miller) and the mysterious Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia) can stand in his way. Atkinson's antics as Blackadder and Mr Bean are now world famous and many of the situations English lands himself in would seem at home in either serial. While the film is far cleaner than any Blackadder episode it's far funnier than any Mr Bean instalment. There's a particularly Blackadderesque scene when English battles a non-existent assailant in the Tower of London. While Atkinson really plays himself, the true comic moments come through his interaction with the straight-laced Bough, who delivers every line with deadpan seriousness. Australian-born Imbruglia, of course, provides a love interest for English in her big screen debut, but whose side is she on? Johnny English is bound to do little for Anglo-Franco relations, with a radio announcer suggesting the Brits ring in with the ten things they like most about the French during the lead up to Sauvage's coronation. `So far we've had no calls,' he says. Johnny English (PG) is a rollicking good laugh for all, but will be most appreciated by the English viewer who will see it in its real context. The film is now showing at The Regent Theatre, Te Awamutu, and is a must for any Blackadder or Mr Bean fan. Don't forget to sit through the credits for a final laugh.</fullReview>

And to add to all that - an amazing car chase, thats far more spectacular and hilarious than anything from James Bond or Fast and the Furious.Yes many scenes were predictable, but that just added to the giggles.

Some reasonable action set pieces, a lot of laughs, definitely worth an hour and a half of your time.In difference to some of the other reviews - Johnny has had the requisite spy training, and isnt completely clueless(seeing as from the start he knows who the villain is) - merely very clumsy and incompetent.Perhaps I went in the right mood to see the movie, but the line about whistling in the right pitch still cracks me up, even when it's obvious what's going to happen.Not worth buying on DVD, but definitely worth a cinema or rental view.Probably wont go down too well in France!Just scrapes a 7/10, I feel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ludicrous plot is as follows: French businessman Pascal Sauvage plots to steal the Crown Jewels so that he can become King of England. When secret agent Number One is killed during his latest mission, Johnny English played by Rowan Atkinson becomes his successor as a result of a bomb wiping out all other feasible contenders. English's mission is to stop Sauvage and his evil plan becoming a reality. Needless to say, this is a very silly movie but it does have some genuinely funny set-pieces -I was relieved to find that these were not just restricted to the ones that I'd seen in the trailer. In many ways Johnny English is as inept and clumsy as the Mr Bean character but sidekick Bough (Ben Miller) is nearby to clean up the messes that English finds himself in. Much of the comedic value is derived from the fact that this assistance is never acknowledged by English. John Malkovich plays the bad guy and hams it up with an over-the-top French accent while Natalie Imbruglia is an effective and pretty ?English' girl.This is definitely not the film for you if you are after something intellectual as the comedy is simple and unsophisticated. However, if you like Rowan Atkinson or if you are a fan of the Mr Bean character, you will have a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is worth seeing once, and you won't feel like you've wasted precious time. It's rather funny (in it's slapstick style), but do not expect any kind of profound message or anything. The plot is silly to the extreme, and Atkinson does a pretty good job of playing the bumbling fool. You can see lots of the jokes coming, but that doesn't really stop them being funny.I prefer Rowan Atkinson in his "Blackadder" guise (series three and four though for those in the know), but I presume he makes more money this way. Fair enough. As I said, it's worth seeing once, but I won't go to buy the DVD once it's out. That would be a waste of precious resources... :-) Final mark: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never expected anything huge from this movie because I knew it was meant to be fun and give a few laughs. I thought it did up to it's genre, although I think Rowan Atkinson was his funniest in the tv eps of "Mr Bean". I guess that many people are going to compare it to the much franchised "Austin Powers", I mean true this movie didn't produce as many laughs in comparison to the latter but I believe it made it's own little niche in the comedy-spy movies.I love John Malkovich as any kind of villain, his passive attitude to Johnny making a fool of himself was funny. I thought that Natalie Imbruglia did a good job as Lorna Campbell, again you can't expect oscar winning performances in a movie like this. Ben Miller was great as Bough, the smart side kick of Johnny.I suggest that if you like Rowan Atkinson's comedy then watch this</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amiable is really the word. But it should be a word stressed mutedly; while amiable and innocent humour is indeed not a bad thing in today's cinema, the sheer predictability and one-note nature of the comedy drains one's enthusiasm for the venture.Ingredients for this slight comedy:Rowan Atkinson - pitched into a comfort zone of competent, uninspired slapstick. Perfecly comfortable with the material, and certainly makes the most of it; his seasoned delivery sounding like Blackadder, but coming from a character who is like a jumped-up Bean.Barclays adverts - much impatient shouting of "Bough!" from Atkinson as per usual, and a certain degree of corporate smugness.John Malkovich - awful, horrendously cliched 'Frenchman' sterotype, hammed up with an absurd accent.Jingoism - this film fails to really get a handle at all on modern Britain, or even a plausible fantasy Britain, yet feels justified in running out anti-French jibes fitting for the knacker's yard... or indeed, "Blackadder Back &amp; Forth", a dire production made for the Millenium Dome, Murdoch and the BBC, bizarrely.Refreshing pleasures - the general line of innocent humour; much needed really, and puts it in a happier ballpark than "Austin Powers" (a series I have found unimpressively crude and poor on more viewings than one; one-trick really). Ah, the graveyard scene here is brilliantly played; old comic techniques really, but well, genuinely funny in a seasoned manner. A lack of pretension at being more than it is, and a refreshing lack of sexual/romantic elements needlessly included to suit a demographic.Natalie Imbruglia - But, what is she doing here? A pointless inclusion from an actress seemingly lacking, and not even really given a chance. Just there as a token female presence and to do the fashionable 'kickass'-ery.Overall, pleasant enough, ambling viewing. It doesn't really deserve any praise in the grand scheme, but there are far worse and more detestable films out there.Rating:- ***/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * BrilliantWARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Johnny English, Gentleman spy.Nah, actually it's more like Johnny English,complete pillock.That's more or less the premise of comedian, Rowan Atkinsons latest movie.A character taken from a series of adverts for Barclay card over here in the UK some years ago, Johnny English(In the adverts he was called Latham)is Britains answer to Inspector Clouseau and Frank Drebin.Supposedly a secret agent,(even though he is confined to a desk job behind the highly secured walls of MI5)Johnny can do nothing but dream of a life of daring do,amazing escapes,brilliant gadgets and the added bonus of fast cars and attractive woman.That all changes however when all of MI5's top agents are killed when attending the funeral of a fellow agent who was killed in the line of duty.Every single one bar Johnny (He was side tracked by his boss who was speaking with him) is killed in an explosion caused by the planting of a bomb within the late man's coffin.With no other agents left Johnny's boss Pegasus(Tim Piggot Smith)has no other choice but to asign the incompetent nit wit and his young assistant Bough(Ben Miller)to the task of protecting the crown Jewels.However things don't go well and the prescious royal antique is stolen by henchman of the evil french millionaire,Pascal Savague(John Malkovich)a distant relation to the royal family who also owns a chain of prisons world wide.He plots to some how over throw the Queen and become Great Britains next monarch.As the story moves along Atkinson's Johnny meets Natalie Imbrughlia's gorgeous,intelligent and feisty agent from Interpole who begins to rather strangely fall for the oaf that English is.Not with out telling him that he is one at first though.As comedies go 'Johnny English' may not exactly be inspiring.Let's face it we've pretty much seen this kind of thing before.An inept, police man, agent or what ever who manages to some how save the world. Let's face it.He's not really that different form Atkinson's other comedic creation Mr.Bean.Both characters are complete idiots.It's simply just a variation of the personae.Plus the whole little gut manages to win through is the cliche of so many movies these day's. Not only that but you have Malkovich sporting a truly laughable french accent on top of that.The film despite these flaws isn't all together bad.The performance by the cast in general is of grade A quality.(Even though you have to listen to Malkovich's accent).Atkinson as ever is entertaining to watch as well as there are some genuinely humerous moments in the film.English mistaking a a crowd of mourners at a funeral for being henchman of Savagues.His bungling in to trying to break in to one of the villains company skyscrapers where he is throwing a gala.Then theres the films finale which see English at the coronation of Savague(who has indeed managed to over throw the Queen)as he tries to idiotically try to expose him for the crimminal genius that he is.All in all it's an amiable enough movie that you could take your kids to see.(They probably pester you to take them to see it).But if you don't have kids I would advise you to wait for the video or DVD.Robs Rating: * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I haven't had so much belly-laughing in a cinema for AGES. This is really, really, truly funny. A comic spy spoof **par excellence**. Rowan Atkinson does mock suavity to absolute perfection. The script is so tight; and it's absolutely great to see John Malkovich do a light-hearted fun story for once, just to show he's a truly all-round top class actor.(Spoiler warning!)My only slight criticism was the ultimate climactic moment, which stretched internal credibility a little bit too far I thought - though it was still fun, and fitted the style of the story I suppose. Otherwise the story was absolutely tight, spot-on with every gag perfectly placed and timed. Most notable was the threat to the Queen, and the radio overplays. And the ABBA tributes were great too (they are my fav band, so I suppose I'm a touch biased there).I think Natalie Imbruglia should thank her lucky stars she managed to have such a great film to make her debut on. This is very rare; I can only think of Edward Furlong and Edward Norton as the only other actors to manage it. Anyone who likes great fun storytelling should definitely check this out. It's made my Top 100 list, right behind the Austin Powers movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thing since The Naked Gun trilogy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supposedly the British version to the ever successful "Naked Gun" trilogy (yes, THOSE movies with Leslie Nielsen), Johnny English goes beyond the usual butt jokes of normal spy spoof movies and takes a look at the world of espionage through the eyes of a nobody - namely Mr. English himself.Rowan Atkinson is without a doubt one of the masters of British humour. Forever remembered for his role as Mr. Bean, he does excellently to play Johnny English, as a bumbling spy who contradicts himself, collapses the simplest of plans and makes a complete idiot of himself - all in a good cause. English is seen replacing a deceased British spy, who was in a case to uncover the attempt to rob the Crown Jewels of England. English's "anti-French like" behaviour plays a vital role in the movie, as he uncovers the mastermind behind the plot - one Pascal Sauvage (played handsomely by John Malkovich).Wherever English goes, he doesn't leave without his trusty sidekick, Bough (played by Ben Miller). Miller does well in his debut frontline role as the clever and more wise Bough. I really see big things for him in Hollywood. As for the wonderful singer Natalie Imbruglia (who plays undercover spy Lorna Campbell), she dazzles the audience with her kick-ass attitude and her sophisticated wit. Not bad for a debut role! But as ever, Atkinson steals the show with his bumbling plans, his idiocy and his humour in an attempt to save England and all its citizens. The film has its fair share of memorable scenes and punchlines, nonetheless the ending where Johnny and Lorna share a passionate embrace only for English's elbow to accidentally hit the ejector seat button and shoot Ms. Campbell high into the sky!!!As spoof movies go, Johnny English is a marvel. It is probably the best film Rowan Atkinson has made so far, and probably the best since the "Naked Gun" trilogy. I loved it so much, I would recommend anyone to see this movie. If the Americans welcome it with open arms in the Summer, I shall be a very happy man!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Rowan Atkinson, so I was excited to see him in a rare movie leading role (the last was Bean in 1997), and I wasn't disappointed. This film is full of funny moments, and only a few of the jokes don't really hit the mark. Atkinson and Ben Miller are both good value as the spy duo, with Miller playing the more deadpan role to Atkinson's mugging, and Imbruglia makes an okay movie debut, but Malkovich lets it down with a terrible French accent and a genuinely annoying performance. Then again, maybe that was his aim. It's full of wit, both erbal and physical, and is a good way to spend an evening. Just leave your brain behind, sit back and have a good laugh in spite of yourself. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rowan Atkinson is a great comedy character actor in films such as BEAN, Rat Race, Four Weddings etc and this is no different. As one comment has just said, this is 90 minutes of harmless fun.Harmless it is, well made it is, but something which i have taken away after seeing this is how funny it is.Mr Bean was a really good character who now seems to have been used too much, although the film did have some hilarious moments, as does this.The premise was ok, a good character from some very funny old commercials for Barclaycard and the film extends those adverts into a film.The end product was actually better than i had expected.Ok some of the gags were signposted well in advance but each one was wonderfully done and then there were scenes of comedic genius such as the car chase and the funeral.The writers of THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH and DIE ANOTHER DAY were behind this one and that was comforting to know because in the last bond film the plot was good but sometimes TOO spectacular and too little thinking time. This film at times could have been a decent bond movie.Although it isnt and it is a very funny, easy to watch adventure/comedy film to be enjoyed time and time again.When does it come out on DVD?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny EnglishIt's unavoidable that people will try to judge this film by making comparisons to Atkinson's other characters and all the James Bond spoofs out there. But so great the success of Mr Bean and the BBC TV series Blackadder to name but a few, it was always going to be judged that way.Johnny English, as commented before, was the character of a series of credit card adverts in the mid-90s. However, to transpose a character that appeared in 30 second sketches into a movie isn't easy, given people already has a perception of him. And that's the real problem of Johnny English.The start of the film is a little uneasy - we're looking for gags, but they don't come often enough, but that rectifies itself from about half way. But sadly, the originality that we saw in the adverts is lost in most of the movie. Ok, there were moments of brilliance - the car chase scene was original and hilarious - but many of the gags, especially the finale, were simply remakes of those from Naked Gun.I am biased, though. Rowan Atkinson is one of Britain's funniest comedy actors, and his creations are simply brilliant. His stand-up video is hilarious, Mr Bean has become a worldwide success and his recent parody of the Martin Bashir / Michael Jackson interview for Comic Relief, a charity telethon in the UK, epitomised his comedy genius.But the script and the plot lets down the whole concept of the film. There simply wasn't enough of a buzz throughout the film to make you feel satisfied when leaving the cinema. I was looking for a little bit of hidden intelligence in the character of Johnny English, but sadly it never appeared and there was just too much slapstick in it.But in a way, the cast salvaged the movie. Natalie Imbruglia is great in the movie, although I'm slightly surprised that other people are surprised she was so good - in the UK she's more well-known as a singer, but her days in Neighbours as Beth before that did show she can act very well.Mind you, I can't say the same for John Malkovitch. You'd get a better French accent on a end of a baguette than from him.Ultimately, though, this is a film that has the laughs, and though there is a slight disappointment that you don't get everything you want, it is a very funny film. One to recommend to Hollywood, in case you think all Brits are like Hugh Grant or Pierce Brosnan...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfunny spy spoof (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Johnny English" is the latest in the spy spoof genre, and attempting to make its mark as a British 'Austin Powers'. Yet to do this, you need a successful ensemble of characters. Part of what made 'Austin Powers' work is the gallery of memorable characters such as Powers, Dr Evil, Mini-Me, Scott Evil, etc. But "Johnny English" doesn't have this, instead servicing as a vehicle for "Blackadder" star Rowan Atkinson. The rest of the actors don't get enough decent material, and the film feels imbalanced and uneven as a result.Johnny English (Atkinson) is a bumbling inept nerd working for the British Secret Service. He and his sidekick Bough (Ben Stiller) team up with Australian agent Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia) to stop scheming French tycoon Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich) gaining the throne of the British monarchy...The laughs don't come thick and fast in this one. Too much of the comedy seems forced or lame, the worst example being a scene where Johnny climbs up a sewage pipe into a men's lavatory, getting showered with raw excrement in the process.On television, Atkinson is a normally quite dependable comedy performer, good at self-mocking pomposity ("Blackadder") or slapstick physical comedy ("Mr Bean"). Here he attempts a little bit of both and the results are ineffective. Ben Stiller, barring a good scene in a car park, is mostly wasted as the straight man sidekick. Natalie Imbruglia looks great but can't generate any chemistry at all playing the love interest. As the villain of the piece, Malkovich is given absolutely no funny lines whatsoever and instead relies on a ridiculous French accent to generate what little laughs he can.Poorly directed, written and acted, "Johnny English" is a desperately unfunny disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny English is a pretty lifeless attempt at comedy. English is a blatant copy of the Naked Gun, and Pink Panther films. With the unfortunate exception that it's not funny.The film is relatively short, but the pace is very slow. Any attempts at a joke are signaled in advance, which makes it all rather pointless. The humour is pretty low as well (think getting hit on the head, bare bottoms, and poo). I half-chuckled three times or so - that's it.It's a mystery they didn't work more on the script, as the action scenes look fairly expensive. It should have been better, but as it is now they really must have been scraping the bottom of the barrel. [1/10]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the success of the Bond films in the 1960s, there was a whole gamut of '007' copies, some serious and some spoofs. With a few notable exceptions, Michael Caine's Harry Palmer springs to mind, they were all derivative and basically rubbish. In the 1970s, the UK's output seemed to consist of unimaginative film versions of popular TV comedy. They were all rubbish. Even the decent TV shows (Dad's Army, Steptoe and Son) were pale copies of the original programmes.So what do we have here to herald the British Film Industry's entry into the 21st century? A Bond spoof that's an adaptation of a TV advert for god's sake! What's worse, it's so obviously geared to the US market. Well, believe it or not, my American cousins, we are not all middle class snobs and buffoons; where the only thing that is of any importance is our obsession with the monarchy. How would you like it if someone made a film about how all Americans are loud, culture-less slobs who are only interested in eating?See, it's not funny either.</fullReview>

He was not funny in any way. He wasn't cool in any way. His whole performance I felt was very laboured and forced and unoriginal and stupid and just whatever...Natalie Imbruglia will never act in another movie ever again, I promise.

That was just absurd and totally unconvincing.I have no idea what John Malkovic, one of the greatest actors of the 21st century, was thinking.

		<fullReview>Rowan Atkinson stars in a film version of a spy he portrayed in a load of adverts for a credit card in the 1990s, and, as those brief ads were quite entertaining, one would think that this would undeniably translate well into a film. What a shame that it ultimately turned out to be a missed opportunity. Actually, that's a big understatement, as we shall see...Atkinson plays Johnny English, the secret agent assigned to prevent anyonefrom stealing the Crown Jewels. Unfortunately, being him, and this being acomedy, he stuffs up in spectacular fashion and the jewels disappear. His only real assistance comes from Bough (Ben Miller) and Interpol agent LornaCampbell (Natalie Imbruglia). But can they catch prime suspect FrenchmanPascal Sauvage (John Malkovich) and foil his plans?OK, that's basic plot out of the way. And I do mean 'basic' -- and that's being generous.'Johnny English' really is a pretty lame effort, and you wonder what kind ofsubstances the makers were taking when a potentially great idea is reduced to juvenile and/or predictable humour. The sight gags and so forth can be seen a mile off, and the over-use of jokes about bottoms and poo really do not endear grown-ups to this (in fact, when I saw this in the cinema I don't think I heard even so much as a titter from the adults there). And, to be perfectly honest, I really am getting seriously ticked off with the overused idea of spoof spies practicing martial arts moves whilst doing lame Bruce Lee-style wails; THAT GAG'S BEENDONE TO DEATH! The film is also undeniably racist and I wonder what certaincountries made of it.Not even the title song (sung by the one and only Robbie Williams) can save it from being anything more than dumb. It's not awful, and it's not boring, but it could, and should, have been a lot better than it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an extension of the Barclaycard ads that Rowan Atkinson made a few years back, and he is here complete with his assistant Bough (well played by Ben Miller). UK viewers will remember some of the gags from the ads which are repeated here (the pen that shoots a dart for instance). However, this is a solid film that gains laughs consistently throughout. It will appeal more to kids than any other type of audience, and many of the laughs are from the slapstick style of Mr Bean than the verbal dexterity of Atkinson's best character, Blackadder. There's nothing really original or different in the way perhaps that there was in, say, Austin Powers 2 to take another Bond spoof as an example, but it's an entertaining hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Funny Despite Bad Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Johnny English better then anticipated. I heard some bad things about it but it just goes to show that sometimes movie reviews aren't always right. The continuous slapstick comedy kept the movie interesting even in the more "serious scenes." It was little predictable but the anticipation of seeing if you were right and the initial delivery left me roaring. Typical Mr.Bean comedy but it's still classic. Being a huge Malkovich fan, I thought he was so funny as Pascal Sauvage. You gotta love Malkovich in every part he plays. Rowan Atkinson was on his A-game. The timing and the jokes were hilarious. My side was aching after laughing so hard. *SPOILER* Going in a crap shoot to get upstairs into the castle, just the makes me laugh. Anyway i highly recommend this movie if you Mr. Bean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the Funniest British comedy since A Fish Called Wanda. Americans should love this,it makes fun of James Bond and the French. I have not seen a comedy as laugh out loud as this for quite awhile. Rowan Atkinson is Superb as the inept spy. The Action Scenes are better than Die Another Day,More realistic too. John Malkovich makes a better Villain than most of the recent Bond movies have produced. This is Better than Goldmember and Die Another Day. A Great Family Comedy. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable comedy that will have you smiling often and make you laugh out loud once or twice.Not the first James Bond comedy rip off and won't be the last either the possibilities are too fertile. There have been better parodies though - David Niven for one.Comparisons with Rowan Atkinson's other creations are unavoidable. In this movie our hero is played like the Black Adder of Season one. At times a wibbling oinker but at others insightful and ingenious. He manages to mess his own plans up every time yet still gets to be in the right place at the right time. He drives really well but accidentally presses the eject button at the most inopportune moment - you get the idea. It isn't Mr Bean.Not a must-see movie but if it comes on you can put the remote down and relax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a sudden attack on the MI5, Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson), Britain's most confident yet unintelligent spy, becomes Britain's only spy.Others have commented that your enjoyment of this film will depend on whether or not you are a fan of Rowan Atkinson. As a spy parody, it is not that good, and comes nowhere near the level of "Spy hard" or "Austin Powers". But for an Atkinson film, it happens to be alright, at least as good if not better than his Mr. Bean character.The redeeming quality is the supporting cast. John Malkovich is always great, even when a role is beneath him. And Natalie Imbruglia? What a clever casting choice. I only know her as the singer of "Torn", but apparently she has a few more tricks up her sleeve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predicitable and Somewhat Uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all of the other agents in MI-7 are killed the British government calls upon the services of "Johnny English" (Rowan Atkinson) to investigate a case which their top spy was working on prior to his demise. Assisting him is his loyal backup "Bough" (Ben Miller) who is as adept in the secret agent business as Johnny English is incompetent. In any case, Johnny English's first assignment is to ensure that the newly polished Crown Jewels are kept safe and secure so that the Queen is able to inspect them. When they subsequently stolen Johnny English leaps in to action. Or in his case bumbles into it. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that although it was quite predictable and somewhat uneven it was still rather funny all the same. That said, while Ben Miller and Natalie Imbruglia (as "Lorna Campbell") certainly turned in credible performances, it was Rowan Atkinson who clearly carried this film in spite of the weaknesses mentioned earlier. In any case, I rate this movie as slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny English (2003): Dir: Peter Howitt / Cast: Rowan Atkinson, John Malkovich, Natalie Imbruglia, Ben Miller, Oliver Ford Davies: Spoof of a sub genre that has been spoofed many times. The writers didn't hurt themselves on plot ideas so they came up with a concept that is as old as rocks. It regards the stealing of the Queen's crown jewels that agent Johnny English was suppose to protect. He is the only agent available because the others died in an explosion. The rest involves English and his constant miscalculations and mishaps. Conclusion is effective due to timing and directing by Peter Howitt. He previously made Sliding Doors as well as the idiotic Antitrust. Rowan Atkinson has good intentions but he mugs every scene to the point where the jokes misfire. John Malkovich as the French heir is uninteresting, which is unfortunate considering the quality of actor Malkovich is. Natalie Imbruglia as a female agent is useless because her role renders her merely as an attraction. Ben Miller plays English's smart sidekick in what is clearly a reference to the superior Pink Panther films. Oliver Ford Davies plays an Archbishop who manages to fall victim to the prat falls of a bad script as well. The film could have examined the idea of multiple agents but everything including the phony sets is tiring until Atkinson succeeds in burying the idea that was already buried. Score: 4 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silly but fun James Bond spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny English fantasises about being Britain's top agent; then following a mistake by English he is Britain's only agent! This means that he and his sidekick Bough are put in charge of security of the unveiling of the recently cleaned Crown Jewels. Inevitably they are stolen. He is convinced that the man responsible is man who funded their cleaning; Pascal Sauvage? mostly because he is French. He superiors don't agree and order him to stay away from Sauvage. Luckily he doesn't and more through luck than judgement he learns what Sauvage; he doesn't just want the jewels he wants to be made king so he can put Britain to a new use.Anybody expecting anything serous will be disappointed but if you enjoy a bit of silliness this is quite fun. Rowan Atkinson is great in the lead role; making us believe in this ridiculous character. Being an obvious spoof of the Bond films there is some action and this is done surprisingly well with comic twists; I particularly enjoyed the chases scene and the scene where English parachutes onto the wrong building. There are also some delightfully silly moments such as when English interrupts a funeral, has problems at a sushi bar and tackles the Archbishop of Canterbury. There is little to offend here; the most shocking moment being the sight of the Archbishop's bare backside? more something to laugh at than be offended by. John Malkovich delightfully hams it up as Sauvage, Ben Miller is solid as Bough and Natalie Imbruglia is fine as Interpol agent Lorna Campbell. Overall a fun enough way to pass an hour and a half? not bad considering English and Bough started off as characters in an advert for a credit card.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Bond Spoof! (SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Universal Pictures, StudioCanal and Working Title Films have created a fine spoof of 007, known as Johnny English. Rowan Atkinson, known for playing Mr. Bean, Blackadder and starring in a James Bond movie (Never Say Never Again) plays the lead role in this comedy. Johnny English is basically a fool who is upgraded to MI-7 intelligence duties after an explosion leaves the other agents dead. He is totally unqualified for the job, but always gets it done. Just as with his other roles, Rowan Atkinson plays this role finely with sharp wit. The supporting cast was rather well rounded. Ben Miller as Bough, the more sensible one, you have Natalie Imbruglia as INTERPOL Agent Lorna Campbell, though she is way out of the lead character's league, being rather well rounded on this project. Then you have John Malkovich as Pascal Sauvage, the jumped up Frenchman as they put it, with a horrible French accent meant for laughs.Released April 11, 2003 in the UK and July 18, 2003 in the US, this film is rated PG for comic nudity, some crude humor and language in the US. In the UK, it is rated PG for mild language and comic violence. I can say those ratings were deserved due to a couple of mild profanities and a few seconds seeing a man's bare backside which is played for laughs.To compare to Austin Powers, I would say this is superior due to it not being as crude in order to get laughs. Austin Powers took it a bit too far in some scenes, whereas this is cleaner and wittier. Don't get me wrong, Austin Powers, I find funny, but a little risqué sometimes, therefore taking away some of my enjoyment of the film.Johnny English is not a laugh until you're crying movie, but a clever, witty, sublime film for the family to enjoy!The DVD has some nice extras added, including making of, spy tips, etc. Presented in 1.85:1 widescreen with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond turns upside down!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It looks like James Bond turns upside down as Rowan Atkinson stars in this spy spoof where England's intelligence agency becomes under attack, leaving the confident but blundering Johnny English (Atkinson) the only spy agent to save his country from a villainous despot. Filmed with fast-paced action and endless gags and humor, this film will surely entertain you from start to finish. Singer Natalie Imbruilia portrays Johnny English's partner-in-crime and they made a great team together; their chemistry is just hilarious. And, John Malkovich makes a fitting villain for the movie. The shower scene where Johnny dances to ABBA's "Does Your Mother Know" was one of, I think, the most memorable scenes - gives a hilarious new perspective view of the song!Overall, a very entertaining film and, like all spoofs, not to be taken seriously. But, it's filmed in a way that is tastefully done and not overbearingly stupid. Grade B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Made Me Laugh - What More Needs To Be Said?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is essentially a spoof movie - and it's a pretty good one at that. Clearly, what's being spoofed here is James Bond. In this case, Johnny English (played brilliantly by Rowan Atkinson) is a low ranking official with the British Secret Service who ends up (partly due to his own incompetence) becoming Britain's leading secret agent. And just in time, because French super-criminal Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovitch) is about to steal not only the crown jewels of England, but also the crown and throne of England, in a plot to make himself King.It's preposterous - and it's supposed to be. It is, after all, a spoof movie. It's not as outrageous as what is probably its nearest relative - the Austin Powers series - but in a way, because it does cloak itself with an aura of seriousness, that makes it funnier. Atkinson, as you would expect, does a great job portraying the bumbling English, and there are several very funny scenes, leading up to English taking on Sauvage at the latter's coronation.The basic success of this movie is measured by the fact that it did indeed make me laugh out loud on a number of occasions. That's what it's intended to do - so give it credit. My only real problem with it was that it at times seemed to have a bit of an awkward flow, but then again in a movie of this type the story is really quite secondary. This wasn't made to present a well structured and suspenseful story. It was made to be funny. And in that it succeeded admirably. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny English is what it promises to be ? an amusing and light-heard film. But what would you expect from Rowan Atkinson, the actor in Mr Bean? There are some strikingly funny scenes in the movie. But be prepared for some outlandish humour and chauvinistic jokes. But be prepared also for 007 and Austin Powers-style gadgets, which (I hope) you'll also laugh at, as I did.However, there are some weaker aspects to the film. For example, the movie portrays Chinese people as the bad guys and, in a way, vilifies them (though there are certainly bad apples in the Chinese race). Another one is that thinking logically, you would find some scenes improbable.In short, though this movie was a bit short of in-depth food for thought, it was a quite funny and light-hearted comedy. Very suitable if you're just looking for an hour or so of laughter and nothing in-depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I have to say that if you expect a real James Bond parody this is not your movie. You ´ll be disappointed. But this no surprise. There were more attempts and they never really worked. But if you like Rowan Atkinson and Natalie Imbruglia this movie is quiet entertaining. Atkinson is really a show of it´s own and I think this film is just a vehicle for him. Imbruglia is really good in her part. I hope we will see more of her next time. It´s true most of the gags are not new( some are directly taken from The Naked Gun I believe) but the editing is fast enough that they still work. Some of them are a bit tasteless. But that´s one´s own choice. The story is weak but that is not very important for this kind of movie. Many action films this movie takes off even have not a good story. To be short. If you don´t take it too seriously and don´t expect too much you will have two entertaining hours. If you are really a Bond fan simply forget it. I give it 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truely painful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Johnny English and was kinda expecting some mild laughs as the adverts I remembered were quite entertaining. What I saw was a painful experience and reminded me of a visit to the dentists.Rowan Atkinson has created 2 characters that have gained success, the first was Blackadder and the second was Mr Bean. They are totally different approaches to comedy and generally you like one or the other but not both. Bean was a success in the US as a comedy british character and fell around alot, Blackadder used sarcasm and a sharp wit to create humour. Unfortunately Johnny English plays toward Mr Bean rather than Blackadder.The film just doesn't work on any level for me, the jokes can be seen a mile away and it takes hours for the punchline to kick in and even then it's played weakly. There are two or three major jokes that can be seen in an instance (hospital and face mask) and it's just a case of tapping your fingers until they are played out.The plot is disjointed and insane, John Malkovich unfortunately embarasses himself in a terrible hammy french accent, the gorgeous Natalie Umbrugia is given there to look good (what attract is there to English????).Now of course, you could just say "it's a comedy, not meant to make sense if its funny" but there were just too many jokes that failed. Yes there were bits that I laughed at but 4 laughs in a entire film does not a comedy make.Compare this to Austin powers and Johnny English can easily be seen as a poor copy with more flaws than seven pound note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funnier than you might think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having a day off, my teenagers convinced me (with some reluctance) to come along to see this movie. I was expecting little; Rowan Atkinson has done nothing that appealed to me since Blackadder, and I find Mr. Bean even more cringeworthy than Norman Wisdom - and I HATE Norman Wisdom.To my surprise, in places the movie is hilarious and it had me weeping with laughter in my seat. In fact I found it funnier than the kids - but then, I'm from the Benny Hill and Carry On generation. It is predictable, could have used some judicious editing, it is far too inclined to encourage Atkinson's self indulgence, but it is helped by a sterling supporting cast. And it takes the mickey something rotten out of the cheese eating surrender monkeys which is always welcome to a Brit. Further, as one who has suffered here in Holland from the Gatsometer ( a Dutch invention) there is a scene which will gladden the heart of every motorist who has to put up with these things. Written I suspect by Atkinson, a man who loves his cars.So should you see it? If you've an afternoon free, enjoy bad jokes and slapstick, and can believe John Malkovich (who lives in France, perhaps not after this) as a pretender to the British throne, you will leave the cinema feeling a lot more cheerful in this world of tears. Which is what I suppose the movies are all about. And Natalie Imbruglia looks quite foxy in a leather catsuit.</fullReview>

Rowan has a way of making comedy which is unique. He is able to make me laugh just by making different faces. John Malkovich is the bad guy in the film. Malkovich is one of my favourite actors and he is great in this film as well. I can't think of anyone better for this role.Johnny English is the kind of a film that makes you feel great.

		<shortDescription>A great movie and nothing less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny English was one of the funniest movies I have seen to date, and I don't think everybody realises that it IS a comedy, and most comedies do NOT have to have a perfect plot. Sure, the plot has similarities to many other 'spy spoofs' such as "I Spy" and "The Naked Gun", but it was still VERY original. The aim of this movie was to make the audience laugh, and laughed we did, all the way through. The movie doesn't require a perfect plot with perfect direction and perfect acting, it doesn't need a brilliant score, lighting and editing, camera work. While all these contribute to the success of the movie, the main point is that its absolutely hilarious, and that is what we should be reviewing with a movie such as this. Rowan Atkinson could not have been better, the rest of the cast were brilliant in their roles. The movie while shorter than average, paces itself really well. I recommend to everyone...</fullReview>

I only sat down to write this user comment so I could come up with word-plays on 007/Mr Bean.I've always enjoyed Rowan Atkinson and I'm a huge Bond-fan so "Johnny English" should be right up my alley, and the movie certainly looks great but the jokes... oh the jokes... you can see them coming a mile away and most of them aren't really all that original.BUT Atkinson still makes it worth a look as The Bean Who Loved Me (can't help it) with A View to a Bean (somebody stop me!) My favorite scene is definitively the car-chase (which was the only original idea of the entire film) and it IS fun to watch John Malkovich - of all people - ham it up as the French baddie. Despite all this AND Atkinson The Bean is Not Enough (have I no shame?) and "Johnny English" ends up as a picture perfect yet brain-less comedy. And why the hell didn't they have a scene with Johnny English getting all his gear? Placing Rowan Atkinson in a room full of deadly gadgets should have been a must in a movie like this, and maybe they could have had someone like Eric Idle or even better: lovable old Norman Wisdom doing a spoof on Q!It should be noted that the screenwriters (Neal Purvis and Robert Wade) also wrote the very real Bond-movies "Die Another Day" and "The World Is Not Enough"!As a fan of 007 I don't know whether to laugh or cry at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the vein of Naked Gun, Mr. Bean style!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie stars Rowan Atkinson as Johnny English, and he plays a role something of the sort of a James Bond, a bumbling James Bond (think Lt. Frank Drebin in the Naked Gun series). The plot is very basic also, so there is nothing at all to think about. The Crown Jewel's are stolen, and it's up to English to save the day, alongside his partner, and a mystery woman played by Natalie Imbruglia (yes, THAT Natalie Imburglia). The "bad guy" is played by John Malkovich, so we're good there. Like I said though, there really isn't that much to the story, it's your basic Naked Gun type thing, with many visual gags throughout the film. I'd venture to say that if you dig stuff like Naked Gun, then you'll enjoy this one for what it is.Now, I may be just a little bias, because I've loved Rowan Atkinson for years. The moment I first saw the TV show "Mr. Bean", I've loved watching his comedy. I don't know why, but even just looking at the guy makes me laugh. Anyhow, that's that. He does what he's always done here in this one for the most part, and at times he is actually pretty good in this role. I'm not talking it's all over the place, but in a couple of scenes I was actually ready to think he was playing in a drama/action like James Bond.John Malkovich is just about always gold, and if you've seen him play the bad guy before, you know what to expect.I was most shocked at Natalie, she did pretty good for what was there. I mean, she had the type of role that many women could play, but still, coming from here I was surprised and pleased. While watching the movie, I didn't even think of her as "the singer" a single time, so that has to be a good thing, right?Many of the gags have been done before that we have here in this one, and many times they have been done better. You see shades of Naked Gun, Austin Powers, and all other types of films in that vein. There is some originality here though, and you'll know it when you see it. This will not win any awards, and it more than likely wont do all that great once it goes nation wide in August, but it's a great "check your brain at the door" comedy/action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Kids Films in Recent Memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I didn't feel like ruthlessly tearing this film apart at the moment, I could simply copy and paste the majority of my review of Shawn Levy's The Pink Panther, as many of my points in that review apply to Johnny English (not to mention that both films are nearly identical). And yet, Johnny English is even worse, and while at least the Pink Panther provided a meager handful of infrequent chuckles, Johnny English has little to no working gags. Once again, I am disgusted by the low standards of live action children's cinema- that is, if I dare to refer to this inexcusably terrible piece of formulaic tripe as cinema.There's hardly any plot in Johnny English. The majority of the film is made up of loosely related action/comedy scenarios that are neither exciting, nor comedic. The bare bones plot of the film is that Johnny English- by account of an absurdly violent incident at the beginning of the film resulting in the death of every other agent in the country- is the only living secret agent in England, and therefore, the only person that can uncover the secret behind some stolen jewels. Teamed with his partner, Angus Bough (who contradicts the film's previous statement that all of the other agents have died), they must uncover the missing jewels, as well as stop an evil "genius" from becoming king.Johnny English has almost nothing that will appeal to anyone over the age of 9 (and I am sorry to insult those 1-9 year-olds in this manner). All the children's film clichés are here, including poop jokes, silly dancing, a bumbling main character, and dozens of other unfortunate elements. The humor is also subject to not one, but two shots of a man's bare bottom (one of which is an extended bit), and an alarmingly raunchy scene of innuendo that struck me as completely out of place for a PG film. In addition to quite a bit of violence, and a surprising amount of language, I can't imagine what parent would feel comfortable letting their kids watch this.And yet, as I stated before, there is nearly nothing here that could possibly be enjoyable to anyone whose age is in their double digits. At times, Johnny English is downright insulting in it's stupidity, and general laziness.We've seen everything in this film before in other movies. Just rarely this poorly. Johnny English is also an extremely predictable movie, with gags that can be predicted before they even begin to occur. There's not an original gag in this film, and I struggle to think of any funny one(s).Rowan Atikson tries hard as Johnny English, but he cannot make the material work, no matter how silly his faces. John Malkovich as the villain, Pascal Sauvage, sports what might be the worst, unintentionally bad French accent I've ever seen in a feature film. Supporting actors like Ben Miller and Natalie Imbruglia are so forgettable and weak in their roles, that they're hardly worth mention.The only vaguely bright spot about this film is its half-way decent score, composed by Edward Shearmur. Purposefully emphasizing on spy clichés, the score is actually pretty fun at times, if somewhat formulaic.Unfunny, even vulgar, and an utter failure in almost every respect (not to mention sloppily edited, and poorly shot), Johnny English is one of the worst kids films I've seen in recent memory- an impressive feat. Consistently defying logic, physics, and my tolerance, Johnny English is an aggressively bad film. Other than acknowledge the score again, the best thing I can say about Johnny English is that its only 88 minutes. And yet, that is certainly 88 minutes too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Top Secret" Val Kilmer sang,"How silly can you get?" This dumb flick answers his question. Beats me how so many good actors get raked into this "time-waster" sort of movie. It barely has a plot.What it has stumbles along and is disjointed(I'm not talking about Mr Bean's acting either!) If a production team wants to take the proverbial out of the "Bond genre",how about doing it with a super smooth well-mannered nit from the David Niven stable? Rown shows a flash of brilliance then descends to Lou Costello tricks!Hard to believe it cost 35,000,000. In all movies of this kind the baddie really gets to strut his stuff. John M.s evilness was just enough for "family consumption" Lorna whats-her-name from Interpol gave a formula performance that would have satisfied the Bond production people.Talk about a curates egg!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny English is what it promises to be ? an amusing and light-heard film. But what would you expect from Rowan Atkinson, the actor in Mr Bean? There are some strikingly funny scenes in the movie. But be prepared for some outlandish humor and chauvinistic jokes. But be prepared also for 007 and Austin Powers-style gadgets, which (I hope) you'll also laugh at, as I did.However, there are some weaker aspects to the film. For example, the movie portrays Chinese people as the bad guys and, in a way, vilifies them (though there are certainly bad apples in the Chinese race). Another one is that thinking logically, you would find some scenes improbable.In short, though this movie was a bit short of in-depth food for thought, it was a quite funny and light-hearted comedy. Very suitable if you're just looking for an hour or so of laughter and nothing in-depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny. A good comedy that I enjoy every time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny English is one of those movies that some people will find hilarious (me) and others will find just stupid. It is a parody of pretty much all spy movies, but it also holds up on its own by being clever.Johnny English is a spy who is one of the lowest ranking spies of them all, and does the paper work. Well after Johnny accidentally kills one of the top agents, there is a funeral where all of the agents gather in memory... and a bomb kills them all... except Johnny. So now Johnny English is the only spy left for a major mission with his much more intelligent assistant Bough who actually is a much more worthy agent. I won't spoil too much, but that is the set-up for the movie and the plot is actually pretty funny and interesting.The acting is good in this movie, and I found the movie funny at a lot of scenes. This is a good movie to watch when you need a laugh or two. Not everyone will find it funny, and the movie isn't ingenious, but it sure is good at what it promises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny English - The nations favourite bungling spy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The creation of Johnny English plucked up from the unfunny Barclaycard adverts of the 1990s has a mixture into it of the Beans series and the hilarious spy spoofs Austin Powers. I always liked Rowan Atkinson in the Bean movies and Blackadder and had the ultimate pleasure of going to the pictures with my father to see it back in 2003. I watched it again only recently only having just purchased it cheaply on DVD. I was surprised to find that even after eight years (with the sequel Johnny English Reborn on it's way to our cinema this October) this has lost none of it's comic wit that sparkles. I found myself laughing out loud all the way through in all the right places after the first viewing.Basically Rowan Atkinson plays bungling spy Johnny English who is the only hope to save England after all the other agents are killed in an explosion. He is teamed up with Bough (Ben Miller) as the crown jewels are stolen from The Tower of London. English suspects French businessman Pascal Savage (John Malkovich) of being behind it. He and Bough are joined in finding the Crown Jewels with Interpol agent Lorna Campbell (the beautiful Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia). Along the way watch unfold as English gets himself into mishap after funny mishap. But despite all this he does everything he can to save the nation he loves.Looking back at the IMDb rating on here of a 5.8, it seems quite low to me but I can understand why not everyone would like this. Maybe slapstick comedy isn't the type they like and not everyone can like Rowan Atkinson (my Nan can attest to that, she cannot stand him).Anyway I love this, the story is very basic and some of the comedy sequences are quite predictable, but they are so superbly timed by Atkinson that I don't mind. There are laughs all the way through with some terrific comedy mostly thanks to Atkinson. Ben Miller though has to be mentioned with a great performance who also gets his comic moments too. I have to say I was impressed with Natalie Imbruglia's acting, which was reasonable. She even in certain scenes manages to act quite seductively. The script is mostly a joy throughout with some witty dialogue though it does fall flat at certain points. The film also boasts a fantastic soundtrack by Robbie Williams and it's well shot and edited by director Peter Howitt. Overall this spoof spy comedy is a laughing hoot from start to finish and I am really looking forward to the sequel coming out this October. I cannot wait to see the great bungling agent that is Johnny English reborn again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a farce.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the movie Rowan Atkinson had to make for his North American fans and being one of those fans, I enjoyed it tremendously. It had all the physical comedy and farcical set-ups you expect when Mr. Bean plays James Bond but it also had more than enough story and character to hold it together and make it a real quality comedy. Aside from John Malkovich, there were no really big Hollywood names in the supporting cast, but they were all more than passable. Kudos go to Natalie Imbruglia as the "beautiful woman with a mysterious interest in the mission" and Ben Miller who weighed in as Bough, Johnny's sidekick and straight man. It can't be easy playing off a man like Rowan Atkinson, I would think.While the movie holds much more than the silliness of the opening credits, it can be said that if you enjoy the credits and pre-opening credits segments, you will enjoy this movie. The character Rowan Atkinson creates in portraying Johnny English is hard to describe. He is somehow a proud, honest and well-intentioned man who makes the mistakes and errors in judgement that would be truly painful to watch if it wasn't so funny and yet it's all done in a setting where you can laugh about him without laughing at him. As one of the other reviews I read said, when Johnny is removed from the case, you see the true dejection of the character, not another stubbed toe or sight gag. And that attention to the character and his personability is what makes this movie worth the price of admission. Rowan Atkinson is truly a comic genius, in my opinion.I'm sure many will rate this much lower and never go back to watch it again (comedies seem to have much more trouble appealing to a wide audience base than dramas), but for me, it was a 7.7 and definitely worth re-visiting.But that's just my two scents. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The only gadgets I've ever needed are a sharp eye, sensitive hearing and a whole bunch of bigger brains."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of his own ineptness, Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) is the only agent left in the British Secret Service. The crown jewels are stolen and against everyone's better judgment, English is put on the case. But when he uncovers a plot involving a wealthy Frenchman to overthrow the Queen and have himself named King of England, no one will believe him. English knows he's right and knows it's up to him to save his country.I'm shocked. I was quite prepared to hate Johnny English. Instead, I found a movie that, although uneven, had moments that made me laugh out loud. Nothing on the level of the Atkinson's masterpiece, The Black Adder, but still worthy of a laugh or two if you're a fan of Atkinson's style of humor. I admit, some of the bits fall flat and some of the situations feel forced or, even worse, telegraphed, but when it's funny, it's really good. I'm not sure what my favorite moment was, but the scene where English mistakenly invades and attempts to take over a hospital had me laughing hard. Or the scene where English bares the Archbishop of Cantebury's back-side. Predictable - yes, but still funny. It was just so stupid. That's another thing ? if you want comedy with a bit of sophistication, steer clear. There's a lot of potty humor here. Like the rest of the movie, some works and some doesn't. Other highlights for me include the music (the title song by Robbie Williams is really good), English's love interest played by Natalie Imbruglia (I thought she was amazing given her rather limited acting experience), the stunt work, English's put-upon sidekick played by Ben Miller (he manages to steal many scenes from Atkinson), John Malkovich's ridiculous French accent (a complaint to most people - I thought it was a scream), and the locations, costuming, and lighting. It's not perfect and it's not for everyone, but for me it mostly worked. I'll give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old hat spy spoof gets an 'English' treatment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Rowan Atkinson's wild and hilarious antics saves this spy-spoof formula from grating. How long can audiences buy a formula that's been overused to the death? Patience can be tested in JOHNNY English, a spy spoof that has been done before. Surely it wasn't long before the last in the AUSTIN POWERS series has been released at the time. JOHNNY English has all the feel and look of a tired formula. The laughs are not quite as funny, and some of which have been overused. The movie has that deja 'vu feel it can't escape. But it has something going for it, and it comes under the name of Rowan "Mr. Bean" Atkinson. What Atkinson does here is simply wear the old hat, and does his act at his best. Just for Rowan's antics, I can give this a mild recommendation.After a tragedy that kills off all the agents of the British Scret Intelligence, MI7's head Pegasus (Tim Pigott-Smith) had no choice but to put Johnny English (Atkinson), the last remaining "agent", on an investigation case to find the Crown Jewels, which were robbed from the unfoldment. The culprit is a mysterious Frenchman named Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich), who plans to be the next heir to the throne of England.What the movie revolves around on is simply a number of physical humor and crude jokes that Atkinson does. But what he does, he does fine. Rowan Atkinson carries the movie on his back. While there are a number of popular co-stars like Natalie Imbruglia and Ben Miller, as English's sidekick, but it's mostly Atkinson who does the job. The laughs all go to him, and as is much of the script. Mostly he's funny, his incompetence is irresistible. Besides, you don't go watching his Mr. Bean act for cleverness right? JOHNNY English is a tired effort. The world doesn't need another spy spoof, but if you still have the patience, JOHNNY English is not a letdown of what it is. It's not meant for repetitive viewings, but it gets my passing grade.Rating: *** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The word 'mistakes,' sir, is one that does not appear in my dictionary?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our first look at Johnny English is as an ultra-smooth secret agent, which turns out to be a dream sequence as we meet the real English, a bumbling desk jockey who fantasizes about a life of danger. The movie turns in a completely different direction when we realize that this is a dream sequence, and I have to say that it is not a disappointing turn at all. Far from being a wild turn from Atkinson's most successful character, Johnny English is basically Mr. Bean playing James Bond, and in true Bean style.This is an excellent premise that allows for plenty of mishaps and mayhem, but unfortunately it also takes away some of the movie's intended effect, because we know that just about everything English does will be wrong. Because of that, a lot of the biggest screw-ups are immediately obvious and then become tiresome as they play out, such as English sky-diving onto the wrong building and holding a lot of doctors and nurses hostage, holding up the wrong funeral and dancing on the coffin of a grieving family, and attempting to pull off the plastic face of the wrong Arch Bishop in front of an astonished crowd.Nevertheless, the movie very successfully emulates the look and feel of a Bond film, even more than the far superior Austin Powers did (or either of the hugely disappointing sequels), and there are some genuine laughs. John Malkovich, as well, is surprisingly convincing as the French villain, illustrating once again the British distaste for French people, a widespread feeling that I don't really understand, but have seen evidence of it in several movies and TV shows (Atkinson also lampoons them in the TV show The Thin Blue Line). Malkovich takes on a fake French accent, but for some reason it is not distracting. Maybe it's because of the movie he's in, which doesn't expect any part of it to be taken seriously.The premise is also overblown in the traditional Bond way. Pascal Sauvage (Malkovich) plans to steal the crown jewels, force the Queen to renounce her authority, get himself crowned king, and turn all of England into the world's biggest prison. You see, he has become a billionaire as the owner of something like 500 prisons in 60 countries, so why not close them all down and just own one country that is just one big prison? Upon learning about the villain's goal, I wondered how the movie was received in England. During his speech where he describes his plan to his cronies, Sauvage his goal for the future of England as something like "210,000 square miles of prime real estate conveniently separated from true civilization by 20 miles of ocean, and soon available for the entire world to dump their human waste into." True civilization? Human waste? Those are some pretty strong words, even for such a goofy movie! Nevertheless, the movie in undeniably fun, although it does have the feeling that it is made up of not quite enough good material stretched over a running time that's too long, even at a modest 80 minutes or so. Natalie Imbruglia shows up in a throwaway role as the Bond girl. She is beautiful and fills the role well but isn't really given much to do but show up occasionally and recite her sparse lines. There are some brief sex jokes that might make it not the best thing to show to the youngest viewers, although they are the ones that would probably appreciate most of the humor.All in all not a bad film, it's vintage Bean material that even with his astonishing incompetence he could manage to go from being a fifth-rate secret agent to quite literally being crowned the King of England (entirely by accident, no less), but Rowan has done much better.</fullReview>

Although it has been a while that Anglo-French enmity has ended but this film has given it a new twist by depicting the wicked person determined to wreak havoc on England.

The disappointment was already tremendous at that time, but I did not want to admit then that Atkinson's career was on the wrong track. This "Johnny English" made definitely obvious that my worst fears had become true: Atkinson's ability to make me laugh has vanished. I don't know if I must blame the actor, but one can only say how unconvincing he is now in his usual "so-stupid-would-be-spy-that-no-matter-what he-does-ends-up-as-a-catastrophe" act. Every single gag is foreseen 3 minutes before it happens. The embarrassment was huge when I watched this lame parody. John Malkovich doesn't help either. His unbearable overacting made me sick. Sorry if I am too honest about it. But I sincerely disliked this film. Bought it second-handed at low price and deeply regret my money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoyingly unfunny spy spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we watch films of the spoof genre we see funny jokes that make fun of other films recently released (Scary Movie) making fun of the stereotypical conventions of other films (Not another teen movie) and hilarious characters that we can associate with in context (Austin Powers) Johnny English justified the genre perfectly, meaning its unfunny, tries it make fun of the spy world and has predictable written all over it.Personally I'm not a huge fan of Rowan Atkinson and this 2003 film did nothing to increase my likability for him. As great a comedian as he may have been in 'Black Adder' he is unable here to make this film even acceptable with a low performance as the dim-witted agent. His annoying childish speech throughout was driving me up the wall. His character is supposedly trying to mirror an idiotic James Bond. Fair play they might have the spy conventions worked out but are unable to make them interesting. Also the fact he is trying to act big headed all of the time is enough to drive anyone mad.EVERY scene is predictable I could have written it myself. Sitting with my sister I told her the ending specifically, involving what happened with the Archbishop of Canterbury and she said 'Have you seen this before?' And that was half way through the film.The story is overly coincidental and blown out of complete proportion. Rowan plays the daft agent who is sent to track down some missing jewels. The fact that he 'knows' what is going on is ridiculous, seeing how dumb he is. Some ideas are resolved too quickly and the whole plot is dumb driven so to speak. It tries to captivate the audience by containing scenes where the central character is being made a fool of (which happens all the time so be prepared for the same ideas being used) having too many action scenes to justify the action genre, all blown out of proportion and are no way shape of form realistic, making the film unacceptable viewing if you wish to appreciate a real life scenario.The stereotypical characters are also used to justify the genre. Natalie Imbruglia stars as the central woman and is never convincing as she is uncomfortable in-front of the camera and forms unhealthy chemistry with other actors. John Malkovich to is unacceptable as the stereotype villain but is probably the most interesting character as audiences wonder what he is up to, although it is predictable in the end.Although predictability may have been the purpose would anyone find that interesting? 'Shall we sit down and watch Johnny English?' There is no fun watching a film which is unfunny, predictable and doesn't add anything new which so many other spy spoofs such as 'Austin Powers' with its funny characters does.A film to criticise if you deem necessary but don't get your hopes up for enjoyment. With minimal laughs, a predictable plot, a story involving stereotypes, it's a film destined to be hated.</fullReview>

Then by sudden luck, the woman he sort of has a crush on is put on the case and forces him to help because she can look past the bumbling idiot that everybody else see's. Then after being captured, he escapes, and purely by accident, saves the country he loves. Then there is a twist ending that truly takes you by surprise.

		<shortDescription>Flawless editing and a wonderfully crafted script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a spy film spoof, Johnny English is flawlessly put together. The James Bond-style atmosphere is all there at the beginning - until the squeaky dog toys come into play, of course, because it's all a dream! It would be really easy to lose sight of the plot when parodying a spy film, but Johnny English works so well because it doesn't. There's always just the right degree of seriousness in the comedy. In a way, I feel sorry for Johnny. He obviously admires his superiors. Looking at the respect he shows to the suave Agent One, he clearly wants to do the right thing but it just doesn't work for him. The "most secure location in England" scene is a great example, and also serves to demonstrate the wonderful editing present in the film - a moment too long on any shot in that sequence and the whole scene would have been ruined.Rowan Atkinson's fantastic physical comedy is ever present in this film - from the tuning-up of his voice to find the length of a tunnel to the subduing of an invented assailant in the Tower of London - tomato sauce actually gets a chance to be fake blood, for once! The car recovery truck is an ingenious method of surveillance and I am convinced after seeing that particular scene that there isn't a car driver in England who wouldn't do what Johnny did to the speed camera. But Rowan Atkinson isn't the main star of the physical comedy - the minor characters are just as good. The scene with Johnny's truth serum and muscle relaxant signet rings is well played, and this seemingly catastrophic mix-up ultimately works in Johnny and Bough's favour - another sign of a well-written script.The pace of the film, which could quite easily be slowed down by scenes that link one point of the plot to another, never gets boring. There is always something going on. Some films can have a slow bit at some point, but Johnny English just keeps going. On a technical level, I was very impressed by the aerial shot when Johnny and Bough are in the helicopter. Another brilliantly written scene was the scene where the two infiltrate the wrong funeral - as thinking on your feet goes, what a brilliant way to get out of an embarrassing situation.Two minor points I particularly appreciated were the fact that Johnny's beard grows after his mad dash to France when he is clearly much too busy to do anything mundane like shaving and also the use of the voices of Christ Tarrant and Trevor McDonald. They might not be familiar to other audiences, but I'm sure I'm not the only British person who appreciated the time the film-makers took to use these well-known television and radio voices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atkinson as the new 'James Bond'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice comedy with Rowan Atkinson as the 'new' James Bond, directed by Peter Howitt who also directed "Sliding Doors". I think this movie will be most appreciated by the people who love the Bean-character of Atkinson as well. Although Atkinson is Johnny English in this movie, you still see Bean. John Malkovich is the villain and the beautiful Natalie Imbruglia is Johnny's love interest.The story is quite predictable, but after all that's in the 'real' James Bond-movies as well. The good guy always wins. But I suppose no one saw this movie because they thought it would have a great story. We all saw this movie because of Atkinson's stupid look on his face and his clumsiness. And that's exactly what you get in this movie. Not the best comedy of the year, but still enjoyable. Atkinson is funny, Imbruglia is beautiful and the Aston Martin is extremely fast.The only remark I have concerning "Johnny English" is the Audience Award Atkinson was nominated for at the European Film Festival. I think it was quite insulting for the other actors who were nominated among who Javier Bardem and our Belgian pride Jan Decleir. Rowan Atkison just didn't deserve this nomination for his average comic performance.Fine comedy, not brilliant, but enjoyable. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gotta love spoofs. As for me, I love Rowan Atkinson's work and think he is perfect in all his roles. This movie is no exception and he's not the only one, this movie has a spot on cast and everything fits into the comedy. They could have made John Malkovitch's character more humorous though but that doesn't stop this from being a rip-roaring action comedy.An accident prone English agent is chosen to solve a notorious jewel heist as he is the only one they've got. After being seen by his partners of all the misfortune he is capable of, he is still entrusted to bring down this respected thief and bring order back into society.When you play this movie, don't expect it's an inspiring story to be taken in seriously, because its, uh, not. Don't get serious and you can really enjoy this one. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm a fan of Rowan Atkinson and think he did a good job in this movie as well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that most of the time comedies and certainly those like this one that are mainly based on making fun of a certain genre, aren't very popular on this website. Sometimes I can understand why, but this time I didn't. I had a great time watching this movie, probably because I'm a fan of Rowan Atkinson (especially since he played the role of Edmund Blackadder) and because I don't like the Bond movies all that much...Johnny English is a member of the secret service MI-7, but hasn't got the best of all jobs. He dreams of rising on the corporate ladder, but hasn't got the charisma to make it. However, fortune turns when all the good agents get killed and they need an agent to protect the Crown Jewels. Since he's the only one left, English will perform that important task. But of course the jewels are stolen and Johnny English will have to try to get them back. Doing so, he uncovers a plot to replace England's Queen with what the British fear the most: a French king. There is only one person who can stop this from happening, the clumsy secret agent Johnny English...What I feared most about this movie was that it would be a bit too much over the top. If you know the Austin Powers series, than you know exactly what I mean. A second movie like this would really spoil the fun in my opinion. Now they both have in common that they make fun of movies like James Bond, but each of them does it in a different way. I guess that people who love James Bond movies and take them very serious, will not always see the humor in this movie and might even hate it and perhaps I'm only one of the few, but I really liked this movie and that's why I give this one a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film, despite poor reviews it is one of the funniest I have seen. Every moment of it is hilarious and no matter how many times I watch it it still makes me laugh. The timings of all the sound effects are absolutely perfect, the expressions of the actors really fit so well (especially Rowan Atkinson and John Malkovich). Even when you least expect something hilarious to happen it does and when English tries to do something to look heroic or clever it always goes wrong and makes him look a total fool. This film is a great spoof on quite a few things: The Secret Servive, Government, and so many action films (mainly 007) and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a huge laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Get Smart" mets "King Ralph", only not as funny as either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rowan Atkinson, who plays the title role of "Johnny English" is one of the funniest comedic actors around. Unfortunately, you really wouldn't know that from this movie.The plot can only be described as a combination of Get Smart and the movie King Ralph. In fact, you wonder if the whole premise of this movie didn't come from one rainy day of watching daytime television (re-runs and bad movies).Basically, Rowan Atkinson is a Maxwell Smart clone, an inept spy, except somewhat unexpectedly thrust into the role of spy. The King Ralph part comes in two aspects - the how of the spy (it seems all the other spies were killed at a funeral for the top spy who died in a freak accident), and the motives for the villain of the piece, John Malkovich.Atkinson has done a lot of things (including a role as a spy of sorts in the James Bond movie, Never say Never), but is best known for the witty dark comedy of Blackadder and the rather insane physical comedy of Mr. Bean.The character of Johnny English does have some of the physical, slapstick comedy of Mr. Bean, but really is essentialy Don Knotts' Barney Fife.John Malkovich is okay - he does a good job of overacting as the villain, but his French accent is ridiculous. But not nearly as bad as Natalie Imbruglia's attempt at an British accent. (If she really is British, she must embody every stereotype of them). Ms Imbruglia's character is essentially Agent 99.The plot doesn't make sense - I mean, it's just flat out broken. And most of the jokes are duds, either stables of Get Smart or just really obvious. For instance, they want to parachute on a building which just happens to have an exact twin nearby. You don't have to be Kreskin to know that Johnny English will parachute onto the wrong building, especially after how he brags that he doesn't need the fancy guidance equipment his assistant uses.There are a few funny moments, but mostly early on. Much of the rest of the movie is just boring, with a few painfully unfunny moments that were easily predictable. (Again, pretty much like Get Smart)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'He might be a fool, but he's a fool who keeps showing up.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Rowan Atkinson, but his best work are those silly silent bits that he wrote and acted in. Here, as secret agent Johnny English, he is 'the fool who keeps showing up.' There is a very thin story about a theft of the British Crown jewels, and an attempt by a Frenchman (John Malkovich, in a good performance) to become King of England, but the story is way secondary. This movie was made to showcase Atkinson in a parody of the James Bond movies. For me, no where near as good a parody as the Austin Powers movies. Still, it is a somewhat entertaining 90 minutes of physical humor and silliness.SPOILERS, be forewarned. You may want to read no further. The movie begins with a dream sequence where Johnny English envisions himself as the dashing number one secret agent. Then, he is brought back to reality as the real #1 shows up for the assignment English had prepared, "Including the codes for opening the submarine hatch. I checked them myself." Next day, news to headquarters, #1 died in action, couldn't open the submarine hatch! Then, a bomb at headquarters kills all the other secret agents, and Johnny English is the only one left to guard the crown jewels at the unveiling at the Tower of London. But, the jewels are stolen, they are given back, a plot is hatched to force the queen to abdicate her thrown, the Frenchman is next in line somehow, and secretly plan to turn all of England into a prison for all the world's crooks, an idea explored in "Escape From New York" years earlier. Johnny English spoils it at the coronation, the queen is restored, English is a hero. A few very funny, laugh out loud, scenes, but mostly Rowan Atkinson, not at his best, but pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly humuorous James Bond spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny English is a bumbling spy for England who gets assigned to find the queen's stolen crown jewels. All of the other agents above him were killed in a freak accident. So, most of the movie is Johnny with his side kick stumbling around and receiving some help from a beautiful lady spy. Some how they got John Malcovich to play the evil guy who wants to be named king and turn England into a world jail. So, it did have a few laughs, like when they play the video tape of Johnny dancing in the bathroom.FINAL VERDICT: I'd recommend it if you really like spoof movies like Scary Movie or the Naked Gun series; otherwise, it wasn't funny enough just to rent if you are looking for a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY funny -- classic Rowan Atkinson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided this movie in the theaters due to the negative reviews it was getting on IMDB. Rented the DVD last week and I and my husband and guest, all Rowan Atkinson fans, were in stitches for the whole movie. I can hardly believe that there was talk of the weak plot -- yes, the plot isn't really there. I got the feeling that they edited out a bunch of footage with John Malkovich that would have helped it make more sense, and it's too bad that they didn't clean it up some. But hey, this is a spoof -- like Naked Gun except much funnier-- so who cares. If you love Rowan Atkinson, you'll love this movie. It's hard for me to understand why Rowan Atkinson has developed more of an audience in the US. Rent Mr. Bean. It will grow on you. If you want something more sophisticated, try the Black Adder series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, bad and bad. Shame for Atkinson and Malkovich!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, it makes me so sad to witness two of such a wonderful actors wasting their valuable time and skills in a horrible excuse for a movie like this. I've always considered Rowan Atkinson as one of the very greatest British comedians of all times and from where I'm standing John Malkovich is practically a living legend. Atkinson's best works are however always been the ones he did in a television (ingenious "The Black Adder", hilarious "Mr. Bean", brilliant "The Thin blue line"). Unfortunately he has never reached the same level in his movies. "Johnny English" shows only a careful glimpse of his remarkable comic talents and seeing Malkovich in quite likely the worst role of his glorious career playing this baddie with a horrible French accent nearly puts a tear in my eye. I recommend "Johnny English" only to a brainless morans who can't see the difference between a decent comedy and a huge, stinky pile of...okey, I guess my work is done here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What could have been? Being a fan of the great ham, Rowan Atkinson, this was very depressing to watch. Being an Australian, the only funny bit was the irony of England becoming a penal colony. But the Jokes are all very weak.What I noticed most about this movie is what it missed. A `master of disguise' scene was begging for Atkinson's talents. A James Bond sex scene, with Atkinson fighting a condom, was also missing.Not to mention a complete lack of layers. Johnny, hopeless at everything, manages some spectacular driving. Why not have him fighting with his shoelace, and accidentally become a driving ace?Instead we have to put up with the endlessly one-dimensional Johnny actively `covering' himself, clueless but cunning ala Mr Bean (and NOT working). Further are the repetitive situations where Johnny has driven up the wrong path, again borrowing without success from the hapless Mr Bean.Don't get me wrong, I love Mr Bean, but he belongs in a 10-minute format. This movie needed to think more about Peter Sellers and James Bond, and add some layers. Surely the English don't need to leave the good homage's to Mike Myers.Don't get me started on John Malkovich, who I love, but he is no Dr. Evil.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, I never even got a mild chuckle out of "Johnny English" (well, during the first 45 minutes anyway -- I walked out of the theater at that point deciding not to waste any more time on this dud). I didn't really hear anyone else in the theater laughing either so it puzzles me a great deal to find reviewers here who actually thought this movie was funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seems to be a strong division in opinions over Johnny English. As it seems, there are many people who do not like this movie and do not appreciate the principle of jokes that are heralded to the viewer long before they hit the main protagonist (played wonderfully by Rowan Atkinson). It seems that especially viewers in the USA tend to view the movie as annoying.From my own central European point of view, the movie was great. I give it happily 8 out of 10 and I cannot quite remember laughing out loud so often on any movie recently.I strongly recommend that you try this one. It stands high above Bean's previous movie attempt 'Bean' (especially in script quality), and though as it seems is not everyone's cup of tea, it worked for me and most of my friends extremely well.Natalia Imbruglia puts an OK performance, John Malkovich is simply superb and Rowan Atkinson made my cry with laughter.</fullReview>

If you like a movie that looks stupid but isn't, then see this. There is a laugh in almost every scene. There is DEFINITALY going to be a sequal. I hope it's as good as this one was!Final Grade for JOHNNY ENGLISH: B-PG for action violence, some crude humor, language, comic nudity, and mild sex-related humor. Not the most appropriate movie for litte kids, but not a terrible PG family action/comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Broken English</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Johnny English" is a broken movie and I just wanted it to end. As The Cranberries would say, "let it linger" and it just lingered. As The Rolling Stones would say, "let it bleed" and it just bled. It should have taken what The Beatles said, "live and let die". Here are my reasons for despising this movie (spoilers contained within): (1) Rowan Atkinson could never hold a candle to John Cleese, Eric Idle or Graham Chapman because these are British comedy masters. I find Bean's sense of humor to be a stale of loaf of bread. It might kill a duck someday. (2) Natalie Imbrigulia is another unfortunate to be caught in the eye candy role. Her entire talent is wasted in a role that could be filled by any model wannabe that flunked out of high school. Too bad the world of movies is more about flashy s*** as opposed "indigestable" substance. (3) Speaking of s***, if I ever see another s*** joke on screen, I will take a sharp object and slice the screen because s*** jokes are just s*** to begin with and I have seen too many of them (insert any other title you can think of here). (4) As for more wasted talent, how could John Malkovich have ever agreed to make this movie? Isn't this the same John Malkovich who played himself in "Being John Malkovich" and the rather psychotic dualist in the unfairly underrated "Mary Reilly"? How could such a good actor play such a lame villian? His performance in "In The Line of Fire" beats this sad excuse of film villainy into the ground easily. (5) I know movies are fiction but the plot was so GD ridiculous that I would have shot jellybeans out of my mouth if I had eaten them at certain times. For crying out loud, all of British citizenry would rise against their newly crowned King if they ever found out that their homeland would be turned into the modern-day equivalent of colonial Australia. I wish some writers would use common sense when they write a stupid comedy. (6) I hate repititive jokes like English's gun falling apart at the pull of the trigger. Those jokes get tiring real fast. (7) All the jokes could have been easily anticipated and that took much away from the movie (like there was much to take away from to begin with). (8) The romance angle wasn't needed in this movie either. Some really sad comedic heroes should be left on the short end of the stick (I think this should have happened to Billy Madison {and I really like that movie too}). The narration at the end of the movie said Johnny English was going on his most arduous mission yet and I said it was to lose his virginity. As I said before, writers need common sense when they write a stupid comedy. Eight subtracted from ten is two and thus that is the score I give this movie.The upsides were (1) the theme song by Robbie Williams. It gave me a fair warning that I was wasting my time in the first place. (2) The other upside is the performance of Ben Miller as Bough. He was the funniest character and he one of the better second bananas I have seen on screen.Overall, this movie sucks and I suggest it be avoided at all costs. If you ever see another British films, try the works of Danny Boyle or the works of Monty Python because they are smart, dramatic and sometimes funny (depending on the mood of the movie). Don't ever see this movie because you will be crying at the end because you tortured yourself and you never get your money back. Here ends my rant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Bean is Better than Mr. Powers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever goes to such a movie must know what he or she pays the ticket for - and this is how such a film should be judged. Rowan Atkinson got famous - in Europe at least - for Mr. Bean's character. Here he plays a secret agent saving the British dynasty, but he is still the same Mr. Bean - sometimes the prototype of a complete idiot, evil and candid at the same time, Laurel and Hardy in the same tuxedo. If something can go wrong around him, it will, and if it does not he will make it happen. Comparing the film with the other latest Bond parody, the Austin Powers series is required, and you know what? I liked this one better. Without the great money of 'Powers', 'Johnny English' succeeded better in extracting healthy laughs and making me feel that I did not completely mis-spent the 88 minutes and the ...no, I will not tell you what a ticket in the theater costs over here! John Malkovitch seems to enjoy every moment on the screen, and Natalia Imbruglia makes us wait for the next in the series. Which I am sure will come, and I hope it will not be falling much below the original, as the Powers second and third did. 7/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

This spy wanna-be is a bumbling idiot, like Peter Sellers' Jacques Clouseau. I rather enjoyed the fact that Rowan Atkinson did not go for the Austin Powers jokes every chance he got.

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of Rowan Atkinson's brand of slapstick humor, then just perhaps Johnny English is the film for you. Even if you've liked his performances in such films as BEAN, you'll probably need to see Johnny English only on a day when your silliness quotient is through the roof. You'll want to choose a day in which the mere thought of a pratfall sends you into nervous giggles because Johnny English , a film that feels like it was designed for the single digit set, lays it on awfully thick for anyone who has graduated from grade school. The story line is a appalling.Atkinson plays Johnny English, the only British agent left after a bomb destroys all the other agents. Trying his best to be a likable doofus, Atkinson plays his part with utter confidence as a super sophisticated James Bond without a scintilla of sense. When the crown jewels are stolen right in front of his eyes, he is unable to ascertain how the thieves entered the building. Everyone but him sees the big hole in the ground.The gorgeous Natalie Imbruglia plays the Bond girl part, except her character has infinitely more brains than English. Actually, everyone is smarter than our would-be lovable idiot. John Malkovich, with a terrible french accent, is there to ham it up as Pascal Sauvage, a Frenchman with designs on the English throne.If the theater's air-conditioning is working and it's hot outside, spending some time with English isn't a bad idea. Otherwise, there are undoubtedly many better activities to occupy your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Rowan Atkinson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big Rowan fan. He's possibly the funniest man to come out of Great Britain since Dave Allen and Benny Hill. After the hollow anti-climax of "Mr. Bean" and his limitations in "Rat Race," it was interesting to see him go all out in a full spy spoof following the limited potential of his spy commercials. "Johnny English" is an amusing farce with a good action and intrigue plot, but unfortunately constantly embarrassing Rowan the main hero constantly discovering the error of his hurried assumptions and cockamamie plans isn't great comedy. The movie actually seems like one long joke on the French and sometimes insulting to both the French and British cultures, but I guess they get the joke; it's still a heck of a lot better than that god-awful Austin Powers which somehow spawned two more unfortunate sequels. Obviously, Johnny English knows he's not really a great spy and he works hard to create that image, but the humor works when he's surprised when things actually work for him. Ben Miller plays the clueless but obedient Bough who assists Johnny and takes his lead; after all, Johnny is his best friend and he cares a lot for him and doesn't want to see him get hurt. Natalie Imbruglia is a beautiful and whimsically experienced special agent to share the plot and provide the love interest. John Malkovich at first seems miscast, but he portrays the villain with an ironic sense of whimsy. He's funny because he's the one person who gives Johnny the best piece of ill-timed logic: "If I was you, I would not go there." just before Johnny embarrasses himself and everyone else for the hundredth and worst time. Despite a few odd conveniences providing plot points and moments of embarrassing comedy, "Johnny English" is a very funny comedy and one very worthy of deserving a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** HERE BE SPOILERS **Johnny English (Atkinson), an administrator in the secret English agency, is appointed their top agent after all other agents is killed. His charge, to protect the crown jewels. After they are stolen his mission is to retrieve them. He suspects French businessman Sauvage (Malkovich), but his boss declare that Sauvage is a friend of England, and English is to stay clear of him. English however, although incompetent in all other matters is persistent, and stumbles through the investigation. Improbable as it may seem, he may be on to something.It is very much Mr Bean over Johnny English. The entire humor, in fact the entire movie, is based upon English being incompetent, and repeatedly making a fool of himself. If one appreciates this, I believe the movie might be very funny, I do not however, and there is precious little otherwise to appreciate. The plot and humor is also very predictable, stealing a lot of the humor away. Atkinson is good as English, he has done that type of character often before, and there is nothing new there, which leaves me rather unimpressed. His far more competent aid Bough, played by Miller and the fellow agent Campbell, played by Imbruglia impress me much more. Malkovich is also good, until his character takes a turn for the more juvenile humor, and that is not his fault I guess.So, if you're a fan of typical Mr. Bean humor, see this, otherwise, stay clear.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very funny film from that master of comedy Rowan Atkinson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's obvious that this film was tailor-made for Rowan Atkinson; if it didn't have him in it, it would have been a pile of rubbish. We've all seen bumbling secret agents before, but none quite like Johnny English who, again thanks to Rowan Atkinson, is a completely original character. There are tons of memorable gags and slapstick sequences to keep most people happy, and some good lines too ("I think you over-estimate your sexual potency Mr. English" "I think that is more than is physically possible"). If you do not like Rowan Atkinson's comedy in general then you probably won't enjoy this film, but fans of Atkinson's various TV series like "Blackadder" and "Mr Bean" are certain to roll about laughing. Highly enjoyable! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This complete mess of a film is most likely one of the worst of the year. I say "one of the worst" because it's intolerably unfunny antics are only beaten in cruelty by My Bosses Daughter. I have two questions of logic in this film, one is: WHY JOHN MALKOVICH!? WHY!? I'd like to be John Cusak for awhile as to crawl inside Malkovich's head and see what he was thinking by making this trash. Question Two: Who in the hell is Intelectually challenged enough to fund the creation of this worthlessness. This film and a landfill actually match well, a landfill is made from left over, unwanted trash. Johnny English is made of unfunny, unwanted, crude(as in revealing the nude behind of and elderly Cardinal) garbage. I hated every inch of this movie from Malkovich's french-stereotype of a character all the way to the last three seconds of the credits. (seeing a plain black screen was a relief). In total, avoid this movie **AT ALL COSTS** even if it means jumping in front of a bus, it's less painfull.</fullReview>

I've enjoyed Rowan Atkinson for years as Mr. Bean and even his brief scenes in the movie "Rat Race." He's nothing short of a comic genius.I've heard people bashing this movie as unfunny and stupid. I don't know what movie those people were watching, mistaking it for Johnny English, but I saw this flick in it's 3rd week with a packed audience. It was a laugh riot in that theatre.There's no shortage of laughs in this movie. The plot isn't weighed down with impossible twists, but theres plenty of plot to allow English to get himself into trouble.I never finished my popcorn. After about the 3rd near-choking incident, I gave up and put it under my seat.I wasn't expecting this movie to be so funny. Check it out if you're looking for a fun flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>90 minutes of harmess fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're either a fan of the zany antics of Rowan Atkinson or you're not. Tentatively placing myself in the former category, I went to see 'Johnny English' with hopes of little more than 90 minutes of harmless fun. Although I enjoyed it I would also have to admit that this movie sadly underperformed. Atkinson plays the newly promoted and super-clumsy secret agent Johnny English, working for 'MI7' and attempting to track down and prove the guilt of super sleuth Pascal Sauvage - played admirably by John Malkovich. There are some good belly laughs - notably when English uses the rear rocket launcher on his Aston Martin to delete the evidence from a a speeding camera he's just passed, or when he accidentally gives himself a muscle relaxant and slips into 'Mr Bean' mode. John Malkovich is incredibly polished as the archetypal French villain and Natalie Imbruglia provides a bit of glamour with her 'come-to-bed' eyes and smile that give the lads in the audience some distraction when not trying hard to giggle at Atkinson's less than hard-hitting gags. And it is very much a case of 'less than', say, his award-winning performance in Bean. Somehow the scriptwriters and director between them, all who have shown great competency in the past, are unable to cope with this type of humour. We are given so much advance warning for most of the jokes that the punch lines are little more than a much-needed apology for dragging it out so long. This was a film that had enormous potential for sending up Bond: sadly it neither does this well nor creates its own genre. The understated self-referential humour that works so well in Bond, or the overblown caricatures of Austin Powers or even Triple X have all found their mark within the modest aims of their creators. Johnny English, on the other hand, never quite finds its slot. But if you like Atkinson it is still 90 minutes of very light and harmless fun, even if the mixture has been overly shaken rather than expertly stirred.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Low Point of British Film Making?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 1990's the extremely talented Rowan Atkinson did a series of commercials on UK television for a credit card company that featured a very funny James Bond spoof character and his long suffering sidekick Bough.This was ripe for developing into a film (although I though a TV series may have been better) and sure enough before long along came Johnny English.Oh dear?.Something went badly wrong somewhere as this was by far and away one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to have to sit through and marks a very low point in the history of British film making.As a Bond spoof it could have worked on so many levels but instead the talents of Rowan Atkinson and others were wasted on an utterly drivel laden script devoid of nearly any laughs whatsoever.It also proved that John Malkovich will appear in any old rubbish these days but even he must have thought of leaving this turkey off his CV? It transpires that the couple of clips I saw on TV at the time of the film's release were the only two minutes worth watching. Indeed this diatribe of insulting codswallop was so bad I just gave up when the showing broke for the news, shook my head in disbelief and walked away.And then all was revealed ? I discovered it was written by the same two utterly useless talent vacuums who penned the almost franchise killing Bond film disaster Die Another Day! That explains why this film which should have been so good was so utterly awful!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) is an incompetent British Intelligence agent. A bomb explodes at the funeral of Agent One killing the whole intelligence force leaving English as the only surviving agent. There is a plot to steal the Crown Jewels. English is to protect the Jewels but he is distracted by Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia). He and sidekick Angus Bough (Ben Miller) investigate and place the heist at the feet of Frenchman Pascal Edward Sauvage (John Malkovich).I just didn't laugh. Part of it is probably my love of Mr. Bean. It's weird to see Atkinson speaking normally. There are some attempts at fun slapstick action but none of it rates higher than a chuckle. Imbruglia adds no more than a oddly pretty girl. Broad slapstick spoof is something that requires special skills which I'm not sure director Peter Howitt has. Without Atkinson, this would be a complete train wreck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm more impressed after my latest viewing than I was four years ago, but still don't think it's nearly as good as I did in the theatre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember going to see this James Bond spoof, starring the very talented Rowan Atkinson, on the silver screen back in 2003, and thinking it was a great comedy! I saw the movie again a couple times on the small screen within the next year or two after that, and my opinion did not change, even though it had been widely criticized by many. However, a little over four years ago, I watched it one more time, and still found some funny parts during this viewing, but found most of the film to be dull and unfunny, enough to make it just mediocre as a whole! For the first time, I could finally understand the criticism! I didn't watch "Johnny English" again until this month, knowing that a sequel is coming up, and it improved slightly for me this time, but not very much.Johnny English is a secret agent in England who works for MI7, and has the tendency to louse up. After a bomb goes off and kills most of MI7's top agents, English is the only one left, so he is sent to the Tower of London to protect the crown jewels. While he is there, the crown jewels are stolen while the lights are out! It is unknown who stole them, but it is up to Johnny English to find the culprit! He investigates with his sidekick, Bough, and makes lots of mistakes, but eventually, he discovers that Pascal Sauvage, a Frenchman, has evil plans to become King of England, and take control of the nation! English must now try and reveal Sauvage's intentions to his country before it's too late. Bough and an initially mysterious woman he keeps running into and is in love with named Lorna Campbell can help him on this mission, but the mission will be made more challenging due to the agent's clumsiness!During my most recent viewing, I found myself laughing pretty hard a number of times for a while, with a lot of the mistakes Johnny English makes and the accidents he causes. If it had stayed this way, I would have wondered what I found so lame about the spy spoof when I saw it in 2007, but unfortunately, it doesn't stay like that. I eventually found myself laughing less often and not as hard. Perhaps the constant sight gags and the protagonist lousing up just about everything he does just get a little tiring. Several times in the film, something goes wrong with the clumsy MI7 agent's gun when he points it at his enemies, and I found this funny at first, but it soon wore out its welcome to me. A lot of the slapstick just shows lazy and cheap comedy writing. When I saw the part where English climbs up through the toilet and gets covered in excrement again after a few years, I found it to be basically just like I did back in 2007 ? not funny, just gross, though I still found Lorna's reaction pretty funny. However, towards the end, I did find some more big laughs, with a very memorable part I remember finding hilarious the first time, and not much less funny, if at all, the last time! When I saw this spoof in 2003 and 2004, I hadn't seen nearly as much of Rowan Atkinson's work as I had by the time I watched it again in 2007. Maybe this was a major reason why I didn't find "Johnny English" nearly as good that time, and another major reason may have been that I had higher standards by that point. Atkinson still does show his talent in this film, and fans of his could easily find laughs here, but could also find that these laughs are nowhere near consistent enough to satisfy. The comedian playing a clumsy secret agent sounds like a great idea, but it did not reach its full potential, and I really get the feeling that this won't change with the upcoming sequel, "Johnny English Reborn", especially after seeing the trailer for it, featuring more excessively simplistic sight gags. I certainly don't think this 2003 spy spoof is as bad as many others do (it's still better than the super forgettable "Spy Hard"), but it's still pretty much just fluff, and far from one of the big highlights of Atkinson's career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an uncertain world, few things are as dependable as the British Secret Service. So when an unthinkable plan to filch the country's beloved Crown Jewels comes to the Service's attention, the best man for the job, the creme de la creme of the organization's super sleuths, Agent Number One is quickly assigned to the case and is quickly dispatched to six feet under. But unfortunately for the B.S.S., virtually every other able member of its esteemed ranks soon joins Agent Number One in the afterworld when the funeral is being bombed! Now there is only one man remaining who can even hope to protect his country, avenge the elimination of all of the Secret Service's spies and uncover the fiendish plot to make off with the lasting symbols of the once supreme British empire, the Crown Jewels--Johhny English. He knows no fear. He knows no danger. In fact, he knows absolutely nothing.This Film Is An Okay "Turn Off Your Brain" Comedy, I Remember Seeing It 8 Years Ago And Thinking That This Was Quite Good. I Recommend This To Anyone Who Is A Fan Of Mr. Bean. The Only Problem With This Movie As I Said Is That If Your Not In The Right Frame Of Mind Than This Can Seem Like Sh!it. Overall I Did Laugh Quite A Few Times When I Saw This Recently. My Favourite Part Is When Johnny Puts The Disc Of What He Thinks Is Pascal's Plan Into The TV And Really Its Him Dancing To "Does Your Mother Know" In His Bathroom And In The Middle Of That Sequence He Mouths Some Of The Words. I Hate Abba But That Is Just Priceless, Knowing How Many People Would've Been Watching All Over The World...I Think It Would Be More Embarrassing Than What Happened To The Archbishop Of Cantebury(Don't Ask).Overall As I Say If Your In The Mood For Smart Comedy Than Steer Far Away But If You Are Looking For Just A Stupid Movie Than I Recommend This(In My Opinion Stupid Movies Aren't Gonna Win Any Oscars But They Should Be Embraced).</fullReview>

His fantastic comedic ability showcased so well in Blackadder and Mr Bean all come through as he plays Johnny English - the last spy on the planet you'd want to see saving the world. Atkinson is ably supported by Ben Miller who has since gone on to bigger and better things and Natalie Imbruglia as the love interest as English bumbles through disaster after disaster.This film is one of those you either love of loath but there are enough big comedic moments to entertain most people and Atkinsons charm more than makes up for some of the slower moments.People have a go at this film but it's a family film really that can be enjoyed by everyone.

To anyone who hasn't seen the movie, I will warn you, don't expect too much from the screenplay, it is very simplistic, and the plot is predictable. And the whole film is very, very daft, and I can't count the number of scenes that I deem as extremely silly. I do think the Coronation Scene is hilarious though. There are some nice locations, some good effects, and a number of funny scenes. The acting is not Oscar-worthy, but everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. Natalie Imbruglia looks gorgeous, and does do well. Tim Piggott-Smith and Oliver Ford-Davies have little to do, but they do shine in the few scenes they are in. John Malkovich hams it up to a tee as the villain of the piece Pascal Sauvage, but holding the film together is Rowan Atkinson in a rather unsophisticated but fun role of Johnny English, and he breathes life into a film that could have been embarrassing and forgettable, but his sheer entertainment value makes it worth seeing. All in all, unassuming and definitely not Oscar worthy but not a bad film by all means. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

I think that Atkinson is a great comedian, but this film is a big disservice to him and all the Film's actors.This kind of film is always going to be a difficult to pull off.

This movie doesn't force you to laugh on creepy dialogues rather the situations in plot make you laugh and feel happy from your heart. Even the very first scene in which Rowan crunches two dogs is a great imagination. Rowan's unability to shoot a gun and kiss a woman is truly awesome.

		<fullReview>Before viewing this film, I expected it to be incredibly stupid and slapstick. And yes, I was right in a small way, as some parts of the film (such as the part when English and a guard take muscle relaxant) are a bit silly. Some parts, however, are absolutely hilarious.The film features many excellent performances, with Atkinson bringing his usual brilliance and John Malkovich playing his role with significant menace and loathing. Most of the other roles, however, are generally unchallenging and dull in comparison with the two just talked about.The most hilarious part of the film comes at the end, when the DVD of English dancing to ABBA is played to the entire planet who are watching a coronation like none other. Though this is slightly predictable (we see English pick up the wrong DVD earlier in the film and so vigilant viewers will have been expecting this) you cannot help but laugh at the cringe-worthy nature of the climax of an incredibly clever, well-written and fun film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Johnny English" is *supposed* to be a comedy starring Rowan Atkinson of "Mr. Bean" fame. I guess I'm mistaken in thinking that a comedy is actually supposed to be funny. One of the taglines for the movie reads, "He Knows No Fear. He Knows No Danger. He Knows Nothing." At the end of that they should have added, "He Knows No Humor."I'll have to admit that it wasn't the worst movie I saw in 2003. That honor still belongs to the unforgivable "Legally Blonde 2." But I'd say "Johnny English" probably ties "Daddy Day Care" for the second worst movie of Summer 2003. Having said all that, I must confess that I laughed a couple of times, but not once did I experience an aisle-rolling guffaw. The last 10 minutes of the movie picks up the pace a bit, but by this time it's just too late and nobody really cares anymore.The funniest thing in the movie is probably John Malkovich's fake French accent. It's as stereotypically fake as a French accent can get. Rumor has it that he found a book at the Dollar Tree called, "How to Fake a French Accent - Just Replace the 'th' sound With a 'z.'"As we were leaving the theater I heard one guy say, "It was OK. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. I mean, if it was on cable and I had nothing else to do then I might watch it." He sums it up rather nicely except I'm pretty sure you could find something better on cable to watch. Natalie Imbruglia is cute though. She had a bit of an Elizabeth Hurley vibe going, but she wasn't in the movie long enough to merit even the slightest "eye candy" recommendation. THE GIST "Johnny English" is an unoriginal, predictable, and unfunny movie whose humor is definitely directed towards 10-year-olds. I'm sure glad I saw this for free, and thankfully I'm only about 7 minutes from the theater where it was screened else I probably would've asked to be reimbursed some gas money. Johnny English - he's definitely no Johnny Betts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay- this ain't high art, but then it was never intended to be. A few good laughs, reasonable plot and Atkinson up to his usual tricks were enough for me to enjoy this. I think he's capable of better, but then he needs better writers (such as Ben Elton and Richard Curtis of Blackadder fame) and more time to develop new characters.Anyway, like I say, this was worth the $3.50 rental fee for the coronation scene alone. Now that was hilarious! Rent it, you'll be pleasantly surprised, and even if you don't find it allthat funny you still get to see the very foxy Natalia Imbruglia in a variety of poses and outfits. Look carefully, and you'll see the really sexy tatoo she has on the small of her back! Yummy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really desired just to laugh. Even if the scenes were sophmoric or silly,I just wanted to at least chuckle. I haven't watched too many movies lately that have done this. This film with Rowan Atkinson delivered such moments. Sure as a whole,the film is hit or miss,but four scenes really caressed my funny bone. I mean I never laughed especially hard,but there were moments I really giggled. **Spoilers** a)the scene where English is following a hearse which has bandits who house the Queen's Royal Jewels in a casket. He follows a real hearse into a real funeral. You'll have a guilty concious after you laugh at what happens next. I still chuckled,although I tried hard not to realize that the film pokes fun at funerals. b)the scene where English believes the Arch Duke of Cantebury is actually a fake with the words:JESUS IS COMING SOON..LOOK BUSY above his buttcheeks. What happens in front of a nationwide audience is a scream c)a scene where English is suppose to land from his parachute on the evil Pascal Sauvage's building and instead lands on a hospital. What happens in this scene is also a laugher d)there is also a scene where English believes he has proof of Sauvage's misdeeds on disc. What he plays in front of a nationwide audience is also a laugherIt's a film with funny scenes. It isn't no work of art..far from it. Still I had a good time. That's all I wanted. ****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But not bad either. Austin Powers it's not, but I don't think that was the idea behind this project. First of all, I like Rowan Atkinson very much, so, whether or not I heard nothing but bad comments, I had to see this movie. I thought it was funny only in certain areas. It certainly wasn't anything compared to Austin Powers, or any other spoof of spy movies past or present. I'm just sorry it wasn't funnier than it was. I don't know why Rowan Atkinson, who has been in much better roles, especially Blackadder and even Mr.Bean which is okay but not that great either, did this. He is smarter than this. I actually liked him more in Scooby-Doo. I just think this could have been a lot funnier if they spent more time writing a better story, and less time goofing around with the script. I give it a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but no Mr. Bean...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rowan Atkinson is his usual humorous-self in this movie, but in no way does it compare to Mr. Bean, the movie or the show. There are some really great lines, and it reminded me of an almost British version of Wrongfully Accused with Leslie Nielson. This film was really a satire of James Bond, which wasn't hard to guess from the previews, but a less worthy attempt at it than the Austin Powers series. This film was funny and there is one scene towards the very end that is absolutely hysterical which involves an ABBA song, but nevertheless, not what I was expecting from Atkinson, knowing his great successes with not only the Mr. Bean series, and film, but also from The Black Adder and more recently than that, Four Weddings and a Funeral in which he played the priest who couldn't speak during his first wedding. John Malchovich even being in this movie didn't say much for his film options these days, and I wasn't sure if his accent in the movie was on purpose that bad, or if he just couldn't act. Natalie I. (I'm not even going to attempt to spell her last name), was good, but lacked something I'm sure a "real" actress wouldn't have. She, in my opinion should stick to writing songs. So, with that my score for this piece is 6.5 out of 10. It was a funny movie just for the great lines that it continually had, but the story and plot line were almost non-existent. Try it out if you like Rowan, however, you might be disappointed.That's my review</fullReview>

But it's up to yall.How John Malkovich gives himself up at the end is just dumb.

		<shortDescription>English, Johnny English.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Mr. Bean. The TV show was hilarious and so was the movie. I saw the movie twice in 1997 and I can´t remember any other audiences laughing as hard as back then. In fact, Bean was one of the biggest, if not the biggest, box office hit of 1997 in Finland. Now Rowan Atkinson is back and this time he´s playing Johnny English. When I saw the teaser for this movie I knew this was one film not to be missed, Rowan Atkinson being one of the best comedians in the world. When the movie premiered a few weeks ago I read some lukewarm reviews and started thinking if the movie was worth seeing after all. Finally I decided to catch Johnny English during its theater run.First I have to say that I´ve never been to a movie that equally attracts kids, teens and adults. All these groups were well represented in the showing. That alone tells something about the popularity of Rowan Atkinson. Did I like the movie? Yes, I did. Was it perfect? No, it wasn´t. It wasn´t as funny as Bean, but on the other hand this isn´t Bean. The movie had plenty of hilarious scenes and Rowan Atkinson played his part very well. I have actually just two complaints: 1) Poo jokes are not funny (unless you are 5 years old), and 2) one joke/scene was stolen from the Naked Gun 2?. Other than that there are no other major flaws. This isn´t the most original movie out there and as a Bond parody it´s still below the Austin Powers trilogy (at least the first two movies), but if you went to see this expecting Oscar material you must have been out of your mind. These movies are meant to make you relax and laugh, not to make you think about the problems of our lives. And as brainless entertainment Johnny English doesn´t fail. Johnny English is actually the only hilarious character in the movie, all the others are more or less "serious" characters. John Malkovich obviously has lots of fun with his role and French accent, but they could´ve written more jokes for him too. Natalia Imbruglia won´t get any major awards for her performance, but she´s still better than one might expect. I´d recommend Johnny English to all of you who enjoyed the Bean movie. If you don´t even like Rowan Atkinson don´t go see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like humor, and at the same time don't mind wetting your pants, this is the film for you. The intro is funny, daydreaming that he is a pro spy. Turns out he's not but Agent One's secretary or something like that. Then Agent One is KIA: submarine hatch failed to open. And earlier on Johnny English claims he checked them himself. When his boss, Pegasus turns up, he assures Pegasus that he is entering the most secure place in England. Bomb detonates. Cow moos. Then he slowly turns around. Big laugh from audience (from my theater, by the way. After that English is assigned to the case. The scene with English 'assembling' his handgun. Without the trigger. English's futile attempts to fire a gun is hilarious; the first time he forgets to cock his pistol, tries to fire, and the magazine slides out of the butt; the second time the slide falls off. If you are a fan of films by Atkinson, or just want to watch a plain silly film, this is a film for you. Just keep a tub to pee in. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always wanted to find Rowan Atkinson funny and he consistently disappoints me, with the very notable exception of the 4 'Blackadder' TV Series, which were extremely funny.I don't suppose you should expect too much of a film that is based on a series of TV Ads for Barclaycard. The Ads were actually quite amusing, but then they only lasted for a couple of minutes each. This film is tedious and predictable and just tries too hard to be funny, failing miserably. I admit the scene with the Aston Martin on the lorry is quite good but that's about it.The Bean film was absolute rubbish, 'Rat Race' is nearly as bad and this is worse. Unless you're a die-hard Atkinson fan, I wouldn't bother. Watch the episode of Blackadder III with the Comte de Frou-Frou and the Scarlet Pimpernel instead - now that is Funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say I am disappointed by this movie. I expected it to be bad. The first Bean movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was a disappointing crossover from TV to movie. His Bean shorts are pure genius. His shorts were aired on TV in England and rebroadcast on PBS and Showtime about 7-8 years ago. I loved the shorts so much, I bought the complete DVD set just released. He seemed like a modern day silent screen star. His body movement and language was funny even with the sound off. Bean never said anything; he just acted with his body. His movies are not even in the same league as the Bean TV shows. The first thing wrong is that he talks. Vocally he is not funny. Maybe if he tried to replicate his silent acting style of the Bean shorts it would be original and funny. This movie is not a Mr. Bean character move. I did not expect the Bean character, but I did expect better. In this movie he plays a super agent in England, because all the other agents have been killed. I don't remember laughing or being very interested at any point during this movie. This will definitely qualify for one of the unfunniest comedies of the year. 4\10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a Hollywood studio commissions an English character they select from one of three racist stereotype pigeonholes, resulting in characters with all the depth of a paddling pool, namely: a) Mustache-twiddling sadistic baddie b) Ludicrously camp pervert c) Bumbling idiot. In this case Rowan Atkinson plays the fool with all the grace of Mr. Bean and all the subtlety of a Hydrogen Bomb. The pantomime villain's role taken by John Malkovich (boo, hiss, look behind you) who is obviously enjoying himself but probably isn't in the running for an Oscar this time. A dire film with no redeeming features, Ben Miller's obvious talents tragically wasted and the best performance coming from the Aston Martin. Rowan Atkinson, who I so admired in his early days in such brilliantly crafted series as Blackadder and Not the Nine O'Clock News has become lazy and unfunny. A shameful mess all round.</fullReview>

Natalie Imbruglia gave an outstanding performance as Lorna Campbell but not quite as impressive as the wonderful Ben Miller who played the organised sidekick Bough.

The Englishwoman I work with, and I, spoke at great lengths about all the inside jokes. This is not meant as an insult, just cultural differences. Being from New Jersey it's kind of like when I tell people I live in NJ and they ask "what exit?" Either that or being asked Tony Soprano kind of questions.

		<shortDescription>Atkinson just not funny. Not Black Adder funny. Not Mr Bean funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big Rowan Atkinson fan. I particularly loved the Black Adder series and before watching Johnny English I had a slight hope that Atkinson's spoof bond character would be a bit like Black Adder - a perpetual underdog with a sharp, cynical bite. I also hoped that the movie would not rely solely on slapstick, funny-face humor like that of Mr. Bean. I would have been happy with a healthy mix of either. Unfortunately, Johnny English failed on both counts.Atkinson's dry wit, so brilliantly executed in Black Adder, was doomed from the start, with a shaky, feeble script of hackneyed one-liners and repetitive, corny gags. I grew so tired of the debonair boasts immediately followed by a clumsy disaster. Also, the elaborate tales he reflected upon when in a tight squeeze (e.g. when he was trying to pick the lock) was a dismal attempt at copying Black Adder's hilarious stories bestowed upon an awed Baldric.On the Mr. Bean front: well, in this case it was two strikes and you're out. There were one or two funny Mr. Bean-esque scenes in the movie which did dig up a giggle. I thought the scene in the beginning where he confidently marches down the secret headquarters and then gets very lost was amusing. And his home-cam footage of him dancing around was worth a chortle. But, again, if quality humor were a biscuit then this would be (in the style of Monty Python) 'wafer thin'. I won't harp on about the rest of the movie which just bored me but I will say that I felt sad because it seemed Atkinson had kind of sold himself out to The Man. The Man being the one in a blue and white pin strip suit systematically sucking any magic out of Europe.Natalie Imbruglia was kinda fit though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nope, Johnny be bad, very bad (was toying with Johnny 'B' movie, but that's doing it a favour). Rowan Atkinson has extrapolated a character that originally appeared in British credit card ads as a vehicle for his slapstick 'n girn brand of acting (which can be very funny in its place) and hitched it to the publicity wake of Bond 20. Since the plot revolves around the crown jewels we are given plastic sequences with a (i.e. the) Queen and in a church designed to be like Westminster Abbey and precociously failing as such. Nearly all the jokes are telegraphed. I hope John Malkovich had fun as the 'Frainch' baddie because his is a miserable performance alongside a largely British cast making the best of a bad job - particularly the English comic/actor Ben Miller.Peter Howitt's hands may have been tied by a star that was the only reason the project got green lit. But I remembered his acting career in the (excellent) British sitcom Bread too quickly as I watched set piece after set piece with no narrative consequence in a film this size.Put it on for your kids when you want to go down the pub. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I found the film entertaining enough, but I always get the feeling that Rowan Atkinson isn't comfortable with the transition from small to large screen. His performances all seem to lack conviction, whilst every time I've seen Blackadder, there's never been even a shadow of a doubt that he's enjoying himself immensely with the role. Here I kept seeing flashes of Mr Bean, interspersed with Blackadder moments, and a few times (not that many, sadly) the Barclaycard commercial character upon which this movie was largely based.It was also sad not to see the original Bough (from the adverts) in this film. I guess there's a story as to why not somewhere, but I doubt if we'll ever know why. Ben Miller is pretty good, though, and acquits himself admirably in the role.However, the humour is oh so obvious and predictable all the way through, which rather lessens the effect of the puns and gags. It's still amusing, but not the side-splitting hilarity we could have been treated to. In fact, the jokes still work largely thanks to Rowan's comic timing and his enormously talented facial expressions.However, the film is worthy of a watch. Natalie Imbruglia did well for a first outing and I'm sure we'll be seeing more of her in the future.</fullReview>

If you find such things amusing then you will probably enjoy Johnny English. Anyone else should avoid.

Even the Barclaycard adverts on which this film were based made me laugh. I guess that's why I feel so betrayed by this film. When you see one of your childhood favourites sinking so low it tends to get under your skin. First off, Rowan actually gives a good performance, his comic timing is as perfect as ever. It's just the material doesn't have much of the comic about it. Every joke is predictable, from the pen to the ejector seat. The cast is pretty strong, true Natalie Imbruglia is only there as the love interest but she plays it well. Ben Miller is his usual reliable self as Bough. It could have been so great. But even a good cast can't do much with such lousy material and their best efforts fall flat. The film's biggest problem, even more than the script, is John Malkovich. Yes, John Malkovich, godlike genius actor. How he'll ever be able to justify this film is beyond me. For someone so acclaimed to give such an offensive, ill-judged performance is saddening. This is also the question of the films horribly xenophobic anti-french jokes. Though that should mean it'll get a good reception in certain parts of the U.S. If you're really a Rowan fan you'll do well to avoid this film, pretend you've never heard of it.

Johnny English is basically the same inept spy brought to the big screen. So the concept of this daft English Spy came before Austin Powers, and isn't some sort of austin ripoff as many people think. The ads were quite popular and occasionally funny.The film uses many of the ads concepts to good effect, but it's a hit and miss film. Enjoyable, but instantly forgetable.

		<fullReview>I love Rowan Atkinson as Bean and I really liked Bean the Movie but as some have said they spoiled the movie with the trailers. Besides that, I believe it was more of the writing/directing that was at fault. There just wasn't that Rowan Magic. I looked forward to that movie for a year and took my whole family and regreted not waiting for the video. Paying over $30 for nothing is tough when things are tight.I'm not saying it was awful, just not worthy of Rowans great talent. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fan of Atkinson's (as I am), you will probably love this film, (as I did). Contrary to what I've been reading here and in the external reviews, this is NOT a lame undertaking. "Johnny English" is tremendously entertaining, with bits I hadn't seen before in other spy spoof movies (a huge accomplishment in itself!), and Rowan, of course, is dazzlingly brilliant - AND brilliantly dazzling - in the title role. What more do you want? Ok, you get Malkovich too, as the not-so-sane Pascal Sauvage (that name alone would drive anyone off the deep end), plus Natalie Imbruglia isn't too hard to look at either. I hope there will be a sequel: "Johnny English II: Sauvage's Revenge" perhaps?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Bond he isn't, but he's also not Inspector Clouseau. Instead, Rowan Atkinson is `Johnny English', Secret Agent `1', a sort-of hybrid of the suave Roger Moore, and the bumbling Peter Sellars. While the film has some fine moments of comedy, it doesn't quite hit its target on overall creativity or ingenuity. This really isn't Atkinson's fault, but more that of the filmmakers, none of whom have ever made a comedy before.As is the case with `secret agent' movies, the overall framework of `Johnny English' follows the traditional spy-thriller formula. Here, English is a lower-grade agent with her majesty's secret service, but when a bomb kills literally all other agents, he is the only one left to be assigned the responsibility of guarding the crown jewels of England. After they are stolen, his job then is to recover them. The villain is Pascal Sauvage, played by John Malkovich, a very distant descendent of French royalty, who owns the largest and most successful prison construction and management company in the world. His plan is to dethrone the Queen of England, take her place as the new king, and exercise the little-known rite of reclaiming all the land in the UK in his own name. What does he plan to do with the island-nation? Turn it into a huge prison that would house all the criminals of the world.Uh. Right. Well, anyway, the film's framework mirrors the 007 spy-thriller, including the plot, the gadgets and the female counterparts; this isn't surprising, since the screenwriters are Robert Wade and Neal Purvis, co-writers for the last two Bond films, `Die Another Day' and `The World is not Enough.' The star of the film being Rowan Atkinson, you'd think that there would be more `Mr. Bean' style comedy, since this was his signature caricature for which most people know him. To his credit, Atkinson portrays a more intelligent agent than the simple-minded Mr. Bean, and his natural comedic abilities extend beyond what we've seen from him before. In one scene involving his mixing up two drugs, a truth serum and a muscle relaxant, I was in tears laughing for a good five minutes, even though the entire skit was predictable and not very creative.While Atkinson's work was well done, `Johnny English' doesn't really overcome its downsides: the comedy feels inconsistent, the plot line is sloppy, and the supporting characters don't compliment Atkinson's style of humor. Unlike Peter Sellar's `little yellow friend', Kato, in the Pink Panther series, Atkinson's `straight man', Bough, is more of prop than a catalyst to the antics. These and other problems are more due to the fact that the director, Peter Howitt II, and the aforementioned screenwriters, have never made a comedy before. They are just too inexperienced to best exploit Atkinson's talents or the finer details of comedic cinema.It's hard to recommend `Johnny English' overall, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it for the bits and pieces that were fun. I do hope he tries again, though. He definite has more promise than I'd expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd mark plot spoilers if there were a plot to spoil. Nevertheless, spoilers ahead.The only good point of Johnny English is the recursion of classic ABBA songs. The feeble attempts at humor would be found funny by third graders and nobody else, and though the gag of Atkinson's failing gun was funny the first time, it was repeated far too many times. Malkovich as Sauvage was, pardon the pun, a savage amalgam of stereotypes, including a typical evil villain and an horrid French accent.Nothing seems to be sacred to these people. First, Sauvage's plan is to turn England into a giant prison. Second, Atkinson invades a hospital and holds several doctors and nurses at gunpoint. Third, the Queen is threatened with assassination unless she abdicates, and when she refuses, Sauvage's henchman holds her dog at gunpoint! Finally, at Sauvage's coronation, English removes the trousers of the Archbishop of Canterbury!I demand my hour and a half back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miserable, unfunny waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll save you the plot description and get right to the dissection; this movie was written in a lackadaisical fashion, almost as if the writers had thought it up as a straight drama and then tried to shoehorn jokes into it as it was being shot. Just as some of the gag sequences begin to show comedic promise, they end prematurely (especially the conveyor belt sushi bar scene). A lot of the comedic set-ups are telegraphed so far in advance and the payoffs are less than anticipated that watching the movie almost becomes an exercise in waiting to see how lamely the set-ups will pay off. The fecal tunnel gag was just gross and for the life of me, I can't understand why an innocent victim (Pegasus' secretary) being crippled for life by English (the wheelchair when she comes back from her presumed hospital stay) has comedy value. And while the funeral bit was amusing in a ghastly way, an isolated chuckle here and there do not a comedy make. I personally don't "get" Rowan Atkinson so watching him mug his way through a movie was not amusing in the slightest. As for the rest of the cast, whenever Natalie Imbruglia is onscreen there are sparks of life (and trust me, I'm no fan of that awful "Torn" song she performed a few years back) and, while John Malkovich is slumming here, he puts in a professional performance that shows an intelligence the rest of this enterprise sorely lacks. The production design is passable and the scattered effects shots are fine and dandy. But as a comedy, this movie is as funny as a fart in an elevator; there may be lots of moaning, groaning, eye-rolling and funny faces, but it takes a very "special" sort of person to laugh at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a funny movie somewhere in Johnny English.In fact there is the potential for an excellent movie.Rowan Atkinson is one of Britain's most popular actors and Peter Howitt is a more than capable director. However the problem is the writing.Purvis and Wade fill this movie with the kind of humour that twelve year old schoolboys giggle over at the back of the classroom. Anyone who has ever had the misfortune to sit through Die Another Dayor The World is Not Enough will have cringed at their embarassing attempts at double entendre and lavatorial humour.The same is true here. The jokes are so tired and predictable that the audience can see them coming miles away and they aren't worth the wait. On the plus side Natalie Imbruglia is a charming heroine and the music is quite good.</fullReview>

Going in expecting a film I'd rate 2 and a half or 2, I ended up rating it a 4. The film is really funny!I don't understand it's negative comments. Maybe it's the poo joke, but there is only one so I don't see how it affects the film that much. It's really one of those mindless films where you leave your brain at home and just come with your money for a ticket and the popcorn. If you come expecting a spectacular masterpiece full of clever wit, you'll find nothing in it.Rowan CAN do better, that's the exact line I thought after seeing the Bean movie. Johnny English is certanily better then the Bean movie, but nothing near the Bean show itself. Rowan does good acting as usual, Natalie was a bad choice for the woman as I don't think she can even sing let alone act. John Malkovich did a good job as the French Villian.As a verdict,Acting: ***1/2 out of *****Story: ** out of *****Laughter: ***** of *****Overall: **** out of ***** (I would usually rate 3.5 out of 5, but considering it's so underrated here I'll give it just another bit of credit).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rowan Atkinson performs to expectation in this comic homage to the world of James Bond, as the hapless / unlucky titular hero, plucked from obscurity to take the 007 role and save the world. By turns arrogantly officious and painfully embarrassed, English muddles through with help from sidekick Bough (an excellent turn from Ben Miller) and love interest Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia making the best of a shallow role). While some complain that most of the gags are highly predictable, the comedy is really centered on Atkinson's reaction to the situation everyone but him could see was coming. Malkovich coasts through his role as Pascal Sauvage, which might have suited someone with a real accent better (Vincent Cassel, perhaps. Maybe next time).In all, while it has it's flaws, Johnny English has enough character to encourage a sequel, as long as the producers don't attempt to 'reset' the character to trot out a cheap rehash.Failing that, I'd encourage a spin-off franchise for Bough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again it all boils down to what you are expecting. Sometimes reading reviews before you see a movie can be a bad idea, but saying that it can sometimes outline what you will be getting. One key point that I read before seeing this movie was that it aims a little younger than say Austin Powers. Now that pre armed me with what to expect and true enough it is aimed at a younger audience but saying that it was very entertaining quite similar to Inspector Clouseau and his reliable Kato. I enjoyed it at times it was a little silly and the jokes are quite predictable but they are well executed and there were a few little surprises that were very funny. People attack Malkovich but this is supposed to be pantomime and the baddy is supposed to be over the top and a little silly the plot is lamentable and just a tool to put people in comedic situations Natalie is absolutely stunning. If your in the mood for some light hearted English fun then go and see it lets face it you know what to expect with Rowan Atkinson this is a sort of a cross between the Thin blue line meets Bean meets Blackadder.</fullReview>

Some of the jokes are blatant and groan-because-you-saw-it-coming but they tend to have a twist at the end, without spoiling it, the long running joke about his problems with his gun has a great ending.Watch this movie for a bunch of laughs from a movie maker who realises you don't need to be slapped in the face by a spoof type joke every half second.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the most God-awful cringingly-accented Miss Imbruglia, the worst Aussiefied tonsils since Olivia Nuke 'em John's turn in GREASE, JOHNNY ENGLISH has its moments......three in fact, one of which (the muscle-relaxant sequence) alone, is worth seeing the flick for. John Malkovich even, manages an excruciatingly over-the-top French accent in his role as the Bondesque baddie Pasquale Sauvage.As someone correctly noted, JOHNNY ENGLISH is simply an extension of the Barclaycard ads Atkinson was paid squillions for a few years ago. For the most part though, rather indifferently flat, much like MR BEAN. Best described as JAMES BOND goes NAKED GUN, it could and should have been way funnier, still if one is in an undiscriminating mood, it is a likeable enough time-filler, nothing more. No one's life will be the least bit enriched for having seen it. Ben Miller as Johnny's long suffering partner has the best role in the flick and makes the most of it too.Highlight of the film is Robbie Williams title track....close to the best "Bond song" ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special, but entertaining enough and great for good laughters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Johnny English" is a simple and predictable movie. There's nothing special or extraordinary about it, but it is somehow a good surprise. Many people say it is terrible, but it ain't that bad.Without being a 5 stars movie, "Johnny English" is great fun and very entertaining. We can watch it relaxed and give some good laughters. This is a parody to James Bond, it's like mocking on James Bond. He even has an Aston Martin (just like James Bond). However, unlike James Bond, Johnny English is an incompetent spy. His partner Bough is more competent than him.This movie has lots of hilarious (even hysterical) moments. There are so many that it would take a long time to mention them. However, one of the funniest is when Johnny English's partner inserts the wrong DVD and the whole world sees Johnny dancing in the bathroom, making silly figures at the sound of the ABBA song "Does Your Mother Know". Another hilarious scene is when Johnny English enters in a hospital by mistake and realizes his error (without admitting it, however). That's a real treat!The soundtrack is not bad too. Besides the mentioned ABBA's song, there's also the catchy "A Man For All Seasons" (by Robbie Williams) and others.Only the comedian Rowan Atkinson could play a role like this. Surprisingly he speaks much more in the role of Johnny English than as Mr. Bean. The beautiful Natalie Imbruglia is great too in her role. Ben Miller does a good job as Bough (Johnny's partner). However, John Malkovich is quite weak but hilarious as the villain Pascal Sauvage and his french accent is terrible and so unnatural. He definitely should take some french lessons.Johnny English's tagline: He knows no fear, he knows no danger, he knows nothing. How true is that! Couldn't say myself better than this.Overall, "Johnny English" isn't meant to be an Oscar winner, but a silly comedy full of British humor and a "full plate" for Rowan Atkinson's fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rowan atkinson gurning makes this film funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a simple plot, rubbish spy Jonny English is given his big break as a major spy and manages to luck his way through the mission despite incompetence.All the jokes are completely transparent, and I was guessing the punchlines before he was saying them. This should be a dire film and I almost regret the fact I absolutely love it.Rowan Atkinson is hilarious. Even though you know what's coming, it's the way he does it that keeps you laughing despite yourself. The variety of ways he embarrasses himself and his assistant, Bough, keeps you with the film and rooting for Jonny. Comic timing is spot on between Jonny and Bough, and their exchanges are the best parts of the film.Malcovitch is annoying. That accent, uggh! My housemate is French and he admitted he found Malcovitch extremely annoying. But after a while you can forgive even that, and just try to ignore the man.I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this film. It's complete rubbish. But funny rubbish. Watch it, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.Pete</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through a series of events too far-fetched to detail the British Secret Service have only one agent at their disposal - Johnny English - to stop the theft of the crown jewels and hinder a Frenchman's plan to ascend to the British throne.Sadly - for us and them - the agent is also a face-pulling fool.Silly comedy is a strange fish in that you can't really attack anything that happens with regards the plot. They are bullet proof. When you say "this makes no sense on any level", people reply with "Yes - but it's a silly comedy."What are the rules of this bonkers world then? Where is the logic that I am supposed to cling on to? Can he fly or change in to farmyard animals? Sorry, but I need at least some logic - even its-own - to get me from one scene to the next!Here we have the premise doesn't exist anywhere but on film: The hero is a complete and utter idiot, but somehow no one else notices this, even though he screws up everything! Have they - his employers - been hypnotised? How come they don't, sort of, notice that he is an imbecile?(We are told "he normally only works in an office." Well obviously an office is a place where being able to function on any level is optional! This guy would strangle someone to death just by picking up the phone. But hey, I am giving the writers free material for the sequel!)Here the villain is John Malkovich but this fact can't have been known to the writers, because if they had known they would have given him some proper dialogue. However given the quality of the rest of it, this might turn out to be a blessing in disguise!Despite being British-based it involves a lot of well known places and landmarks so it will play well in Middle America. It is not so much London as cliché London. We even have the Queen! Add to that the sub James Bond clichés (gadgets, car chase, sexy girl) and you find that there is nothing at all happening here that hasn't been done a thousand times before - seriously and not so seriously.Natalie Imbruglia plays the "sex interest" role - but acts like she has no interest in anything at all and certainly not English. I have seem some wooden performances in my time but this one lays her open to wood-worm!Rowan Atkinson went in to a clinic for depression after this and I think I can see why. He had to watch it more than once. At least he got paid for watching it - not like the poor suckers who liked Bean (Atkinson's big screen TV spin-off) a lot and went hoping for more of the same. Hope they enjoyed the popcorn and came home to find the house safe-and-sound!This film is proof that Atkinson has pulled all the silly faces he can get away with. He is a millionaire now - so I hope the shrinks and his assistants (and assistant assistants) can talk him out of making any more of this cynical quick-buck junk and return to plain acting.While face-pullers like Jerry Lewis had no acting talent and, therefore, nowhere to go when the laughs dried up, Atkinson has. The tragedy is that the guy has a lot of talent the non UK public never see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a horrible attempt at a spy comedy. I have seen Rowan Atkinson in many things, from his Mr. Bean character to the Black Adder. He is a funny man. This movie makes him look worse than Leslie Nielson in Spy Hard. Okay maybe not that bad, but it comes close. The jokes are old and repetitive. WE GET IT !!! He's a bumbling fool. There's no need to drag it out for 90 minutes. The story is simple enough. All of Great Britain's secret agents are killed by a criminal mastermind (with the exception of Agent One who is killed by Mr. Bean's incompetence). One could argue that the rest of the agents fall much in the same way, however Agent One's demise has a more direct correlation. Thankfully, there is one left. Can you guess who ?? I cannot even imaging what kind of painkillers John Malkovich was taking to star in this movie. The "evil plan" along with the ending are so ridiculous that one wishes to use the writers and director of this movie as a dart board. The final assault was by far one of the most ridiculous scenes .. since Austin Powers 2 (think Fat Bastard and poop jokes). I don't think I laughed once. I may have chuckled once, but I think I was choking on a grape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, my son and his two friends very much enjoyed "Johnny English." Good.This is a largely lame comedy that occasionally attains the sophomoric level while sinking beneath unfunny scatological "humor". Rowan Atkinson is a bumbling "MI7" agent and he can't play the role with the subtle wit or great physical comedy that Peter Sellers gave his Inspector Clouseau. Natalie Imbruglia is your generic, drop-dead beautiful, operative ready with a quip and able to disarm adversaries with unconvincing kung-fu tactics. The only one interesting to watch is John Malkovich as the evil Pascal Sauvage, a Frenchman driven to be crowned king of England (this is a great time for Gallic ambition to succeed the Windsors, isn't it?). Malkovich is one of our greatest actors. I assume his house needed emergency and expensive repairs and this dog came along. Can't blame him. I would have done the same.2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can only comment on the first 45 minutes of this film, since I walked out on it. The problems it has is telegraphing its jokes. Since you can see them coming 5 seconds before they hit, you can already have evaluated whether or not they'll be funny. Unfortunately, most of them weren't at all funny. The jokes are generally embarrassing faux pas or just general clumsiness. When he and his assistant are supposed to parachute to a building, and an identical one is right beside it, you can tell where he's going to land. That sets up all the rest of the jokes, but since you know what's going to happen, it loses its appeal. When the hearse he's following stops at a cemetery, you know what's happened and what's going to happen as a result.Overall, it's unfortunate that the film didn't have more talented writers. That's the whole reason the movie fails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so "Johnny English" is basically a stupid movie. BUT IT'S SO HILARIOUS!!!!!!!! Rowan Atkinson plays the title character, a dim-witted secret agent trying to stop French villain Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich doing a ridiculous accent) from becoming king of England. Of course, the whole thing is an excuse for English to get into one embarrassing situation after another...and meanwhile get to know sexy Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia).Yes, this is very much a movie that they only intended to be silly. Rowan Atkinson's character is essentially Mr. Bean as a spy (and talking more than usual). Even if it is a pointless movie, you're sure to love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have very high expectations for this film, but it was even worse then I thought. This is a one joke film, ruined by the fact the joke was used in the trailer, so you could have just watched the trailer and avoided the rest of this terrible film.Naked Gun did this stuff so much better, and many years earlier. Apart from the sushi bar scene all the jokes were stolen from other films and the anti-french jokes were cringeworthy.John Malkovich in particular was terrible, definitely a film he did for the money, i'm a big fan of his films but this is definitely his career lowpoint to date.If this is the best we can do in Britain then there's not much hope for us. We have a great many decent comedy actors, it's about time we gave one of them a film break rather then re-using Rowan Atkinson and the rest of the "past it" brigade.2.5 out of 10</fullReview>

Though when you look at parody films Jonny English has to be the best one ever.Atkinson proves his skill of acting again which he has done before in other shows like the famous Mr bean. Other actors also have done their parts well. All the scenes of the movie that showed Atkinson in it produced either smiles or made you jump from your seats. Though many of the scenes are a bit unintelligent, it still created hum. In short Johnny English is a great Parody and should be watched by all viewers in the world.I hope the sequel is also great.If you haven't watched it yet then all I can say is go bu the DVD or borrow it.

You'd have thought that they could, at least, have found a voice coach to help him with the French accent even if his acting couldn't be helped.Austin Powers is a better James Bond spoof, without a doubt, but, nevertheless, this is very entertaining. The 'just look busy' line is one of the best that could be chosen for an Archishoprical tattoo, and the Mr Bean style incompetence is done as well as ever.The end suggests a sequel, but I'm not aware of one having been made. Why not? If he teamed up with Austin Powers it could breath new life into both bond alternatives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small Time Comedy !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Bond attracted the spoofs very early. After the super spy's birth in (Dr. No ? 1962) the character got parodied in no time with (Carry on Spying ? 1964), (Two Mafiosi Against Goldfinger ? 1965), then a whole TV show (Get Smart ? 1965). Actually Bond, as I said once, can be a perfect spoof of itself sometimes! Since the mid-90s there were clear spoofs of certain marks belong to the super spy's world such as (Spy Hard ? 1996), (Austin Powers International Man of Mystery ? 1997), (OSS 117 Le Caire nid d'espions ? 2006). Or action comedies that makes fun of the formula, yet achieving it also, with kids : (Spy Kids ? 2001), (Agent Cody Banks ? 2003), (Secret Agent 420 ? 2005).So when I've heard about (Johnny English ? 2003) I said to myself here's a new spoof. It isn't. It's a comedy about being - so small - in Bond's shoes. That could have made it better than any spoof since it got good premise. But the things were between mediocre and usual. It reminded me, at best, of some of the 60s decent comedies. However without the Jazz tunes, the slapstick and the sexy chicks!I was shocked when I read that 2 of 4 wrote the script (Neal Purvis and Robert Wade) previously worked on two James Bond movies (Die Another Day), (The World Is Not Enough), and then (Casino Royale) !?? I still can't believe since there wasn't any creative action, or action, to prove that right. It is obvious that Johnny English was just a rest in between!While the plot of stealing the throne was so fine, the dealing wasn't as big. There was a plot hole : how the queen didn't inform about signing the renunciation after, as something has been done under threatening ? (I though it was better to have her cat kidnapped all the time so she can't open her mouth about that).I laughed while : English threw his coat out of the window trying to imitate the real spy, drawing the alleged Banana terrorist, showing the CD of English's goofiness in the bathroom internationally, and the last scene with the trick of Bond's car in (Goldfinger). Sadly there wasn't more. Maybe it relied too much on some traditional stuff, Rowan's own routine, or not a well made situations.Well, although (Rowan Atkinson) without the Bean stuff seems like a typical everyday-man with a touch of sad seriousness sometimes, but he was at his worst, looking real frigid at times. Unlike Bond, of the 1960s, there wasn't any hot female presence in it whatsoever (The feminism. I KNOW!). But the problem is that (Natalie Imbruglia) has pale presence as an actress, comedienne or face. Especially with her sleepy eyes and bad hair cut. (John Malkovich) was about making a fool of himself but he didn't, and that's why I didn't like him. I felt that the ACTOR in him interfered with the farce of the whole thing to give something nerves and evil but not comic! What I really loved about this movie is its opening credits in which Robbie Williams's (A Man for All Seasons) - music by Hans Zimmer himself - is on while showing many fast moments of English's daily fooling, all in the colors of the UK flag dancing smoothly on screen. That was perfect in a way the movie itself didn't achieve very. I can say it was the only high and memorable thing in here ! OK, wanna a last line to sum it all up, then know this: First time I watched it I didn't like it, deciding that I would not write about it. But after nearly 4 years I ran into it again, and you know what ? I sat till the last second of it. Whatever that might tell you.. it's true !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rowan Atkinson is better known for his role as clueless Mr. Bean or Raymond from "A Thin Blue Line," British comedies that play popularly here in America too. Rowan Atkinson (he should be knighted or honored but that will come eventually) is one Britain's best known comedic actors. Unfortunately, he does not have the look of a leading man to get better roles. As Johnny English, this film is a spoof of the James Bond genre. The film has great authentic London locations and also stars the deliciously evil John Malkovich as the man who steals the Queen's jewels in order to reclaim his family's throne. The film does have some laughs along the way. It could be funnier but I still enjoyed it. I love watching Rowan Atkinson in anything. He truly is one of the great British comic actors of our time and his talent is surely underused in today's film industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Johnny English" in theaters back in the year 2003 and I remember being just disappointed, maybe because I was expecting something similar to "Mr. Bean". I never felt desires of watching it again but I found it in a double-movie DVD, being the other movie "Bean" (1997), so I decided to give it one more chance and I'm glad I did it.I don't know if the writers made the script of this parody of James Bond thinking always in Rowan Atkinson for the main role but in the end they have a really great choice because I just can't see him in a serious role and that is what Johnny English tries to be: a really serious secret agent. So that's why I think Atkinson is perfect for the role because nobody takes him seriously and, in the film, nobody takes Johnny seriously not even his own enemies. In the plot we have that the Agent One, the best secret agent of England, died in a mission and an explosion at his funeral killed all the other agents so Johnny English is the only alive. Johnny and Bough (Ben Miller), his inseparable assistant, used to work for the secure of the Agent One but now they need to take care of the things. Johnny is the kind of guy who seems that is a big fan of all the James Bond movies and he just want to be like him or like Agent One. Now that he have that chance he tries really hard but he is just very stupid to be a James Bond but for his fortune he has the help of Bough who is less pretentious but much more effective and later he also has the help of the beautiful Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia), who is first a suspect but later turns to be an agent. The plot involves the theft of the Crown jewels and the suspect of Johnny is Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich), a multimillionaire French. Is just really funny to see Malkovich as this conceited French who wants to be King and turns England into a prison. He must have seen "Escape from New York".Lots of fun with the worst agent of England that soon is the only hope for this country. Of course all the fun is based in the nationalism, the countless gadgets, the amazing cars, the beautiful women and the class of James Bond. So definitely I like it much more than the first time I saw it and I think that I even like it more than "Bean". Recommend to anyone who is looking for 82 minutes of pure entertainment with great fun and also with the amazing beauty of Natalie Imbruglia. Mr. Bean is Mr. Bond and is fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny English (2003, Dir. Peter Howitt) When a funeral of a British spy is attacked, all the remaining spies are killed. Only one spy is left and is now Britain's last hope. Johnny English and his sidekick, Bough have been assigned the case of investigating the theft of the British Crown Jewels. The prime suspect is a mysterious French entrepreneur, known as Pascal Sauvage. English and Bough soon find out the horrifying truth behind the theft and Sauvage, but it's not going to be an easy job to bring him to justice.'Johnny English' is a spoof of spy films, but not in the 'Austin Powers' style. It has been created more in the style of 'Mr. Bean'. This comes as no surprise, as the star of the film is Mr. Bean, himself, Rowan Atkinson. Atkinson portrays the usual clumsy spy, who you expect nothing to go right for. Add to this the humour of 'Bean' and you get this. The jokes are nearly all focused on physical actions. Children are obviously going to enjoy the jokes on poo and his actions, but i feel adults really need to be a fan of Atkinson or of Bean, to really enjoy this."Everything's under control." - Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny English is a smart film very funny. Rowan Atkinson is very funny and very entertaining. The story is smart when England's only hope is the last man on earth you want to trust the fate of Great Britain too. One mistake made in the film is the Villain's plan to become the king of England and make Britain a giant prison. But of course no King/Queen has the power to do that. But besides the plan to destroy England the film is Great!. I think this is one of Britain's best comedies. Not as a good as The Full Monty or Life of Brain but still up their. Johnny English is a film you can see loads of time. and still find it funny. It's a film for all ages. From 4-50.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atkinson is funny, film is derivative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Johnny English" will remind viewers of films in the Pink Panther series and Rowan Atkinson's character is modeled on Inspector Clouseau, the maladroit detective created by Peter Sellers. Some may also be reminded of Don Adams in the TV series, "Get Smart." Except that Rowan Atkinson is a marvelous physical comedian, "Johhny English" would fall completely flat. Even with Atkinson, "Johhny English" is utterly inferior to the Sellers and Adams vehicles. I saw it because it was being played by teen-age relatives. Be forewarned: This movie doesn't cut it. It is funny occasionally, but only the physical comedy fits the bill. More sophisticated comedy is entirely lacking. And the physical comedy is repetitive. Atkinson is talented but a little of him goes a long, long way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johny English(Rowan Atkinson) is the most funniest movie I have ever seen before.Johny English always does some silly things, he always drops the bullets on the floor if he was fighting.Those scenes make the movie seems very funny.I think that the music added in the movie is very fast, it makes the movie's pace more faster. The movie's sound effects are more specials than other movies. In addition, the actor's acting is very true, it makes me feel scared when Johny English(Rowan Atkinson) is in danger, I really wanted to run in to the film and safe him, but I cannot do such things. I love this film very much. I would like to watch it time over time to discover new things they used in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very mediocre film to watch once and to forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Johnny English" is not up to the usual "Bean" standards. It's nothing special and that sounds quite negative. Don't know about you, people, but for me Mr Rowan Atkinson must be excellent (like in "Bean" sketches, like in "The Thin Blue Line" serial, and like in "Bean" the movie) or mustn't be at all. Being just good means being bad - like here.A very disappointing movie. Thankfully, did not buy the DVD (though some people had brainwashed me how funny it was). Well, it seems that the more funds they put into productions with Mr Rowan Atkinson, the less impressive they get. "Bean" is not about SFX, not about sex and big explosions, it's about a down-to-earth nerd, who is constantly making mischief and behaves like a child. The idea of a dim-witted spy is not bad. The way it's carried out is not bad. But, come on, it's Mr Rowan Atkinson. This role is NOT for him.5 out of 10 - a very mediocre film to watch once and to forget. Thanks for attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it has been referred as a "total disappointment", I feel the need to admit that they are totally wrong. Yes, it may seem a little stupid every now and then, but in the most of times, succeeds in the combination of action and comedy with some parts that will provide a full-time-laugh. Rowan Atkinson at his best persuades really makes an impression and John Malkovich -Oh, my God, he has rich hair!- drives people crazy -in the good way of meaning- with his English-French accent. The screenplay is written in an exceptional way of style and I don't see the reason for not giving this movie a shot. It may change your night.</fullReview>

On some moments, you will not be able to stop laughing! But this movie is not as funny when you see it for a second time! That's a pity. There are some movies that stay just as good, even if you see them 3 times. It's still funny if you watch it a second time, but certainly not as much as if you see it for the first time.

		<fullReview>Rowan Atkinson is always funny and Natalie Imbruglia plays a great female lead. Ben Miller also provides a great supporting character as Bough, English's sidekick. The premise of the film is funny and there are a lot of very entertaining scenes. However, the first time I saw this film I was incredibly distracted by John Malkovich's horrible French accent. I mean it was really bad! I read another user comment that said that the accent was intended to be over the top. I'm a great fan of Malkovich, but after having seen the film again several times I still don't see it. I hope that was what the original intention, but it didn't convince me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this on a DVD at my relative's place, and the other time was like when I was on holiday with my family from the hotel room's TV. At that time in the latter case, my family and I all watched it together.At times I wondered is it because Rowan Atkinson, otherwise famously known for his funny antics on 'Mr Bean' which I grew up watching and laughing along, is the reason why my family watched it together.In this movie, the Crown Jewels had been stolen...and it's up to Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) to help get it back for the Queen. But when the Frenchman Pascal (John Malkovich) was the one who stole it, things can get out of hand and a little comical at times. With Lorna Campell (Natlie Imbruglia) helping English, it's interesting to see how things work out.Kind of funny and silly at times, just like how I often know of Rowan Atkinson when he plays the lead role of Mr Bean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey this ones good just for laughs. Okay there is our (Anti) Hero who becomes a special agent for a very ironic reason. His mission is to protect the British crown jewels but he acts like (and of course is) a complete wannabe. I just can't imagine any movie which was funnier. This one is a spy spoof and this spoof was well done. To be honest I think it is one of the best spy spoofs ever made (aside from the Austin Powers saga). Well okay, there are better movies but that's visual Comedy. Slapstick is just for laughs and doesn't always have to make much sense.

		<fullReview>This movie was funny and had a bit of action, yet there were no gruesome deaths, inappropriate jokes, or heated sex scenes. Except for a few stray scenes, it was a movie I'd watch with the family.The acting wasn't the greatest, but it got the movie along. Mr. Bean was pretty amazing as Johnny English, and his sidekick, played by Ben Miller, wasn't bad at all! In fact, I almost liked Baugh better than English.The plot was pretty simple and easy to grasp, which is good for slow people like me. Don't expect to be wowed by any intense surprises or twists in the story, it's pretty simple and follows the usual good guy vs. bad guy theme. But I think this worked in favor for the movie, it allowed for concentration on the humorous parts, which were the meat of the entertainment. I guarantee a couple of chuckles out of this movie! I'd recommend this movie to anyone at any age. It even has a cool theme song. You just can't beat this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to say it but this movie would have been easier to enjoy if we hadn't been recently flooded with James Bond spoofs in the form of the Austin Powers trilogy. Still, Jonny English becomes pretty unique within the bumbling spy genre when it doesn't try to mock everything in sight and insert as much bathroom humor as they can fit into every minute. Rowan Atkinson plays the title character, a third-rate spy who comes to power when everyone else is killed in an explosion he accidentally caused, Ben Miller plays cinematic history's most overqualified sidekick, Natalie Imburgia exhibits a playful sense of humor as the steaming love interest, and John Malkovitch's performance as the villain is choked up in an annoyingly thick French accent. The humor, revolving around English's stupidity, gets to be repetitive and the film makes the mistake of caring too much about a plot not worth caring about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atkinson should stick to TV and cameos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rowan Atkinson has made part of his career doing scene-stealing performances in movies in which he's not the star, like "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and "Love Actually," both scripted by his writer Richard Curtis. He even was good in the Bond film "Never Say Never Again," where he was funnier in five minutes than he was for the entirety of "Johnny English." He doesn't seem able to translate his talent at TV skits and movie cameos into starring roles in feature films. A good example of the problem is "Bean," the feature-length adaptation of his often-hilarious show "Mr. Bean." But at least that film had some good parts, even if it didn't amount to much in the end.The problem with "Johnny English" is far more serious. Almost all of it is patently unfunny. It does have a couple of good moments, such as when he comes up with a ridiculous composite of a criminal he invented to make himself into a hero, and when he gets his tie caught in a conveyor belt. But between these (very) few laughs are long sections that are so barren and desperate they become painful. I honestly would not have continued watching the film to the end if I wasn't a fan of Atkinson. I was hoping the film would somehow redeem itself. Alas, it gets worse as it goes along, and at 88 minutes it feels way too long.Most of the jokes are so badly set up you can almost hear the "thud." They frequently seem to lack a punchline, or the punchline is so predictable you wonder what the point was supposed to be. When he picks up what he thinks is a pen and begins fiddling with it, anyone who's even passingly familiar with James Bond films (in other words, just about everyone) will easily predict that the "pen" will turn out to have some concealed weapon that he will inadvertently set off and hit the secretary with. The rest of the scene involves Johnny's attempts to distract his boss from noticing the woman being taken away on a stretcher.I think this movie makes a fatal error in its characterization of Johnny. It's funny to see a character who's inept but who thinks he's a genius--like Inspector Clousseau, for example. It's a lot less funny to see a character like Johnny English, who seems to know he's incompetent and tries to cover it up. And with one or two notable exceptions, the way that he covers up his mistakes is lame and unimaginative. The movie isn't outrageous enough, never willing to take its jokes as far as they will go, and it frequently waits too long before springing the punchlines, as in one scene where he pretends to be a mental patient to hide another one of his embarrassing misjudgments. The blandness of the humor is particularly stunning to anyone who's seen "Mr. Bean," which often depended on a clever surprise at the end of each skit.This film also has the same problem that plagued the movie "Bean," which is that Rowan Atkinson's persona is basically a creep. That may work in the skits and cameos Atkinson specializes in, but it's fatal to a full-length movie in which he's presented as an improbable hero. The behavior of his characters is obnoxious and off-putting, yet in this film the other characters around him don't seem to notice. When Natalie Imbruglia as his fellow agent professes her undying love for him about two-thirds of the way through, it goes without saying that we have no idea what she sees in him, but the absurdity generates discomfort rather than laughs.People who have never seen Rowan Atkinson before and watch this film are likely to come away with the highly mistaken impression that the guy has no talent. "Johnny English" is not merely disappointing; it is a truly awful movie that gives no indication why Atkinson is famous. For those who have never seen him before, my advice is: avoid this like the plague, and go and rent "Mr. Bean."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad but could of been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually enjoy Atkinson's work so I was looking forward to watching this despite remembering some bad reviews it received when it was released. I found it a quite entertaining comedy without being hilarious.Atkinson plays Johnny English, a bumbling spy who with the help of his trusty sidekick Bough (a nice performance by Ben Miller) sets out to foil Pauscal Sauvage's (John Malkovich with a ridiculous French accent)evil plans. What almost sinks the film is the lack of chemistry between Rowan Atkinson and his leading lady Natalie Imbruglia (who can't act for peanuts). Despite this there are enough humorous bits for the undemanding viewer to get some enjoyment. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre, 88-minute, spy thriller parody. Mr. Bean has officially done everything now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>---Trailer Level Spoilers---Rowan Atkinson's most lovable character has to be Mr. Bean, if not Bean, than Enrico Polini from Rat Race. He is even known to some people as that Italian guy from Rat Race or just Mr. Bean. This time, Rowan Atkinson stars in Johnny English, a parody of all spy films, mostly just the Bond films but in a comedic way mostly. However, Johnny English could have easily been taken into satiric context but instead, it's filled with unnecessary stale jokes but still contains some good ones. It's also stereotypes the hate between English and French, thus, that could have somewhat led to a satiric context easily for a parody.From the director of Laws of Attraction, Peter Howitt directs Johnny English with his English style of film. Rowan Atkinson plays a government clerk named Johnny English who is forgotten, over-looked, and seldom thought of. He has a low paying job and is never given a chance to improve. One day when him and his friend are working in his office, the top agent in Britain named Number 1 enters to get his assignment filed by Johnny. He then gets killed on his mission. When his replacement comes, it's Johnny's job to welcome him. Unlucky for him, while he ensures the agent that the establishment is the most secure place in England, a huge explosion kills the rest of England's top agents. Now Johnny and his friend are assigned the job of top agent. Their mission is to find out what the French are up to next. Apparently, this certain French man they're after has a complex plan to take over the world by becoming the King of England. Anyway's I hate to write reviews with spoilers, even trailer-level so I'll conclude.Overall, Johnny English has some classic Bean-style jokes except his character is too excited at times and plays too stupid for a secret agent, even for a parody. When the jokes aren't good, they're bad; real bad. The action is all right, when it actually happens. Still English has a good foundation and could have been done much better. If it's given a sequel, there is a perfect opportunity for re-thinking it over and making it better.My Rating: 6.5/10 (A Low 6.5)Eliason A.</fullReview>

English soon has to save the crown jewels of England, and him and his partner Bough are the only ones who know the real suspect is seemingly-innocent, multi-billionaire Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich) whose family was supposed to own England 200 years ago. Johnny teams up with a lady spy to save the crown, because Sauvage wants to turn all of England into a prison.

		<fullReview>1st watched 4/10/2003 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Peter Howitt): Sometimes funny, most of the time boring attempt by Rowan Atkinson to jump out of his popular `Bean' character into a James Bond-like spy who obviously does not have nerves of steel. The movie begins with Atkinson dreaming of being a suave-debonair spy and then he is given the chance to become one when the # 1 spy is not available for the case. What follows is this character's attempts to become the best James Bond-like spy despite his obvious shortcomings. There a lot of plot-holes in this story, but what really doesn't make the movie work is that it's not funny. Some of the jokes are obviously meant to be understood more by British-folk with a few pokes directly at `royalty' and some directly at `French' people. The evil person is played as a Frenchman who wants to be king of England, played by John Malkovich, who looks like he doesn't what to be a part of this movie most of the time. This is probably his worst role he's ever been given. Sometimes with comedies, we can forgive the storyline glitches but not when we aren't laughing when we're supposed to, which is the bottom line for this movie. How about a Bean #2 instead, mister Atkinson?</fullReview>

When I watch a comedy, I expect to laugh a lot. I didn't even smile much, let alone laugh. Only semi-humorous parts were in the first third of the movie. Atkinson's brilliance was wasted big time here on stupid scenes. Exactly what was funny about him getting his tie caught in that conveyor belt or getting dumped on with raw sewage?

		<fullReview>Johnny English is a tired comedy, with stale and predictable gags. Consider the following example of outrageously unfunny verbal wit: "I think I'd rather have my bottom impaled on a giant cactus than exchange pleasantries with that jumped up Frenchman," says Johnny, unknowing that the 'jumped up Frenchman' is standing right behind him. It doesn't even raise the ghost of a smile. Rowan Atkinson should resign himself to the fact that his metier is as the silent Mr. Bean.The film begins well enough, with an amusing daydream sequence, where Johnny English - pen-pusher at M17 (comic cousin of Britain's M16 spy agency) fantasises about his dangerous, dashing life if he were the notoriously brilliant Agent One. When Agent One, and the entire M17 spy corps are killed - through English's blunders - his dream becomes reality. It is up to him to save England from the machinations of a megalomaniac Frenchman, who wishes to claim the British throne and turn the country into a massive prison.With a plot and characters like these, there is obviously the potential for Johnny English to be a humorous Bond-spoof, but the potential remains largely inactivated. There are occasional moments of genuine mirth, such as a hearse being chased by a tow truck, and the subsequent scene in the graveyard, but these are few and far between. The jokes are signposted a mile off, and include juvenile toilet humour. One does get the impression the scriptwriters were rather low on inspiration and in the resultant morass, one joke is even utilised twice. Ironically, the funniest moment of the movie is tacked on part way through the end credits, by which time most of the audience will have switched off in disappointment.</fullReview>

There is a film in the eighties called King Ralph that repeated nearly all the same jokes and the stereotypical royal gags that weren't that funny then so why dredge them back up?

		<fullReview>The only excuse to see this film is Rowan Atkinson. When he is good, he is terrific, and very funny. It's a shame this film doesn't allow Mr. Atkinson show his talents, due, do doubt, to the silly treatment this movie has been given by the production people behind it. At times, this film is very funny, but it's a shame that it could have been helped with a more satisfying script to make it worth of Mr. Atkinson's screen persona. All that said, it's not a horrible film, but just think what it could have been if all the elements would have jelled to make it better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should probably start by saying that I really don't like Rowan Atkinson much except when he's Blackadder, or way back when he did stand up.And I probably shouldn't have expected too much from a film based on a character created for a credit card commercial.But the trailer looked quite funny, (I think I laughed at it once) and there was nothing else on....Well, amazing to say but even my low expectations weren't met. It was awful, every 'gag' telegraphed a mile off, just...dire. I have nothing constructive to say, so I'll keep this short.I would say the humour is aimed at maybe 8 - 12 year olds, except the rest of the cinema were in fits of laughter, and they were mostly adults, so what do I know?Just be warned - if your first instinct is that it will be bad, go with that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Some Very Minor Spoilers*Like most of the spy spoofs before it, "Johnny English" doesn't seem to achieve its full potential. It has a lot of material, a lot of spirit, and a lot of talent, and just the right amount of charisma, laughs and gags, but nevertheless fails to muster up enough laughs to strongly recommend.Rowan Atkinson is the eponymous lead, aptly named Johnny English. He's a wannabe secret agent with no knowledge of spy tactics, weapons or combat training whatsoever. The story starts with Johnny imagining himself as Number 1, the best agent in MI7. Johnny wakes up to realize what he really is: A penpusher working second (or lower)-hand to Number 1. But after Number 1 dies because of a falty escape hatch in a submarine, Johnny takes it upon himself to work security at the funeral, which then explodes, killing everyone who once worked close to Number 1. Johnny is the only person to escape unscathed.It's not long before MI7 realizes Number 1 was on to something important (although why he never reported anything to MI7 is beyond me), and so they send in the only remaining person even remotely close to Number 1, Johnny English, to help them find out what's going on. (Though it should be obvious to them Johnny has barely even met Number 1, and the Head of MI7 probably knew Number 1 better than Johnny ever did.)This is the weak setup for Johnny to stumble upon a conspiracy to steal the Crown Jewels of England led by Frenchman Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich), who attempts to become king of England and turn England into a giant jail for criminals. ("Escape from New York," anyone?)"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" was a surprisingly funny spy spoof. It went a bit limp at times, but delivered on the whole. "Johnny English" tries desperately to become the next Bond-spoof film; and while it is entertaining for 88 minutes, it is in no way as clever or humourous as any of the Austin Powers entries. (Well, the first two, at least.)It is very hard to dislike Rowan Atkinson in any film. There is much the same here. But alas, the flaws do not lie in the cast, which is perfect. John Malkovich gives a terrific performance as a British-hating-Frenchie. The beautiful Natalie Imbruglia doesn't capture every scene like Rowan and Malkovich, but holds her own. No, the problems lie in the script.The film tries to be both the new "Austin Powers" and the new "Mr. Magoo" (yes, "Mr. Magoo"). The jokes range from intelligent adult humor to kiddie-pranks, involving a man crawling up a "poo shoot" and having about ten men flush "poo" down the toilet on him in a truly appalling scene. That's where the "Mr. Magoo" side comes in. Stupid prat-falls involving crude stints for children. I compare some areas of the film to "Mr. Magoo" also because the filming technique can, at times, be like Magoo.Also worth pointing out is Robbie Williams' opening title song, which sets the film up for more of an overdrawn music video than anything; a music video with vibrant colors and annoying vocals on Mr. Williams' behalf. I was scared during the titles, to say the least.But I seem to be harming the film's reputation too much. There are some great (nay, funny), if uninspired areas in the film, including a hilarious graveyard scene we've seen before but nevertheless laugh at. Once past the title sequence, the film gathers momentum, presenting an excellent middle, but then loses its steam during the last half-hour stretch.But in the long run, if you are looking for a film you can take your children to see and, at the same time enjoy yourself, "Johnny English" is the way to go. It's hard to dislike the film. Yes, we see all the gags very far in advance, and sometimes the slapstick gets out of control, but at times it can be quite funny, and that is the film's strength, if any.It's harmless, and enjoyable for an hour and a half, though not worth going out of your way to see.You know when you are walking through a movie theater, and you get outside the push-doors to a particular screening-room? You know those little signs you always see that say "Please turn off cellphones"? Well, the sign outside "Johnny English" should say, "Please turn off brains before entering," because if you do so, you're sure to have a fun time.3/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Utter rubbish. Hollywood has clearly run out of ideas as we see with such things as its remake of the Italian job or the proposed movie of the who wants to be a millionaire fraud case. This film is just an American mockery of being English - funny only because they do not understand English customs and ways and they dreadfully over exaggerate everything. I do not know why Rowan Attkinson lowered himself to this level, he has done FAR better things. Personally i feel that one half hour episode of Blackadder would give the audience far more pleasure than this xenophobia and stereotyping</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"johnny English" is undoubtedly one of the worst films I have ever seen in over fifty years of cinema going.It still rankles that I paid ?4 to sit in a darkened room with 200 other mug punters to watch something as amusing as a dose of anthrax. Rowan Atkinson just isn't funny.He clearly thinks he is,but he is merely irritating in the extreme.He has joined the ranks of TV heroes who think they can make a smooth,painless and lucrative transition to the big screen without raising their game 500% - and there are so many casualties along that route that I won't even bother to detail them,we all know who they are.Tragically Mr Atkinson hasn't learned from their mistakes. He gets to drive a nice car - looking very pleased with himself as well he might - romance a pretty girl - looking very pleased with himself - in fact he spends most of the film looking very pleased with himself.This might (indeed,does)work in "Blackadder",an exceptionally well-written TV series,but it doesn't work in "Johnny English" which is embarrassingly inept in all departments. I laughed once,when Mr Atkinson caught his tie in the moving belt at the sushi bar,and then only because it reminded me of an old Steve Martin gag.This,during what was advertised as a laugh- a - minute fun fest caused me to leave the cinema feeling they owed me 89 laughs. I wait in trepidation for "Johnny English 2".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We used to enjoy this guy on his TV show of yesteryear. But his foray into the movies has been pretty pathetic. Johnny English is no exception. It seems that he is trying to remake the great Pink Panther movies. He is really falling short. How could anyone think they could compete with Peter Sellers. Sellers was one of the brilliant comic geniuses of the century. In this movie the gags has no punch or followthrough. In the Pink Panther, once Sellers got you going, he just never let up. I can recall laughing for a long time. In Johnny English, I just giggled. You can just pass on this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this so called comedy film, and I was very very disappointed. The movie is terrible- it has the most idiotic plot, and Rowan just doesnt work trying to be Peter Sellers or Mike Myers. Furthermore, there are so few jokes, and the few jokes there are, are so predictable and lame it is disgusting. I really can't find a single redeeming, or even funny moment in the film( other than Rowan singing in the Shower- and he puts this singing on DVD?). I suppose being an American I have different taste than a European. We are all told that British Humor is an acquired taste- well I must not have acquired it- and this movie sure doesnt help any. It is as stale and tasteless as English food. Ugh. From the previous comments on the board, I am quite shocked that people enjoyed this sorry excuse for a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny English</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rowan Atkinson really became popular for Mr. Bean, got a British Academy Award and appeared in a couple Richard Curtis films including Four Weddings and a Funeral. This was another chance for a starring role, after Bean, and it is not a bad one. Atkinson plays Johnny English, he appeared in some Barclaycard adverts, he is the only spy left to complete a mission to find out who stole The Crown Jewels. Johnny suspects Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich) of stealing them, he also finds out Sauvage plans to become king. Johnny is joined by Lorna Campbell (singer Natalie Imbruglia) to help stop him. Also starring Ben Miller as Bough and Tim Pigott-Smith as Pegasus. Some amusing moments, but not as funny and genius as Bean. It was nominated the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>we (and Rowan Atkinson) deserve so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writing was awful and the thing as a whole was excruciating to watch. I don't know how this film was made after 9/11. The concept of a terrorist attack killing every secret agent in Britain must have stunk up the theater. The idea that the attack was successful due to a bumbling agent insulted my intelligence. I tried to watch it in real time, but I couldn't. I could see the jokes coming from a mile away, which was good, so I could fast forward. I wound up watching this film only by speeding it up a half-step and I caught some very funny physical comedy - where it was allowed. Climbing up a sewer pipe however, is not physical comedy. I do not understand all the positive reviews on this site - whether or not you're familiar with the genre, the humor should stand on its own, but there's next to no humor at all to begin with.Rowan Atkinson is a truly *great* actor, not the least because he can act like he's in a great movie. He deserves a freakin' medal for slogging through this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie should have been a wonderful spoof on the James Bond movies,it had Rowan Atkinson as a would be Super spy, in what should have been some hilarious film making.So what went wrong? bad script, bad acting,bad direction,all of the above but there is nothing worse than having to listen to John Malcovitch's dreadful irritating attempt at a French accent. I don't know what is worse the accent or his dreadful hairstyle, left over from the 1970's perhaps. There were reports in the U.S. that Rowan was so upset over the reviews for this movie that he went into some kind of rehab for his depression.I don't blame him I was depressed watching this movie.Atkinson is a marvellous comedian deserving better than this mish mash.I heard a sequel is due,take heed ,Rowan, get it right people quickly forget the good and easily remember the bad.Careers have gone downhill and never recovered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A flat comedy with flat characters and a flat story line but still very funny. In other words; an uneven movie.The most disappointing thing about the movie is the flatness of it. The characters and story are just way too uninteresting and shallow. Also, the movie is way to short. The villain played by John Malkovich is highly underused and is given way too little screen time, which is a real shame because he could have made the movie at least a bit more interesting to watch.Still for a strange reason the movie is funny and entertaining, some of the scene's such as in the hospital are just hilarious. The action is also very good, not comedy good but action movie like good. Really spectacular.Rowan Atkinson was fantastic. He really made me forget he was the guy that played Mr. Bean and Blackadder. He showed in this movie that he actually is a pretty good actor.Ed Shearmur delivers a great David Arnold like James Bond score which adds well to the movies feeling and atmosphere.I still hope for a sequel, I feel that Johnny English deserves a second change.Uneven movie with some nice moments that makes the movie worth watching but not a must see.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a real rubbish movie, with almost no fun at all!! I'd seen Bean The Movie a long while ago and thought after the trailer that is was going to be really funny, but I really disliked the movie. Now I saw the trailer of Johnny English when I was in England last January and I thought this will be a funny movie at last for rowan Atkinson. But it was the same as Bean. All really funny things are in the trailer and only one more funny joke in the movie. It would have been better to put that joke in the trailer too, so you only need to see the trailer. And the story is to sad to talk about. This movie really doesn't deserve any higher then a 1 (and I almost never give one) But I think if you liked the Bean Movie you like this one too. So maybe their is still change for you!! I forget to tell you that I loved the television serie with Bean, so it's not that I don't like Mr. Bean,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had I never seen the various Blackadder shows as well as Mr. Bean, I probably would have enjoyed this film a little more. However, I know that Rowan Atkinson can be a tremendously funny man and he is quite the talent. Sadly, little of Atkinson's genius for comedy is evident here, as this spy film features exceptionally broad and dopey comedy--with none of the sophistication or finesse of his other work.Now for people unfamiliar with Atkinson (especially the kids), this still might be a decent time-passer. After all, they won't have the same expectations and this is a family-friendly movie. But for folks like me that expect more, stay clear of this amazingly flat movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very funny but pretty much par for the course for UK spoofs (unfortunately)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a bomb kills the main agents of MI7, the only British agent left is the mostly office-based agent Johnny English. His first mission is to protect the Crown Jewels while they are at a gathering organised by friend and relative to the Royal Family, Frenchman Pascal Sauvage. When the jewels are stolen, English and Boff go after the jewels and their main suspect - Sauvage himself (despite the objections of his bosses). Despite his sheer incompetence, English manages to uncover Sauvage's plot to succeed the Queen and take control of England.I don't think I really need to explain why I didn't bother to see this at the cinema - the level of humour didn't appeal to me at the time and it simply didn't look like it would be much good. In the mood for a silly spoof I rented this film and sat back happy to let it gently wash over me. However it was a surprise how few laughs there are, even though I was in the mood I still didn't laugh more than twice (and they were silly half-laughs). The jokes are very basic and all basically stem from the idea that if English can do something wrong then he will. This is OK at times, but for the majority of the film it is tiring simply because you know what it is doing and where it is going.Needless to say, the plot is daft and pointless but if you didn't know that before you went to see it then you get what you deserve! The silliness wouldn't matter if it was consistently funny but, since it isn't, it just seems even more juvenile than it is (if that's possible). The script tries hard, but it's basic humour is not clever enough to be an effective Bond spoof; the concept is funny but it overdoes the `incompetent' thing way too far and damages the humour it could have had.Atkinson may not be playing to the same crowds as he once did with Blackadder but he is still good enough for this material. His 00-Bean act is OK here but he really needs to start doing other roles in the very public way he has done this and Bean. Imbruglia looks good enough to be a Bond girl type but she isn't a very good actress - Neighbours has taught her to be quite deliberate in her delivery and she does that here (although her lines are hardly Shakespeare!). Ben Miller is good in support even if this humour is below his usual standard. Malkovich does an outrageous villain that is quite funny but it would have been better if he played it a little bit more knowingly rather than just spinning wildly like a firework like he is here.Overall this is a fairly disappointing film that isn't very funny. It's silly mood and constant pratfalls means it is passable even when there are no laughs, however it'll take a forgiving soul to really enjoy this film as it's lack of laughs just leaves it as an overly silly, repetitive film that is only likeable due to the good hearted nature of it's cast and it's clear (but missed) good intentions.</fullReview>
