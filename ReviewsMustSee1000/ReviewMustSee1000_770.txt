		<shortDescription>Husbands and Wives (1992) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Woody Allen's greatest films, but it took me two viewings to fully appreciate it. I first saw it in 1992 at the theatre upon its initial release with my then-girlfriend, when I was 30 and she was 24; but this second time was in 2005 on home video, with me still in the same relationship thirteen years later and married to this same woman for ten of those; it really hit a nerve for me as a middle-aged spouse. I'm not so sure it can appeal to every viewer, but I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to older married couples everywhere.Allen's hard-hitting film dissects the long-term effects of being with the same person for a long time: familiarity, infidelity, stagnation and indifference. To drive the point home still further, the photography is crudely rendered in a sometimes confusing hand-held camera style which works wonders. Woody's cast is excellent - beginning with the note-perfect Sydney Pollack and strong-willed Judy Davis, who play a bored married couple announcing a trial separation, shocking and convincing their friends (Woody and wife Mia Farrow) to take a closer look at their own vulnerable relationship. Juliette Lewis is once again a very good young actress as a twenty-year-old student in Allen's writing class who becomes infatuated with him and turns out to be his protégé. Liam Neeson is strong as the new man Davis tries to reheat her romantic life with. One of Woody Allen's best performances here too, where he's more reserved and human -- not as whiny or nerdy as we're so accustomed to seeing him. Even better, he actually makes us more interested in the other characters instead of himself.The mature story is sometimes told in a candid documentary-like format, where the participants alternately give their own perceptions as though they're spilling their guts to a psychotherapist, and then ultimately wind up expressing what they've learned from these experiences. I happen to agree with the idea that a couple must learn to accept imperfections in a marriage and work through them, together.* Released at the height of the media controversy surrounding Allen and his relationship with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi, there may well have been some similarities on display here.*(EDITED UPDATE): Unfortunately, my wife and I divorced in 2010, after us being together for 21 years (married for 16 of those). I'm now in a new relationship and I suppose this experience will only serve to make HUSBANDS AND WIVES even more effective on the next viewing. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Woody Allen's best comedy/dramas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A married couple, Sally (Judy Davis) and Jack (Sydney Pollack), tell their best friends--another married couple named Gabe (Woody Allen) and Judy (Mia Farrow)--that they are separating. This news throws Gabe and Judy into a tailspin. It makes them reexamine their own marriage and find it lacking. Meanwhile Sally starts seeing a handsome, romantic man (Liam Neeson) and Jack is living with a girl at least 30 years his junior. This film follows what happens to them over the course of a year.A fascinating film. I'm not married (or even straight) but I don't think that matters--this is about love, sex and relationships and has dialogue and situations that anyone can relate to. Allen's script is right on target--the insights are just incredible, and we slowly begin to see exactly how all of the four main characters really are. During the film they are all interviewed by a never seen person--these interviews really help the story and reveals how everybody feels about the others. It pulls everything together.The acting is almost all great. Allen and Farrow were living together when this was filmed--when it was released they were in a bitter custody battle. This movie actually provides insight to WHY they broke up--their argument scenes are just a bit too realistic. Davis and Pollack are just superb in their roles. They let you feel their characters pain and confusion--just great acting. Neeseon isn't asked to do much but he is very affecting in his scenes. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as a college student. Her voice is nasal and whiny and her acting is pretty lousy--but it doesn't ruin the film.I saw this back in 1992 in a theatre and loved it. Twelve years later I STILL love it. A great film. I'm only giving this an 8 though. There are two big faults with this film: the hand-held jittery camera work being the main one. My guess is Allen filmed it this way to make the film more immediate and give it a documentary feel. It works but it IS distracting. Also it gets a little repetitious towards the end. Still this is well worth seeing. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any film that affects me emotionally I consider great. But a film that affects me so much that I feel it physically can be called a masterpiece. Narrative does not normally have such power. When a spectator is learning about people who aren't directly connected with you, who are usually not even real, then he/she should realize that these characters are apart from your life and should not matter. Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives is a film, however, which sets the viewer in the action on screen. He does this with perfect hand-held cameras and jump cuts. The camera work makes you feel like you're right there, and it adds a breakneck speed to the film. This seems like one of the most realistic films ever made. I have no complaints about this film myself. I would give it a 10/10, but make no mistake: this is a very unpleasant film to watch. I like unpleasant films, but this one is particularly harsh. The situations develop like a fly landing in a Venus fly trap. A character will walk towards a life which he/she believes will bring sweetness and happiness, but the new life quickly engulfs them. And when the film ends, the characters are seen stepping into a different trap: quicksand. No audience member could be naive enough to think that any of the characters are standing in a desirable place when the film closes. Husbands and Wives is a movie that could cause divorces, and could cause long-term lapses between relationships. If nothing else, it is a film that will make you cringe and squirm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entrapment in the "comédie humaine"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of Woody Alan and this movie really expresses the essence of his personal and constant recurring confrontation with the meaning of life. His pursuit of a significant context in human relationships always drives him to the brink of madness as he realizes all too well that there is no basis for real values in a life cycle which is basically totally absurd.The dark shadow of the philosophy of despair is constantly present but often relieved by a delightful form of sarcastic humor. This movie is for people who know what it's all about and are conscious of the fact that we are all trapped in this the "comédie humaine". The acting is excellent with no flaws at all. Judy Davis is a sheer delight to watch and Juliette Lewis - fascinating as always - with her mixture of Lolita-like innocence, her girlish ways and sudden adult insights would be a dangerous temptress for any middle-aged guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my top five favorite Woody flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a recent documentary I saw on Woody Allen's career, with him being interviewed, he said of this film that it was one of only a small number of times in his career he felt he carried over what he wanted on the page to the screen. Though I've never read the actual shooting script to Husbands and Wives, I can see what he means. I've seen the film several times, if not all the way through then usually when it is on TV, and it always strikes my attention the frankness of it all, how it follows almost no rules. It shares a kinship with another Woody masterpiece, Deconstructing Harry, also about a neurotic writer and the relationship problems around him. Here he focuses not only on himself, but also on another married couple, played by Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis (the later of which one of Woody's best in his quasi stock company), and what he calls the "discombobulated" characters. It is funny here and there, but in reality this is a great film of dramatic sincerity and occasional intensity.Woody himself is in his final collaboration with his ex-wife Mia Farrow, who themselves in the film play a married couple working through some issues. There is also the sensitive, passionate man between the two couples played by Liam Neeson, who acts as a good mediator between the two intertwining story lines. And Juliette Lewis is surprisingly good as a young would-be author who befriends the author/professor Woody plays in the film. What works to make all of these relationships, with warts and all, is that the dialog is always totally, without a doubt, believable. One can see people like this around the New York city upper-middle class landscape, with the neuroses as intriguing as they are frank and even a little disturbing.While the film shares a kinship with some of the dark, brooding themes of Interiors, and quintessentially European (in a good way) attitude towards editing and composition to Deconstructing Harry, it also has (also 'Harry's' DP) the eye of Carlo Di Palma. Di Palma, who also worked with Antonioni on Red Desert and Blowup, works with great ease with the aesthetics of the scenes. This time the camera-work is practically all hand-held, lit with nearly (seemingly) no artificial lights, and with a kind of intensity that is sometimes lacking in other Woody films. In wrong, amateur hands this style could falter, but with the material given, the constant interest and conviction in the performances, and Allen directing, it works. Having Di Palma as a cinematographer is as good a bet as having (a mentally-all-together) Marlon Brando as your star, and because of the documentary realism involved it always remains interesting. I could watch this movie, at least most scenes, just as easily as I could with films like Manhattan or 'Harry', because it is one of those special times in the filmmaker's career where everything comes together, however how raw it may be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>candid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many look at this as an autobiography of the real downfall of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen's long tenure as husband and wife. The ugly battle doesn't ruin the film for me,but increases it's power. Woody Allen really experiments with what causes a marriage to deflate or how it,over the years,isolates feelings between man and wife. The acting is stellar..not a bad performance that I saw. Probably one of the best casts I've seen in some time. The story is compelling and fascinating. Allen disects the inner struggles of what makes a marriage fall apart and in turn shows how a marriage could just need adjustments. Allen shows a side of him that really charts back to the older man/young woman of "Manhattan" in the facts that younger women can woo an older man. As Allen shows,an older man can see the things he was attracted to in his previous relationship except in a younger woman. The best aspect to me was how Allen shows one couple split up(Jack played by an excellent Sydney Pollack and Sally played by Judy Davis) when in actuality this relationship was stronger than Gabe and Judy's(Farrow,Allen). The film is intelligent,candid,very observant to the characters,and unique. The main problems from some is the hand held cameras and quick edits(or jump cuts). The only problem I had was with the narration and interview segments. I found that the true fans of Allen's films would understand the story without needed additional help from a source. ****1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen's Most Mature Drama..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, while rather amusing in some parts, is more or less a drama. Allen seems to have become more accepting of the "love fades" theme first presented in ANNIE HALL, and his characters seem to be a reflection of this maturity. The concepts of what love and marriage mean are dealt with in depth here, and there are no clear answers, of course. This provokes thought without being too sure of itself (who would expect that from Woody?)and provides a thoughtful examination of what makes love begin and last..or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen hits the nail on the head, yet again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Match Point" was the movie that converted me into a Woody Allen-fan. I had literally hated the man's work, but suddenly I found that these movies really spoke to me more than before. I guess you just have to grow older and get a little life experience before you can appreciate Woody Allen's fabulous writing. Lately, I've been catching up on his filmography and was blown away by his immense power of observation. Out of all his classic movies that I've seen in the past couple of days "Husbands And Wives" made the biggest impression so far. This movie is fearless, honest and true. Allen really hits the nail on the head with this one.Unlike movies like "Crimes And Misdemeanors" or the aforementioned "Match Point" (which are both great) "Husbands And Wives" isn't laden with symbolism and there are no highly philosophical thoughts to be found. The movie is merely depicting the universal truth that it's tough to remain honest and passionate in a marriage. Masterfully Allen shows his struggling characters in all their weaknesses without ever making them unlikeable. These characters falter between loyalty, fear of loneliness and an undeniable desire for passion. Everybody who's ever been in a longtime relationship will be able to identify with these problems, but only the brave ones will be able to admit that to their partner.That's the beauty of this movie. Allen says what everybody else is either too afraid or too hypocritical or simply unable to. "Husbands And Wives" shows what the fewest people understand: the egoistical side of "love", the way we cling to relationships because we're afraid of being alone, but also the simple fact that sometimes we need to lose something to understand how much we need it. Even when there's still love we can reach a point where we lie and betray the other person, just because sometimes people are confused about their lives and their feelings.Nobody has voiced our confusion about love and death as accurately as Woody Allen and he's rarely done it better than here. "Husbands And Wives" is recommendable for everyone, especially couples, but be prepared that watching this might lead to uncomfortable discussions. The truth is hardly ever convenient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Such Thing as Perfect Relationship Possible? How to Find and to Keep It?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen makes good, very good, and excellent films.Husbands and Wives is a very good film with excellent performances. It is not a comedy but rather a dramedy that explores marriages and relationships of four main characters. It has several funny moments and dialogs (it is Allen after all) but it has disturbing and sad scenes, too.When Jack and Sally (Sidney Pollack and Judy Davis) announce that they're separating, this comes as a shock to their best friends Gabe and Judy (Allen and Farrow). They start to reevaluate their own marriage only to find out that it is not as perfect as they thought. Very soon Jack and Sally, and then Gabe and Judy start to meet new people - young, bright, and attractive. They all hope that new is better, and for some of them it is true while the others come to understanding that true love involves loving another's imperfections even when very well aware of them. This film is for all husbands and wives, lovers, and partners around the world. It is for couples who've been in a relationship for a month, a year, or decades. It is for singles who are ready or who think they want to enter a relationship. It is also for people who don't. All of us have been or may find ourselves in a situation or relationship or having a conversation like the ones in the Allen's film. All of us think and talk about love, trust, understanding, fidelity, sex, and yes - marriage. The best scenes of the film belong to Allen and Farrow. Some of their conversations in the movie probably reflect the situation in their own relationship that ended soon after the film was made. It is the last film Allen made with Farrow. Judy Davis played the role of her carrier practically stealing the film. I was shocked to find out that she received all possible Critics Awards that year and lost Best Supporting Oscar to Marisa Tomei. I love Tomei's performance in My Cousin Vinny (1992) but nomination itself would've been enough. Davis was the Best Supporting actress (I saw all films with nominated performances). Sidney Pollack (The Oscar winning director of Out of Africa and two times nominee for Tootsie and They Shoot Horses, Don't They?) and Liam Nisson were wonderful. I did not like Juliet Lewis at all. What she did adorably in Cape Fear with De Niro for ten minutes scene, she tried to stretch for over an hour here - did not work, IMO.I like "Husbands and Wives" - it was interesting to watch, and it left me thinking if such thing as perfect relationship is ever possible, and what it would take to not only find it but to keep it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very smart, grown-up film about the nature of marriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An intelligent, complex, sometimes very funny look at the ins and outs of adult relationships and marriage. I admire the way the film works hard to avoid casting too much blame on any of the characters while not letting anyone off the hook for their actions either. Like all of us, these are flawed, very... human characters just trying to find a way to be happy in the thickets of marriage, divorce and love.All the acting is quite good, although Judy Davis, while always great, and wildly entertaining, seemed a bit over-the-top on the ice queen meter, to the point where it was a bit hard for me to believe Liam Neeson's character falling for her. Ultimately quite sad in it's recognition about just how difficult keeping relationships alive and healthy can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am surprised that so few people mention that this film is so obviously inspired by Bergman's television series - which was later edited into a film.As Scenes from a Marriage is perhaps my favourite Bergman film, it makes sense I guess that this is my favourite Woody Allen film.If you like this film, I would highly recommend Bergman's "Scenes" and vice versa.Regarding H&amp;W, it is great in that it uncovers the savagery involved in love and breakups that many films gloss over. There are also some touching moments, but for the most part the film is an investigation into the darker side of relationships and egos.I love it!-BB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen at his most bitter and least romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives tellingly came at the tale-end of his relationship with Mia Farrow, while he was already involved with Soon-Yi. Allen has always immersed himself and his personality in his films. In the 1970s he viewed himself in a more romantic vein, and his films sprang with hope and comedy amid neurosis. By the time his relationship with Farrow was about to come to its volcanic end, he is in the bitter grounds. The result is a film that becomes more and more uncomfortable and unpleasant to watch.Allen casts himself and Farrow as the comfortably married couple whose relationship is fraying - he wants a child and she doesn't, she is drawn to a colleague at work (Liam Neeson) and they ignore each other at home. They are shocked when their friends, played by Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis, announce an amicable divorce. What does this mean for their relationship? Allen finds himself being drawn in by a 20-year old student (Juliette Lewis) with a penchant for flings with older men (and a self-confidence about herself and the torture she puts her men through" "I'm worth it" she states). Farrow is more and more drawn to Neeson, but she sabotages herself by setting him up with her newly divorced friend, Davis.While the ground being covered by Allen is interesting, he clearly had little or no sympathy for his characters. All of them, even Neeson, who is romantic to the point of being dim, become more and more repellent as the film progresses. Scenes seem constructed simply so that the characters can have uncontrolled, outrageous emotional outbursts, and they do things that are unbelievable in their shortsightedness (SPOILERS BELOW): Allen's character, Gabe, is a professor and novelist. Attracted to Lewis, and not interested in the input from his wife, he entrusts a 20-year old with THE ONLY COPY OF HIS NEW NOVEL, which she loses in a taxi. While this might have been a believable plot twist prior to cheap and commercially available photocopying (say, the 1940s), by the 1990s, when word processors, hard drives, Kinko's et. al. are common, this is a unbelievable. Either the character is exceptionally stupid, or it's a plot device to provide conflict between Allen and Lewis. Neither explanation works in the context of the script. We already know Allen's relationship with Farrow is dying (both on screen and, as it turns out, in real life), so we don't need this episode as a way to force the characters together.Allen should already be fleeing from Lewis. She has shown, with no hint of remorse, that she is a one-way train wreck and takes all of her older lovers with her. By showing only that dimension to her, and depending on Lewis' prettiness to draw men to the character, he is badly miscalculating the audience.Farrow's character is just as bad. She hovers over Neeson at work in a manner that makes it obvious what her feelings are (to the viewer and, it would seem, everyone else in her office). Even at home, where she is cold to Allen and he oblivious to her, what could have been interesting scenes investigating the dynamic of alienation are wasted. These people have lost the ability to care about one another and don't even notice.Neeson's Michael, the lone romantic, is also portrayed as stupid. Davis' character, in her first date with Neeson, is hypercritical and obnoxious about everything about their evening (she could have done the Alfredo sauce better, she doesn't like Mahler, she criticizes the way Michael drives etc. etc.), yet Michael is somehow attracted to her. How? He hasn't been shown to be a masochist. Davis is shrewish and antagonistic - there is nothing in the slightest appealing about her. At work, Farrow hovers over him in a manner that even an alien to the species would not mistake. She couldn't be more obvious if she doffed her clothes and sat down on his desk with her legs spread.Sydney Pollack fares no better. Having left his wife, he takes up with a sexy aerobics instructor (Lysette Anthony). Unfortunately, she is dim, and argues about the veracity of astrology at parties. Having learned his wife is in a new relationship, Pollack suddenly becomes jealous, gets into a screaming fight with Anthony at the party, and high tails it over to his ex-wife, GIRLFRIEND IN TOW, to confront her and Neeson. One clever end to this would have been Neeson and Anthony, who are simultaneously ignored by their paramours, bonding and falling in love with one another, although Allen makes this impossible by making Anthony's character too stupid. Pollack and Davis get back together, Neeson is heartbroken and eventually soothed by Farrow, who leaves Allen. Allen is the only one who winds up alone.Being forced to watch ostensibly intelligent characters ignore the obvious and then be subject to their tantrums is made worse by Allen's pursuit of a cinema verite aspect - the use of a jerky hand-held camera zooming around from character to character while they make their pronouncements. Allen is never a bad filmmaker, but he has made an uncomfortable and unpleasant film. Of his introspective 90's work I felt Deconstructing Harry worked better. Of course, comedies such as Bullets Over Broadway and Mighty Aphrodite are also quite worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted this is not Woody's funniest film, but it delivers the goods. Like most of Woody's work, it plays out like a photographed play (he's not a highly visual filmmaker), but if you've seen any of his other films you shouldn't be surprised. The film is low-key, at times too low-key, and if you've seen any other relationship comedies of this nature the story should come predictable, but the characters are very well-written and engaging. I was especially interested in the relationship between Woody and his beautiful student, played by Juliette Lewis. There are lots of funny moments. I see that Judy Davis got nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar. She really was great in the film. It's nice to see that Woody often finds a place for her in all his recent films. Sydney Pollack is also great. Basically, the whole cast is talented and it's pretty much an ensemble effort. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drifting in and Out of Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gabe (Woody Allen) and Judy (Mia Farrow) have invited their good friends Jack (Sydney Pollack) and Sally (Judy Davis) for a small dinner at their quaint Manhattan apartment. Their abode is full of books and knickknacks all pointing to a comfortable urbanite life in the largest city in the world. Then Jack and Sally reveal some surprising news?after years of seemingly happy marriage, the two have agreed to a separation and eventual divorce. After that bomb is dropped the two couples reexamine their relationships with each other, trying to find meaning in romances both current and past while discovering the good, the bad and the ugly in marriage.Woody Allen is mostly known for his comedies. But while Husbands and Wives has some pretty spot on observational humor, the story is largely somber and dramatic. Not dramatic in the sense of a Wednesday afternoon soap opera but a benign drama that with a few spikes of activity focuses mostly on the characters. There is no clever high concept or narrative liberties here like say, The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985); the film is more straight-laced and character driven along the lines of Interiors (1978) and Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989).And what of the characters or rather the actors who flesh them out? Judy Davis, Mia Farrow and Juliette Lewis are the obvious standouts, representing three very different women all of which are looking for the same thing; someone to love and someone to love them back. Davis received an Oscar nomination for her role as a bitter divorcée trying to come to terms with her ex-husband's infidelity and being single again. She's continually frustrated and confused by the yearnings of the heart occasionally even lashing out on her boyfriend Gates (Liam Neeson). She's cynical and wary of attachment yet deep down she knows that her entanglements with Jack aren't over.Mia Farrow is a stark counterpoint to Diane Keaton's brassy personalities of Allen's earlier work. Farrow's intensity lies always below the surface, providing the perked looks and mousiness of a young ingénue with the mind and body language of a veteran in the trials of love. It's a shame that out of the twelve Woody Allen films she has been in (for which Husbands and Wives was most famously her last) she had never received recognition by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for her stellar work.Juliette Lewis who plays one of Gabe's young students from his Literature course, has the appearance and vulnerability of a dewy-eyed devotee. Yet when the amiable Gabe discovers he might be the object of desire here and Lewis's Rain the controller, he recoils. There's a scene where the two are in a cab discussing the latest draft of his book. Unable to take criticism, Gabe calls Rain a 20-year-old twit and says "I'd hate to be your boyfriend, he must go through hell." Rain cavalierly responds "Well, I'm worth it."Those who bemoan Allen's post-Annie Hall (1977) work won't find relief from his more meditative works of the 1980's. While most of the characters are likable they sometimes do unlikeable things, each on their own journey of discovery. I suppose we all do things we regret for love and those with a mature outlook on the subject matter will find a lot to enjoy and a lot to flinch at in Husbands and Wives. I suppose the heart wants what the heart wants.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpleasantly truthful but one of Allen's most relatable films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanours, Manhattan and Hannah and Her Sisters(probably some rather clichéd choices) Husbands and Wives is one of Woody Allen's best. Allen is not for all tastes but his films have always had some interest value and mostly they are very well written and acted. Husbands and Wives certainly has those. The hand-held camera work may put some people off, especially compared to visual beauties like Hannah and Her Sisters and Manhattan. Not for me it didn't, the use of it was quite clever and while extensive it wasn't overkill or seizure-inducing(and this is coming from somebody with epilepsy). Stylistically also it came across as intentional, to convey the character's thoughts and neuroses. Allen directs with no problem, and his performance in the film too has degrees of bitterness but also one of his most reserved and honest. In fact, apart from Juliette Lewis who is annoying(the only thing about the film that didn't quite work for me, but considering how outstanding everything else was she wasn't enough to completely rock the boat) the acting is superb, particularly from Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis. Mia Farrow gives a heartfelt performance too. Husbands and Wives is a superbly written film, it does have a fair bit of Allen's razor sharp wit and plenty of well- thought out observations conveyed bluntly. But few Allen films are this candid, and the documentary-style that the film adopts allows the candour to come through and resonate in a very rich and vigorous way. The themes and relationships explored in Husbands and Wives are ones that any married couple or pretty much anybody will relate to(the Pollack and Davis storyline is the most poignant and insightful). Some of what is shown is very unpleasant and the characters are not likable ones at all, but to be honest it's absolutely like that in real life, it just goes to show how much the truth can hurt. It really is one of Allen's most relatable films, Hannah and Her Sisters I also related to strongly but in a different way, being warmer in tone and slightly more multi-layered(that's not to knock Husbands and Wives at all in that regard as it certainly is that). Overall, some of what is shown is unpleasant but it is a remarkably candid film with superb writing and acting that a lot of people can relate to. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My rating: 7</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My rating for this movie is high when I mean the shooting and the hardening interests of Woody. The plot is well known and the style - the same. But the movie succeeded in carrying you into his idea and to make you ask yourself which protagonist of its are you or which protagonist I am in life.Even we can generalize the moments in the movie to the total moments which the producer and the script-writer are showing recently. Here we speak about the people who stay with us, who helps us get up when we fall, with who we live easily or even we love. More, the movie shows the inability to tore with our past, not to be the therefore in the concluding, to change our life when we are grown ups. Or shows the derail of the present into the unknown future.So, this film is good but it is a modified version of other Allen's pieces of art. Made a little like a documentary and on moments like a staging.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes you not want to get married.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen continues his streak of impressive yet despairing films exploring relationships between men and women, specifically that of long-term. As he did in Hannah and Her Sisters and Crimes and Misdemeanors, Allen takes a group of closely-knit people who have been through the tediousness of life and thrusts them into a vortex of pain, suffering and disappointment as they attempt to find themselves.In this film, he plunges us immediately into the situation in a brilliant opening of one unbroken shot, hand-held and whirling around the set. Indeed, the whole film is shot in a very "cinema verite" feel that gives a documentary air to this story, making the characters and their situations feel all the more real and powerful. Added to this is the great acting by all, particularly Judy Davis as a recently single woman still conflicted over whether this was the right decision and Juliette Lewis as a young writing student who catches the eye of her professor (Woody Allen himself) and creates some rather confusing dilemmas.Although I really got into this story, I felt that perhaps Allen had treaded this territory a bit too much already without giving any real new insight. Woody's earlier films like Annie Hall, Manhattan, and Crimes and Misdemeanors so brilliantly captured that which was relevant to the people and their situations while at the same time giving us a fresh story unlike the previous. This one feels a little rehashed but still is miles above what most other directors and writers would consider 'entertaining' or insightful.' Still, no matter what your feeling to Allen's career is, this is still fantastically acted, well-directed and sharply written in a bitter and cynical way. This is the Woody Allen way, and while some can only take so much of his pessimism, I cherish his honest look at the way people think and feel. It isn't pretty but it's true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen strikes again with some complicated relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen invites audiences to watch the ups and downs of love relationships in "Husbands and Wives". An intellectual and happy couple (played by Allen and Mia Farrow, ironic because it was their last film as a couple both real life and on screen) starts to reevaluates their marriage after the sudden and enthusiastically break up of a couple (played by Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis) friend of theirs. After that a roller-coaster of emotions takes place in the story and the character's thoughts and feelings on relationships, break-ups, new beginnings, love affairs, happiness, loneliness, age and several other things are presented in many dramatic sketches and in some very subtle funny moments. Juliette Lewis, Liam Neeson, Lysette Anthony all play the love interests of the broken couple (including Allen and Farrow) throughout the film.Allen and the questions his characters asks in the course of the movie is very down to earth. I think many people who had been involved in a love relationship must have asked some questions like "Do you still love me?", "Did you ever cheat on me?" and that kind of thing, and the other one seemed to be shocked with the "interrogation". A movie about trust or the lack of it between a couple; it's a movie about doubts; judgments and misled feelings (Pollack's comments about how he got bored of his wife after so many years; then after he leaves his younger girlfriend he follows the same direction). To Allen our heart isn't logical, so you might wonder where did this is going to take us, thoughts in one side wanting to fulfill expectations (many of it wrong), our hearts following other path, always wanting other things. An enormous and continuous contradiction. But as it was showed here after many of the couples were going right, then going wrong, and everybody searching for the real loved ones, we always must give it a try on love and try our best to get happy (or don't). In the end whatever works! Another great ensemble casting with positive good performances (Davis nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe), "Husbands and Wives" is wonderful, a work of a genius, right in the target on the subject without suffocate the viewer with too romantic modisms. It's a very truthful work. By the way I loved the movements of the hand held camera in the beginning when Pollack and Davis are so happy talking about the end of their marriage and Allen and Farrow are devastated by that. So non typical of Woody Allen. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen is getting his retaliation in first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Allen's most serious comedy to date. It explores, through the two couples, what keeps husbands and wives together and what renders them asunder. Its conclusion is that the most stable relationship can start to fail and the rockiest can, inexplicably, continue for years. It is an extraordinary film for Allen to make at the time of his break-up with Mia Farrow, particularly since she plays the part of his wife. It is more extraordinary that the film deals frankly with the fantasies of a middle-aged man concerning a 20 year-old woman. It is not surprising then, in the circumstances, that the Allen character behaves honourably throughout and the Farrow character is fickle in her relationships. One is tempted to feel that Allen is getting his retaliation in first.The film is intensely talkative, like an Eric Rohmer film, with all the characters examining their own and each other's motivations in the minutest detail. Allen also uses the device of an unseen interviewer who addresses questions to the main characters and to whom they give straight to the camera explanations. The film seems to have been shot using a single, handheld camera; adding to the documentary feel and almost making it look, at times, like a home movie. Allen may be reacting to over-editing of most modern films. It is as if he is reassuring us that, look, all the actors who appear in this scene are together in the studio at the same time. This is laudable but one does get slightly dizzy on occasions when the camera swings wildly round the room from one character to another.Allen again indulges his habit of using actors from world cinema, in this case Liam Neeson and Judy Davis. Davis is particularly effective as the neurotic Sally</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Serious" Woody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's comedies were always shallow, and that is what made them great. They were based on the same Parking-space-NRA-I-could-buy-this-ring-for-less jokes. He never tried to make his films more than one man's confessions to the world. Then came his "serious" films all through 80s. "Wild Strawberries" as "Another Woman", "Anna Karenina" as "Hanna and her sisters", even "Crime and Punishment" as "Crimes and Misdemeanors". Here, his shallowness and simplifications made pictures uninteresting and pretentious. And then came "Husbands and Wives", his most underrated film. Here, Allen stopped going for big ideas, and made simple melodrama, so simple, that like his comedies, it came close to perfection. From Liam Neeson's semi-cameo to Judy Davis's crazy bitchfest, every character feels unbelievably alive. Dialogs are as funny as they get, and simple structure makes development of story incredibly fun to watch. Even much criticized hand-held camera comes off as a mean of Allen's new found simplicity. Every great filmmaker owes his audience a small nice movie. This is what it is--a small masterpiece.</fullReview>

Of course I find some better than others and let me tell you, this is one of his best.Woody's character is great, as usual, Mia's great, Pollack is great, Judy is great and Juliette Lewis is great too. I believe that it's easy to be great when you're in a Woody Allen's film, when you've got such great text to "debitate". Well, anyway, what happens with this movie is that when you've finished watching it you feel that you've been washed with waves of LIFE, with waves of joy and sadness, you feel that you've experienced a nearly life experience... This cinema comes alive inside you, Woody's great at it and will always be. I hope...If people come to watch it as a comedy they will be deceived, anyway you can't say about any Woody's movie that it is ONLY a comedy, this is a tough movie, bitter, but hey, what about your lives, is there only sugar in it?Thank you Woody Allen, thank you for beeing yourself, thank you for letting Europe watch your movies...

		<shortDescription>Another funny Allen comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another Woody Allen film you'd just love to hate but end up liking in spite of yourself - and in spite of the typically a**hole characters involved. However, these characters are always made to be so funny to the point where it doesn't matter that they are such damn typical bored middle-class Americans, with nothing better to do than make problems out of nothing. Everyone is doing it with everyone, like in "Melrose Place" or some such crap TV show, but Woody Allen cleverly included a bit in the movie where he defends his character's book's indulgence with everyone doing it with everyone. In the film his character justifies this aspect of his book by saying that it's an exaggeration serving the purpose of more easily making its point (which is fair enough; I've always agreed that exaggeration is one of the best ways of making any point). Clever, indirect defense. There is also great irony in the film concerning the real-life situation between him and Farrow right after the completion of the film. Examples; 1) Farrow asks him early on in the film whether he is hiding something from her(!), 2) Allen falls for a twenty year-old (admittedly, we know Allen finds 20 too old), 3) they eventually split up in the end of the film, 4) Allen's character says to the camera that he often involves himself with women which he shouldn't be getting involved with. PURE IRONY, in wake of the scandal regarding his present wife (and former adopted daughter), Soon-Yi. The overly casual style of the film, typical of his movies, is a little too much at times but one gets used to it after the first ten-twenty minutes. The camera work? What camera work? Allen tried so hard to make it super-casual that he decided that not only did the actors have to look like as though they weren't playing roles, but he also must have told the cameraman to pretend he wasn't working on a picture but instead just filmed the family cat falling off a table or something like that. The "camerawork" looks at times as though it's been put into the hands of a drunk, or a playful chimp - or a drunk playful chimp. I'm referring to the ever-annoying "hand-held-camera" shtick. However, in all fairness, the wobbly motions of the camera don't irritate all the time. A small plus is that there are no left-wing political statements - which is a miracle considering Pollack's involvement (and W.Allen isn't exactly an anti-Socialist, either). A small minus is the attempt to interrupt the plot with documentary-style sequences where the film's characters give their explanation about (past) events. (Here Allen's obsession with Bergman's dull movies becomes apparent.) It doesn't work because it's trying so hard to look and sound like documentary footage - too much casualness can get irritating; with one exception though: the sequences in which Farrow's ex-husband describes her: very funny. Another thing: why is this film considered a comedy-drama? Where's the drama then? I don't see anything dramatic about bored middle-class morons bitching about their relationships ? sorry, but I can only laugh at this; so, to me - if you like - both the film's comedy and drama bits are funny. Judy Davis is the standout in a very effective cast. Neeson is okay/bland as usual. Pollack is quite good: a far better actor than director. Juliette Lewis is quite miscast; I cannot accept her playing a BRIGHT 20 year-old TALENTED WRITER; she talks like a typical MTV-generation Beverly Hills airhead, and whenever she uses a word longer than two syllables I get the impression she had never heard of it before reading the script. (Can't be much different in real life: she is a Scientologist.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Husband and Wives attempts to navigate the tricky territory surrounding two married couples in their middle ages, one of which has suddenly announced their separation. Farrow's Judy takes the Allen role here; she is almost offended at this sudden change in their within their comfort, projecting hard and yet unable to accept that this is an outcome that she wants for herself. Allen's camera departs from its usual fare, the serenity in the stillness, the roving, unbroken long takes that let the performances and script shine. It whips backs and forth with the jerkiness and blurred vision of an intruder of this intimate moment, as unbelieving as Judy herself, shocked by the revelation. The dialogue does not pause for a witty insight - it is overlapping, interrupting, reflecting the fragmentation of their relationships to come (and which has perhaps already begun long ago). Judy Davis is a marvel. She is the hit hard the most of the following events, despite how Farrow might act, because she is the one left initially alone, and her ex-husband has found a prettier and younger thing. And in just three weeks, no less; upon discovering this she whips up a fury that seems to charge the frames to rumble themselves. Davis is restless, trembling, a bundle of nervous energy openly and without inhibition. By contrast Jack seems to be having the time of his life, snuggling, teasing, kissing his new shiny partner, flaunting his rediscovery. Gabe predictably treats this as an intellectual sin: "You're IQ's gone into remission," he remarks. It is not like him. The interactions in Husbands and Wives are wonderful because they are full to the brim of bitter, distrusting adults that have grown weary of keeping up appearances over a lifetime. The navigation of the business of love and romance and dating in these middles ages is a contemptuous battleground, full of baggage, frustration and insecurity. Judy asks her husband is she wants someone new, and underlines the question strongly with connotations of her own desires, but would sooner explode at his wrong answer first. He answers correctly, and flips the question back to her, and the atmosphere is stagnant with their dual dissatisfaction. Davis can barely contain her misery even after a wonderful night, her voiced enjoyment undercut by a biting scorn at Mahler's sentimentalism or watery Alfredo sauce. The faux-documentary style is appropriate when we are witnessing characters and relationships exploding and releasing a storm of emotions, and yet at times it takes away from the moment. Aside from the hand-held there are also snippets of talking heads, snap zooms and injections of the snappy narrator's comments, but they feel like stealing ripe opportunities right from under our noses, moments of truth and vulnerability in-between the play-acting. Case in point: Judy has all but set up her dream date for Michael and Sally, and is swooning at his descriptions of the night out. The dramatic irony of the sudden rainstorm during their lunch is the universe openly mocking her chances. And yet the culmination of all this is Farrow merely voicing her envy to the camera. Why not follow her shuffling away to the other room, sitting down and breathing hard, letting the take linger until it becomes uncomfortable? Let Farrow act, let her display that tremendous and natural vulnerability within her.The editing is vicious, even more so than when it exposed Alvy Singer's hypocrisy in Annie Hall. It cuts deep down into the married couples instabilities, juxtaposing the fiery highs and the nostalgic lows into a flurry of realisation. He departs to follow a similar path as Jack, chasing after the metaphorical lost youth. Because it is a purely physical affair, he ignores the warning signs, the fictitious nature of her stormy and tempestuous personality. But surprisingly there is a reversal. She comes to fetishise his maturity and intellectualism, which is a dream come true for the Allen type, but he falters. There are thunderstorms, birthday wishes and candles, all set up for him, but he does not characteristically pounce. This is not a clumsy autobiographical element as many have proposed. Rain criticises (and rightfully, if you are familiar with the Allen type) the less savoury aspects of his novel, and initiates the moment. But he admits that "I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't want to get hurt.", and realises that it will not last. A romantic illusion, but a comfortable one for some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Men, women and the slow erosion of marriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie at the time of its release when I was in my twenties and found it unremarkable. After many years and a serious relationship, this finally hit home.In documentary-style, Allen shows us what most middle aged couples fear to face: the dissolution of their marriages, due to habit, boredom and frustration. The kind of situation that arises simply by living with someone for many years, without any major dramatic event occurring.Allen and Farrow plays Gabe and Judy. Since the movie was the last before their acrimonious split, most of their dialogue sounds uncomfortably realistic. Pollack and Davis are their friends Jack and Sally, who set the story in motion with their "trial" separation.Soon all four friends are entangled in new relationship or fantasize about one. Sally and then Judy are attracted to romantic Michael (Neeson), while Gabe is infatuated with Rain (Juliette Lewis) a student, who reciprocates.However, Rain is "just" a serial older-men lover with the most annoying nasal voice and this indiscretion ends nowhere. On a side note, I never liked Lewis, who once again plays a lascivious nymphet with little energy.I am not a big fan of Farrow, either. With her oversize, thick sweaters, long skirts and super-short hair Farrow is at her most unattractive in this movie. Her character is also whiny and pushy, making her my least favorite of the quartet.The movie ends with a twist that I found hard to believe, and a lot of ambiguity about the future of the characters that I found a lot more believable. Not for the romantics, but definitely worthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent performances can't hide the fact that the four major characters in this are completely unlikable. Yes, they all show a few redeeming values, but those come out of their need to manipulate. For the most part, they thrive on pure selfishness, self hatred and narcissistic behavior that is often hard to take. In their last film together, Woody Allen and Mia Farrow barely seem to stand working with each other, while friends Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis make Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner seem like Ward and June Cleaver. They are better developed than Allen and Farrow who never legally married but ended up in their own war of the rises.At first, the camera seems to be as shaky as the two marriages that this focus is on. No sooner has the film begun, then the marriages have pretty much ended with each of the four people becoming involved in other relationships yet finding opportunities to harass their estranged spouses every chance he gets. Pollock is particularly volatile in his relationship with a much younger Lysette Anthony, culminating in a violent sequence after a party where he accuses her of purposely embarrassing him. Adding to the case of an older male involved with a younger woman, Allen end up with Juliette Lewis, who is one of his characters students. Nothing really much happened with Sarah, but Davis ends up involved with the handsome Liam Neeson who seems to appreciate her more during the short time they are together Dan Pollock did in their entire marriage. Davis, one of the best actresses of the past four decades on screen, gives the best performance and while her character at times is a bit of a harpy, she contrasts that with occasional charm and an insight into her character own self dislike is that sometimes make her painful to watch. Davis has knocked her own Oscar nominated performance, but she seems to be the only one with any kind of soul. Her scenes with Neeson are very revealing, and when her tenderness is finally revealed after much unpleasantness, it is a major relief. Still, I don't think that I would want to associate with any of the major characters.Often obnoxious, this is set up as an interview with the various characters and it is awkwardly stage with the camera sticking its nose into these characters personal lives when really, who would want to follow them?the summit documentary style of the film makes this seems like a companion piece to Ingmar Bergman's scenes of them from a marriage, but I'd have to call this scenes from two separations. Jarring editing adds in all Woody Allen films, you're glued to the screen, if not to see what's going on with these characters than the shots of early 1990's New York which takes you all over. Cameos by such familiar actors as Blythe Dinner, Ron Rifkin and Caroline Aaron adds to the film greatly. I must say that while Allen's screenplay has been praised and was Oscar nominated, I found out one of the weakest elements of the film. If it is sacrilegious to call a Woody Allen screenplay unbelievable, then I must claim to be an atheist at least where this film is concerned. Considering what was going on in his personal life, perhaps he was trying to say things that were not necessarily obvious, and at times I felt like I was sticking my nose into where it did not belong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, emotionally intense and gut-wrenching exploration of the difficulties often associated with relationships in general and marriages in particular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Woody Allen's more autobiographical films, this is an excellent, emotionally intense and gut-wrenching exploration of the difficulties often associated with relationships in general and marriages in particular. The script is beautifully written and treats the tricky subject matter with a great deal of respect and sensitively. I have to admit that shaky cam is not one of my favourite filmmaking techniques as it can be more distracting than anything else in some cases but it was employed brilliantly here. The frequent use of a hand-held camera served to emphasise the anxiety and tension of the various situations. While the film stopped short of being a full-scale mockumentary, parts of it are framed as if it were a documentary. This was a very interesting and worthwhile decision on Allen's part as it gives the film a very naturalistic quality. It never felt like a gimmick. The film was released not long after Allen and Mia Farrow's extremely acrimonious and high profile separation as a result of his affair with her adoptive daughter Soon-Yi Previn. Given the topic, it is not difficult to imagine that art imitated life to some degree.The film stars Allen in an excellent performance as a Columbia University professor of English named Gabe Roth who has been married to Judy for ten years. When their closest friends Jack and Sally unexpectedly announce their separation in a (seemingly) very flippant manner, Gabe and Judy are both astonished as they thought that they were happy together and that their marriage would stand the test of time. The latter is particularly upset by the news. This serves as a rude awakening for Gabe and Judy and each half of the couple begins to notice the cracks that have been forming in their own marriage for quite some time. Gabe has a history of tempestuous romances with unstable women. It is pretty clear that he is still infatuated with his ex-girlfriend Harriet who was the most unstable of them all. Judy, played in a wonderful performance by Farrow in her 13th and final appearance in an Allen film, is concerned with some justification that Gabe finds her wanting in comparison with his beloved Harriet. To that end, after reading his novel, she objects to the fact that the protagonist's wife is a basically an unflattering caricature of her. I have to wonder if Farrow raised similar objections after reading the script. As becomes clear throughout the film, Judy is a very passive aggressive person who uses her giving, supportive, understanding persona to get what she wants. As his marital problems become more pronounced, Gabe finds that he is attracted to a 20-year-old student named Rain, played very well by Juliette Lewis. Rain is a huge fan of Gabe's work but she has a thing for members of "the mid-life crisis set" and her professor is merely the latest example of that. Although she is outwardly calm and collected, this tendency seems to indicate that she is just as neurotic as Gabe as she likewise keeps going after the wrong person. Gabe becomes more and more attracted to her over time but he eventually realises that a relationship with a woman almost 40 years his senior is not what he is looking for in life. In the meantime, Judy sets her sights on Michael, a charming, kind, sentimental co-worker played in a great performance by Liam Neeson. Even though Judy set him up with Sally, she had been attracted to him for some time and comes to regret that decision. When Michael and Sally part ways, Judy is there to pick up the pieces and she begins a relationship with him herself. He tells her that he will never love her the same way that he loved Sally. Her reaction to this news is the best example of her passive aggressiveness in the entire film. Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis are fantastic as Jack and Sally with the latter giving what is probably the best performance in the entire film. They are compelling characters but not especially likable ones, particularly him. Several times during their marriage, Jack employed the services of two high class call girls and wastes no time in beginning a relationship with a much younger aerobics trainer named Sam. Although they seem to be utterly besotted with each other at first, she begins to get on his nerves with all of her talk of the zodiac as soon as he learns that Sally is seeing someone else. Jack then becomes abusive towards Sam. For her part, Sally is a cold fish who does not have much passion in her life when it comes to sex or anything else. This is one of the major reasons that she and Jack decided to separate in the first place and it can also be seen in her relatively short-lived relationship with Michael Gates. At one point, she claims that her attitude to life is that some people are foxes and some people are hedgehogs or, in other words, Type A and Type B personalities. She and Jack are both foxes and are therefore more suited to each other than they are to hedgehogs such as Sam and Michael. To that end, the two of them decide to give things another go. They are able to work through some of their problems and they have learned to live with the rest. The film also features nice appearances from Ron Rifkin, Blythe Danner and Lysette Anthony while Allen's long-time costume designer Jeffrey Kurland provides the voice of the unseen interviewer.Overall, this is a thought-provoking film on relationships and marriage. I think that its message is two-fold: no two marriages are exactly the same and what may work for one couple would not work for another and relationships are hard work and can sometimes be emotionally shattering but it is worth it if they can be made to work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen's Husband and Wives has made me question whether I ever want to get married but then again it makes a fairly bad argument for single life too. Married couple Gabe (Allen) and Judy (Mia Farrow) meet up with fellow couple Jack (Sydney Pollack) and Sally (Judy Davis) who announce that they are getting a divorce. This has a dramatic affect on the lives on all four characters and the film follows them through the turmoil. The film is shot like a documentary with talking heads of the characters communicating their feelings and thoughts. This technique has been used time and time again in comedies like Modern Family and The Office but here it doesn't just provide humor but also an urgency and paradoxically through drawing attention to the form it increases the realism. Woody Allen is a genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Husbands and Wives exemplifies everything that people "don't like" about Allen's work; that its Allen-centric, in that his literary leanings and obvious qualities as a writer for some reason put him in front of the camera half the time, and that the main characters are all over-privileged Manhattan creatives or academics with swanky apartments, that conveniently never seem to do any actual work, just revel in the emotional drama and romantic comedy potential of their personal lives.I don't dislike Allen's films per se, his recent picture Blue Jasmine has an excellent script, by turns witty, brilliant, insightful etc. Everything Allen would ideally like to see in himself every morning in the mirror is here, and other films of his are well known little masterpieces, but Husbands and Wives is badly overrated, and it bothers me a bit that major voices in the US media nodded approvingly when the film opened. (see Rotten Tomatoes.com).The main problem, to put it bluntly, is that 80% of the film is in hand held, head and shoulders footage of the actors, intercut with occasional locked off shots of the cast confessing guilt, contempt and regrets over their mid-life failed marriages. This, in itself, makes the film feel more like a radio play that happens to take place on screen, and although shaky hand held shots can (and do) create a 'there, in the middle of it all' feel for drama, it goes way overboard. The film feels cheap, claustrophobic and repetitive. The other problem is the plot - or lack of. Essentially, this is the story of two couples entering mid life, feeling disappointed with their relationships and going through with break-ups and affairs, and Husbands and Wives is definitely more drama than comedy. In both cases, the husbands leave their partners for younger women, in Allen's case considerably younger, and in the other guys case, just for a young blonde that likes sex. There's not much to add here plotwise, except the situation opens up a lot of space for Allen's observations on relationships and human sexuality in a mature sense that you don't find often elsewhere in Hollywood movies....But did I mention the film feels plot less? It definitely does! Woody Allen's real talents are his skills as a writer and his ability to create great female characters, so during a revelatory and surprisingly funny exchange between Allen and his extramarital crush (a 20 year old literature student, played by Juliette Lewis) the film feels finished, but for some reason drags on for yet more, and more arguments, observations, exchanges etc. Its a badly made movie, without much plot and some big name actors taking a pay cut to work with a writing talent. Is it a great movie? Well, sales aren't an indicator of quality, but its a modestly budgeted movie that only made half its investment back. Other films of his live up to their reputation, this one doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody brilliantly channeling Ingmar Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Woody Allen's strongest films was the caustic and brilliant Husbands and Wives, a 1992 black comedy that doesn't provide a lot of belly laughs, but had me riveted to the screen with its scathingly accurate examination of the institution of marriage and the work and commitment that the institution constitutes.One of Woody's strongest outings as a writer and director, the film is shot in the form of a documentary that features an offscreen narrator who not only narrates the story but interviews the central characters as well. The film introduces us to Gabe (Woody) and Judy (Mia Farrow) a supposedly happily married couple, who are rocked by the calmly- delivered news that their best friends Jack (Sydney Pollack) and Sally (Judy Davis) are planning to divorce. What we then get is a Bergman- esque transformation between the two couples as Jack and Sally fail at new relationships and Gabe and Judy realize that they are not as happy as they think they are.There's a strong Ingmar Bergman influence here, not surprising considering that Bergman is one of Allen's few cinematic idols, as we watch two couples who are basically in the same place but don't even realize it, but end up traveling journeys that mirror each other to the point that their lives have done a complete 180 by the time closing credits roll without them realizing what has happened until after it's happened. I found myself having Personna flashbacks, the Bergman film about the actress and her nurse who gradually exchange personalities.Woody has put together an intensely personal story here that, despite the documentary film technique, still has a creepily voyeuristic feel to it. The scenes we are privy to all come off as intensely private and make the viewer feel like they are watching private moments that they are really not supposed to be seeing.As usual, Woody has assembled a first rate cast...he and Farrow are a well-oiled machine here, despite the fact that this was the final film they made together before the Soon-Yi explosion and the tension between them is apparent on screen, but it works for this story. The late Sydney Pollack once again proves that he was one of the few directors out there who could also act with his explosive performance as Jack and Judy Davis's crisp and unpredictable Sally actually earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Davis is just riveting here in a performance that burns a hole through the camera and makes it impossible to take your eyes off the woman and when Davis is not on screen, the movie is just a little bit slower. LOVE the scene where Sally asks a blind date to use his phone twice so that she can yell at Jack about moving in with someone else.Liam Neesom is sexy and vulnerable as a co-worker of Farrow's who comes between her and Davis and Juliette Lewis, in a role I kept picturing Winona Ryder in, scores as a student in Gabe's writing class who he eventually leaves Judy for. Lysette Anthony also makes an impression as the woman Jack moves in with after leaving Sally. The scene where where Pollack and Anthony make a very noisy exit from a party is almost frightening in its realism.This is not your usual Woody Allen fare and if you're looking for something with a lot of fall on the floor laughter, you will be disappointed, but if you're dedicated Woody-phile looking to experience his finest work as a writer and director, Husbands and Wives should be at the top of your viewing list. This is a masterpiece, right up there with Hannah and her Sisters and Crimes and Misdemeanors</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As of now, probably would consider this his best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not going to recount the plot. All I will say is that this is his best movie out of all the films I have seen of his. Before I watched the movie, I saw that the movie was rated R. Surprisingly, the film was not as shrill as I thought it would be. There is, of course, sexual content and foul language in the movie. There are no sex scenes, but the language in the film is what ultimately gave the film an R rating.The film works because it has a realistic tone. It may be a drama, but it is not depressing. It is also not as cerebral as many of his other flicks (i.e. Manhattan and Crimes and Misdemeanors). So it obviously is a film that has a less pretentious mood. Combining these three qualities while also balancing the rational and non-rational elements of the relationships in the movie, the film ultimately has a very natural flow to it.The actors are all good in this movie. Woody Allen and Mia Farrow are good. Not surprisingly this is Mia Farrow's last flick; I counted her being in twelve Woody Allen flicks overall. Juliette Lewis is also good and has a role that strikingly seems to match the other types of characters that she portrays in her other films; perhaps she is typecast. Liam Neeson is decent; it is interesting to see him in a Woody Allen movie. After all, it does not seem to be the type of movie he would ordinarily star in. Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis are the actors who steal the show in the final analysis, however. Some/many will disagree, but I hold firm to my humble opinion.For all I know, my deeming of this to be his best movie may become different. My opinion may change if I see another flick of his such as Blue Jasmine or Broadway Danny Rose. It is interesting to note that the highest rated movie of his that I rated is not a comedy. It is rather unpredictable as to whether or not I will give a thumbs-up to one of his dramas or his comedies after watching one of Woody Allen's movies.Concluding note - It generally seems to be the case that Woody Allen's movies are getting better as the years go by. Of course, he may have some lulling periods, but that's to be expected of anyone's work. I highly recommend this movie; it teaches the viewer to be careful about who you marry. Entering into a relationship is obviously not to be taken lightly. Secondly, it also causes one to ask the question, "Will this relationship work?" And that, as one who would watch the movie may agree, is not a question that is easy to answer. Problems latent and seemingly easy to solve may blow up in the couple's face; conversely, problems that seem impossible to solve actually turn out to be more fixable than one would think.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gabe (Woody Allen) and Judy Roth (Mia Farrow) are shocked when their couple friends Jack (Sydney Pollack) and Sally (Judy Davis) announce that they're splitting up. Jack has a young girlfriend Sam (Lysette Anthony). Judy convinces Sally to go out with her colleague Michael Gates (Liam Neeson). Judy is actually attracted to him. Jack gets jealous of Michael and breaks up with Sam. Meanwhile Gabe develops a close relationship with one of his students Rain (Juliette Lewis). She's a free spirit and they are on the edge of something inappropriate.Woody Allen is doing this in shaky documentary style including an unseen filmmaker interviewing the characters. It adds something compelling to these stories. The characters jump out of the screen. It's a fascinating look at relationships and secret desires. Nothing is ever as good as these people want or pine for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't that great! 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: This is yet another movie about troubled relationships by Woody Allen, with a New York backdrop. It's about 2 couples who are questioning there marriages and wonder if they could find happiness with another partner. Personally, &nbsp;got bored after a while and it seemed like the movie wasn't going anywhere. Although the movie is classed as a light comedy, I found it to be more of a emotional drama with Woody Allen babbling all the way through. I find it amazing that one director can make so many movies about the same subject without changing them in the slightest. Anyway, it's a watchable movie which has some average performances by the actors, but it's my nothing amazing. Average!Round-Up: After watching Liam Neeson kicking butt in his movies lately, it's weird seeing him in a dramatic comedy, looking so young. He obviously wasn't comfortable with this genre, although he was good in Love Actually, but since then he just seems to stick to voice overs and action movies. As for Woody Allen he just seems to act the same in all of his romantic comedies so his performance wasn't that surprising. On the plus side, I do rate him for acting and writing most of his projects because it must be hard to direct yourself. I think my problem is that I'm watching these Woody Allen movies back to back because they all seem really similar.Budget: $20million Domestic Gross: $11millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies which are mostly about troubled relationships and affairs. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bland Side of Midwood High school</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apologetically Woody Allen and I went to the very same High school with a 15 year difference I must say another Woody Allen Celebration of the once great liberal Corporate capitalist society's middle class lifestyle and the objectification the human experiences of sex and living.Sorry I am not the biggest of fans though respectfully one can suppose they should be grateful for subject matter that would be better detailed in a book rather than in the shorthand form of popular film and cinema in what is not always relevant to everyone. Woody Allen films though of a interesting nature and good quality seemingly often presents a one sided view of what is essentially existential liberal and intellectual as if his life revolves around what exists in a Cocoon. These films are not Robert De Niro Raging Bull. Woody Allen perhaps Woody Allen closest to Dustin Hoffman in many ways is distinguished as even more insular where I would wish he broke out of his mold that is unique to him as a stylized artist who seems to have stopped expanding beyond what he has already done in his career.This title Husbands and Wives lives up to its title but it fails to expand beyond that subject matter 26 minutes into the film in its predictable formulaic nature which though thoughtful and provocative in that sense neither present entertainment nor any intellectual breakthrough in the sphere of the middle class life style.I want and demand significance and though this film is interesting but in that it fails to provide what "I want and demand significance" I am disappointed. This is not the three stooges nor peter Boyle. This is exclusively Woody Allen where I presume his productions are the products of his cloistered environment which means nothing to me except the world is pathetically mundane which would need to produce the dynamics of the working and under classes if there was no "working and under classes" that are sorely lacking in Woody Allen films.So 35 minutes into the film and I am still bored as the dynamics are insular subjective of a personal nature that seems to be lacking a social element similar in nature to Jane Austen but lacking the blunt social dynamics life is so full of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching accuracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only began to appreciate the greatness of this film upon my second viewing. Only then did I really take it all in and appreciate just how unflinching, superbly intricate and accurate this portrayal of relationships truly is. It really is a testament to the life experience of Woody Allen to be able to write something so deeply observed and then be able to direct this vision so it plays out with such normality.It explores all the love and heartbreak elements of relationships I can bring to mind. The individual interviews are an extremely effective way of vividly revealing the thoughts that we all have about these human relationships. They capture so many thoughts around monogamy, insecurity, honesty, anger, capriciousness, philosophy, social etiquette/acceptance, courage, fantasy.. I could go on. It flips the whole wishy-washy notion of 'love' on it's head to instead really examine the practical nitty gritty of everyday life as a couple. It's also interesting to see just how these interplay affects these people of different ages.It's one of those rare films you can watch several times. I've seen many Woody Allen films and this is definitely in the top 3 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Allen's film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Woody Allen works, no surprise here. I even find some of his weakest efforts to be above average films. Husband and Wives is far from being one of his weakest efforts though, pretty like the opposite actually. It depiction of the people relationships is spot on here. Worth Noting that he clearly had a tendency to write about 'old man relationship with young girl' and relationships breaking up. Sounds like interesting subjects, being said I'm not a old man nor a young girl, but the dialogs and the characters make it feel so interesting, and above all, real, that's hard to not be interested at all. The separation thing is so true, and so surreal at same time?that is probably why it's so interesting. The metaphor is what is worthy, after all, so thumbs up.But anyway, Woody shows here a history about two couples: one of them going through a difficult time of separation, and the other pretending that are well, but very instable and weak, even weaker than the marriage of their friendly couple. And of course, there is always a lot of discussions (typical of Allen's films), comic reliefs, and there is also an apparently 'psychologist' talking to each character, inter called with their actions. What I like the most in Allen's films is the character development. Is so beautifully made, and so simple at the same time. He in fact has a unique way to do it. In my opinion, he is better than his biggest idol on cinema, Ingmar Bergman, which also was excellent. The editing also makes it looks like a found footage film, and the cinematography may be comparable to an actual sitcom, like The Office, for example(being said Husband and Wives was released ten years before the aforementioned TV-show), full of zoom-ins and shaky camera, looking like an amateurish thing. Interesting choice. And no, it not abuses at all of that so 'controversial' techniques.There are a few recognizable faces in the film, Woody Allen himself, Mia Farrow, Juliette Lewis, Liam Neeson?they all gave average to good performances, what is usual in Allen films(for some reason). If you are a Allen fan, you cannot skip that film. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's dry humour on display</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when I didn't quite get the humour of Woody Allen. It was mildly funny but I didn't get the wit in the rapid fire dialogue that rolled out like natural conversation. It seems natural because the script is so well crafted. With so many people being like the rather serious and shallow characters in these movies, we might not have the subtle sense to hear the biting satire. Now I find the humour hilarious and the scripts brilliant. This film is no exception.In Husbands and Wives, Woody Allen, Judy Davis and Liam Neeson were all excellent as youngish married people coming to terms with the reality of marriage and looking for something better, as if marriage has to always be a great fit. Sydney Pollock was very droll in his own exasperated way. In one scene, Davis and Pollock demonstrate a first rate cat-fight that is the comedic high point of this movie.This is a movie where Allen's humour shines with a cast of actors in roles of well educated, middle class New Yorkers who describe their marriage problems (usually in terms of the other spouse needing to change). The conversations are presented as if they were part of a documentary; it works well. The movie lacks the characters of other Woody Allen movies like Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Annie Hall. Nevertheless it is telling in its portrayal of late 20th century marriage. In the end, we see one of the couples confiding about their own limited success in marriage and the way they have adapted. All in all, the movie is an entertaining look at marriage in a particular setting and how it succeeds, fails or just keeps on going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of a long list of greats done by Woody Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My partner and I, while also watching other films, are working our way through the Woody Allen library. We're making our way from A to Z and just last night watched Husbands and Wives.What I liked: What isn't there to like? Woody Allen turned in perhaps his greatest performance to date. He was witty and intelligent without being goofy, and didn't rely too much on physical humor. As usual Mia Farrow was excellent along side Mr Allen and even stole the show at certain points. Liam Neison, Sydney Pollack, Judy Davis, Juliette Lewis, and so many others performed fabulously. The dialogue, focus on relationships, single camera shots, and the soundtrack were all on par with other Allen movies I've seen. Unlike most movies, I didn't really notice much of an arch. There were a few dramatic parts ? marriages ending and coming back together, flirtation with adultery ? but for the most part the film started at a dinner engagement with strong dialogue and ended much the same.What I didn't like: I'm hard pressed to find something I didn't like, but I also don't consider it the best movie I've ever seen, so there must be something. I suppose I would have enjoyed Allen and Lewis actually having an affair. Other than that, there's nothing negative I can think of to say. A life lived without seeing this film is a live lived incompletely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gabe (Woody Allen) and Judy (Mia Farrow) live in couple for about 10 years and are friends with Jack (Sidney Pollack) and Sally (Judy Davis), married for twenty years with kids in college. The film opens with an announcement from the Jack-Sally couple, they're splitting up. Whether it's a trial or definitive separation doesn't matter, the news come as a big shock, especially to Judy who is so upset that she steals Jack and Sally's thunder. We're too busy wondering what's with Judy that we don't really listen to Jack and Sally's explanations.The opening scene is one of Allen's most inspired moments. What we have is a couple quietly handling the idea of a separation after 20 years of common life, making tremendous efforts to rationalize it and convincing the entourage that they're happy with that, and another couple, totally confused and distressed about it. The directing contributes to create a dizzying effect, the scene is shot with a hand-held camera going back and forth from a character to another, with so many jumps and cuts it conveys a deliberate feeling of real-life confusion. It's just as if the characters played by Allen and Farrow didn't expect the news, and the cameraman didn't know if he had to go on or stop filming. The chaos almost reaches the level of a Cassavetes' film, except that Cassavetes was a director of raw emotion, while Allen, more cerebral, uses the scene to raise the very questions to which the film will try to provide answers.Jack lived 20 years with a woman extremely cerebral and anguished, and not a detail at all, cold in bed. Rather than an alibi for Jack, it serves to show how sex can cement the harmony within a couple or totally destroy it. After leaving Sally, Jack dates a sexy, beautiful, aerobics instructor. He feels like living again as if he was wasting away with Sally. Of course, he would sooner realize that all the fantasies that filled his marital sex-less nights couldn't live up to the everyday realities. Any older man is capable to seduce the sexiest bimbo but then would he feel confident enough to introduce her to his friends? As for Sally, the life following the breakup oscillated between many attitudes. She's first devoured by jealousy when she learns that Jack sees another woman, positive that it's a colleague of him who's like a younger version of her. Judy is so full of herself that she can't imagine Jack going for a 'cheaper model', and it hurts her because she's a confident woman and her pride can't allow this. Yet at one point, she's not old anymore but experienced, not single but free. She changes her perceptions and it seems to work for a while, to a point even Judy is impressed by her self- confidence. But from Sally's new perspective, Judy is not just impressed; her reaction is closer to jealousy and gives some early hints about the reasons of her reaction in the opening scene. Indeed, Judy and Gabe is a more perplexing couple, they live independently to each other yet passion seems to lack in their relationship. In fact, they argue so frequently that the moments of tenderness are more unusual. It feels like they had no chance to live in harmony as soon as their friends separated, as if Jack and Sally were the third link of their relationship. The separation of an ideal couple could easily mean a threat to a more fragile couple. To give us more insights about the characters, Allen shoots the film in documentary style, punctuating the scenes with interviews from the different protagonists. Gabe had a lust for highly libidinous women or nut-cases, and married Judy because she would reconcile him with a more normal way of life. As for Judy, the separation hit a sensitive nerve, maybe she was wasting great opportunities with Gabe. But these interviews only illustrate what the scenes brilliantly show. In "Husbands and Wives", Woody Allen demonstrates again his incredible talent when it comes to human emotions' writing. Halfway through the movie, we're so familiar with the protagonists that we can immediately guess their true reactions regarding one or another's actions, and not only guess them, but also understand them. And it's this very capacity to inspire our empathy that gives all the credit to a wonderfully written screenplay. Indeed, the movie tackles the difficult subject or relationships within couples, and in a thought-provoking move, the script succeeds in making us wonder whether marital commitment drives or undermines one's quest for happiness. In other words, can this quest not be just personal? That's it, in "Husbands and Wives", we understand any of Gabe, Sally, Judy or Jack, no one is guilty or innocent because no one can actually be blamed of seeking harmony or self-contentment. Made in a difficult personal time for Woody Allen, hi film is thought provoking because it chronicles people's approaches to marital commitment. And while we're committed to live with the same person for the rest of our lives, it's impossible not to think about what our life would be, with another person, or if we were single. Being married for less than a year, the film didn't have the same effect on me as on the first viewing. I understood the characters, I can understand the lust a man can have on a younger, or a sexier, on a more or less sophisticated woman. The food in the neighbor's table always look more appetizing.Still, why do some people stay together even if they know they don't share the same dreams than their companion? Because although we'd feel guilty and weak not to fulfill our personal dreams, guilt and weakness are double-edged swords when they concern the person we loved for a long time. It's up to us to see on which side, those feelings would be more tolerable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutally real and intimate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen any of Woody Allen's Bergman-inspired work yet, so I was surprised by the dark and intimate turn he took with Husbands and Wives. He strips away all of the charm and wit of his normal routine and instead brings an intimate look into relationships with such a bite it would put Carnal Knowledge to shame. The writing is on top form here, the authenticity and brutally honest approach is outstanding from start to end.What's even more impressive than the writing though is the way that Allen shot it. With a lot of hand-held camera work and seemingly no set blocking for the actors, he gives it this intimate feeling that I can't think of a time I've seen utilized as well before. With the authenticity from the writers and actors, combined with that brazenly unique shooting style, it truly felt as though you were in the room with these characters, the likes I've never seen before. You are just a fly on the wall watching these interactions and it runs you through the gambit of heartache. Watching these people fall apart within themselves and away from each other, I just wanted to grab them and tell them what to do (and it felt like I could).These characters are so fully fleshed by Allen, so humanly flawed and real. All four main characters shine from moment to moment, with Mia Farrow's cerebral quality, Judy Davis' commanding presence, Sydney Pollack's dark bite and Allen's own insecurities. I think a few of the scenes went on a little too long and I wish that it hadn't taken place during that weird early '90s phase where people kept trying to make Juliette Lewis happen, but it's a tremendous work that is one of the most startlingly real looks at relationships I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think it's unfair to call this Allen's version of SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE. His love for Bergman is no secret (heck, they even talk about WILD STRAWBERRIES in the movie) and he explores marriage with the same brutal cynicism and candor. There are also shades of THE PASSION OF ANNA in the structure. It's one of his harshest films, and it's also hard not to see it retrospectively as some attempt at justification for his personal choices, which were just coming to light at the time of release, if I recall correctly. He does make himself the most sympathetic and least flawed character. Nonetheless, it's a great piece of work, loaded with insight and intense confrontations and palpable bitterness. And it's funny, too. The entire cast is terrific, even Juliette Lewis pulls off the impossible by making you believe she's got a brain in her skull. The scene-stealer, however, is Judy Davis. She gets the lion's share of the script's best lines, all those wonderful back-handed compliments and barbed criticisms and raging outbursts. Some people complain about the hand-held camera and abrupt editing choices, but to be honest I hardly even notice I get so wrapped up in the immediacy of it all. It's a powerhouse of a film.</fullReview>

English professor Gabe begins a serious flirtation with a student of his named Rain and Judy begins to have feelings for Michael. Eventually, Sally and Jack reconcile, but have not improved their relationship. Gabe and Judy end up going their separate ways.Husbands and Wives serves as an eye-opener for relationships and marriage.It narrates what people involved go through and the many issues that they deal with.It tells the viewer how to balance their needs and the needs of their partners.Aside from its interesting theme,it was smart, sensitive and packed with quality performances especially from Judy Davis,who definitely deserved her Academy Award nomination for this film.In summary,it is a defining film for these emotionally embattled times and classic Woody Allen that is both watchable and insightful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a darker Woody Allen comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tabloid gossip surrounding Woody Allen's private life completely overshadowed the release of this film, which is a shame, because it's his most challenging comedy in quite a while. The story itself is nothing new, presenting another quartet of sophisticated New York City neurotics falling in and out of marriage, but the packaging is certainly novel: Allen almost encourages a certain degree of audience voyeurism by shooting the film as if by an eavesdropper, with lots of hand-held, cinema-verite focus pulling and so forth. The technique can be an eyesore at times, and it raises the question of who exactly is meant to be filming these intimate arguments (the documentary interviews and occasional God-like voice-over commentary suggest a psychoanalytical case history in progress), but it has the advantage of making the over-earnest dialogue Allen enjoys writing when he's in a serious mood sound more natural and spontaneous. It's certainly one of his darker comedies, but the anger and insight in no way diminish the laughs, although the humor is frequently more ironic than funny. And, for once, the all-star cast is an asset, not a distraction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic from MR.Cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr.Cinema aka Woody Allen is above compliments, above talent and undoubtedly the face of Modern-Era-Cinema. Allen has made remarkable films, and 'Husbands And Wives' is a yet another classic from this genius! 'Husbands and Wives' is as nagging as a Married-Couple. Allen and Mia Farrow star as a married-couple, who begin to find flaws and depression after a couple they knew happily split. The characters are like your next-door married-couples. Allen's most mature drama works, due to his genius. The film succeeds in all the 3 levels: Start, Middle and End! Allen's writing and direction, is top-notch, as ever. The late/great Carlo Di Palma's Cinematography is picture perfect.In the acting department, Allen takes the cake and delivers a charming performance. Liam Neeson is brilliant in a brief role. In fact, this is Nesson at his best! Mia Farrow is okay, while Judy Davis pitches in a superb act. The late/great Sydney Pollack is lovable. Juliette Lewis does very well. Lysette Anthony is superb.'Husbands And Wives' is a winner all the way... MR.Cinema delivers and how! Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a remake of Eric Rohmer's Boyfriends and Girlfriends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BIG SPOILER HERE This isn't a remake of the Bergman, I don't think, as someone has said. And it's not only talky like Rohmer, it IS a Rohmer film, or story at least,... if you look at the central plot ... Lea/Mia pushes Blanche/Judy towards Alexandre/Liam . .. for the same reasons and the same ending will out...I loved the style of this film, the shakiness and the cutting. It worked beautifully, woody showing some vigor as a stylist here and the style was perfect for the story of things being shaken up in the lives of these New Yorkers.I'm not a huge fan of woody Allen but here the parts that often turn me off the most (take all of small time crooks as an instance in which his "you can't take a horticulture" philosophy predominates - the last film of his I saw, after which I was just like I've had enough of this ridiculous snobbery) are here confined to one little corner of the film and that's the bit about the personal trainer who is clearly so inferior to the social set in which the principle characters belonged. Quite hideous all of that is in his films. There is a Hollywood legend to the effect that the reason Judy Davis didn't win the Oscar is that Jack Palance announced the award incorrectly having misread the teleprompter. I've only heard this from one source but the person seemed quite confident it was common knowledge. He was a movie poster designer and I guess, well, a lot more privy to inside information that yours truly, Mary Morrissey, marginal Hollywood character, outsider auteur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Husbands and Wives" is exactly why we love Woody Allen movies. It's full of insight, intelligence, moral dilemmas, realistic dialog, and first-rate performances. I didn't fully appreciate this film on its initial release. It was too tied up with the real life drama playing out between Woody and Mia. The film grew on me over time, and it helps to be a bit more experienced to really get it. It's too bad it turned out to be Mia Farrow's last appearance in a Woody Allen film. She usually got it right. All the actors are so in tune with their characters. Especially notable is Juliette Lewis, who did a great job at such a young age. For a film with so many heavy themes (marital discord, midlife crises) there's lots of humor mixed in with all the pathos. I would rank it high up on the list of Woody's best efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably my favourite Woody Allen picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably my favourite Woody Allen picture, this is intelligent, provocative. Innovative and funny. It is also so very, very, 'Woody Allen', seemingly almost a distillation of his work up to that time. Also, of course, pivotal in that by the time the film was released Allen and Farrow had fallen out rather and the scandal had burst. Looking at the film today and the far from sympathetic presentation of the Farrow character it is tempting to imagine this was a bit of a dig. We learn, however, that Judy Davis and Farrow changed roles at the latter's request. Something Freudian there perhaps! Shot in an unusual way, often from behind the actors and the narrative, such as it is in the hands of an unseen onlooker. All the parts are so well played but Allen and Juliette Lewis are stand outs for me. I would say that if you have never seen a Woody Allen movie and you see this and like it you will like almost everything he has made. If you don't enjoy it you may still get, 'Manhattan', 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan Murder Mystery', but that maybe it, which probably, at least in part, explains why he is loved by many but loathed by many more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Break-Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plight of over-privileged Manhattanites as filtered through the lens of Woody Allen who once again evokes Ingmar Bergman, even if it's closer to a spoof than a homage or a reconfiguration. Here the focus is on two marriages: The Roths, Gabe and Judy, who witness the breakup between another married couple who are friends of theirs, Sally and Jack, played by Judy Davis and Sydney Pollack in one of his rare incursions into acting. The Roth's reaction to their breakup is clearly that of two upset people, and while Sally and Jack's paths take different turns -- she tries her hand at tentatively dating, while Jack embarks on an affair with a much younger woman -- Gabe and Judy experience a slow disintegration of their own. Gabe meets and falls for an extremely young woman (Juliette Lewis) who aspires to be a writer and is a student of his, and Judy finds solace in a friend (played by Liam Neeson) who had also dated Sally while she became single.An interesting analysis on the nature of human relationships -- though by saying this I'm quite possibly at risk of having to say this for all of Allen's films since this is what he deals with as subject matter -- it focuses on how one marriage, already shaky to the core, can actually cement their relationship when taking a hiatus from each other (which is what they may have needed to begin with) and how such a "split" can cause another couple who represents the marriage that would grow old and die together to see their very values shaken and have them parting ways. What is remarkable is how the events within the movie mirror the events within Woody and Mia's life together. As early as MANHATTAN and CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS Woody had flirted with the recurring image of an underage girl who becomes fast friends and companion to Woody's older mentor figure. He explored it again in this movie, and then in real life when he took the definitive step, broke the sanctity of family, and began a relationship with Soon-Yi Previn that to this day survives.Even with the ensuing scandal and custody battles that followed, HUSBANDS AND WIVES remains a sharp movie to watch. The performances of the entire cast (consisting of Allen's regulars at the time, which is a long list) is, as usual, a standout, particularly that of Judy Davis who rips into her role in one hysterical scene when she chews a potential date right out of her house and looks like she might even castrate him. (She was nominated for her role and should have won over Marisa Tomei, but Oscar has a rule: when four of the five actresses are not of American origin, give it to the American actress even if she's adequate at best.) Juliette Lewis is also good and was at her moment, coming off her nomination for CAPE FEAR, and her scenes with Woody look as genuine as possible. They might as well have done it completely ad lib. It looks great. The hand-held camera technique also brings a natural, docu-drama feel to it, and would be used again in MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Woody Still Married to His Step-Daughter??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Again, life almost parallels art, except for the cop-out at the end. His romance was going on at the time with their adopted daughter, so of course, he has to step out of the romance with his student at the very end. Seeing it today, I played Art Tatum's jazz as a fitting accompaniment to all the beautiful NYC scenes.Woody's scripts are, as always, brilliant. He has smart people speaking smart lines. And dealing with real 'What is Love?' issues. "You just press it down and pretend it's not there,...the dysfunctional parts. But you still make it work, no matter what you have to do, you make it work." What brilliance spoken by The great director, STanley Kubrick (?).As I watch the movie in 2006, I'm seeing Larry David in the light Allan comedy with his bright younger wife and the Jewish friends, again all speaking intelligently humorous, if neurotic lines. Judy Davis has her parallel in the woman who plays (susan ?) Larry's agent's overbearing wife (to whom he is continually unfaithful).In view of all the publicity given to plagiarism these days, I wonder how many close matches you could find to Larry David's semi-extemporaneous scripts with Woody Allen's scripts. Their outlook on life is so similar, their characters so similar, so almost stereotypical (e.g., the J.A.P.) that they could have identical lines without ANY plagiarism. On the other hand, Larry David says his model is Phil Silver, which is weird, since Woody is more logically his mentor, his muse. They have the same neurotic ticks, the same knowledge of great literature (e.g., Turgenev). I even looked up 'abrogation', thinking it was a sly joke on college girls using words whose definitions they didn't know. But it DID mean 'approval' (I thought it meant 'the taking over, as in cheating') . How often do you today have to go to the dictionary while watching a modern movie, such as "Failure to Launch"? Or as Woody would say, "Can I help it if the nation decided to go dumb?" (another movie, "Hollywood Ending"). Again, Woody's a jerk, but Woody's a film genius and his photogenic love affair with Manhatten, his great music in the background, his smart real-life lines blew my mind. ("Serenade in Blue" by the Jackie Gleason Orchestra took my mind completely away from the dialog. I'm about to go off and order the record as soon as i finish this review.) He is a genius and a jerk. I'll see and buy every movie Woody Allen ever makes, no matter the reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about several husbands and wives, especially Woody and Mia about to divorce over a young lover. At the time of the movie's release, long-term mates, Woody and Mia were the hottest news item in the world (even the Times and TV news were electrified for a week), because Woody was exposed for having an affair with Soon-Yi, Mia's very young foster child, whom Woody would soon marry. It was briefly a scandal to match Michael Jackson for sheer take-over-the-worldness. Even my wife and I were going through something a bit like it at the time ('94), though we stayed together in the long run. This is one of the ten best Woody Allen movies.

		<shortDescription>tough going and funny in the same breath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Woody's most trenchant works ponders marriage, desire and love and just how lasting each of them are (or can be). Typical neurotic characters you find in every Allen piece but this time, an aching sense of regret can be felt. Story does double takes as stability, anger and forgiveness do flip flops. The fact that some hilarious moments manage to escape is amazing. Judy Davis (an Oscar nominee) stands out in key supporting role but Mia Farrow delivers some of her strongest acting in what turns out to be her final film for the master. She never totally looks happy or relaxed in any of their scenes together, as the camera seems to capture them more in real life style than a movie. Note: Farrow only smiles when she's on the screen with other people. Deliberate choppy camera work borrows a lot from French cinema. The use of rain here is quite effective, following as it does, the significant rainy moments from Allen's previous work in Manhattan, September and Another Woman. He really films thunderstorms quite nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is classic Woody Allen material. If you know his other movies, then you will not be surprised. If it's your first (although i don't think there's one human being who doesn't know Allen), then you just might have a small shock.Husbands and Wives, just as much as the other Woody Allen films, follows the same recipe, and it works out perfectly. As usual, the strong point of his movies is definetely the dialogue, which is absolutely flawless. The scenes look very real, too real, some people might say, and they are sometimes filmed with handycams, which gives them much more energy. The characters are carefully built, interesting and strong. Taking these facts in consideration, Allen manages to create a very good movie from a simple, normal plot: marriages, divorces, love. Vote: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An objective, harsh, thought provoking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a Woody Allen fan for a decade or so now, becoming one right after this film was released in theaters actually. I never located it on video until recently, so finding it was a nice surprise. I must say, not knowning fully what to expect, I was somewhat taken aback-this isn't the serious "so real it's unreal" drama of earlier works like "Interiors", but a rather affecting and, in my opinion, uncompromisingly realistic look at love and relationships. A summary for those of yo who have not seen the film: After more than a decade of marriage, Jack &amp; Sally (Sydney Pollack &amp; Judy Davis) announce to their best friends Gabe &amp; Judy (Woody &amp; Mia) that they're splitting up. While this comes as an unpleasant surprise to Gabe, it basically turns Judy's entire world upside down, forcing her to question every aspect of her relationship with Gabe, her husband of a decade. What ensues is a somewhat ugly breakdown of relationships with everyone involved as Judy, Gabe, Jack and Sally all begin to discover their true feelings. While Gabe, a college professor, develops a crush on one of his students (played by Juliette Lewis), Judy finds herself falling for coworker Michael (Liam Neeson), who is in turn falling for Sally. All the while Jack has resigned himself to banging a young, spacey aerobics instructor. It's all a complete mess, not unlike real life. The movie does have some a few comedic moments, but even those are steeped in sharp cynicism, brought to life brilliantly by a cast where everybody outdoes themselves. Woody actually abandons his usual nebbish self to give a very thoughtful performance while Mia's passive aggressive Judy really gets under your skin, presumably the way she was meant to. And as you've probably heard, Judy Davis all but steals the show as the obesssive, overly critical Sally. But I must say Sydney Pollack more than holds his own with her, and mention must also be made of Juliette Lewis, who is excellent as usual. "Husbands And Wives" is unlike most of Allen's films because it is neither shallow or overly self-indulgent. The questions posed by the film, regarding love, relationships, honesty, and trust, are all viable. Though the film can be quite entertaining at times, it's not about making you laugh or making you cry so much as it is about making you think. For me, that's the force behind this movie. Many of us have or will find ourselves in these situations like this in real life, and food for thought certainly doesn't hurt. I recommend this film to fans of Allen's work as well as those who enjoy seeing realistic human interaction on the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who can't stand to hear a Woody Allen character mutter "You're s-so beautiful, I-I mean ..." again, but you love those three little words, "Are you crazy?" then this is the movie for you. Allen brilliantly focuses on four people and the people who they have relationships with, and the neurotic effects their past relationships have on them.Allen's character, Gabe, is once again falling in love with the "interesting" yet crazy women as he did in "Stardust Memories," another often forgotten film of his. Mia Farrow, as Judy, is portrayed as a passive-aggressive shrew, or perhaps Woody Allen's perception of Mia Farrow at the time of filming. Judy Davis (Sally), in her first major Woody Allen film role, pulls a great part of the acting weight, but all of the actors including director Sydney Pollack (who plays Judy's separated husband, Jack). Other lost souls include Michael (played by Liam Neeson) who falls in love with Sally but ends up marrying Judy, Judy's ex-husband (who calls her "passive-aggressive") and Gabe's student Rain, who has had three December-May relationships, by the young age of twenty who falls for the small man in the big glasses. (For a brief summary of Allen's view of marriage, play close attention to a reading of his novel near the end.)Why does it work? It's a drama, but it's not an Allen drama. Other dramas by him dwell too much on his philosophies on life which are cut from other philosophers--this one takes everything seriously that needs to be taken seriously. His others, like "Interiors" and "September," have the characters in a world where they must say "Oh, god, Mother" in just about every line. The acting is excellent, the script is excellent (an Academy nomination, I believe) and it is perhaps his best movie. It comes from the heart, while his other too-dramatics come from the head. It is, I believe, his first R-rated one, and it marks his first foray into chronic anger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another movie from writer-director Woody Allen focusing on the minutia of relationships and the strange way that life threads it's needle through our everyday lives.When a Jack and Sally (Sidney Pollack and Judy Davis, respectively) announce that they're separating before going out to dinner with Gabe (Woody Allen) and Judy (Mia Farrow) this prompts Judy to seriously contemplate her future and just what she wants out of life while Gabe starts to look around, especially in the direction of a very talented student (Juliette Lewis) and to daydream about . . . . . . . something else.With Liam Nesson, Blythe Danner, the lovely Lysette Anthony and a small appearance from Bob Balaban, this has almost as good a cast as many of Allen's other movies.Which makes it even more of a shame that they're reduced to working with some of his lesser material. The script lacks any real edge, with the occasional humorous barbs lacking any bite and other dialogue coming across often as either too self-pitying or just spiteful depending on the character and tone.The camera-work and editing add to the naturalistic feel of everything and that's a definite plus, as is the acting from all of the leads. It's a decent enough movie but Allen falls short in the writing department and that subsequently undermines everything else that he tries to do on screen. Of course, like almost every Woody Allen movie ever made, there are others who think this is one of his very best works so if you're a fan or even just a part-time fan then give it a go and make up your own mind. Just don't blame me if you dislike it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Myth of the Infallible Relationship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first scene of Husbands and Wives, one of Woody's very most insightful and deeply reflective films, is a lengthy, uninterrupted documentary-style shot. Carlo Di Palma's camera is more than simply mocking the documentary feel, but being very sensitive, absorbing the characters' feelings and reflecting them, agitatedly whip-panning around the apartment to capture the proceedings as two long-married middle-aged couples handle the news that one couple, played with great intensity by the wonderful Judy Davis and director of powerhouse melodrama They Shoot Horses, Don't They? Sydney Pollack, has made a decision to get divorced. This sort of take can be executed with a visual style that is as smooth as you like, but Woody is all about character, and thus perceives them in a a shuddering, bothered manner, a cameraman as baffled as the characters, who continually cut each other off and reject what they are told.Pollack and Davis are divorcing, but they are the ones who are calm and sensible. They intend their separation an good-natured effort to give each other room to breath, which in the expression of Woody Allen's overanxious, delusional characters, that is naturally more crucial than to commit to someone else, to find middle ground, to compromise for them. This ironically is an overwhelming jolt and a neurotic threat to the other couple, of course played by Woody Allen and Mia Farrow.What Woody tries to say with this subtly humorous but overall somber outing is that many relationships are not as enduring or resilient as one would generally imagine them to be, as the id of your average person is a self-centered whore craving the spotlight. We give and take, and we say things to warm our lovers' hearts, but how much of it is purely out of love for them and not out of the expectation of being gratified? That's why Pollack winds up living with a sexy aerobics instructor twenty years younger than him, so he can recapture the youth he feels he gave up for Davis, who herself gives, as is typical of her, fascinating, inviting, becoming, and infatuating performance, overall the highlight of the film. That's also why Woody, a fiftysomething English professor, is attracted to his young student, Juliette Lewis in her best performance next to, dare I mention in the same review as a Woody Allen movie, Natural Born Killers. Woody is blind to her pattern of hung-up attachment to older men, propelled by the wild mirage of romantic sanctuary.Though Davis is the focal feature, the most powerful scenes are between Allen and Farrow, who radiate with real experience and seasoning of having before in pivacy late at night talked about just what their characters talk about, like trust, fidelity, and what they really want, slithering warily around the proximity projectiles of intimacy and sexual desire. The remarkable lack of amiability in Farrow's character is one of Woody's most insightfully written in memory, a passive-aggressive, side-stepping woman who controls her own advantages by subtle and indirect means, which dawn upon only people who have passed through her life.What with which Woody at this point in his career had come to a peak of wrestling, underneath the ineffective perseverance of all the older characters, is the apprehension that life is passing, time never slows down, life dangles a romantic illusion in front of you and frames you with reality's answer to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite Woody Allen movie amongst his "serious" ones, and I rate it 10/10. Don't get me wrong - I love his comedies a lot, and some of them are amongst my favorites (Sleeper, Radio Days, Take the Money and Run and more), but this one is very different. It's totally "straight", meaning you shouldn't expect the usual Allen jokes. Instead you've got a very sincere and effective drama that is brutally honest, relevant and sensitive.The movie was released just when the Allen-Farrow scandal blew-up, leaving the former out of the sight of the public and highly underrated. Some claim that the real-life tension between Woody and Mia can be seen on the screen. In retrospective, some of the themes in the movie look like Allen's diary or "confession" (especially the ones involving Juliette Lewis' character), making the elements even more realistic and honest. Of course, making the movie highly-realistic was obviously Allen's main goal here - which explains why he used the shaky hand-held camera (that many find annoying) throughout the movie, the interviewer documentary-like style, and the rough cuts during the scenes. Amazing acting by the entire cast, which includes Allen himself, Mia Farrow, Liam Neeson, director Sydney Pollack in an unbelievably brilliant performance, and the fantastic Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis (in one of my favorite roles of her). The script contains so many smart and true real-life ideas, observations and sayings that in my own man-woman relations I found the movie actually "speaking" my thoughts and feelings, and explaining a lot of the under-layers. Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wanna watch people yell at each other? Here you go. This movie will make you feel like you've done something bad. Everyone in it is upset. I realize most people hate their families but come on, don't make a movie about it or anything. The plot is you shouldn't get married, I guess. It says that the movie was "written" but it seems like Woody Allen (he made this movie as well as some others) wanted to do some improv to make it seem all natural and whatnot, but the problem is none of the people he casted are any good at making up things to say. They're just like "BLARG YOU'RE A CRAPPY WIFE!" "SHUT UP DO YOU WANT A DIVORCE?" "WHAT NO ARE YOU CRAZY DIVORCE IS FOR LOSERS LIKE YOU!" "I HATE YOU I'M HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSE!" "BLARG WHAT? WHERE IS HE I'LL KILL HIM AND I'LL KILL YOU PRETTY SOON AS WELL!" "WAAAH NOW I AM CRYING BECAUSE OF THE TERRIBLE THINGS!" "I AM DRUNK, HERE WHY DON'T I AWKWARDLY MANHANDLE YOU FOR AWHILE!" "I AM STILL CRYING!" It isn't very good. People might say it's good since Woody Allen made it, but from what I've seen his ratio of good to bad films is not overly positive. I did not enjoy myself nor was I moved to think of anything interesting because of it.

		<shortDescription>Woody's Return to Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neither one of Woody Allen's worst films, nor one of his best. It has a few laughs, some cinematically inventive moments (though nothing that Woody hadn't already done before in "The Ballers Club"), and certain emotionally accurate observations. But it often feels like it's going around in circles without really getting anywhere. I decided to note down all the quote-worthy lines of this film - and they are in the single digits. And some stuff - like Allen's obsession with guns and pro-gun lobbying for self-defense - simply doesn't work at all. But other stuff - like the psychoanalyst who barely speaks - does work, Ralphie Biggs acquits himself admirably in the "early Woody Allen" role, and as is to be expected from an Allen film. Even as an adult I wouldn't want woody allen touching me. 1 1/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen is a superb writer/director/actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Explorations into the human psyche are always dangerous ones, when it comes to cinema. Sometimes they work and other times they are devoid of emotion and are nothing more at failed attempts. Husbands and Wives falls into the former category. This film explores the relationships of four people and the people around them. Gabe (Woody Allen) and Judy (Mia Farrow) are a long married couple whose best friends are Sally (Judy Davis) Jack (Sydney Pollack). When Sally and Jack announce that they are getting a divorce after 15 years of seemingly happy marriage, Gabe and Judy begin to question their own marriage and how stable it really is. A varying mix of other characters are thrown into the story and play unexpectedly important roles in the character progression.The film takes a little while to get off its feet, but once it does it becomes an intriguing and mature look into human nature and relationships. Woody Allen (Annie Hall, Manhattan) is a very diverse filmmaker who approaches ideas in new and unconventional ways. His writing here is superbly sophisticated and succeeds at being entertaining and fixating without being overly vulgar. Allen employs some very creative camera techniques in this film. His long takes allow the actors to truly act and react. At times you almost feel as if you are watching a stage play, with the camera swooping around a room as the actors act out an entire scene without a single break in the action. Another technique that Woody Allen uses to subtly weigh the emotion of the film down on you, is the long takes that focus on one characters face. It's another way to quietly press emotion down on the viewer without over exaggerating or ramming the emotional pinpoints down your throat.The writing, directing, and character depth and development are all exquisite in Husbands and Wives. It is a wonderfully constructed film, yet my biggest complaint here is a personal one. I couldn't connect with the characters in the way I'm sure Allen intended his audience to connect. This is not so much a fault of the filmmakers, but really a fault of my own personal world view. Husbands and Wives explores the relationships in marriage, divorce, and forbidden love. These are things that I as a 16 year old kid have not experienced in my lifetime. I feel like the film is made to connect to on a deep emotional level, and I have no point of reference to do so. I enjoyed watching the film, but after a while I realized that it is essentially just an exuberant expose of dialouge and human interaction.Husbands and Wives is an enjoyable film and I could see where the emotion was intended to be, and it kept me captivated, but I could only become so attached to the film as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although HUSBANDS &amp; WIVES is not the first of his films to explore the personal lives of the middle-aged, it is certainly the best to do so...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HUSBANDS &amp; WIVES (1992) dir. WOODY ALLEN with WOODY ALLEN, MIA FARROW, JUDY DAVISAs Woody Allen grew older, so too did his on screen persona, and, necessarily, so too did the characters inhabiting his films. Although HUSBANDS &amp; WIVES is not the first of his films to explore the personal lives of the middle-aged (SEPTEMBER, CRIMES &amp; MISDEMEANORS, ANOTHER WOMAN), it is certainly the best to do so, and probably his best film of the decade.The story centres on two couples, expanding to include their various love interests: Sally (JUDY DAVIS) and Jack (SYDNEY POLLACK) appear to their friends to be happily married, and have been for 15 years, but in the first scene we learn that they're unhappy together, and have decided to split. Their friends Gabe and Judy Roth (WOODY ALLEN and MIA FARROW) are shocked and upset, the split appearing for them completely out of the blue. Judy introduces Sally to a colleague of hers named Michael (LIAM NEESON); Jack begins to date his aerobics instructor Sam (LYSETTE ANTHONY), reveling in her unrefined simplicity of character, a sharp contrast to Sally's detached coldness; and Woody Allen, in the guise of "Gabe Roth, university professor," is his usual ineffably-charming self. He begins spending time with a student of his named Rain (JULIETTE LEWIS); he's enamored with her writing, and she idolizes him.All of these things are filmed as cinema verite, captured by a documentary crew that happened to be present at every moment in all of the characters' lives. It's not that difficult a stretch of the imagination, and through the device of interviews conducted after the events portrayed, Woody is able to psychoanalyze his characters to an extent unsurpassed in all his career. As they talk about the events set in motion by Jack and Sally's separation, they recall more and more bahaviour of their partners, and themselves, that is indicative of unhappiness in their relationships. Woody also uses the same device to its full benefit as a structural aid: we are introduced to a new setting, and the character on focus free associates about how they feel about it, and then, knowing and understanding their thought process, we are taken through the scene. All of the nuances, from the observational camera to Rain and Sally's sometimes snotty, brattish tones, are carefully inserted and serve the film's purpose, which is to give as complete an insight into these made-up characters' psychology. The resolution is predictable and recalls some of his earlier films (CRIMES &amp; MISDEMEANORS, HANNAH AND HER SISTERS), but it's justified, and satisfying in how much sense it makes after plumbing the depths of these peoples' psychology.As in everything he writes, the film is saturated in Woody Allen. Through the Woody Allen character, we are afforded glimpses of his neurotic tendencies: the story of Rain's romantic history is utter, utter self-parody. What sets HUSBANDS &amp; WIVES apart from his mileau, apart even from the three or four of his other films that are extremely similar to it, is the hand of a master, clearly evident in the completeness of the film's execution, and the clarity of his vision in doing so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Husbands and Wives and Foxes and Hedgehogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was much younger and pretentious and just discovering Woody Allen movies, I thought the world of elite intellectuals in which his movies are so often set looked appealing and exciting, and I liked to think of myself as belonging to it some day. Now that I'm much older and have more life experience under my belt, I watch a movie like "Husbands and Wives" and thank God that I don't know any people like the characters in it."Husbands and Wives" is a very accomplished film, but it came awfully close at times to making me utterly frustrated. It's about a bunch of privileged intellectuals with far too much time on their hands, which they spend dithering about philosophical and emotional conundrums that are boring to everyone but themselves. The saving grace of the film is the fact that Allen seems to be somewhat bored with them too, and suggests that the way to ensure you won't have a fulfilling or satisfying relationship is to analyze and worry it to death.The film is full of some of the most unlikable characters Allen has ever created, notably Sydney Pollack's total ass of an adulterer and Mia Farrow's frumpy drip of a wife. The standout in the cast is Judy Davis, who plays Pollack's estranged wife with a brilliant combination of broad comedy and pathos. She's hilariously believable as a woman who struggles to convey a confidence she doesn't feel, and one of the film's highlights is a scene in which she mentally begins labeling everyone she knows as either a fox or a hedgehog while in the middle of having sex with Liam Neeson.The film also has a part for Allen himself, as a literature professor and writer who flirts with the idea of starting up with one of his students, played by Juliette Lewis.Allen chose to shoot the film as if it were a documentary, with lots of hand-held camera-work and confessional monologues delivered directly at the viewer. I understand why he did it, but it still feels unnecessary and hurts more than it helps.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen released his weakest collection of work during the last ten to fifteen years. "Husbands and Wives" is however one of the few high points released during that time, and stands well against his best. Having seen much of his catalog its clear there are several trademarks of any Woody Allen outing, whether it's the opening titles, the sorts of characters and their pastimes, or the general style of film-making that frequently becomes a backdrop to the acting. Allen clearly has a style all his own, and generally it takes only a couple films to know if you'll like the rest or not."Husbands and Wives" stands well on its own, though. In ways it's a departure for him. The shooting style is much looser, there's an intriguing usage of jump cuts throughout the editing, and the direction is more guided by the material than Allen's style. This is a far more filmic film than the majority of Allen's canon, which often comes off as filmed stage plays to a degree. This said, Woody Allen is still one of the greats, and that is not being challenged here.Even his best work is marred by a certain feeling of disconnection, and those occasional moments of simply putting up with how much Woody is bleeding through all of his characters. In this film there's a far more passionate and mature captain guiding things. This is a thoroughly engaging and confident work that is simultaneously interesting and affecting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Qaulity Allen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Husbands and Wives (1992) A good Allen film though the jittery camera work may be off-putting the first time you watch it. The incomparable Judy Davis delivers a great performance as a high- strung high-powered New Yorker who tries to loosen up after she loses her husband. The usual Allen touches are here: the crowded New York party scenes, partner swapping, unexpected reunions, and unexpected breakups. Because Allen lets the subtext and the unwritten move the story along more so than in most of his films, he delivers a fairly complex look at love in the latter part of the twentieth century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like eavesdropping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film, knowing that Woody Allen and Mia Farrow's relationship was crumbling at the time, is a disconcerting experience. And not an especially good or funny one, despite this film's reputation as being Woody's "comeback comedy" after a series of more experimental films like Alice and Shadows &amp; Fog. It really has a home movie feel, probably intended by Woody (the shaky hand-held camera, which he would use to a lesser extent in later movies). And the movie is reduced to shrill, unpleasant, who-cares characters yelling and cursing at one another--I doubt this is how people act when marriages collapse. Judy Davis is particularly annoying, although most found her to be hilarious in this movie. She would repeat this character in Deconstructing Harry later in the '90s, although a little toned down. Finally, do we really need to see the interaction between Woody and Mia in this film? Thanks to Husbands and Wives, watching the earlier Farrow/Allen films is rather uncomfortable---some of the magic is lost. Maybe Woody Allen made this to exorcise his feelings about Mia Farrow. I don't know, but this is not one of my favorite Woody Allen films, despite the presence of Sydney Pollack, who usually brings an element of class to the films he appears in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Husbands and Wives" is one of Woddy Allen's better films, but not his very best early genre. The cinematography is exemplary and actually an actor of its own right. Mia Farrow is subdued in her performance of Allen's wife. Their performances are worth seeing and the technical application of Allen's talents are enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sucker punch to marriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Mature' is an apt description of this drama written and directed by Woody Allen, concerning a married couple in NYC whose relationship hits a wall after finding out their best friends are splitting up. It's an often gut-wrenching picture that doesn't shy away from some really tough scenes and emotions. That said, I didn't quite buy the ending that attempts to wrap things up with a smile; this plastic conclusion seems foisted upon Allen, who first sucker punches marriage and then gives us an everything-will-be-OK tag. Allen shows no signs of personal belief in this section of the picture (it's a throwaway job), yet it's such a small portion that it can be forgiven--or, at the least, overlooked. Mia Farrow and (especially) Sydney Pollack do amazing work, and Woody gives another of his wise performances playing a writer/college professor, but Judy Davis' high-strung and bitterly-stung character--cultured to the point of being so cerebral, she can't relax--tends to grate if she's on the screen too long (and she is). A scathing dissection of marriage, and one of Allen's best films from this period. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge Woody Allen fan, I was disappointed by this film. While interested in what was said about love, passion and marriage, I found it overall slow and boring. Perhaps I was comparing it, unfairly, to another drama of Allen's, Crimes and Misdemeanors, which I found phenomenal. Even a genius like Allen can't bat a thousand - though he gets closer than just about anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jerky camera, Jerky movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it weren't for the hopeless September, HUSBANDS AND WIVES would be Woody Allen's worst film. After Judy Davis and Sydney Pollack announce that they're divorcing, friends Allen and Mia Farrow start to re-examine their own relationship, with Allen starting an odd -- and creepy --- relationship with young student Juliette Lewis. Pretentious in the extreme --- Allen and Lewis discuss Rilke --- this is a god-awful movie and, as with most of his failed attempts at drama, Allen leaves ALL humor behind. It's as if he thinks having any levity leak in would dilute the impact of whatever he's trying to put across. The hand-held camera work doesn't help either...it's one thing to go hand-held to heighten the realism, but here it's so jerky and extreme, it's sickening.</fullReview>

The plot was insipid, the camera shots were nauseating, and the movie, itself, was a flop if you asked me. It was the first of Woody's movies that I walked out of in the middle.

		<shortDescription>Take the Marriage and Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways, Husbands and Wives is filmed like Take the Money and Run. An interesting a popular style used by Woody Allen, this is a typical Woody Allen movie. It is funny and entertaining with a good ending. Woody Allen stars alongside his former wife Mia Farrow. This is one of the later films the two worked on together. The chemistry is there between the two actors. In a way, the movie is apart of their real lives living as husband and wife. Two surprise parts to this movie were amazing performances by actors Sydney Pollack and Juliette Lewis. Both are better than terrific, they make you forget that they are actors as they give 2 realistic performances. Pollack only is not only natural but funny. Lewis is beautiful and a talent among her peers. Together, they had to the movie's success. Not a slap stick comedy, but another great movie about relationships.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explains how Hillary Clinton won in New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been wondering how someone like Hillary Clinton could just show up in New York, move to Westchester County, and then get elected to the US Senate. This movie explains it for me. There is enough nausea and angst in the little universe of this film as there was sub-atomic plasma congealing just prior to the "big bang". I have absolutely no pity for these folks. They should all take a canoe trip down the Cahulawassie and get shaken into reality. They are so pompous and self-obsessed as they posture in this facade of up-scale upper west side Manhattan and Westchester county hyper cerebral life that they just eat themselves alive. We even have a young acolyte getting attached to the steam catapault ready to launch in the person of Rain (Juliette Lewis). We see the same crowd which is represented by Hillary, unlike people in up-state New York, who are of a much different ilk. None of the characters was likeable or attractive. Woody Allen was seldom ever funny. Mia Farrow was a drag. Sidney Pollack was frighteningly ugly. I just wanted to see Judy Davis go out on a date with Travis Bickle or better yet, have the whole bunch shaken down by the "Bad Lieutenant". Now there are two characters from some real New York flicks. "Broadway Danny Rose" is still number one and stands as the antithesis of "Husbands and Wives".</fullReview>
