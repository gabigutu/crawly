		<shortDescription>This movie rocks!! Those critics are idiots!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your Highness is a goofy movie from the Pineapple Express guys. My husband and I loved this movie, we didn't stop laughing, and neither did anyone else in the theater. Danny McBride is hilarious. James Franco and Zooey Deschanel have an infectious sweetness that makes you want to run home and proclaim your undying love! Natalie Portman gave an amazing performance as always and it was nice to see her in a comedic role. Of course Your Highness is no Black Swan, but if you're looking for a good laid back, feel good movie to keep you rolling, this is the one for you, I have NO idea why this movie is being bashed, it must be from people with no sense of humor or spirit of fun! Go see it today,you won't regret it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this on DVD last night, shamefully because of what i had heard around the time of its cinema release. Well that taught me a lesson.The only accountable reason i can arrive at for all the negative feedback i heard from critics and the public is that i feel they were expecting something a little more Holy Grail, because of the setting and the English accents and instead i felt this is more Blazing Saddles, very un-pc, whilst gently goosing (oo-er) its chosen genre.It is immature and crude, but the laughs were consistent enough, its a comedy notion which would usually have a B grade budget, but has somehow been made with an A grade budget and for me that was part of its charm. Its like the slackers broke into the set of Lord of the Rings and mucked about all weekend and managed to film it.Maybe i did the right thing in retrospect, sometimes its better to watch something after the dust has settled, just watch this cold and i'll bet you'd enjoy it. In years to come i think this film will have quite a loyal following, across a certain demographic, including me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and uncommon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your Highness is so underrated but it's totally comprehensible. The movie is a satire about medieval action and dungeons tales movies, but it's not cheesy as ordinary satires like Scary Movie series (among others), it has its own story, with its own characters and originality and plays with clichés all the time, making the characters look pathetic when acting like heroes that needs to complete quests as in a RPG game, a satire that seems much more like Mel Brooks classic titles.People are claiming it offensive and aggressive for the extensive use of sexual language and also for some explicit nude scenes. For sure it is, and this negative response from these people is just a reflexion of the puritan hypocrite society we live in, because if you laugh about Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor farting with his family for about 10 minutes, you aren't able to say that You Highness is offensive or aggressive for its verbal content, first of all because I'm talking about a movie that seems silly and a waste of time, but in reality it is a very intelligent and interesting one, and for sure, one of the funniest movies and the best in its satire genre that I've seen since... once upon a time.It's pure entertainment, the dialogs are sometimes taken from a porn movie. The acting is great. James Franco, as Fabious, the charming prince, is fantastic, always happy, empowering and in love, making his character seems that was taken from a fairytale, even his movements and expressions are totally inspired by everything a charming prince means and does. Danny McBride, as Thadeous, is completely the opposite, the real anti-hero image, full of envy, anger, hate and jealousy, searching and making everything just to satisfy his very own ego. And every character is ridiculous as it should be.Also the movie is full of action and special effects. Screenwriters Danny McBride and Ben Best did an excellent job together creating an uncommon tale based on mythologies and sex into a medieval and puritan world, that's why is so funny, because you never expect so serious characters talking about sex and genitals like something simple and ordinary. Like another one said, it's not a movie for those who are easily offended, but for the ones who might get its tone, will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filthy, stupid yet charmingly funny fantasy adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen this at a preview screening in London.I'm not actually a fan of low brow humour but I found myself laughing and chuckling throughout this filthy mouthed, very gory, medieval sword and sorcery fantasy comedy. Its mainly because the cast is very likable with its main leads resonating off each other in this pool of silliness which makes the film highly entertaining. While James Franco and Danny McBride provides the laughter and brotherly banter, Natalie Portman strides in with stunning gravitas as a deceptive sexy swashbuckling heroine.The storyline is a simple action adventure journey to save a damsel in distress from a warlord. But this not a naked gun style comedy, rather a humorous homage to classic fantasy movies such as Dark Crystal, Conan the Barbarian, Princess Bride etc. What's surprising is that the adventure is rather genuine and exciting with a huge dose of special effects that a comedy shouldn't really be allowed to have. I believe the film was given a normal comedy level budget but they certainly seem to have made clever use of it with some impressive special effects.Yes there is much sexual jokes and innuendos and a heavy reliance on uncharacteristic medieval expletive adjectives to force a laugh but the charm of the characters makes them get away with it.Having said all of the above, there were clearly some pacing issues and missed opportunities for this to be an even funnier and smarter movie but as it is, it offers plenty of entertainment, fun and laughs for a Friday/Saturday evening at the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was made to make you laugh and that is exactly what it does. No real depth or signifigant underlying message to speak of, just a lot of raunchy humor to split your sides. I laughed the whole way through the movie and you will too if you have at least one funny bone in your body. There is so much filthy humor in this movie that is in no way suitable for children, but hey we adults need some idiocracy of our own every now and then and that is exactly what this movie brings to the table. Purely brilliant idiocracy. The best kind there is. It has a great cast and Danny McBride is hilarious as usual. Definitely worth watching. Be forewarned, it is DIRTY!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, future cult classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the immortal words of Sidney Deane as played by Wesley Snipes in White Men Can't Jump; 'The sun even shines on a dogs ass some days?'. There I was minding my own business going to watch a man fire darts from his butt hole and in 3D no less, when a kindly lady with a clipboard asks me if I wanted free tickets to a screening on Wednesday. Being the sort that never looks a gift horse in the mouth and seeing the title of said movie on the clipboard I said 'of course my good lady, I will relieve you of the burden of your tickets'. My details were taken and I was all set to see Your Highness on Wednesday. You see this is the latest film from David Gordon Green, the art-house director who turned his hand to comedy with Pineapple Express and stars Danny McBride, James Franco, Natalie Portman and Zooey Deschanel. I knew the premise and I couldn't wait to see what they did with it.The film begins with Prince Thadeus (McBride) in a dwarf village with his servant/sidekick Courtney, he has clearly upset the little people as he is about to be hanged. Due to a miscalculation about the length of the rope Thadeus and Courtney escape back to the kingdom where Thadeus's brother Fabious (Franco) has returned from another successful quest after defeating the evil Leezar (Justin Theroux) and won the hand of his new bride to be Belladonna (Deschanel). The kingdom revels in Fabious's success and once again the oafish Thadeus is pushed to the side, preferring instead to womanize and smoke wizard weed. At the happy couple's wedding Leezar returns and kidnaps the virgin Belladonna with the intention of impregnating her with a dragon when the twin moons are aligned (or as Leezar politely refers to it 'The Fuckening'). Fabious must once again go on a quest to rescue his beloved with his trusty band of knights. Thaddeus is given a choice; go on the quest with his brother and man up or get out of the kingdom. So Fabious and Thadeus set off on the quest where they will encounter a village of nude savage women, A wizard puppet who is also a possible pederast,huge mythical snake beasts, a horny minotaur and vengeful vixen Isabel (Portman). Thadeus must learn to be a hero, handle a sword and woo the fiery Isabel who is on a quest of her own.Your Highness could have so easily become just another spoof along the lines of Epic Movie or Meet the Spartans but surprisingly just as the action was treated seriously in Pineapple Express, the fantasy elements here are just as important as the comedy. The special effects and production design are very impressive and the film certainly looks epic using the country of Ireland as its backdrop. There are evil witches firing lightning all over the place, there are mechanical beasts right out of the original Clash of the Titans and there is a weird hand/pit/monster thing that is cool as hell. Its also mega gory, limbs are hacked off and there is plenty of blood. Of course there is silly humor, very silly. If you didn't get Green's last comedy you may struggle here although Your Highness is probably the better film. This could well be the film that breaks Danny McBride into super stardom as he is the main star here. He delivers his lines in a pretty flawless English accent and the character is a classic spoiled loser who must learn to be a man. Just wait until you see the scene where he takes a trophy from a kill, its hilarious and gross. James Franco is being himself but also gets plenty of laughs jabbing away at the image of the handsome prince who writes poetry while also being handy with a sword. Portman is her usual brilliant self and for all her male fans there is a bathing scene that will get your temperature up. The main cast are supported by some more traditional thespian types. Toby Jones plays a creepy town crier type, Charles Dance is the king, Damian Lewis plays a treacherous knight and Justin Theroux nearly steals the whole thing as Leezar. Previously best known for smaller roles in David Lynch films and writing Tropic Thunder, Theroux is a comic revelation here delivering many of the films best lines with prosthetic teeth and a hideous wig. I laughed a lot and loudly and so did the packed audience. The script is written by McBride with his frequent collaborator Ben Best and clearly they have a lot of affection for the 1980's fantasy movies they (and I) grew up with. Films like Krull, Clash of The Titans, Hawk the Slayer, Willow, Conan and Beastmaster are all wonderfully homaged and never poked fun at. It really could have died on its ass for being so ambitious but in the hands of a craftsman like David Gordon Green it works wonders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess this movie isn't for everyone. we were 3 people, two guys and one girl. she fell asleep.. but we loved it, so maybe its a guy movie..? if you think blood, unnecessary violence, fine women, and explicit language is a good thing in a comedy, then maybe you will also enjoy this one. I think its one of he ,most enjoyable and funny action comedies for a while. the characters are good, great actors and Portman is as talented as she is candy for the eye. the story is hilarious, lots of funny moments and absurdities. a non stop pace. I am really surprised it hasn't got a higher rating, I think that in time this will be considered a classic, I mean, whats not to like?! an awesome movie.(the only reason I don't give it 10 is because I'm stingy, it certainly deserves a 10:)I totally recommend it:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stupid...and FUN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is one of those movies you get to enjoy no matter how stupid they are. "You Highness" mocks everything about medieval time movies, kings and knights, etc. by applying exaggeratively sarcastic and cynical humor. The humor is so superficially dull, that it really is funny due to the way it is applied to a movie about the middle ages. It's almost like a porno version of "Shreck", harshly speaking. Making jokes about genitals, sex, masculinity an such. It absolutely is nothing more than a movie to get some laughs out of, since the plot is definitely NOT on of the most superb stories you've ever seen in a movie, and the acting is rather fake, for the exception of Natalie Portman and maybe James Franco. Which is actually quite funny how two A list actors put a lot of effort into a movie so dumb. And another good thing about this film is that it actually looks really cool sometimes, especially at the end during the climax. So there you have it. It definitely isn't meant to be praised as a masterpiece of a movie. Just sit back and enjoy the stupidity of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I did laugh out loud quite a few times!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film. It is not going to win any Oscars, and is pretty rude at times, but anyone who is a fan of Eastbound and Down will like this. It is cheesy at times, knowingly so, but does entertain all the way through. It is not trying to be ground breaking and original, it is a comedy and does what is says on the tin. Maybe do not watch the trailer though as the best bits are in there! Do not go to see it if you are easily offended, it is full of bad language, crude sex references and is quite in your face. I was heartily amused, and would recommend this for a light hearted, entertaining romp. The cast is strong. Too often, critics pan films which Jo public actually really enjoy, so judge for yourself based on what actual people say, not according to reviewers, who often are quite wrong about what people enjoy watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cross between 'Krull' &amp; 'The Inbetweeners'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting, comedic twist on the 'Fantasy Quest' genre! Lot's of 'schoolboy' humour and a large number of expletives, kept me entertained anyway!It's a sort of 'Krull' meets 'The Inbetweeners' and I found myself laughing occasionally and smiling throughout! How they managed to get a pretty impressive cast, I don't know but, it all worked well, in my humble opinion.It was Danny MacBride's previous incarnations which enticed me to watch the movie and he didn't disappoint! Almost as politically incorrect as many of his other roles albeit with a slightly anglicised accent, added to the fun.It's likely to be panned by the critics but, if you want a light hearted romp for 105 minutes, don't mind gratuitous references to unnatural sexual acts, unexpected 21st Century expletives in a Medieval environment and Natalie Portman saying the odd 'F' word, then you may well enjoy this.I have only written one previous review, for a film which had good reviews and I thought was crap! 'Your Highness' is the complete opposite, in my opinion and, as such has prompted my second review.I will watch it again, not with my youngest daughter who is an ordained minister but with my eldest who is an A &amp; E Nurse. Say no more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it's an original spin...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say that there is no such thing as a bad idea for a movie, just bad executions of ideas. I was open to the idea behind "Your Highness" - after all the spin on this sword and sorcery world - mixing stoner and frat boy humor into this pot is an original one. All I was asking that the movie be funny doing this. Sadly, the movie isn't that funny at all. Stoner and frat boy humor can be funny, but all this dumb humor has to be executed with some intelligence to work. But the filmmakers of this movie seem to be thinking at the level of a brain-dead adolescent. The movie thinks that simply spouting off curse words is hilarious, but it simply isn't. The actors do their best, but the low-level mentality of the entire enterprise ultimately sinks the movie. The best I can say for this failure is that it is seldom boring. Stupid and intelligence-insulting, yes. But not boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing humor, flat story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were to give this movie a score solely for its humor, I would give it 11/10. It is basically exploding with humor - a good adult humor I must say. This is no movie for children, even though they would probably not understand the jokes and concentrate on how beautiful N. Portman is. The plot is dull, but I understand the author's purpose. It is not to produce an amazing story-line which would force you into thinking for hours after viewing the movie - it is to make you laugh, in which it succeeds. I have not laughed so much for a long time. I think Tarantino might have inspired this a bit - therefore, it might not make much sense, but nonetheless, it is an amazing parody and whatever you want from a funny movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Gordon Green's crude, silly and dirty medieval fantasy adventure spoof 'Your Highness' is hilarious and even charming. I'm not a big fan of the overuse of toilet humour that has polluted most Hollywood films today but here it works. The good mix of adult (pretty modern-day) humour and the medieval look and language (I use this word loosely) is itself something difficult to achieve. Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, the movie has heart. 'Your Highness' pays tribute to many of those old action adventure fantasy films that we have grown up watching like 'Conan The Barbarian', 'The Dark Crystal', 'Lady Hawk' etc. The costumes and sets are pretty cool and the special effects and robotics are brilliant. The humour does appear forced at times but the funny characters keep it going.The actors doe a fine job with their obviously fake British accent (with the exception of Charles Dance and a few others). Danny McBride (who also co-wrote), James Franco and Justin Theroux are very good. This is perhaps Natalie Portman's funniest role to date and she does a decent job. Her role was also supposed to be sexy but that's something difficult to do when you're in a movie that has Zooey Deschanel. Deschanel shows a good dose of cleavage and here she is cast as the damsel in distress (something different for her). She doesn't have much screen time but manages to make the viewer stare at her and chuckle.On the flip side, the pacing is uneven and there were some scenes could have easily been funnier. Anyway, the movie doesn't take itself seriously and its certainly not a bad suggestion for a Friday night or an indoor flick for a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could find nothing I liked in this film. It was not funny or interesting and at best, I was bored.The cast should be ashamed of themselves, there are some good actors here who are surely above this.Too often when films rely on improvised dialogue the result is an incoherent showcase of actors having a whale of a time while the audience are left alienated and disappointed at being left out of the joke and Your Highness is one of the worst offenders. I'm sure they had a great time making the film, but that doesn't make for an enjoyable viewing experience.Though, having said that, this film would still have been awful with a script.</fullReview>

So bad, I can honestly say it's the worse film I have seen so far this year.The makers seem to think that putting stoners and profanity into a medieval movie will bring in the laughs, they are horribly mistaken.The cast, McBride et al, all do there best to save this, but they struggle with the regular fart jokes and and stoners jokes that have been used a thousand times before. But the honours go to Franco, who was so good in Pineapple Express, here he is just wasted as the 'hero'.There are zero laughs in this, and it's just very painful to watch and the majority of the cast look bored.No wonder Portman hides her face during her entrance....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst film forced to spend ?23 on ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in London when this film was released and my partner came to visit me. We decided between Your highness or Limitless, in retrospect we really should have waited a bit longer for Limitless. It cost ?23 for the both of us as it was in Leicester square. There was 3 people in the cinema, the lights went dim, there was a promise that this film would be amazing. What was it? It was absolute vitriol from start to finish with the deepest pit of toilet humour I've had the misfortune to witness. Some people have said we are hypocrites, I love humour if it is good but it doesn't even fit into a decent storyline. There is no reason for hanging a penis from your neck, or making a small purple alien into a sicko pervert, or any of the other jokes that fell flat because the only thing they were actually good for was the advert. Kudos to the editor of that ad for making the film seem really funny because that was pretty much it with the same amount of storyline. Even Natalie Portman couldn't save it, nor Zooey Deschanel. Nor even Danny Mcbride. I spent half the film fiddling with Facebook on the phone and would have happily walked out half way through if my partner hadn't been sadistically enjoying it. It is probably man humour of the lowest, stalest pit of someones mind. It isn't satire, you can't call it black comedy, it is merely awful.</fullReview>

'Your Highness' Synopsis: When Prince Fabious's bride is kidnapped, he goes on a quest to rescue her... accompanied by his lazy useless brother Thadeous.'Your Highness' stands on an erratic screenplay. Danny McBride &amp; Ben Best's Screenplay begins in the right tone, but surrenders to profanity &amp; over-the-top sequences, to leave an impression. One is clearly missing cleaner humor &amp; also good jokes. David Gordon Green's Direction is pretty good. Cinematography is eye-filling. Editing also is well-done.Performance-Wise: Danny McBride is alright. James Franco delivers an earnest performance. Natalie Portman, however, steals the film with a terrific act. She's sexy &amp; tough. Zooey Deschanel is cute, as always. Justin Theroux is ordinary. Toby Jones &amp; Damian Lewis justify their parts.On the whole, 'Your Highness' misses the mark.</fullReview>

Danny McBride and Franco are a good pairing just like they are in This is the End and Natalie Portman is dynamite. Ten out of Ten if you ask me.

Before that, The Princess Bride.

I was listening to Howard Stern, of all people, because I accidentally turned into his station. I haven't listened to Howard Stern since 1994, to give you some background.So I'm listening to Howard and he goes into his review of the film: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6278088/ available here. He sold it to well.I went. I laughed. Every single scene made me laugh.The absurdity of the brothers (Danny is older?), the silliness of the villainous characters (The ****ening!), the recreation of the era (it really was beautiful..), Zooey and Natalie doing anything at all... I loved this movie.Go see this movie and have as much fun as you can. Do not bring your children, do not bring your old parents. Do not bring Roger Ebert.Enjoy,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was incredibly crude, immature, and stupid. However, it was also funny at times. I didn't find it nearly as bad as the critics, but I'm not quite ready to proclaim it a future cult classic. If you're easily offended, this is definitely the wrong movie for you. It's highly offensive, with a constant stream of vulgarities and crude sexual humor. Interestingly, there's some pretty good special effects, sets, and award-winning actors. It's like someone decided to give millions of dollars to a bunch of stoners to make their masterpiece. The resulting movie is no masterpiece, but it's certainly better than the critics made it out to be. If you're the kind of person who will laugh at anything no matter how stupid it is, you'll probably like this movie. If you have actual standards and demand that movies be tactful and intelligent, you'll probably hate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shame on everyone involved in this unmitigated disaster of a film: Danny McBride, James Franco, Natalie Portman, Justin Theroux, Zooey Deschanel, Toby Jones, and director David Gordon Green. Pathetic and sad, a colossal misfire as well as a pungent waste of money, resources, time, including mine for watching this sludge. A thirty-second preview for Danny McBride's uproariously filthy HBO show Eastbound &amp; Down is funnier than the entirety of Your Highness, a wannabee-stoner film that cannot even milk its drug use for laughs. Neither cursing, nor McBride's goofiness can save this film from falling to the bottom of the heap. The very bottom. There has to be a bottom, and this film is it.Zero stars. So, I'm handing out punishments for this film, the lowest rating I've given for the entire year so far. James Franco should be forced to watch his performance in this film on a loop over and over again with his eyes held open ala A Clockwork Orange.Natalie Portman should have to return her Black Swan Best Actress Academy Award and never speak of her involvement in this film ever.Justin Theroux should have to stop dating Jennifer Aniston.And director David Gordon Green?To paraphrase the classic film comedy Billy Madison, Mr. Green, what you've just created ... is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever watched. At no point in your rambling, incoherent film were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational (or funny) thought. Everyone who has seen Your Highness is now dumber for having watched it.I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ugh. This was such a terrible movie that it could easily compete with "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" in being the most pathetic fantasy film produced in the recent years.It tries to be a parody of many fantasy films (Like Star Wars, Clash of Titans and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, among others) but the jokes are so dumb and unfunny that it fails to entertain on a spectacular level.The character are flat and dull, and the script is something that could have been written by a 13 year old boy, with lots of immature and idiotic jokes that are not even amusing.Honestly, David Gordon Green should stop making those stupid comedies and turn back to dramas, because he is terrible for this kind of films. Do you want to see a good fantasy-comedy film? Watch "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and skip this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no redeeming value in this movie. If you watched the trailer, you've seen every decently entertaining moment of the movie.The entire movie drags from the poor acting (minus Natalie Portman, the only thing worthwhile), bad accents and dialog that had to be written by a 12 year old. I'll admit that I like a good dirty joke but what we have here is random lines thrown together attempting some sort of shock value. They get the shock but its more of an, "I can't believe this movie got funding" kind of shock.By the end of this movie I was amazed at how far James Franco had fallen and also wondered why Natalie Portman would even attach herself to such a giant pile of crap. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes a lot for me to rate a film one star. I didn't think Plan 9 was that bad, hell I even gave Year One 2 stars. Your Highness is the type of movie that makes me sick to have paid ten bucks for the matinée showing, I can't imagine the people who paid full price for this sack.Danny McBride and James Franco play two brothers, one lazy and one brave, courageous, heroic, whatever (I'll let you guess how these descriptions respond). Franco's girlfriend (Zooey Deschanel) gets kidnapped, and the two brothers along with more idiots have to go save her.To continue to describe the plot would suggest that I stayed in the theatre for the duration of the film. I hated Your Highness. I hated how the plot treated the audience like idiots. Half of the jokes used in this film were recycled from Pineapple Express, unsurprisingly the same director, David Gordon Green.The script is awful. Every other word is an obscenity, which is completely unneeded and totally detracts from any chance of comedy. Even scenes with potential are destroyed. Jokes about masturbation and sex run amok and offer no chance of redemption for this turkey.I hope Franco, McBride, and Portman do better next time, because ultimately they're all good actors that deserve better material and have potential. Above all, stay away from Your Highness and watch something, anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness is a movie, if there ever is one, that is an insult to the words "Gross-out" and "comedy" and the dash between the first two words. What's even more insulting is the fact that it came from such a talented director, David Gordon Green. That guy directed Pineapple Express, and a number of lower-key serious ones that are worth mention as well. But alas, Your Highness is an ultimately unfunny embarrassment of a film that makes the god-awful "Step Brothers" look hilarious.The film's story is set in Medieval England and basically revolves around Thadeous, a lazy and fat stoner slob with a successful brother, Fabious. Fabious has just returned from saving his wife, Belladonna, from an evil wizard with three moms called Lezarre. As they are about to get married, on the wedding day, Lezarre kidnaps Belladonna and brings her back to his castle for the sole purpose of deflowering her, with the help of his three mothers. They take some guy I couldn't care about named Courtney as they go on their quest. Their quest includes many things such as masturbating a wizard creature thingy, ending up in a trap and blah blah blah... yeah.That's about as much of a story you'll get from Your Highness. Because much of the film's potential to have a good story is wasted on jokes about sex, paedophilia, wearing a monster penis around your neck and a whole bunch of other gross and raunchy stuff that's too raunchy to be funny, and too dull to be even considered humour, even unfunny humour at that. The film basically subjects its audience to such nasty and gross stuff for the entire duration, and while I love gross-out humour, there's a fine line between gross and funny.That's not to say there wasn't any funny moments, because there were, in fact, two: One where Thadeous goes around, stoned out of his mind, chasing sheep, and another being where they are under attack in a ritual including a beast which is controlled by a fat man's hand. I'm not gonna lie, I just spent 20 minutes trying to remember the parts I did think were funny. That's never a good sign. There were a couple chortles as well, but I can't even remember those parts. There's an incredible amount of gory violence in the film too, but the only reason the gore is so shocking is because of the rest of the film being so static and blasé. Despite the violence, the film is not much of an action movie. Problem is, it's not much of a comedy either, at least to people who know what funny actually means.Overall, while this film is rated 18A in Canada, I find mys elf a number of years years past its intended target audience- that is, 14 year old tweens who find jokes about baby rape and other disgusting stuff funny. And mind you, I've been known around my friends as the one with the incredibly sick and twisted sense of humour, but even still, this film is just not funny. I would definitely recommend staying away from this flick, no matter how much you love gross humour or sick and twisted stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lowbrow comedy that delivers the laughs and excitement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your Highness is one of my favorite comedies of 2011. I'm sure that it wasn't an inspired project but it's still a workable fantasy lowbrow comedy with some surprises. What makes it work is the presence of Danny McBride as Prince Thadeous and James Franco as Prince Fabious. They're two very good comedy actors. The film is at its best and funniest when McBride and Franco are both on screen. It's McBride who is the funniest here though. The humor doesn't come as often as it should but there isn't really a dull moment. Natalie Portman as Isabel and Zooey Deschanel as Belladonna are two additional famous names in the cast. The fantasy setting allows for some action scenes and special effects. There's a hydra-like monster, a minotaur, a great wise wizard and a mechanical bird. The quest that the brothers set out on has a satisfying ending. I recommend the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness, a doubtful movie when it began playing its introduction casting of the movie. The comical graphics of its overly exposed contents should not be directly relate to its movie. Do not expect blasting graphic effects and heart pounding audio nor excessive nudity and constant pot tripping scene because that is not what the movie intends to deliver. Instead this movie allows you to sip in slowly into its traditional storyline, plotted perfectly to increase the excitement of their journey and makes you smile throughout. Each expectations and hopes you had inside the abandoned part of you will be slowly fulfilled as if Bobby and Peter knew the key to your deepest smiling chest. This movie also reflects the sensitivity of one person should have in this mankind which it has been slowly dissipating in the world today. The movie began with a prince riding a dark stallion into the castle arrogantly, making you wonder what is that scene all about. Then later realizing that its all the greatness that they deserved. A Story that is so down to earth, that you should enjoy it with a family or friend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Your Highness (08 April 2011) is rated R and has a 5.6/10 rating from viewers on I.M.D.B. This movie was directed by David Gordon Green and was written by Danny McBride and Ben Best, and the producer is Scott Stuber. The three main characters in this movie are Thadeous, (Danny McBride), Fabious, (James Franco), and Isabel, (Natalie Portman). Fabious and Thadeous are brothers, but Fabious is the real warrior of the two. These two brothers set out on a quest to rescue Fabious' fiancé, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel). They gather a small army and set out to rescue her from the evil Leezar, (Justin Theroux). Fabious and Thadeous encounter many challenges throughout their journey. The first unfortunate event is when they discover that their entire army is plotting against them. The two brothers escape along with Thadeous' slave, now they are on their own. Eventually Fabious is captured by the traitors anyway, and Thadeous must continue the quest along with the female warrior, Isabel, and his slave. The three of them must find the sword of the unicorn and save Fabious and Belladonna from Leezar. Thadeous proves himself by finding the sword and coming to his brother's rescue. With the help of Isabel and his slave, Thadeous is able to rescue his brother and future sister-in-law from Leezar. After the rescue, Thadeous seems to have caught the eye of Isabel and they must now set out on their own quest after his brother's wedding.I think the turning point of the story was when Thadeous finds the sword of the unicorn. He seemed to gain a lot of confidence and courage in himself, and set out to help his brother, Fabious, for the first time. This movie is probably inappropriate for many viewers because it does have a lot of vulgar language and some nudity, but I found this movie to be very funny and entertaining throughout the whole movie. In my opinion the viewer ratings seem a little low, I felt the movie was better than a 5.6, but like I said it is definitely not a movie for those who are offended easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness is a great movie with a fun spoof on fantasy adventure films that brings great comedic performances from Danny McBride,Natalie Portman,James Franco and Zooey Deschanel.I find this movie very underrated,it wasn't very well reviewed and was a box office bomb,but still go by my own opinion that this is a very enjoyable movie that was a very fun mix of movies like Pineapple Express with effects and characters like Lord of the Rings.The main cast members, who are all American, really pulled off keeping an English accent for the whole movie,I was really impressed by this and didn't think they would manage.My favourite character is definitely Natalie Portman's,it was a very different role for her, her character was funny and also a very independent woman,also very attractive,as Natalie a Portman always is.I would love to see a sequel to this movie but it is unlikely because of how it did financially and critically,but it ended with such a good set up for a sequel.It certainly isn't a perfect comedy,and it definitely would have been better if they got Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg involved in some way, but Your Highness is still much better than average and I would definitely recommend it to fans of movies like Pineapple Express and Superbad.When a spin to prince's wife is kidnapped on their wedding day,he sets out to save her with his lazy and careless younger brother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What motivates well-respected actors to participate in this type of movie? What motivates producers and directors to put up time and money?I am aware that Danny McBride wrote it and stars as the slacker prince Thadeous. His older brother is the fierce, dependable prince, James Franco as Fabious, destined to become king. But the situations and dialog are seldom funny, more often just dumb. They throw in filthy language just for shock effect, but it just becomes tedious.The story involves their going on a crusade to find a magical sword of the unicorn horn that will defeat an otherwise immortal foe. Along the way they encounter a village of naked ladies, for no particular reason than to have naked ladies in the movie. Natalie Portman is also in this abomination, as Isabel, herself a fierce and dependable warrior. The damsel in distress happens to be Zooey Deschanel as Belladonna. And yes, she does sing a song. Even more entertaining was the song that ended up on the cutting room floor but into the DVD extras, she has a duet with Franco who sings very badly. Now that was funny! Overall a great waste of talent, and for me, a great waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YOUR HIGHNESS ? TRASH IT ( D ) Whoever came up with this idiotic idea should be hanged. I still cannot believer on one hand we see 50million dollar movie Super 8 and then we have 50 million dollar movie" Your Highness". That's just atrocious. I don't know how fat ass convinced studios on this atrocious script and above all casting him as a main lead? Then casting James Franco &amp; Natalie Portman along with it. That's a little too much luck for such crap project. This movie also got some of the most grossest scenes ever e.g James Franco smooching and jerking off medieval Ugly Old creature, D**kless man, Bull with large D**k etc. Finally, James Franco is on peak of his career after outstanding performance in "127 hours" otherwise he has been good supporting actor but not a such a good lead actor. Natalie Portman has been among favorites all the time but this time she was The One in the world just like Sandra Bullock was last year, though, he role was not that big but still thanks to James Franco and Natalie Portman I was able to go through this crap. Now let's talk about the man who was behind it and on front of it "Danny McBride". Well he was not funny, if you thing being fat and talk dirty makes you funny? That's childish. Zooey Deschanel and Justin Theroux were fine. Overall, after "Drive Angry", Your Highness is the worst movie of the year. I would have given (F) BUT for Franco &amp; Portman's sack, I'm adjusting with (D).</fullReview>

There was not a single decent joke in the entire first half of this repulsive waste of energy, and even the appearance of the beautiful Natalie Portman was not enough to keep me in it. However, for those who like pointless jokes about genitalia and excrement, look no further- This is the filth fest for you.Perhaps the greatest disappointment about this movie was the fact that it truly could have been epic. The special effects, the scenery, even the plot line- It all could have been amazing, as either an action, a fantasy or a comedy. Instead, it will go down in history as being worse- That's right, worse- Than the original Bloodrayne.Uwe Boll, make way for David Gorden Green.

		<fullReview>I'm gonna paraphrase Roger Ebert here: I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every stupid, simpering audience-insulting moment of it.Look, I can rant all day about broad generalities, but I'm gonna hit the specifics. Your Highness is a pointless, wasteful, shameless pet project that Danny McBride thinks can be passed off as a comedy. Look, audiences go to watch high-fantasy movies because they're silly enough. We don't need a parody, because in a sense high fantasy is in and of itself a parody. We laugh at the goofiness that comes unintentionally, not when it is shoved down our throats.There's no point discussing the plot. It is stupid, pointless, and predictable. I'll summarize. James Franco is the darling of the kingdom, Danny McBride is the black sheep. James Franco brings home Zooey Deschanel (who might as well be a mannequin, she gets so little screen time), who is subsequently kidnapped by the evil Justin Theroux. Thus, Franco drags McBride along for a quest to save her, and they meet Natalie Portman (who apparently needed to balance Black Swan with this stinker, I guess...) who joins them. That's all I can say.This film IS funny at times, but for all the wrong reasons. The special effects for Theroux's magic are hilariously bad. Do they give Razzies for effects? The faux-accents that high fantasy characters are so known for are brutal coming out of the mouth of this crew, to the point that I wish there was a mute button in the theater.None of the minor characters are helpful, either. I shake my head the most at Damien Lewis. Damien, buddy, you were wonderful as Major Richard Winters in Band of Brothers. Why do you stoop to the drudgery of this flick? There is no redeemable quality to his character: just a poorly written, betraying friend who is also apparently gay. I dunno, I guess they threw that in for laughs. Cue up the sarcastic laughter.The ending of the movie is abrupt, and in a way appropriate. McBride ends with (spoiler alert...not that it really matters with this plot) "Fuck it. Let's kill that bitch." You know, delete the second sentence, and I think that you have a decent summary of what I am sure was McBride's attitude towards designing this movie. Stick to Kenny Powers, Danny. That's something you're hilariously good at. For all the right reasons.</fullReview>

Not even worth a $1 rental. At least it wasn't a 3D waste.So sad with what looked like a newer Princess Bride, and once you get past the opening credits, the funniest scene has happened at the hanging. Natalie Portman gives a fine performance that goes wasted, while Franco looks like he's stuck in a bad SNL skit from the 90's.

		<fullReview>I've never seen a bad movie starring Natalie Portman -- until now. This is by far the worst movie I've seen so far this year. It was a complete waste of time. If you think things like minotaur penises being worn as necklaces is funny, then this movie may be for you. It's chock full of that level of material. Contrary to other reviewers here, I didn't find a single thing funny in the movie. Can't cut off a minotaur's horn, so sever his penis for a souvenir instead. Bwahahahah! NOT!So was there anything positive in this movie? Sure, but nothing to make the movie worth watching. We get to see Natalie Portman from behind diving into a pool wearing nothing but a chastity belt. A couple special effects were kind of cool. For example, a sort of muppet-operated character smoking a bong had a head that was animated in a sort of way that could have been his psychedelic visions projecting through his skull. On the other hand, some of the CGI was pixellated -- swarms of something were flying around in an unrealistic-looking grid. Overall, the effects were good.If it weren't for the very good sound and the decent effects, the movie would have looked like a bunch of college kids getting together and horsing around at some Renaissance festival.

		<fullReview>Going to see this film wasn't a deliberate attempt on my behalf. Having missed the screening of an earlier film, a woman working at the cinema suggested going to see this cinematic diatribe. I ultimately regret actually even leaving the house for this dumbfounded excuse for a film, and ended up walking out about half way through. I only stayed to ensure that the extortionate price I'd paid for my popcorn and the cinema ticket wasn't complete waste of money.The problem with the film in my eyes is that it was just puerile and unfunny humour for the sake of puerile and unfunny humour. Even in another comedy such as The Hangover, I at least cared about the main protagonists in the plot, and it was at least something I could relate to. I didn't really care if Prince Fabious and his fat jealous and spoilt brother completed their quest or not. Nor did I think that the anachronism of using modern day profanities in what was trying to be passed for a medieval context was funny. In fact, it was an unfunny joke which wore rather thin after the first 10 minutes. What's really rather infuriating is the estimated budget of nearly $50 Million! Where did the money disappear into the cracks of this terrible film? I understand that a considerable amount of the film was improvised and unscripted. I think this puts paid to the general malaise and complete lack of interest and disconnect I felt for any of the characters.I consider myself to have somewhat of an immature sense of humour at times, and don't claim to be the most cultured person in the world. I still felt however that this film really did fall short of either a comedy, or a cult film. I don't know why other people on this site are calling it a 'cult classic'. It's not even a kitsch film which was made on a shoe-string budget with a lesser known director. I could have had at least had some sympathy for the outcome of this disaster if that had been the case. It's always unfortunate that hindsight is a wonderful thing, and it's a shame that the last minute decision to see this film was based on a whimsical recommendation by a member of the cinema staff who was probably being facetious, and knew how much of a rotten tomato this film really is. If you have the chance to, please stay away from this one.</fullReview>

It was amazing and I can't wait for another movie night that is as fun as this night was. If you like D&amp;D, stoner movies and laughing your ass off, I definitely recommend Your Highness!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is not my knight in shining armor. It was really bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody force to watch this, is royalty screwed. Directed by David Gordon Green, the film centers on two Princes: Thadeous (Danny McBride) &amp; Prince Fabious (James Franco) on their adventure to rescue Fabious's bride to be, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel) from the evil wizard, Leezar (Justin Theroux). Can, the two princes with the help of a female warrior, Isabel (Natalie Portman) save the princess or will the evil wizard win the day? Watch the movie if you really want to, to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this movie to be, very unfunny. Unlike, other medieval comedy films like 1993's Robin Hood: Men in Tight, 1975's Monty Python &amp; the Holy Grail &amp; 2001's Shrek that mixed lowbrow humor, so well with smart jokes. Your Highness is so full of gross toilet humor, awful sex jokes and juvenile excrescence that it's nearly unwatchable. Honestly, most of the crass dark humor that the film used, was a little too unpleasant. It's really hard to make controversial topics like rape, funny. It doesn't help, that Danny McBride plays such an unlikeable mean-spirit man-child. Your Highness relies way too heavily on the McBride factor for its laugh. Much of the comedy stems from McBride's comic timing and his horrible and likely intentional butchery of an English accent. Sadly, most of his gags, don't really works. I hate the fact that the movie is trying to make us, root for him, despite the fact, that it's a big fat coward who does absolutely nothing of note, in the film. Are we supposed to root for him because Fabious comes off as a little annoying? He does nothing of importance and screws up things a few times. The whole relationship with him and Isabel seem a little forced. These two, have little to no chemistry that I was really hoping for her, to turn him down. Natalie Portman's presence in the movie, is really jarring. She's better than this crap. It's really surprising, to see her, here. Natalie Portman admitted she only did this movie because there was some uncertainty if her Oscar Winning performance in 2010's Black Swan would get greenlit by a major studio. She signed on to this film for a paycheck and try to use it to help finance Black Swan herself, should the need have ever risen. However, Black Swan got greenlit and went underway fairly easily, and Natalie got stuck doing this film having already signed on. While, her performance wasn't bad, there was little to no reason to have her character to tag, along with the heroes. For the most part, the film really misused Natalie Portman's skills. I guess, they just wanted to exploit her, to get semi-naked for the oddly place, not needed 'Outdoor Bath Peeping' scene. At least, they make her character, somewhat a badass. Natalie Portman wasn't the only one, who dislike the film. Co-star, James Franco said in many interviews after the release of this film, that he thought this film was one of his worst, due to how badly, written it was. He really didn't like the lame delivery of the humor. He really hate the film. James Franco's performance for me, was alright, but every time, I saw him, in that silly long wig, acting noble &amp; gallant, it remind me, so much of his 2006 film, Tristan + Isolde. It was so distracting. Supporting characters like Justin Theroux as the evil Wizard was cavorts in such ridiculous makeup and a horribly ugly poodle dog haircut that his look was a lot funnier than his jokes. The sweet presence of Zooey Deschanel was alright as the damsel of distress. I just wish, the movie made more used with her. She's somewhat funny in other comedies projects, so I was really disappointed, they didn't allow her humorous side to come out. Another thing that bother the living hell out of me, about this film is how the movie felt more like a tongue in cheek take on the sword and sandal genre than a sword and sorcery genre. Seeing, Ancient Greek myths like the Minotaur and the Labyrinth in a medieval settling was somewhat bizarre. The film gets even more stupid with the simpleton plot that makes no sense. Why does the all-powerful Wizard need to sleep with the princess, so that he can birth a Dragon? Couldn't he just create a dragon, or better off, just ruled the world without one? Anyways, its makes no sense. The movie does have somewhat entertaining special effects, cool, over the top-gory action scenes, naked wood nymphs, and nice cartoony opening, but the majority of the film is focus on jokes that make people, miserable. For a film, titled 'Your Highness', you would think the movie would imply, a fun weed-laced romp through a fantasy realm, but surprising, there is very little pot humor in the movie. Maybe, the movie could have work better, if cut out the raunchy shock value humor for smart or Meta absurdity. Just saying. Overall: This movie is not worth going on crusade for. This movie deserves to be sacked. I don't recommended. I would rather go to Medieval Times than see this film, again. At least, they put up a decent show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a satire rated "early teenager boy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A farce or an expensive studio lark? Hard to tell, some ventures are just intended to lose money. But as a companion to all the other "less offensive" R-Rated movies that deal strictly in human natural gas jokes, it's a winner. Can things like dialog, plot development and character depth really be judged in the venue attempted. No. This production is pitched at a too specific audience, young teenagers. Not really a spoiler alert, for those who ask if there is a lot of "sex and violence"? Yes there is, but presented in a strict R version. As a teenage boy, a lot of this movie would have gotten a lot of snickers. Today at the 55-64 age check box, it just gets a yawn. If I even pay attention to the still-developing-brain level of humor. Just a time-waster that gets an occasional glance; sort of like an old time radio play. That's why it may have been a money-loser in release US side. I'm sure there are countries around the world where teenage sex jokes, and boobies, will pay a good return. This exercise in cinema will go down in history with all the millions of forgotten theatrical attempts. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't find it funny at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decided to finally check up on the film. I enjoyed Pineapple Express, and I like Danny McBride, but nothing in this film works. McBride and James Franco and their humor don't translate well to the setting. The British accents do not translate to comedy for me. That might have worked well if the comedy had come from that clash, but it rarely does. The sameness can be attributed to Pineapple Express, the 2008 stoner comedy in which McBride played a distant fourth banana to Franco. The director of that picture, David Gordon Green, is also calling the shots on Your Highness, which is little more than a stoner comedy retro-booted back to medieval times.You could almost forgive the conceptual laziness if there were some killer laughs to be had, but the gags are invariably more miss than hit. McBride plays a cowardly, overweight prince. Franco is his brave, thin brother. Together they must rescue a fair maiden (Zooey Deschanel) before a rogue wizard has his unfair way with her. Portman shows up late in the game as warrior-princess eye-candy. The movie coughs, splutters and nods off on the job repeatedly - as if everyone hit the weed so hard they forgot there were cameras rolling. Overall, did not find the film funny and it was hard to pay attention at certain moments. Would not recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is downright hilarious; don't know why there's so much negativity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on here and I had to participate in this after seeing all of the negative reviews.I don't see how all these other people are bashing this movie. This movie is absolutely hilarious and makes me laugh throughout the entire movie. Danny McBride, one of my favorite actors, is hilarious just like he was in Eastbound &amp; Down.Apparently most of the people that have seen this movie have no sense of humor, because it's funny as hell. It's one of the few movies that I laugh from beginning to end. And not to mention, Natalie Portman is in the movie -- and she's hot! James Franco isn't the funniest guy in the world, but I like him in this movie. This was one of my favorite movies of 2011 and it is undoubtedly better than Pineapple Express.This movie is great. It follows two brothers, who are both princes -- Franco plays Prince Fabious and McBride portrays Prince Thadeous. After coming back from a quest, Fabious brings a girl named Belladona (Zooey Deschanel), who has been a prisoner in their enemy's castle -- Played by Justin Theroux, the villain is a wizard named Leezar, who will have sex with a virgin (Deschanel) to make a dragon that will terrorize the land. At their wedding, Leezar appears, uses magic and takes Belladonna back. Thadeous was supposed to be Fabious' best man but after hearing two of the "Knights Elite" talk smack, he decided to skip the wedding and smoke pot. When he and Courtney (his "young squire") come back, Fabious is crying and thought something had happened to his brothers. Their dad announces that Fabious is going back on another quest to defeat Leezar and bring his fiancée back. Thadeous was happy that his brother was going, but his dad would go on to say that Thadeous could go on his first quest or he could stay and receive a judgement from the people of their "city". Thadeous then goes and the rest they say, is history.After falling asleep, Thadeous is woken up by "Julie", Fabious' right-hand man and confidant. Thadeous does not want to go in to see the "Wize Wizard", and Boremont (one of the Knights Elite) says that he would go and leave Thadeous there. Fabious says no and one he says that, you can tell that Boremont is not too pleased and something shady would eventually happen. When seeing the Wizard, he tells them why Leezar needs Belladonna and they need to find the "Blade of Unicorn". In order to get the sword, he gives them a one-of-a-kind compass that only works in sunlight. Before they leave, the brothers are forced to do a sexual favor for the Wizard -- it is then safely assumed that Fabious was molested by him when he was younger.After Fabious and the Knight Elite trick Thadeous into eating something very gross, he storms off. His servant Courtney is standing by a tree, peeing in the grass. He looks over and sees Julie do some type of magic and talk to Leezar. Leezar tells Julie to capture Fabious and kill Thadeous and Courtney, as they serve no purpose to him. Courtney tells the brothers what's happening and after Courtney captures him, they bring him back to the main camp-site. There, it is announced that Julie isn't the only one on Leezar's side -- Boremont, the other two Knights Elite and two random Japanese(?) warriors are, as well. However, Fabious, Thadeous and Courtney are able to escape thanks to Fabious.Along the way, theay are captured by nymphs, who are led by the evil Marteetee. After Fabious defeats their best warrior, Marteetee has people bring out his cauldron, which somehow made a hydra-like monster-like bulbis (or something of that nature). Fabious gets bit by the monster and Courtney is forced to suck it out in order to save him. After one of the heads is cut off, Marteetee brings it back out and an unknown person is able to cut off the other three heads -- when a head is cut off, Marteetee loses whichever finger it was. After he loses every finger but his middle one, it is revealed that this unknown person is Isabel (Natalie Portman). She soon announces that Marteetee enslaved her father and killed him in the arena. Isabel would then go on to say that she came there for two reasons: 1) to kill the beast and 2) killing him. She is able to somehow throw her "sword" (or whatever it was) up there, stabbing Marteetee in the chest. Marteetee then collapses in the cauldron and the four are able to escape. Soon afterward, they decide to travel together, as they are all headed in the same direction.I'm not going to say much else, as I don't want to give too much away.I just can't see how this movie gets such bad reviews, as well as Hot Rod, MacGruber and Cedar Rapids. But apparently I have a different sense of humor than most people, I guess. If you haven't seen this movie, go rent it right now. It's a great movie and provides a great amount of laughs. It's definitely worth the rental, so check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could like this very much if they let out all those repulsive sexual jokes (if I can call a joke something that's not even remotely funny). Natalie and Frank were great, others solid, although I had a problem with Mc Bride's character (or his acting:) at first, I got used to it later. I guess he had to be that way. It had potential for a nice, funny, lightweight comedy, but they (writers, producers, whoever) wanted something more and they ruined it. Why the "humor" had to be so gross?!? I'm not a huge puritan, I liked Knocked up for example, I kept watching Role models although first 2-3 jokes were repulsive too and totally enjoyed the movie afterwards, but this one didn't know when to stop being gross, repulsive and offensive... I can take it in small doses, but this was waaaaay too much for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Highest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your Highness, not the highest in my opinion and from what I've seen from the other reviews, not really the best in the eyes of most. It's the classics tale of a knight going on a journey to save his princess with a sleight twist; he has a lazy soft little brother. This brother played by Danny McBride, who also wrote the film, makes it bearable to sit thru the whole film with his usual funny persona we see in all his films and his TV show east bound and down. But all in all it wasn't terrible and if your in the mood for a stupid humor comedy, it will provide. Also i'm a big fan of James Franco as well as Natalie Portman so they kind of suckered me into this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its tough having a perfect, over-achiever as an older brother, especially you are an overachiever in debauchery. Of course being spoiled, self-centered and lazy doesn't help your image either. But if you want the accolades, you must make some changes.The underlying premise of the movie was actually rather interesting, as well as the fact that there were some humoresque moments due to spoofs at established fairy tales, and the actors created memorable characters. But this cannot override the absolute crudeness and lack of true comedy. Unfortunately, the main focus of the film seemed to be to push vulgarity to its limits. And that is in the edited version, which should be rated X.The world would be done a great favor if all copies of this film were lost forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider art a form of expression that don't insult our intelligence but emulates it. So why to waste money in making such a movie who happens to be a parody with such a low sense of humor that it depreciates all the good that was put in making this movie, at least good in sound and special effects. I regret seeing good actors playing in these kind of movies, and also what to expect from the entire cast, maybe they taught the movie will be funny to watch and also kind of stupid because who takes seriously nowadays warlocks, witches, monsters, knights, and maiden? Well, or you don't know anything about myth and folklore or you just happen to be a hypocrite who has no idea what he is dealing with. If you want to enjoy a movie like this you have to be no more than a 5th grader with pimples all over your face, but if you grow up already and you are an adult, please stay away from it, or you will be poised to start acting as immature and childish like the characters of this movie, and you will insult everyone you know with your erratic behavior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of talent and chance of making something completely hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This quest sucks!" David Gordon Green has made some interesting and good films in the past ('Undertow') and pretty recently ('Pineapple Express'). But what about this one then? The quote above pretty much sums it all up.In a far away land, there lives two princes. Thadeous (McBride), a cocky and cowardly fatty. With fatty I'm not talking about a perfectly shaped large ass. Let's just say that he's not in shape. But he does enjoy smoking fatties... Where were we again. Was there another prince? Oh yes. Fabious. He's just fabulous. The next King. The great hope of the kingdom. But I'm pretty sure that this gullible princeter has been molested by a wizard of some sort...So anywho. There are other characters but who really gives a f**k. All of them are pointlessly put out in the script. Zooey Deschanel, who is by the way the sexiest chick in the business, is totally lost in the picture even though she's the princess their after. Damian Lewis's character could've been written better. Natalie Portman? OK, she just won the Oscar. Did you know that 'Your Highness' was re-scheduled a few times. Why's that? I guess they've learned of the Eddie Murphy 'Dreamgirls' - 'Norbit' incident. Murphy would've won the Oscar without that 'Norbit' disaster released at the same time. Nuff said. Where were we again? I guess Green has tried to make 'Your Highness' as a mocking tribute to all these 80's fantasy adventures we've grown up with. 'Willow', 'Conan the Barbarian', 'Red Sonja' etc, you know 'em all. Green just went wrong on some really important things. There's a lot of missed opportunities here.First of all, 'Your Highness' starts on very slowly. I understand that you have to introduce the protagonists etc but man... I almost broke my main rule and searched for the forward button on the remote.Secondly, 'Your Highness' just ain't that funny. There are some scenes that are amusing but you know that feeling when you're cracking up completely? It ain't here.Thirdly (can I even say it like that?), Green does deliver some obscene scenes but he doesn't max 'em out completely. It almost feels as if he's apologizing before hand.There ain't gonna come a "fourthly", because I'd probably brake every rule in English grammar. This film just is a mess. There were some scenes that were OK but there's gotta be more. There's no denying that 'Your Highness' has lots of talent in it. It just ain't used the way it should."All I want is for you to be a part of this moment. I want you to be gay with me and father. - I don't want to be gay with you two!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad title. Worse film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your Highness starts with a wedding. The prodigal son of the King (Charles Dance) has returned from yet another successful quest in this ancient and magical land ? where ye old dialogue is only interrupted by as many 'motherf*ckers' and 'c*cksuckers' as painfully unfunny Danny McBride can bleed out of a bic.Fabius is the apple of his father's eye and the pride of the kingdom. Not only has he returned victorious, but he and his small band of fearless heroic warriors have also brought back Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), a beautiful princess who is to be Fabius' bride.But Fabius is more than an ideal son and all round nice guy, noble, brave and much adored by all, he is also the older brother of a lazy, crass slob named Thaddeus (Danny McBride). Thaddeus resents the justifiable adulation bestowed upon his more deserving older brother, so as an olive branch of peace Fabius asks that Thaddeus be his Best Man at the impending nuptials.However, at the lavish ceremony the following day Thaddeus is nowhere to be seen, skipping the ceremony to get stoned and chase sheep with a half goat, half man.Yes, it is that kind of film? Unfortunately for all involved the evil wizard Leezar shows up and plucks Belladonna for himself, as he needs a virginal beauty as one of the primary ingredients of his own prophecy.A despondent Fabius immediately decides that a new quest must be embarked upon, one to save his bride to be, only this time the King suggests Thaddeus go along and prove himself a man. The suggestion is made all the more serious for Thaddeus when he learns he will be banished from the kingdom and disowned by his father if he disobeys.And so off Fabius and his brave offsiders, Thaddeus and his toadying offsider Courtney go, into inhospitable territory with danger at every turn, but not really.Along the way they deal with magical puppets with possible pedophilic tendencies, mythical creatures of varying sizes and topless warrior women. They face betrayal, peril and a dangerous and determined young woman named Isobel (Natalie Portman) on a quest of her own.Might I point out here that *YES* Portman partially disrobes for precious little reason aside from providing eye candy, and *YES* this totally worthwhile. But aside from the brief glimpse of her g-stringed glory Portman is essentially the straight woman to Thaddeus' degenerate childishness. In fact aside from the heaving cleavage and strip down scene she isn't called upon to do much of anything.The supposed humour in Your Highness arrives in the form of frequent vulgarity, homoeroticism ? both mistaken and genuine ? surprising gory moments and grown men talking and reacting like children aged between 4 and 12 years of age.The 4 Y.O. material arrives when Thaddeus threatens to 'dob to his father', the 12 Y.O. when the crew see boobies and practically giggle like well? 12 year olds.And in between is the constant profanity, profanity designed to provoke laughter but in reality just showing that perhaps we shouldn't be surprised at the level of comedy throughout this tripe.McBride proved to me in The Foot-Fist Way that he didn't deserve the accolades from Will Ferrel and co. He proved once again in Pineapple Express and Tropic Thunder that he is barely capable of playing a third or even fourth string banana in a comedy. Your Highness proves that Natalie Portman is willing to show skin with little justification, that James Franco is willing to help out a friend regardless of the damage to his reputation and that perhaps Charles Dance is a worse saver than you might think.Final Rating ? 4 / 10. Also the 'Your Highness' is obviously a nod to pot smokers worldwide, but it has little to do with this film. They might as well have called it Lord of the Smoke Rings. Better yet they could have tried to make a decent film. Bad title. Worse film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much flagrancy, not enough wit, though the film seems capable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something about mythical fantasy and smoking weed suggests that a combination of the two should work. Epic quests, magic herbs and ridiculous, raunchy humor could have all gone to the same high school but never gotten a chance to become friends. "Your Highness" consequently brimmed with potential as the first "high" fantasy flick, especially coming from the team that successfully combined stoner comedy with a crime thriller in 2008's "Pineapple Express." Yet crammed into the same space, these different genres weaken each other and "Your Highness" falls short of anyone's fantasy.Director David Gordon Green and in particular star and co-writer Danny McBride have not had any misfires to this point, at least as far as making entertaining films. But while "Your Highness" isn't a total bore, it commands no attention either. Thadeous (McBride) is the lazy, worthless hornball of a prince who envies his charming and heroic older brother Fabious (James Franco). After a successful quest, Fabious comes home to wed his newfound bride, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel). But when the evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux) interrupts their nuptials and kidnaps Belladonna in hopes of impregnating her to fulfill an evil prophecy, Thadeous and his squire Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker) must aid his brother in stopping him and saving Belladonna. On their adventure they must seek a powerful sword hidden in a labyrinth, escape treachery and befriend a crafty maiden warrior named Isabel (Natalie Portman).A predictable and cliché fantasy plot can and should be excused in a movie of this sort, but lazy humor and forced expletives shouldn't. Those who know McBride's brand of humor ? in particular as seen on his HBO show "Eastbound &amp; Down" ?know that his trademark is the effective use of swearing and perverse comments. They come in no short supply in "Your Highness," but it felt like the fantasy element, possibly even the English accent, tongue-tied him in a way. In other words, the swearing and raunchy dialogue isn't any less than usual, but it's less effective in this fantasy context. In the instances when various four letter words get the laughs, it's because they seem unexpected. McBride and longtime friend and co-writer Ben Best needed to either dial down the quantity and commit fully to or away from the medieval speak. If nothing else it's just indecisive.This wouldn't be as much of a problem, however, if they hadn't written an overwhelming majority of the humor into the dialogue and instead focused it into situational humor. The few situational comedic moments there are work nicely, but they're fleeting.As a fantasy film, "Your Highness" actually had moments of sincere creativity. The five- headed serpent sequence worked the best by far of all the action scenes in terms of both style and creative thinking. Perhaps the approach of making a fantasy film and letting the comedy follow instead of trying to make a fantasy comedy might have helped. Most cult fantasy movies were born this way, though understandably that was the '80s and things have simply changed a lot since then."Your Highness" boils down to a mixed bag of penis and vagina jokes, f-words and over-the- top special effects. It could well be considered the exact opposite approach taken to fantasy comedy of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." This film's best enjoyed by extremely high young people or nine-year-olds with active imaginations who have never seen an R-rated movie before. The laudable moments, though present throughout, dissipate before they can improve the overall experience of the movie.Even after seeing this experiment blow up in the faces of some actors and directors I respect, watching this film there still seems to be the potential to effectively pull off modern comedy in the fantasy context. It just needs to be more clever, and "Your Highness" doesn't care about being clever, even if at times it appears capable.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films I've ever seen - and I've seen some rubbish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to see this in the cinema - it was a spoof movie (which I love) and it had Zooey Deschanel and Natalie Portman in it - what more could I ask for? I was a little bit concerned about Danny McBride who was pretty poor in "Fist Foot Way" (another spoof that could have been so much better) but surely the presence of so many other good actors must mean that this was a good one. In the end I had to settle for watching it on DVD (good old "LoveFilm" meant I didn't waste the money to buy it) and I'm so glad I wasn't stuck in a cinema. I stopped the film on first viewing after about 20 mins.. even my kids, who like some childish crudity were appalled. I watched it all later (along with the fast-forward button) because I hoped that it was a just a dodgy start. Natalie Portman plays it straight all the way through and is as lovely as ever, but she must have been thinking "what the .....?". The script was so bad that even I could have substituted funnier punchlines instead of the crude inanities that McBride and Theroux were coming out with. All in all I doubt I'd have found this funny even if drunk and/or stoned. Quite simply the worst movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely idiotic stoner comedy set incongruously (though not amusingly)among the knights and damsels of the Middle Ages. Kind of like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, but with a lot more weed, non-stop F-bombs, and almost zero laughs. Perhaps the Jack Black dud Year Zero would make a better point of comparison. Danny McBride rarely lets on that he can actually be funny at times in other things, James Franco looks like he'd be more comfortable with his arm pinned back under that rock from 127 Hours, and the usually adorable Zooey Deschanel has almost nothing to do whatsoever. And if you're thinking about renting out the DVD just to briefly see Natalie Portman in a thong, keep in mind that you first have to sit through the spectacle of seeing Toby Jones WITHOUT the benefit of a thong. That's right: you're going to get mooned by Dobby the House Elf.</fullReview>

Unlike most of my age group I don't enjoy slapstick comedy. Sure some jokes are OK but these were just horrible. I couldn't handle the fake Minotaur junk that princes Thadius wore on his chest, and the cheesy but fake "sex" scenes from Zooey.Not to mention Zooey Deschanel.... great gal... and don't get me wrong some of her movies are good.... but I find her acting cheesy, if not monotone and static.

		<shortDescription>Danny McBride is my new least favourite actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched and loved Pineapple Express, and had high hopes for this, but when I finally got round to seeing it I sat transfixed with horror at the sheer unfunniness of almost the entire film. Danny McBride was the chief culprit I think, being both the principle protagonist and the writer. I will blame firstly the script for being frankly awful and containing very little that made me so much as chuckle. Secondly I also blame the director. He seems to have gone for a version of medieval/fantasy world where each line is delivered very artificially. It is possible that he was going for some kind of dramatic, Shakespearean effect, but the effect just falls flat. The story was extremely clichéd and was just them trailing from place to place on a quest that made very little sense. Of course, the story isn't the most important part of films like this, but it was just another nail in the coffin. Seriously, the fact that some people seem to think this is truly, laugh-out-loud funny really worries me. James Franco I have a lot of respect for, but he was average to bad in this. Natalie Portman as well I think is a great actress, but even she could not bring life into this disaster. The only answer is that you must watch this film when you are so stoned that even the this miserable attempt at a comedy will seem like the very pinnacle of humour</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love comedies. The Lethal Weapon films were brilliant, Mel Brooks' works is brilliant the films starring Gene Wilder and Richard Prior such as Stir Crazy and See No Evil Hear No Evil were brilliant. I love spoofs. Airplane is brilliant, The Naked Gun films are brilliant, the Screem films are brilliant, Superhero Movie is brilliant. That's to name just a few genuinely exceedingly funny comedies that I love! This dreadful piece of rubbish is the complete opposite.Having rented it, I am determined to watch it all of the way through. Whether I will or not is another matter. I have tried numerous times so far and every time I do I fall asleep! From there not being even one joke in it that is even remotely slightly funny to Zooey Deschanel's seriously awful English accent (Natalie Portman's isn't that great either, but of the two it's the better one) that is so bad it makes Dick Van Dyke's in Mary Poppins sound posher, more upper-class and more cut-glass than Her Majesty The Queen of England's, there is NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING good in this film! Read this and the others that are similar as we have told you how the movie REALLY is, and save your money! I wasted mine because I din't listen; Don't do the same!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst parody I ever saw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually very excited about the film after watching the trailers few months ago. So, when I finally convinced my wife to watch the film, I lived up to a huge disappointment. The jokes are mostly clichés and even the "fresh" ones, few as they are, are not really fun or very creative. The over-done sexual context in every aspect of the movie not only disrupts the already weak atmosphere, but is actually very far from funny. Some monologues were so full of it that I told myself "Ok, that's enough! I don't want to hear this crap anymore.". The overall idea is actually not bad and I liked the concept of the villain, but the story felt attached with white threads to the heavily enforced parody. There are rare moments which can be enjoyed but mostly the movie was pure torture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer I was doubtful, because it looked like Year One meets Pineapple Express. And I was right there.... Its the same thing of Year One, the same story. Here Prince Fabious and Thadeous have to go to a quest to save Belladona from the hands of Leezar the evil wizard. It sounds like a good-lame story. And if the Director from Pineapple Express is doing it, How it can be bad?Yes, it can. There are a lot of bad tasteful jokes....OK, I can laugh when someone says penis, or when someone doesn't have a penis(remember the eunuch of Year One?) but when of every 5 lines of dialog, 3 are of jokes of sex, C'mon..... SuperBad nailed it in that aspect but here is lame, boring and ultimately pointless, You don't laugh of that.What I'm trying to understand is what Natalie Portman and Zooey Deschanel saw in that script, because James Franco did Pineapple Express with Danny McBride(who is awful in the movie, so I'm going to avoid mention him) so I understand him, because it looks like a good movie but failed terribly. Meanwhile, Portman and Deschanel I thought want to make good things.Deschanel was good in Yes Man and 500 Days of Summer, while Portman should avoid this type of movies.Overall, is bad. It has some jokes and yes your are going to laugh sometimes but at the end, is not even worthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Danny McBride as an actor. Loved him in Pineapple Express. But as a writer I think he needs some new inspiration. The story is a mess. Fairy tales mixed with alien-like creatures who smoke pot and molest kids. Trust me, it sounds funnier than it looks. At times it feels like watching a movie for kids, but with adult jokes and language. I really wanted to like this movie, since some of my favorite actors are in it. James Franco, Natalie Portman, Zooey Deschanel- all great actors who can do much better than this. Better luck next time Danny-boy! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre film at best; not funny, nor with an entertaining enough tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not surprised this didn't do well at the box office; as it suffers badly from self gratuitous identification disorder. Ie, at times is a parody of a mix of Tolkien and Greek mythology themes; some others a generic medieval quest drama. But most of the time; it fails at being either one consistently. Solely as a comedy it just isn't funny enough on it's own. A couple of chuckles simply doesn't quite cut it. I laughed more at a lame half an hour sitcom that this boring movie. Yet sadly it also fails a meta renaissance love story; of which ironically I found to be more interesting that the other main layer. And precisely you know you have a problem when you care and think more of what the next step of the rescue attempt is going to be, rather that the goofy and silly lines and deliveries of the moment. I was hoping it'd got any better; but never did. And the real problem with it is, that is not a good movie overall; on any account. I'm glad this had high production values, since it not only makes it's flaws more pronounced, but slightly more watchable. It sadly also means good money was obv wasted on such said leverage too; but at least it has some decent acting and good special effects, though. Again, that doesn't quite justify the huge budget (this could've easily been made for much less) The premise is good and sound, but still unoriginal and badly implemented. Eg, The Princess Bride (for cheaper &amp; at a much lower age rating too) is the definitive sword and sorcery comedy film this undefinable stupid mess can only now aspire at a sequel to be; so do yourself a favor, and see that one instead (www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/)...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had low expectations of this movie, but in retrospect, I don't know why. The comedy is silly, but extremely witty, often perfectly understated, and precisely delivered (a couple of pedophilia jokes put me off, though). The medieval-quest story is developed enough so that you can appreciate some cool action sequences, decent special effects, and creative spins on well-known myths, but it's also constantly derailed with absurd lines and campy humor, just to remind you not to take it too seriously?you're here to laugh, bitch. Think The Princess Bride, but much raunchier. The cast is terrific! Franco and McBride have a hilarious chemistry that has me ready to laugh before they even say a word. I become more of a Portman fan every time I see her pretty face, watch her perform a kick-ass stunt, or read about another smart thing she said or inspiring feat she achieved; after the gratuitous thong-bikini shot of her in this film, my admiration for her "grew" in yet another way. Zooey Deschanel is a babe, straight up; I wish she had more screen time in this movie. Rasmus Hardiker is a very good non-verbal thespian (love that haircut!)?this could very well be his break-out film in a successful comedic-movie career. Needless to say, this flick exceeded my expectations. Perhaps most impressively, Green chucked the script once they got on-location, and let his all-star cast improvise most of this movie, utilizing only a plot outline and written notes?pretty outstanding if McBride was able to extemporaneously dish out a choice self-description like "great cocksmith, master pintsman, and stunningly-handsome prince of light in these dark Dark Ages."

		<shortDescription>A forgettable, mediocre comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a valiant prince and his gutless brother, who embark on a dangerous quest to save the princess-to-be."Your Highness" is full of crude humour and silly jokes. Some of these jokes work, and some fail desperately. Danny McBride plays a very annoying and courage-less character successfully, while Natalie Portman is very good as a determined warrior. However, just with good cast, great special effects and a seemingly limitless budget, it still requires a good script to make a comedy work. "Your Highness" may work better as a parody of science fiction and medieval adventure films, but does not quite have the magical spark in its current form. I think this project has gone to waste though, given the good cast that it has managed to assemble.</fullReview>

The story was OK and the idea was good.And then we come to what I didn't like.One, the F word is not a joke in and of itself. Sometimes it can fuel a joke: here, it mostly didn't.Two, there seems to be a belief that if you make your central character a loud mouthed, ignorant, offensive oaf, that is funny. Well, Danny McBride in Your Highness joins Jonah Hill in Superbad and Rob Corddry in Hot Tub Time Machine as characters whose company I disliked so resoundingly that I didn't want to spend time with them. To be fair, there were others in the cinema who laughed at what I didn't.Zooey Deschanel was wasted.Natalie Portman's rear end was cute.James Franco affected some weird sibilant speech impediment for reasons which escaped me.This should have been much better and the fact that it wasn't can only be attributed to McBride, whose idea of comedy (in terms of writing and performing) clearly doesn't coincide with mine.</fullReview>

It's even probably got enough going for it to be quoted by teens everywhere of a certain geekiness.All in all, this deserves to be lots of people's guilty pleasure, it's fun, funny, even exciting, it know's its genres conventions inside out, and after a season of Game of Thrones, it's even funnier....recommended as being a lampoon and a half....fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More than any other movie in recent memory "Your Highness" deserves to be judged by the values of the audience for which it was made; people who sat at home drank alcohol and smoked certain drugs and got high while watching the movie. However since I don't do that,"Your Highness" seems so amateur, almost enough to pass as a substandard offering from a struggling local amateur dramatics group. In fact I think they'd do better. This is strictly for stoners who stay at home and watch DVD's. James Franco who has saved worse movies than this, has his work cut out here and not even Natalie Portman can save it.For me Portman remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in movies, and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply. Any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast. I can only assume she either wanted a bit of fun at work after making Black Swan, or was looking to offset the dramatic (and her Oscar Winning performance) movie with a comedy or two as this and "No Strings Attached" where her post "Black Swan" movies.Danny McBride is such an unpleasant and unappealing character it is simply impossible to root for him. This guy is simply robbing a living as an actor. I have rated it 3/10 1, point a piece fr Portman and Charles Dance and a further point for the enjoyment the audience it's made for, will no doubt get out of it.Unless you are the target audience. Don't watch it, give it a miss. Avoid it like the plague. Tell your friends to pass it by. With the exception of Portman, the acting is bad, bad, bad (Franco included)</fullReview>

Little pieces from "Jason and the Argonauts" and "Pirates of the Caribbean". There is a fairy land with princes, princesses, dwarfs, fairy creatures and of course a labyrinth.This type of movies are well used like a ladder from most of the actors to a new fantasy movies with bigger budget.

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this. I grew up on films like Willow, Krull, Princess Bride, so a return to 80's fantasy amidst all this Lord of the Rings Harry Potter stuff was exciting. What this movie failed to do was gel as both a comedy and a fantasy. None of the humor derives from the genre. This is no Blazing Saddles, Airplane, or Black Dynamite. It's just a fantasy movie with some stoners in it. We have two jokes. One, where people swear, because people shouldn't swear in ye old days. And 2, penises. The amount of jokes revolving around cocks is incredible. I'm sure it's a world record. One character doesn't have a penis, another takes one as a trophy, and the price for valuable information from a wizard is to rub his penis. Great actors like Dance, Lewis, and Jones are not used for comedy, instead they seem out of place acting so seriously. The effects and sets are brilliant, as are the costumes. This is why I'm so sad, because it looked like such a well produced fantasy movie. All the great jokes are in the trailer. Entertaining as a fast paced action fantasy, but a complete misfire as a comedy.</fullReview>

If they did, they'd likely be commissioning an inordinate amount of half-baked commemorative coins.Unfortunately, the pampered prince in this comedy does partake in pot, and other pleasantries.When the warrior prince Fabious (James Franco) returns home with the prized princess, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), in his arms, his shiftless brother Thadeous (Danny McBride) is jealous.But when a sorcerer (Justin Theroux) snatches Fabious' fiancée for one of his sinister schemes, Thadeous must prove his worth to his father by joining his brother's rescue campaign.En route, they encounter a number of perils, including a female warrior (Natalie Portman), whom Thadeous takes a shine to.Touted as a stoner-comedy, Your Highness' smoke clears pretty quickly, leaving only a vaguely funny, slightly disturbing, Fantasy fetish-film in its stead.Besides, getting the munchies in medieval times does not sound appetizing.

There are two princes in a castle. One of the princes is a hero (Franco) and the others a loser (Mcbride). The loser is jealous of his brother fame so he agrees to go on a quest with his brother to prove himself.This movie is very lame. The story is ridiculous and there is not even any comedy in it?

I watched this movie with my high school aged son and I think I may have chuckled even bit more than he did. "Your Highness" has good production values and contains good actors. That gets it three stars. I gave it the fourth because the story, such as it was, was THAT bad...and it had some gratuitous boobies which is ALWAYS good for an extra star in my book. But apart from those few redeeming features, the movie fails as much of an entertainment piece. I found it to be merely crude for the sake of being crude with little or no actual "humour" of which to speak. I can appreciate vulgarity, but in this case it just didn't seem to have any relevance that made it contextually funny. Low-brow humour, I can understand, but this brow is SO low, it's more high-pubic hair than low-brow. (now THAT is good, crude humour) "History of the World" this is not; nor even "Spaceballs." I would not even put it on par with "Men in Tights." It--just--isn't--funny. There are no memorable moments and no lingering memories that this movie will cause to be relived once the credits finish and the screen goes dark.On the plus side, the alternative was to spend my Sunday afternoon doing dishes and laundry. Watching this movie at least postponed that pain, although it replaced with a pain of its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director David Gordon Green goes all out to bury his dramatic film past with this silly and aggressively stupid fantasy comedy. Not nearly as awful as its reputation, but not very funny either. It doesn't try very hard in the filmmaking department, except trying to be as rude as possible with the requisite dick jokes and gross out immaturity. A mechanical bird provides more laughs than McBride who just doesn't work very well as the lead with this character and that's where the problems of this film start and end - all with McBride. This is the kind of character that should have been 4th or 5th billing and provide some vulgar, slacker comic relief but there's too little to the character to want to follow this oaf for the entire film. The most hilarious thing associated with this film is that David Gordon Green's first draft of the film required a $150m budget, but clearly settled for slapdash effects and a make it all up as we go along vibe. It's certainly watchable and more odd than funny, but if Green was more disciplined while shooting, this could have been a better film.</fullReview>

Maybe I just like Danny McBride enough that the script becomes less important, but I enjoy the humor in this movie. I don't have a problem with any of the performances--I like Natalie, I like the dude that plays Lezar and his mothers, I like Marteetee--I like it all. It feels like a fully formed adventure. Some might categorize it as stoner humor, and the pot jokes are pretty pervasive, but that didn't bother me either. So it's become one of my favorites, and all I can say is that humor is subjective. I found a movie that is almost universally hated for its stupidity, and somehow it ended up working for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness (2011) ** (out of 4)When the great warrior Fabious (James Franco) has his fiancé (Zooey Deschanel) stolen by an evil warlock, his dimwitted and lazy brother Thadeous (Danny McBride) joins him on the journey to try and rescue her. Along the way they meet up with a rebel (Natalie Portman) who is after the same person. YOUR HIGHNESS and its reputation as one of the worst movies of the year is highly exaggerated because while the film isn't a good one I think it's far from being horrid and certainly no where near one of the worst of the year. With that said, considering the cast you really can't help but be somewhat disappointed that the movie doesn't offer more in terms of laughs. I think the majority of the first hour is very hit and miss in regards to the laughs. Yes, the comedy is very silly and juvenile and the only think really lacking are fart jokes. I mean what can you really say about a film when it starts off with the loser brother about to be executed for "loving" a dwarf too much? There's quite a bit of sexual humor from start to finish and the best and funniest moment of the film deals with a perverted wise man who wants extra favors for his advice. I won't ruin how the scene plays out but it was pretty funny. The rest of the laughs just don't happen fast enough to make the film worth sitting through. For every joke that works there are probably five or more that don't. The most shocking thing about this movie is that they were able to bring so many well-known actors to the project. I'm not sure if everyone was friends but I have a hard time seeing what someone like Portman would see in a movie like this and especially since her role doesn't come into play until around the 45-minute mark and there's really not too much here for her to do. She, Franco and Deschanel are all game for the jokes but they still can't save the thing. I really wasn't overly impressed with McBride as his dry humor just didn't reach my funny bone. With that said, I'm sure those who enjoy the types of movies this thing is spoofing might find more in the humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness, the story of two princes who quest to save one of their stolen wives, was a laughable movie. I was expecting this film to be mildly funny and as well mildly boring. The major theme behind the film was a to portray the classic fifteenth century, adding swear words and themes from the twentieth century. I was very excited to see the duo back in action (James Franco and Danny McBride) since pineapple express in which I enjoyed very much, they definitely forced some laughs out of me, but not enough worth watching this film. Danny McBride is the one who really carries this film, his southern American accent, made English is actually a treat to listen to, McBride always manages to bring something unique too the characters he plays. Your Highness is a film I would only recommend to 'stoners', it has its moments, but while watching it, it bring all the aspects of a stoner film. Not the worst movie, it is definitely watchable but its not a hit in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Your Highness" was somewhat of a mixture between classical sword-wielding tales, fantasy and comedy. But wait haven't this been done before? Can you say "Robin Hood: Men in Tights"? If you are familiar with that movie, then you will know what kind of a movie you are in for here, except that it is nowhere near as fun as "Robin Hood: Men in Tights".The production of "Your Highness" was good, lots of really nice details in everything, especially the costumes and outfits. I loved that about the movie, they had really captured that medieval-romantic feel and brought it alive on the screen. And the effects of the movie were great as well, both actual effects and CGI effects. And there was a good amount of interesting characters and villains in the movie.Now, what didn't work for the movie, was the lack of comedy. I didn't laugh a single time throughout the entire movie, which is odd when it is a labeled as a comedy. And one thing that really brought the movie down in the soil was the excessive use of foul language and jokes below the belt. I was so annoyed and fed up with the usage of the F-word and other inappropriate language. I am not a prude, nor am I easily offended, but in a movie set in the medieval times, get your act together and use proper language. The movie could have been much more enjoyable had they toned down on the foul language. So be warned, this movie has a lot of words and sentences that may not be suitable for all viewers.The cast in "Your Highness" was good as well, although I can't claim to be a fan of anyone in the movie, I must say that they actually did the job well. However, I wasn't overly impressed with Danny McBride's performance, something about him just annoys me. The ones that did it the best were Damian Lewis (playing Boremont) and Charles Dance (playing King Tallious).All in all, the movie wasn't a bore, it was just brought down by foul language and too many sex jokes. Seems that whomever was behind the writers desk hadn't gotten over puberty just yet. It was way too immature. Sure the movie is good for a single evening when you are bored or if nurturing a hang-over, but other than that, don't get your hopes up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, the choices Natalie Portman makes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard about the stoner comedy Your Highness a year ago, I thought it sounded promising. I realize that I am behind everybody else(or, hopefully, not many people) but I just watched it a few nights ago. And to be honest, I don't know where to even begin.Set in the meddle ages, the film revolves around a dumb prince(Danny Mcbride) who is asked by his popular brother(James Franco) to accompany him on a quest to save his fiancé(Zooey Deschanel) and kill the czar(Justin Theroux) that kidnapped her. Along the way, they encounter a woman(Natalie Portman) who is also set out for revenge on the same guy.The film is from director David Gordon Green, who's career has gone in an odd direction(his first film was the indie drama Snow Angels). Following Snow angels, he directed Pineapple express, which was a freshly funny action comedy. And now he's concocted this.I heard that Your highness was terrible, but I really had a hard time believing it. It sounded promising. But I think that the real horror is experiencing the film for yourself, to see that letdown. Your highness is a complete disaster.I expected to laugh a little bit, but I don't think I ever laughed, at all. The jokes fall flat, and they are repetitive and obvious. When Mcbride says to Portman,"Do you feel a prick on your back?", I rolled my eyes, and you will too.The whole film is a bloodbath. Its not like that was even funny. Portman's character is really quite pointless, and the relationship between her and McBride is stupid. After she did Black swan(her best performance), did she feel that she had to jump on board to every movie she could? I love her, she's hot, and a great actress, but she needs to stop taking swings at piles of crap(not that Thor, No strings attached, and The Other woman were crap, they just weren't Black swan; Thor was good though).Anyways, back to topic. The air flies out of the balloon way too fast. What should've been stoner-fied fun just turns out to be a bad trip you don't want to take. If I was to find one pro, it would be Justin Theroux. Theroux, who wrote Tropic thunder, is slowly making a name for himself, and he should. But trust me, Your highness was the wrong choice.D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most foul and not very funny, could've been worse, but still lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'd think Hollywood would have given up on swords and sorcery by now judging from all the failures outside of Lord of the Rings. Your Highness, is pretty much a film for the lobotomized. Rather than being a movie with jokes, this is a movie that IS a joke. A few half hearted laughs are scattered across a hundred minutes of false acting, failed quirks, obnoxious bathroom humour, and special effects which look like something from twenty years ago. At times, Your Highness feels like Epic Movie without the parodies of other movies.Danny McBride is a huge burden on the project. He is quite defective as a screenwriter and an actor. His approach to his character is way too sour spirited and his delivery is lame. Second billing goes to James Franco, playing Bing Crosy to McBride's Bob Hope (the strait man). I felt he was too strait, and his English accent is barely passable (to be generous). Natalie Portman is a more enjoyable addition to the show, although she's not very funny either.Most of the jokes not only fall flat, but almost insult intelligence. Your Highness is the kind of movie that might be funnier if watched while drunk, as it is overstuffed with misplaced sex jokes and contemporary uses of the f-word. Curiously the only area where the movie works is during the fight sequences, they are adequately choreographed and are the least juvenile parts of the movie. What Your Highness needs more than anything else is brains. The makers weren't really thinking very hard about anything. In the end, it's another film that looks more fun to make than to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfunny and so boring I think I fell asleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer for this film a few months ago I was really looking forward to the films release, I enjoyed Pineapple Express and was hoping for more of the same from Your Highness. There are plenty of good actors in the film and the premise and setting all had potential, setting it during the medieval period inevitably makes you think of Monty Python and the Holy Grail and unfortunately this film never comes remotely close to the brilliance of Python's medieval comic masterpiece. Danny McBride plays the same character he always plays, only this time with a bad English accent, the character doesn't work in this film at all and for me McBride has worn the character out, he brings nothing new and didn't once make me laugh during the film. James Franco isn't bad but he isn't great either and Natalie Portman's role could have been played by any actress, she add nothing to the role other than a nice backside in her very brief semi nude scene. I can't recall the last time I fell asleep during a film but around the 60 minute mark I think I dropped off for a couple of minutes, not a good sign when watching any film let alone a comedy. The bulk of the jokes weren't so much jokes as merely swear words, in medieval epics of years gone by swearing doesn't really feature and so the the screenwriters(McBride) seem to think that by simply swearing the audience will find it funny, the first time they do this it raises a smile but after 10mins it becomes more annoying than funny and just feels lazy. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, if anyone asks I'll tell them to re-watch The Holy Grail, at least they'll get a laugh out of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a good movie, mostly because the jokes don't land very often. There's a lot of gross, disgusting stuff that's probably supposed to be funny, but which never seems to be tied into a joke. The production looks cheap and ugly, and the special effects are garish. I think that's supposed to be part of the joke, but it's more unpleasant than funny.The cast is almost a super group of cool young Hollywood actors: James Franco, Natalie Portman, and Zooey Deschanel. I don't know what they were thinking. I'm not proud of this but I like to think that they thought that they were so fabulous that their presence would redeem the film, and then fell on their faces. I doubt that's true, but pretending that it is allows the film to function on the level of schadenfreude. And that's pretty much the only way this thing is going to work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness had potential to be the Airplane! of fantasy films, but instead, it takes a detour down the road of recycled jokes, lame characters, and so much abuse on foul language it wears paper-thin after a while. All four leads, known for some very famous work in the field of film, give mediocre to abysmal performances as if "Oscar Winner" or "Oscar Nominee" in front of their name meant nothing.How did David Gordon Green, the director of some great independent films in his early years, manage to pull himself together and do a project with narrow-minded characters and lackluster special effects to top it off. This is a seriously confused movie that can't decipher whether it wants to be a satire on fantasy films such as The Lord of the Rings, or if it wants to do its own thing.It reminds me of a softcore Skinemax film I watched called The Lord of the G-Strings: The Femaleship of the String. Its got awkward special effects and lame acting, but it also has its share of pointless, gratuitous nude scenes that have no purpose other than to showcase nudity. It almost seems this was a contest to, not only make a bad film, but to make a bad film with large amounts of nudity.The plot is simple, because I suspect if it was any thicker than the thought-process behind this it would confuse itself to the point of senseless scenes piled one after another. It involves a mid-evil village where Fadious (Franco) has just returned home from a battle, and is about to marry a woman he met named Belladonna (Deschanel). Fadious's brother Thadeous (McBride) is jealous and resentful of his older brother, but somehow is chosen to be the best man at his wedding. Thadeous winds up ditching the wedding, and before we know it, an evil whatchamacallit has stolen Belladonna and now they have to get her back.Along the way, they meet the beautiful Isabel (Portman) who is obviously a Xena clone. Isabella is seeking revenge for her father's murder, and happens to be going in the same direction as the boys. She tags along, and now we have a gang of numbskulls, and a women, on this quest.You'll notice that during the course of Your Highness, women have no purpose in this film other than to fill a character position. Unlike the men, not very well developed but we learn more about them as time goes on, the women in this film have no character. Zooey Deschanel and Natalie Portman's characters are just the women units in the film. The Belladonna character is so undeveloped it's an anomaly of film characters. The man's role in this film; to be seemingly strong, resemble utter stupidity, and walk forward and fall into traps. The woman's role; show up, show off cleavage, wear a metal thong, or a red dress. Done.I've read that all the actors had to work with is an outline written by Green and McBride, and most of the dialog is improvised. I enjoy improvising. I've seen various clips of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and improved or not, it's funny. This is a mess. The characters are struggling to keep thoughts coming out of their mouths. When they realize they can't think of anything to say, they spit random obscenities hoping to get a laugh. That's funny.Your Highness fails greatly in the special effects department too. After excruciatingly lengthy dialog scenes we get a special effects orgasm or a fight between the opposing sides. When in doubt, throw in chaos is the new rule in action/fantasy movies. Maybe if these battles had been more about making fun of the fantasy film clichés rather than showcasing an awful lot of pyrotechnics they would've been funnier.This is nothing but a severe mess of filmmaking. Especially by a director of Green's caliber. I respect his choice to move on with a farce film. But farce films work when you have a funny slapstick character or group. Like Chris Farley or The Three Stooges. Maybe the joke is we have four actors, doing the very best they can with the thin material they have to work with. And no script either. If that is the joke, I got it. But it isn't funny.Starring: James Franco, Danny McBride, Zooey Deschanel, and Natalie Portman. Directed by: David Gordon Green.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a bad night for cable: something with Tom Hanks, an episode of "The Newsroom" we'd already seen three times and some kind of sword-and-sorcery spoof put together by David Gordon Green and his old film-school bud Danny McBride, of HBO's "Eastbound and Down." The ramshackle plot concerns Prince Thadeous (McBride), the mullethead dufus brother of the valorous Prince Fabious (James Franco), whose bride (Zooey Deschanel) has been abducted by an evil wizard (a goofily androgynous Justin Theroux); Thadeous hopes to opt out of the ensuing quest, but is ordered to tag along by their exasperated father (Charles Dance, of "Game of Thrones," not exactly playing against type). The movie starts out with a pretty good gag about a hanging in the dwarf kingdom and works its way down from there; the sex and weed jokes almost make up in quantity for what they lack in quality, and the relationship between the brothers?F's unconditional love slowly wearing down T's sullen resentment?keeps things moving along. Zooey D. doesn't have much to do, though I liked her little adorkable dance moves at the wedding feast. Natalie Portman turns up as a bloodthirsty woman warrior; in a brief skinnydipping scene she appears to be wearing nothing but a solid silver thong, and alert medievalists will know immediately what that's all about. I won't be putting the disk in my Netflix queue (even though the "unrated" version contains additional naughty bits not shown on TV), but if it turns up on cable again, I'd still recommend it, cautiously, to fans of nobrow stoner comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The extraordinarily unfunny Your Highness wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. Sure, it sucked back?and I caution on using harsh language so not to be a hypocrite.For, that was a big problem with the movie: the filthy cursing. I'm no prude. Not?in?any?fashion. But, the overuse of the F-bomb, amongst many other profanity used, was simply lazy writing. It wasn't funny, clever or needed. In fact, it was just plain stupid when I heard them use the 'F' word for the 167th time.I'm not even going to honor this film with a full-length review. Suffice to say, it's not the worst period-piece, swords &amp; dames adventure ? Year One is far worse than this ? but it's pretty sad when not ONE SINGLE LAUGH comes from a "comedy."At least, Year One had Michael Cera to entertain us?this had no one great. In fact, I can only think of two characters to mention that (BARELY) rose above the rest: Isabel, played by the almost always awful Natalie Portman, who was a tiny bit fun because she's a she kicking butt and a creature by the name of "Steven" and that reason should go without saying.This movie would be best suited for those under 3 and find the homophobic humor of yesteryears funny. Heck, half of it's not even homophobic as it's about incest. And it's for people who thought: Hey! James Franco did such an AWESOME job at the Oscars, he must be good in everything.I realize now I'm going off in many tangents, like this movie itself, but another thing this movie p|ssed me off about is Danny McBride, someone I've defended until late. 30 Minutes or Less was just plain awful, this one was actually WORSE. If these two movies were my only impression of him, I would've surely given up on him before I saw his previously, more hilarious roles.To sum this horribly UNFUNNY and UNIMAGINATIVE comedy up: It just makes me miss the masterpiece The Princess Bride is. Skip this sad excuse of a movie, or if you must see it, wait for the local network TV premiere where it's edited for language making it a grand total of a 22-minute movie. Though, even that seems too long of a time wasted on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness is not a top notch comedy, but it does provide a few funny moments. This movie is nothing more than a typical blockbuster comedy, but any Natalie Portman fan will be glad to see her take yet another action heroine role. The obvious scenes that play to men's desire for her are somewhat comedic in and of themselves. The combination of bad CGI and horrible acting by Danny McBride is only tempered by the James Franco portrayal of naive optimism. If you're looking for a crude comedy, there are far better movies out there like the American Pie series or an Adam Sandler movie. Still, Your Highness is watchable if only to see Natalie Portman poke fun at herself like in the popular SNL video.</fullReview>

There was no wit on display at all; anybody could have written what passed for the script, and that was just on the rare occasions that they could actually be bothered to use one.When all of the intended comedic parts belong in the same format, then it quickly gets boring for somebody on the lookout for a spot of ingenuity.It's more like a cheap home movie with people goofing off, than a fully-fledged movie... If you find the amateur quality endearing, then I suppose you might get a kick out of it, but with all the money that's spent on movies these days, I just wish they'd put in a bit more effort to have it feel less like a filmed rehearsal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a movie with an odd approach that was seemingly destined to either be a stroke of genius or absolute drivel. Well, it somehow ended up falling somewhere in between, but unfortunately probably more on the drivel side.I have absolutely no problem with cussing, with nudity, with disgusting jokes, with any of it. Many of my favorite comedies feature those factors. But they also feature jokes that work, consistent quirky performances, and most of all superior writing and comedic timing. This movie had none of the above. It was a little frustrating to watch really, as every 10 minutes or so they would get it right, hit a chord, and have an often disgustingly funny moment. But in between those moments the attempts at comedy were positively hamhanded. The timing was off, people were really trying too hard, when they did get something funny in there they could never just let it be funny, they had to trample all over it, and there were long stretches where apparently we were supposed to keep on laughing because a knight used the f-word for the 200th time. There were just enough funny moments spaced in there to keep on watching it through to the end. But there were a lot of painfully unfunny moments too, and really, it should have been better.</fullReview>

Speaking of, it definitely shares a lot of characteristics with Pineapple Express, though I feel Pineapple Express is better executed with better acting. But then again, Your Highness provides us with views of topless forest dwellers and Natalie Portman's behind as she jumps into a pool of water.Obviously not a movie to be taken seriously, so sit back, enjoy and have some cheap laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I watched this movie last night and both really liked it. I love McBride, Portman, and Franco, not in that order. As the movie was written by Danny McBride, his character fits perfectly into his comedic styling. I agree with the person who said that this will eventually be a cult movie. It has everything a fantasy/adventure person could ask for; trolls, magic, and raunchy sex jokes. Franco and Portman fill their roles perfectly. Franco has already demonstrated his comedic chops in Pineapple Express, and Portman delivers her performance just as well, while maintaining her adorable/sexy persona. I will definitely watch this movie again. I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh, you won't be disappointed. Boom!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wont dwell on the story because it's pretty straight forward, like what the trailer shows. I enjoyed this movie a lot. It got me laughing from start to finish. I think people have to understand what kind of movie this is lest they get disappointed. This movie was never meant to be deep, to have any important message. All it aimed to do it to make people laugh with crude humor, and it did that very well. So if you are looking for something that is not "shallow", you will hate this but if you just want a movie to crack you up and are not offended by drug use, sexual humor and blatant use of vulgarities, you will definitely have a good time watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>102 minutes of horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some time now I've made it a rule not to watch comedies because experience has taught me that in 95% of the cases they are medium to plain bad. So, in spite of my better judgment I went to some friends to see this movie.I will admit, it had some funny moments , but all in all it was just grotesque. There was virtually no moment in this movie when you wouldn't have to hear a sexual reference. I think this is the only way McBride and Ben Best could make their little brains think of a way to fill 102 minutes worth of script. James Franco and Natalie Portman , why oh why?James Franco just started to be recognized and get some praise, Natalie Portman won a Oscar, why would they possibly associate their name with this? I don't even know what was worse, the fact that they accepted to go along with this stupidity or the fact that they actually took their roles seriously.Conclusion : Do not waste your money on this, and most importantly , don't waste your time on this. It has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a Prince's bride is kidnapped, he goes on a quest to rescue her... accompanied by his lazy useless brother.One persons 'so bad, it's good' is another persons pain. However, where as Disaster Movie, Superhero Movie and Meet The Spartans to name a few are poor spoof parodies Your Highness is leagues above in all aspects and creates it's own world. The production values are up there with Naked Gun, Space Balls, Austin Powers and Year One with the on location feel reminiscent of Monty Pythons Holy Grail.It's crude it's rude, it's politically incorrect - with dick, sheep, vagina, gay gags and jokes galore but it's daft and arguably unoffensive as it's simply stupid fun.&nbsp;The heavy weighted cast including Charles Dance, James Franco, Natalie Portman all appear to be having a good time amongst the Hydra, Minotaur, wizards, witches and midgets. There's fine special effects, metal sidekick birds, monsters, guts, blood and sorcery. But it's draw is the adventure -&nbsp;magic compasses, sword fights, brotherly tough love, sweeping landscapes, forests and castles.Best described as a dirty Princess Bride mixed with RobinHood.&nbsp;In Your Highness case there possibly was a missed opportunity for a fun fantasy adventure in the vein of Sinbad, Conan the Destroyer, Krull and so on. That aside, with a pinch of salt watched in the right frame of mind Highness is an epic comedy adventure set in a fantastical world, ultimately it is what it is, and it's honesty is what makes it worth seeing. It's good crap, make of that what you will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's simply not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main reason why this movie fails in every way, is the fact that on the one side this film wants to be a serious fantasy-action-movie. On the other side you have dull humor that is circling sex, genitals and drugs all the time. After ten minutes the whole thing has imploded completely. I won't spoil anything but I will give you three examples with Lord of the Rings coupled with the humor of this shitty film. That will complete the picture:- Frodo and Gandalf meet each other after a long time: "Hi, Gandalf" "Hi, Frodo, I'm horny as hell will you do me a favor and smack my salami"- Deep down in Moria Gandalf fights with the Balrog:Balrog says: "It's been centuries that I f***** someone. Bent over, Bitch I want to f*** your ass!"- Gimli meets Galadriel for the first time: "Whoah! What a pleasant sight, madame. At the moment I have a serious fungal infestation on my c*** from my last gang-bang. But that doesn't matter, I want to bonk you right now.Vicarious embarrassment on an unbelievable high level with this garbage of a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1) You think it may be funny2) You want to see Natalie Portman wearing no clothesHere's why you shouldn't:1) It's not funny. Not just not 'laugh-out-loud' funny, it doesn't raise a smirk. There exists no swear word on earth that I believe cannot be used to great effect in the appropriate setting. However, swearing in this film just jars. It is used without consistency, presumably due to the 'improvisational nature of the performance'. If that's the case then that's poor direction, on set and esp. in editing.2) It's the briefest of brief glimpses of what may be a semi-naked Ms Portman. Not enough for the most frustrated viewer to be titillated by (if that's your reason for viewing). If that's your motivation try 'The Darjeeling Limited (Hotel Chevalier)' or 'Closer'. Neither of those films is without fault but at least they have some content.I gave this film 1 extra mark (making 2) for the single original idea I observed: The 'hand-in-the-cauldron-that-came-out-of-the-ground-as-a- beastie' effect was one I hadn't seen before and was quite clever. Pat on the back for whoever thought of that. The rest of you - go home and think carefully about what you've done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness is a comical tale of two young brothers, one who is noble and heroic, the other who does nothing and complains. Together they must go on a quest to rescue the heroic brother's soon to be wife from an evil sorcerer. On their journey they meet a young woman who is on a quest of her own, they decide to team up.Your Highness is unfortunately a one joke film stretched to a feature length oddity. The idea of a film about the middle ages, while throwing in sex jokes and foul language was funny in the trailer, the actual film is not. The problem is that the trailer was just the right length for this type of material. The thin joke gets tired very fast and the film ends up not being funny for 3/4 of the running time. It's a shame too because it attracted such talent. Danny McBride is usually one of the funniest characters in whatever film he is doing. Tropic Thunder and Pineapple Express, he managed to be hilarious without stealing the show. That is very hard to do. He's finally given the chance to lead a film and he drops the ball. He was nowhere near as crude as he could have or should have been. He co-wrote the screenplay, which might lend a hand in the film's problem. Apparently most of it was ad-libbed. So whatever they thought was funny at the time made it into the final film. Word to the wise next time, have jokes on paper first, then do the ad-libbing.James Franco is the straight man here, if there is such a character in such a ridiculous film. He's oblivious to many things, he has one thing on his mind the entire time. He must save his bride to be before she is deflowered by the sorcerer. Apparently she is a virgin and if the sorcerer has sex with her when the two moons unite, she will bare a dragon. As far as quest films go, this one seems rather preoccupied with unfunny jokes than anything adventure like.If you want to see it because of Natalie Portman and the famous scene with her thong, I would suggest sticking to the red band trailer, because it shows everything that's in the film. That trailer is funnier and sexier than this film is. You get the jokes, you get the skin and you're done. You don't have to sit through 90 plus minutes of boring schlock. I managed to chuckle a few times, it is a comedy after all. Your Highness manages to set the bar very low for comedies. This time the critics actually got it right. Skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been waiting and waiting to see this movie since watching the previews on TV. I was not disappointed. The story line, though very cliché, was very well told with some very well written puns and slapstick which never got out of hand. Great special effects and set designs. and marvellous acting on everyone parts... However, I saw the Unrated version which I am hoping was toned down for a paying audience. Granted this movie was eventually rated R I believe, but we know that small kids seem to get in anyway and our society really doesn't care. In my honest opinion this is not a family film as it appeared on the TV teasers. I talk like rusty sailor sometimes and can utilize every version of an F word to perfection, but it still embarrasses me when a movie has to resort to using language like this as the catalyst for a laugh. The movie could have held up on its own without all the sophomoric potty mouth jokes, the drawings and other visual aids. I say re-film this, using the same great talent that is in the movie and see if they could make a joke work without adding slang named body parts or normal body functions into the mix. Don't get me wrong, I do recommend you do see it as it is quite funny, but just be prepared for some gratuitous drops in intelligent script writing and loss of a better word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not very satisfactory comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It might be due to a lack of "experience" that I generally don't find the "stoner" humor (the humor oriented to the drug consumers, particularly the ones who smoke marijuana) very satisfactory. I didn't dislike films such as Pineapple Express and Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, but I felt the fact that I was losing an essential part of the comedy while I was watching them...or the problem might be the fact that they were designed to be watched on an altered state of conscience, and that's the only way in which one can feel totally satisfied with them. Anyway, the point is that I wasn't very interested in watching Your Highness, even though I had some curiosity because I had heard that it combined humor and heroic fantasy. Would it be a spiritual successor of Monty Python and the Holy Grail? Or would it be a light version of The Lord of the Rings filtered through a thick cloud of "ganja"? It's easy to note the effort made by co-screenwriters Danny McBride and Ben Best in Your Highness in order to combine such different genres with each other; however, I could constantly feel the touch of incompatible elements which "took me out" of the narrative due to their inescapable incongruence. So, when we start to get moderately interested in the heroic fantasy...it's suddenly interrupted by some anachronistic line of dialog which destroys the illusion and stops the flow of the narrative. In other occasions, I was occasionally laughing moderately with the "stoner" aspect and the contemporary jokes...until we suddenly go back to the heroic fantasy, derailing the humor and forcedly making us go back to the pseudo-medieval "reality" of the film. I suppose that some people might consider that contrast between styles part of the comedy, and they might find them funny. But it honestly didn't work very well to me, and I would have preferred something more exaggerated in both extremes, instead of this unstable combination of ingredients which shouldn't have been combined with each other.Nevertheless, I can't deny that Your Highness occasionally made me laugh moderately, and that I liked the occasional satire to the clichés of heroic fantasy. And then, we also have the competent performances from McBride and James Franco in the leading roles, who both make the love/hate balance between their characters totally credible. The rest of the characters are quite uni-dimensional; for example, the villain never looks genuinely threatening, but just a minor obstacle destined to the failure. On the feminine side, Zooey Deschanel doesn't have too much to do, because she interprets the generic damsel in danger. And then we have the great Natalie Portman, who brings a predictably solid performance in her role, despite her character not being very well written.So, Your Highness isn't an extra-official sequel of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, nor a psychedelic version of The Lord of the Rings, but a mediocre hybrid of two styles which shouldn't have been combined with each other. Nevertheless, Your Highness didn't bore me, and I had a moderately good time while I was watching it, so I can slightly recommend it despite not being a very good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very bad movie, with lots of dumb and unfunny humor.The main problem of this movie is that it tries to be a parody of the common archetypes from several fantasy flicks (Such as Star Wars, Clash of the Titans and the Lord of the Rings") but instead of being a good parody of those archetypes (like The Princess Bride or Stardust) it is a dumb comedy filled with many tasteless jokes that aren't fun at all.Actually, it feels more like a frat comedy (Such as the terrible film "The Hangover") disguised as a fantasy film. That's why this movie doesn't work at all. The bad jokes from frat comedies aren't funny at all and are very stupid.If you want to see a goo fantasy film with lots of comedy, then see movies such as "The Princess Bride" and "Stardust" and avoid this one.</fullReview>

There is a robotic bird in this that reminds me of a sad excuse of another bird in "Return To Oz" years ago which was the worst film I have ever seen.Her Highness comes close. I can see wasted money on this production.The story is a Misha Moshe of bloody unlikely people trying to throw a party without anything to party with.

Just because Natalie Portman is in it, doesn't mean you're going to see an Oscar worthy film. Your Highness accomplishes what it meant to do which was to be a raunchy "stoner" comedy. Although, it's pegged as a "stoner" comedy, you really don't have to be a "stoner" to have some laughs. And really, just lighten up, turn your brain off, and have some laughs. Yes, it IS funny hearing the "F" word being said during medieval times. That being said however, I do feel that the movie did fall short in certain areas. It COULD HAVE been funnier. Some jokes just felt like recycled jokes from earlier on in the film. Also, James Franco was definitely underutilized. Although he was supposed to be the dashing prince, he could have been funny while doing so. In the end, if you actually paid money to go see this, you can't b!tch about it sucking.

		<shortDescription>A huge disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Danny McBride, and I've enjoyed his performances in many films and particularly in Eastbound And Down. Yes, he does tend to shout and swear a lot, but that's not what makes him funny. Kenny Powers is funny because he's completely deluded and the situations he finds himself in, while not necessarily immediately familiar, do at least relate to some of the self-doubt and loss of influence that many of us feel at some time in our lives. Sadly, none of this is true of Thadeous, his character in Your Highness. It's true he shares the same kind of childish, self-centred delusions, but there's nothing you can identify with. He lives in a fantasy world of swords and magic, but swears like a New York cab driver - with an English accent. That, apparently, is supposed to be funny. It's not. Which is a bit of problem, because it's pretty much the only joke in the whole film, repeated over and over again. At least it was up until about half way through, when I gave up and switched it off. The only other time I've done that was when trying to watch The Spirit. In spite of not finishing the film, however, I'm confident I missed nothing good. Your Highness is simply awful, and fails on every level. The only link I can see to the genius of Kenny Powers is that this movie is like the kind of thing he'd probably come up with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey hey, my first review. I went and saw this travesty for two reasons: It looked so bad I figured it had to be good. I mean who would spend $50 million to make something that looks that stupid w/out having a few tricks up their sleeve? There were positive reviews. In retrospect, I should've remembered that there's a lot of morons out there, and they all have opinions. Secondly, I had nothing else to do that day. Unfortunately, I talked someone into going w/me and have to bear the guilt from that for the rest of my life. There's good people in this movie. Natalie Portman....lost a bet maybe? I can't comprehend why she's in this. I mean she did Star Wars and that was bad enough. I don't know. Damien Lewis is a fairly respectable actor. I don't get that one either. I think it was probably a lot of fun to make, but that's it. They should've kept it hidden, like a hit and run or a war crime or something. We walked out w/approximately 10mins left. We would've left sooner but I'd paid for the tickets so I held on a little longer. The whole scene w/the Minotaur's junk was about the last straw. I laughed twice during the whole movie. I can't remember what the first thing was. Nothing too funny. At one point someone catches a little tinkerbell faerie thing, crushes it up and snorts it. I laughed at that, but I used to do a lot of drugs. And that was it. I wasn't offended by anything in it, aside from the general offense to my sensibilities. It just sucked. Really, really bad. Not in a "so bad it's good" way either. Past that, way past that. Don't do it. Other reviews have covered all the myriad reasons not to go see this. It's not funny. I'm generally a pretty clever sort and prefer smart, dark humor. I'm also capable of laughing at a retarded kid getting hit w/a blunt object if the timings right. This movie, however....nope.

		<fullReview>Okay, I can understand why people mayn't like this film, the story while simple and often charming is also predictable and daft and the gags are on the puerile and lowbrow side. The script however while going overboard perhaps with the expletives is very funny and perhaps quotable. It is a well made movie, with good cinematography, clean and colourful sets and costumes that look more than fancy dress. The characters are engaging and charming particularly Deschannel's character. The cast are terrific, Danny McBride looks clearly comfortable and Zooey Deschannel is also in an ideal role. Natalie Portman is both sexy and feisty, Justin Thereaux nearly steals the show and Charles Dance and Toby Jones are a delight to watch. Overall, not for everybody but while not the best of the year I can think of much worse ways to spend your time. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's talk about characters in film, the stereotypical cookie cut-outs which all make a film familiar and some to relate to. And then comes the antagonist, the evil doer that foils all good in the world. Then comes the people in between. The fillers that leads the protagonist to its goal who may or may not be thanked for or some worse fate do befall onto them as scape goats or even valid to death at the mercy of try to be a hero. Sad isn't it? I do feel for them underdogs. working their butts off just to help. Oh wait i feel for all but of one kind. The annoying funny guy that lightens the mood of a serious scenario. Much like Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars or the fat dude (Zach Galifianakis) from the Hang Over, these are the people who you just wanna smash their teeth in but you can't because you're a good guy and people don't expect you to do these kind of violent nature but if there was a chance, I'll jump at the moment. But, Your Highness stepped it up even further. helming in the steps of films like Step Brothers, Pineapple Express and such, the annoyance just got the lead role. And that lead role goes to Danny McBride.I'll have to admit, while watching the most anticipated film i have been waiting for ages, seating with my friend in the darkened hall, this trailer of medieval times came on and spewed profanity in my ears with the vision of Danny, I was totally put off. I whispered to my right and said, "This looks terrible. It's filthy and stupid, I'll never pay to watch this." A reply returned and said, "It's funny wat. I think it looks interesting". I dissed in disgust and began wide eyed as the reel exploded coming in terms to my anticipation. Forward 1 week later, a message rang on my mobile and there rolled across the screen of my certain demise. But, harsh was i to be judging a character by mere thought as superficial assumption instead of seeing it for my self and judging thee as it presents.There i was, min by min passed, what i assumed to be the confirmation of my forth hatred towards a character, the darken room among the viewers slowly warmed up to me. My statement of it being filthy and stupid still remain true but, i have to admit, it is rather charmingly funny. No, i'm not a total convert but alas my dear readers, i have learnt that one must not judge another by mere assumption and only by understanding and seeing with my own eyes will i discover it's true intent and prospect of such value. In another words, it's a pretty funny show.In a nutshell, Your Highness is modern take of a fairy tale with witches and goblins and whatnot which will incredibly throw you off balance with the dialog script which sounds like a college dorm hall. Let's do a quick story setup. Danny McBride (Thadeous) and James Franco (Fabious) are sons of the king. Fabious met and fell in love with a fair young maiden (Zooey Deschanel) while on a quest and was about to marry her when the evil sorcerer, Leezar (Justin Theroux) takes her ? setting the foundation for the driving story arc: A quest to re-rescue the fair maiden. They both go on the quest, finds and team up with warrior-babe Isabel (Natalie Portman) who has her own quest to complete.Character acting all around are tremendous as expected from the level of what the film has to offer. All were played out to that degree of awkwardness which had to be pitch perfect in comedic timing. Zooey the ever-ethereal fair maiden with a quirky twist was good as expected. Franco the knight in shining armour is as stoned much as one can deliver. Danny as mentioned as annoying as ever BUT i must say, he kept the annoyance under controlled and when i thought he was going to go over the top, he pulled back and was, dare i say, rather charming at times. and oh how can we forget wonderful Natalie Portman, whose ass kicking and warrior demure had us at hello.The story, simple. Nothing complicated. It's pretty straight forward. One can say this film is a cross between Pineapple Express and A Knights Tale who grew up and are in college, drinking beer and smoking pot and tons of dick and fart jokes. Comedy, depending on what your degree of low brow you can go, the lamest and crude are the specials of the day. Some might be offensive at times but its offensive enough that it's actually quite funny. I went in with very low expectation and expected to be offended and bored till the end but i was wrong. In the end, Your Highness is rather an entertaining slapstick fest that not for everyone. I mean where else can you find a wise old creature who will show them the way that happens to be a pervert and smokes pot? Smoking pot. Wait- a-min, the title of the film is...ah, i see what you did there.- www.moviexclusive.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a surprising one, i didn't expect it to be as funny as it was. I t isn't going to win any Oscars and wont be seen by the hoards, most people will catch it when it comes onto Sky TV or whatever county they are in, but there were many many laugh out moments which were really funny which will definitely see it do better than most, a good fun and hilarious film ! Its important to not take this film seriously as it is not meant to be taken that way the acting is sketchy as it is supposed to be so it is definitely something to watch in the background or if you are bored it will definitely put a smile on your'e face.The storyline wasn't so bad either for a film that is clearly thrown together</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I'd found out Danny McBride put on the writer's cap, I was a tad nervous. You know, I've got that women's intuition, and it was like, "Whoa, Danny. Check yourself before you wreck yourself." Naturally, I was right. Therefore, I directly blame myself for the failure of David Gordon Green's Your Highness (2011). I should have sent out a telepathic warning to whoever green-lit this pathetic excuse for entertainment. In this adventure comedy, Prince Fabious (James Franco) sets out to save his future bride, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel) whose been kidnapped by the evil wizard, Leezar (Justin Theroux). Sounds simple, right? Well, no. Thadeous (Danny McBride), the pampered, lackadaisical brother of Fabious, accompanies his fair brother on this fantastical journey. If you're thinking' trouble, you're thinking' right. Swordfights, mythical creatures, and Natalie Portman's breast's work as an all-inclusive joy for whatever demographic this flick was aiming for. But, ultimately, it's a huge disappointment. You'd think the combination of medieval timey sorts and a hint of modern- day jargon would function as 100 minutes of genuine entertainment (cough?Robinhood: Men in Tights; cough?Monty Python), but sadly, no. The jokes are forced, unoriginal, and overused. I mean, I obviously wasn't expecting a masterpiece going in, but I thought I might get in a few light chuckles. Poop and fart jokes are only funny for so long. They're usually even funnier when coming out of Danny McBride's mouth, but this time it was just a tired attempt at a comedy we've already seen over and over again. The only thing that kept me even remotely interested were James Franco's beautiful, flowing locks?what a dreamboat that guy is, am I right?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to say "your highness" isn't very witty or sly. Its very straightforward comedy is similar to titles like "Year one" or anything from Mike Meyers. a lot of humor where most people stay in character, but the main characters will occasionally break out into modern day cussing fits, much like "year one". I really fought about 50/50 with this movie, where half the time i'm laughing and the other half groaning. Role player geeks will like it overall just with the fantasy landscape and sexual references.The acting is well done, with quite a few veteran actors taking center stage. Danny McBride was very amusing in Tropic Thunder, and was a good choice for Thaddeus; a spoiled, lazy prince.Natalie of course is good in everything, whether toppling governments in schoolgirl outfits or slamming SNL actors with breakable furniture. She obviously has a good sense of humor and no pretentiousness as she will take roles from slapstick to serious.James Franco did nicely too. He acted very well but has a very distinctive face. kind of made the long flowing hair seem a bit out of place. But i can see him getting into some serious mafia or cop roles later with a serious punam like that.The one surprising point on this movie was the effects. For a risky slapstick movie, they poured decent effects into this movie, and the sets and backdrops were colorful and thought out. The creatures were cool and fun. Not sure if they did the wrap around green screen but it definitely has the feeling of a full feature film, not some cheap indie.All in, i would say this could be a cult movie later due to some choice scenes and acting, but we will probably watch it hit the $9.99 or less bins really fast. Not a must have, but definitely something sitting on the shelf next to Lord of the rings when everyone wants to see something funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness I allowed myself to be talked into going to this film by some friends. I thought, "How bad can a film be if it has Natalie Portman in it. Let's just say I won't hold it against them; or her. They didn't know either and I am telling myself that her enduring this tripe was a form of purgatory to remind Ms. Portman that even though she can win an Oscar she can still be thrust into the abyss.I am asking why a concept that sounds like it has promise can fail so miserably? And fail it did. I didn't hear a single person in the theater laugh once during the film. Remarkably, the entire script came across as almost worthy of a sophomore high school amateur night with the performances not far behind. A good deal of this film seemed to be aimed at titillating the senses of slow, unimaginative 12 year old boys. I had to search for competent acting here and came up with little to show for it.Ms. Natalie Portman at least didn't make a fool of herself, turning in a performance that seemed to be at least trying with the sparse material. She had the only good moment, no a great moment, in the film by shedding her duds and revealing a quite stunning posterior. Thank you Natalie! Charles Dance as the King was actually quite good; I suppose because he was removed from the more objectionable parts and since he's been knighted by the Queen he must know what he's doing, right? Damian Lewis, who was so riveting in Band of Brothers as Major Richard Winters, gave a spotty, somewhat credible performance. I imagined that he felt bewildered by the material and those people behind the camera kept telling him, "Go ahead man, do it this way. It'll be great!" Those people lied to him.The usually great Zooey Deschanel seemed to be spoofing the writers and directors by pretending to act badly with the material she was given. I know she was pretending because I have seen her do worlds better with seemingly little effort.James Franco came across as a bit less animated that he was at the last Academy Awards program. He must be listening to the Lindsey Lohan school of advice.Rasmus Hardiker had a badly written part but he seemed to do better with it than most of his colleagues.And Justin Theroux as the bad guy, well, he did what he could I suppose but it was a lurid, seamy, badly written part.Having mentioned all of those, I suppose I should say something about Danny McBride, who seems to be responsible for most of what appeared on screen. I could swear that I actually saw people in the theater cringe whenever he was on screen. I know I disliked every scene he was in. A lot. Most of those scenes were puerile to the point of being offensive. There is a way to effectively use material that is more on the adult side. This is perfect example of how not to do it.Each of the participants in this venture can rest easy as, having reached bottom, they have gained an example of what not to do from now on in their careers. I hope.Where do I get my money back? By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been so much better,,,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I initially saw the cast list for Your Highness it was difficult to comprehend how this movie could not be good. Both Zooey Deschanel and Natalie Portman are big favourites of mine, and with regards to especially Portman it is difficult to a find a film she has underperformed in (perhaps with the exception of No Strings Attached ? but that is another story for another day). I was also buoyed by the promise of another comedic performance from two of the main actors in the hit comedy Pineapple Express ? James Franco and Danny McBride.Unfortunately, and despite the apparently strong cast previously mentioned, Your Highness was simply a huge disappointment and most definitely did not live up the hype. Throughout the movie the jokes seemed far too pre-planned and too many of them were really trying too hard to be funny. It also became apparent rather quickly that some of the more distasteful jokes were not working and seemingly came across as being distasteful and offensive. One can be sure that this is not what the filmmakers intended, you do not go and see a comedy film for this purpose.One can always judge the success of a comedy on not only the box office takings, but also on how much the audience are enjoying what they are seeing. You would expect to see audience members in fits of laughter whilst watching a movie such as this one, purely pausing from laughing to catch a breath. Sadly this did not occur during the screening of Your Highness I was watching, and it simply felt as though I was waiting for that initial laugh that never came. You can tell a comedy is going downhill when it beings to use toilet humour in an effort to make the audience laugh.The fact that I can't remember any of the funny parts of the movie to mention in this review is not a good sign, and come to think of it this is probably the only review I have ever written where I cannot think of anything positive to mention about this movie. If I was forced to mention something positive perhaps the only saving grace here is the scenery of the film, some of the locations used for filming looked good.Your Highness could have been so much better than it was. There was real promise for a film that should have been filled to the brim with clever satire, but unfortunately this movie simply does not deliver. The whole film drags, and leaves you wondering where all the of decent gags are and if they are ever going to come. On paper this film seemed to offer a lot of potential, and one may be forgiven for thinking there still is a lot of potential for this movie to be better. Your Highness does not capitalize on this potential whatsoever and so does not deserve even the slightest recommendation.You can read more of my reviews at StevieNight.com</fullReview>

Even the sexual appendage of a beast from Greek mythology. All this combined with the total freedom for politically incorrect jokes.How could it fail, right? But it did... big time! They ruined everything... as bad as the main character was ruining his life at the beginning of the film. The premise for a fun-packed satire fails from the start, rendering the story too goofy for a serious movie but also too slow and just not funny. Even the politically incorrect jokes come out inappropriate, not in a funny way. It really gives you a feeling of frustration to see such good potential go to waste.Unfortunately there's no amount of questing to turn this one around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest part of this movie was the trailer for fast and furious 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The duo of James Franco and Danny McBride was hilarious when paired together in "Pineapple Express". Franco has shown a solid acting career, and Danny McBride is great in "Eastbound and Down". However, this movie was just utterly boring.The movie seems as though every line was ad-libbed. Conversations between characters would go on and on without any substance to what is being said. Instead of something funny being said or happening during a conversation, pointless conversations would go on, kind of like a never ending awkward "Saturday Night Live" sketch (boring, not funny, awkward, asking for a pity laugh type of comedy). For a movie that advertises the raunchy drug humor ("Your HIGHness") of Franco and McBride, their was very little partying at all, almost none. The theater in which I saw the movie remained silent during the screening. It's a sad day when a preview (Fast and the Furious 5) gets bigger laughs than the feature film.This movie was quite literally a snooze fest; during this movie I saw quite a few people actually sleeping during this. Of those people who were sleeping, one was a buddy of mine. I actually sat there wondering if I should wake him up, or let him sleep so that he wouldn't have to watch the horribleness that is "Your Highness". And if you are wondering, the show time was for 6:45 on a Friday! This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time, and I have recently seen the new Big Momma's house. I would rather watch "Avatar" or "The Happening" 20 times in a row than watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, that was disappointing."Your Highness" turns out to be a juvenile letdown of epic proportions. You needn't look further than the title to glean the intellectual extent of its pothead-pandering humor, which wholly lacks the tragic undercurrent that made co-writers Danny McBride and Ben Best's equally crass HBO endeavor "Eastbound and Down" such a success.The pair's medieval genre mashup fails by comparison. Even doled out to a stacked cast that includes McBride, James Franco, Natalie Portman, and Zooey Deschanel, the jokes often read like fairytale MadLibs filled in by a gaggle of stoned teenagers. If your idea of incisive comedy is the suffix "motherf****r" to a line of dialogue, or hearing the Oscar-endowed Ms. Portman say the word "beaver," then ready your funny-bone for one gut busting adventure.For the rest of us, "Your Highness" only occasionally tickles. Lowbrow humor has its place, but Best and McBride make it the star attraction. Their focus clearly isn't on the plot, which serves only to carry our reluctant hero from one set piece to the next, each accompanied by a handful of easy gags. First we meet a pedophilic puppet (har har) and later a minotaur with a third horn, if you catch my drift.Thanks to some welcome practical effects, the fantasy characters and locales actually carry audience interest better than the one-note humor. Director David Gordon Green borrows from a stable of genre classics, and "Your Highness" features shades of Jim Henson and Ray Harryhausen, among others. Given that aesthetic acuity, it's a shame so much of the running time is eaten up in a nondescript forest. The most absorbing visuals end up being somewhat few and far between, and at over 100 minutes, that leaves plenty of lulls.And yet "Your Highness" is rarely an outright bore. It has a tendency to drag, and though the jokes often skew to the lowest common denominator, it's easy enough to fall into its dumb rhythm. I'd be remiss not to mention that Best and McBride elicited a handful of laughs from me, though batted well below 500. "Your Highness" isn't a strikeout for the pair?it's more of a foul tip. McBride's is a career treading water, and instead of expanding upon the emotional facet of "Eastbound," he merely transplants his Kenny Powers persona to the middle ages.Don't get me wrong?I'm usually the one to defend comedians accused of role redundancy, and I'm far more disappointed in McBride the writer than I am in McBride the actor. But where elsewhere he blends his crudity with offbeat social commentary, in "Your Highness," he and Best aren't even trying to be edgy?comedically or otherwise. The laughs are cheaply won, and the plot doesn't elevate its archetypical underpinnings. Naturally, the intention was to create an unobtrusive framework for the gags, but then when the gags fail, the audience is left with no backbone of appreciation for the protagonists or the quest at hand."Your Highness" isn't a terrible comedy, but it is a disappointingly transient one?especially given the aggregate talent on hand. Everyone involved has been funnier elsewhere, though blame ultimately lies with Best and McBride. Their stab at adults-only fantasy earns its R rating, but without challenging a single convention or bringing one genuinely new idea to bear. That is, unless you count plugging profanity into an otherwise nondescript conversation. Motherf****r.</fullReview>

He must have been juggling the filming of the crappy movie and rehearsing for his hosting duties and both responsibilities got the better of him. As for Natalie Portman, well at least she has an Oscar now so she can do whatever she wants at this point whether or not it is considered career-suicide. Zooey Deschanel virginal princess in need of rescuing was the only funny bit in the entire film, I don't mean her performance I mean the irony in casting choice.

I saw no purpose for the foul language or for the crude humor throughout the film.I have no idea why Natalie Portman or James Franco would debase themselves in such a movie. With a total rewrite of the script in an attempt to make it more of a family friendly movie, it might have potential, but the script would need a complete overhaul.

		<fullReview>This film has an all-star cast, but fails in making any gags work. The jokes are squarely aimed at a pot smoking teenage audience, which is probably Danny McBride's main audience. There is potentially nothing wrong with this, but the jokes are not skilfully crafted and the storyline clumsy. We have a wealth of talent in Natalie Portman, James Franco, Toby Jones, Zooey Deschanel, Damian Lewis, Charles Dance and (perhaps controversially given this outing) Danny McBride in this film, but nothing can really tie it together with the dire script and poor storyline. Justin Theroux's strange arch enemy really fails to give the plot line any impetus. You can see there are lots of ideas which went into this film, but the construction poor and the execution worse. The cinema was virtually empty which tells a story of it's own, but the laughs it did garner were largely apologetic. Please save your time and do not go see this film. I went with high hopes of a reasonable comedy, but came away with just regret (that I bought the ticket). For those of you that think this might be a stoner comedy, it isn't. It is just puerile. I like Pineapple Express (but did not find it to be a great film), but this film falls very much shorter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantasy tale of royalty, knights, damsels in distress and all that goes along with this well worn theme.Danny McBride who co-wrote the screenplay stars as Prince Thadeous, the vulgar brother of Prince Fabious (James Franco), who is the favorite of the King and who seems to do everything right. Fabious' love interest, Belladonna (Zooey Deschenal), recently rescued by Fabious from the clutches of the evil Leezar (Justin Theroux), is re-captured by the same. Fabious sets out on a quest to rescue Belladonna and enlists the aid of Thadeous and his squire Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker). Along the way they are betrayed by some close to them, encounter evil forest dwellers and meet Isabel (Natalie Portman) who becomes an important ally.There are a few laughs - emphasis on a few - and many vulgar jokes that really serve no purpose to the overall story. The only saving grace to the movie was much of the scenery during their travels is very majestic and beautiful, I enjoyed the soundtrack and James Franco and Natalie Portman do, as usual, a good job in their roles.If for some reason you want to waste the price of a ticket and don't need any dental work...go ahead and see this one.</fullReview>

The only redeeming qualities of this movie were Natalie Portman, although, why she would even want to associated herself with a movie of this calibre is beyond me, and the scenery. The lush green backdrops and the Giant's Causeway were the highlights of the movie. Natalie was stunningly beautiful, as always. I am glad,...no wait....not glad...less disappointed that I went on half-price night, although, at several times throughout the movie I seriously considered getting up and leaving. If it were not for the fact that I was in the middle Of the theatre, I would have. Do not see it at the theatre. Do not rent it. Do not watch it if, for some bizarre reason the censors fall asleep and it is shown on TV. Avoid. It is an absolutely horrible movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Your Highness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy of a film to the medieval fantasy action adventure genre is something that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer could probably never get it in their lifetime with their track record of horrible films trying to pass off as funny, taking well established formula and stereotypes from the genre and turning them all over their heads for a laugh, which worked a lot of the time and surprisingly was way better than expected.There are many sprawling elements here that make up the narrative, from character or caricature examination to the nature of a quest movie to find a hidden artifact, kill the villain and rescue the damsel, while swashbuckling the way through countless of villains through the combination of brawn and magic. There's blind romance, lust, betrayals, squires that bootlick all the way, mechanical birds, and of course the villains such as the Cyclops and the Minotaur, the latter few items taking a huge leaf from the classic film of Clash of the Titans (especially in that original 80x film).Danny McBride and James Franco star as Thadeous and Fabious, two princes of royal blood who cannot be more than opposite with their attitude and achievements, with Thadeous being the gross underachiever compared to Fabious' alpha-male tendencies. In his latest quest, Fabious returns with a bride to be only for the evil warlock Leezar (Justin Theroux) to come steal her away for deflowering under the eclipse of two moons, and it's up to our merry men, and their entourage consisting the likes of court jester Julie (Toby Jones) to go on a quest to seek out mythical, perverted sages, retrieve powerful weapons and ally with equally skilled exponents like Isabel (Natalie Portman) the warrior woman who is also on a quest with common objectives.What just worked is the casting which had many play against type, and James Franco fans listen up. I've not seen him in any role like this one where he sheds his serious alpha-male exterior for something of a flamboyant beefcake with a penchant for the rough and tumble to protect his father's kingdom. Then there's Zooey Deschanel as the evergreen go-to lass, now required to play her role of Belladonna with child like imagination since her character is modelled after Rapunzel sans long hair, being kept captive in a tower so as to fulfill an evil prophecy. Natalie Portman only had a minor role here, entering the fray midway though contributing no less with new found physicality and an insane parting shot, while Danny McBride co-writes and stars as the grouchy slouch Thadeous who is in a desperate need for money to sustain the lifestyle he's leading, not that he's very bright to begin with, but I suppose being born into the right family means connections as we see from his dealings with various enemies of the state.Be warned though that Your Highness has plenty of raunchy jokes, and nasty visual sight gags from hand jobs to the blatant display of genitalia, or the lack thereof. Almost everyone has sex on their minds, from the above mentioned prophecy involving mating with a virgin to herald the birth of a dragon, to slicing off a creature's wiener as a wearable trophy, are but some of the really inane, crack me up situations. Everyone's not taking their roles seriously and are really hamming it all up, spewing lines that aren't scripted but were largely improvised, making this quite the romp of a medieval story filled with many modern day sensibilities, and swearing, loads of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danny McBride just isn't a leading man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've all seen our fair share of stupid comedies that really weren't too bad. Set aside the fact that very few (if any) of the jokes are truly clever, the real problem with this movie is Danny McBride.You can't make a leading man out of just anyone and 'Your Highness' is definitely proof of that. While nearly all of the side characters are at least somewhat entertaining to watch, Danny McBride just isn't. He's perfect for roles like the one he had in 'Pineapple Express' where he's the weird, drug dealing friend, but in 'Your Highness' he just falls completely flat. It's impossible to get through an unwitty comedy without a dynamic lead keeping you at least holding on for a few laughs.'Your Highness' delivers a few cheap laughs, mostly due to James Franco being his usual quirky self, but over all fails to be more than the kind of movie you *might* watch on TV if there's nothing else on and it's raining outside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is more entertaining than the elite movie reviewing stiffs would have you believe. Ebert said "Your Highness is a juvenile excrescence that feels like the work of 11-year-old boys in love with dungeons, dragons, warrior women, pot, boobs and four-letter words." I agree with him. Where we draw differences is to him, that alone makes it a poor film. If you didn't expect to see a dirty fantasy comedy romp set in medieval times with magic, dragons, drugs, boobs, and violence then what did you expect from this team? The comedy and action style is very similar to Pineapple Express. Danny McBride is hilarious and so is James Franco. Natalie Portman looks like she's having a blast in this role and it is really fun to see her let loose. I will admit that a few of the jokes missed their marks....particularly when trying to mesh the language barriers, but it is easily overlooked. Also some of the plot feels rushed at times given the large scale it is trying to achieve. I would have been happier with a longer runtime with a bit more plot development, or if that wasn't possible at least some smoother transitions between plot devices. The action is fun and surprisingly well done. There were times where I was smiling not because of a joke but simply because I was having fun watching a scene. Like Pineapple Express, Your Highness has a heavy focus on meticulously shot high octane action sequences with a thirst for realistic violence. There is more action here than Pineapple Express. The acting is awesome. The leads have a great chemistry and play off each other well and Natalie Portman is sexy as always. Portman is a real scene stealer here sometimes as the dubious swashbuckling adventurer. Nobody is "Fu**ing to make dragons" on her watch. The rest of the cast is just okay. No real standouts and all pretty one dimensional. That's not a big issue though since their screen time is limited. The setting is amazing. Shot in Ireland, the backdrops and beauty of the environment is on full display as they trek across the land. Really I think they should have utilized the beauty of the scenery more than they did. They were obviously going for an epic feel to the film and they had the perfect location for that type of feel. They should have used more panned back shots of wilderness to get that sense of adventure and peril across. As it stands though, there are still some wonderfully shot scenes of the gorgeous landscape. The plot is strange. While there is a hint of complexity, it is never delved into. It ends up feeling shallow and under worked. Stop the bad guys and save the girl. There was room for much more to be happening in this film but it is wasted on subplots that go nowhere and the brother jealousy theme which doesn't ever feel resolved. This is where Your Highness suffer the most. Too much filler. Overall Your Highness is a fun movie. It isn't Lord of the Rings but it doesn't have to be. Danny McBride and James Franco are funny guys and they work well with each other. The adventure and action is fun to watch and there are laughs to be had if you aren't a prude or in a terrible mood. If you like fantasy and raunchy comedy this is right up your alley. Unfortunately, some of the stale lines and poor plot development keep this from being a great comedy. Watch it only as a popcorn flick to pass the time or watch with friends. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is by far the worst movie I've ever seen and I liberally browse the netflix instant streaming which say something. I don't know if Im just growing up but this humor was just not funny. Im 23 and I love crude humor but this has R rating but yet it is clearly geared for 14-15 yr old males. I suppose if your high or drunk it might be funny but seeing as I was neither at the time I looked at my gf and we both knew we wanted to leave. The acting is terrible everyone has terribly fake British accents that I imagine are supposed to sound funny but they just sound lame. The dialogue is atrocious and boring and beyond all of that there are random nude scenes of both male and female that make no sense and are graphic in some cases. Don't get me wrong im all for female nudity but they show a penis on a menataur trying to rape one of the characters. Like I said I just think I've out grown this middle school humor it reminded me of a fake jackass meets robin hood men in tights. Point is its just lame. I have never in my life walked out in the middle of a movie until seeing this. I wasted 18 dollars and 45 mins of my life on this don't go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy stupid comedy movies, but there are stupid comedy movies that aren't funny. This would be the case with Your Highness. Now, I enjoyed Pineapple Express when it came out and I think it's very funny even though it's very crude, but Your Highness dumps the funny and increases the crude. I saw a trailer and was hoping it would be funny and entertaining, but all I got was a disgusting and boring movie. Yes, it's supposed to be a satire of fantasy movies, but it really just shows how much better ACTUAL fantasy movies are compared to this filth. As I was sitting in the theater (with only highschool and college kids) I figured we would be on the same page, as I am in college too, but I was extremely mistaken. Every time a character would say "fuck" everyone laughed. I'm not sure what's so funny about the word; most people hear it every day especially in highschool and college. Of course this movie wouldn't be complete without some very disgusting gross out humor and some sickening subject material. I guess this movie wasn't targeted to me, because I never once laughed while the whole rest of the crowd were laughing quite a lot. It's sad to see such talented people in such a juvenile and disgusting movie too; James Franco, Natalie Portman and Zooey Deschanel. I'm sure there will be a lot of people who disagree with my view, but my advice would be to save yourself $10 and an hour and a half of your time and go see something else, or better yet revisit some comedy classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>frankly this movie has all the down sides it can get. It's stupid, annoying, idiotic it's straight down retarded. I watched only 30 minutes of this movie and I couldn't take it no more, it literally makes you wanna jump off a cliff. I don't understand why some say it was funny. Maybe they confuse being stupid, made in W a n k e r s V i l l e, with being funny. I'm known as a funny guy and I've didn't laughed a bit, 'cause it resumes to just plain old stupidity. It's just a dumb movie, that doesn't bring anything original. This kinda so called jokes, which in fact are nothing but retarded lines spoken in a manner that supposed to be funny, are the main core of 80% of the so called funny American movies, also known as American comedies that mostly are just stupid and retarded.Sorry for using stupid and retarded so many times, but these terms describe the movie so well I couldn't think at another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 out of 10 - Very lame!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film last night primarily on the back of the trailer and the fact that Natalie Portman is in there. Also, my 20 year old son was with me and I thought he might enjoy Your Highness because he loved Pineapple Express.What a waste of time. Sure, there were a couple of quiet giggles and a few mild smiles but overall the film just fell flat. All of the ingredients were there for a really fun romp using the 'medieval quest' genre as a clever vehicle for some great gags. However, many of the moments that could have been hilarious seemed to be missing that little something extra (such as a clever twist or even a punchline!).It's not all bad though. There are several reasonably amusing moments and some funny characters, as well impressive CGI and an overall 'big budget' quality feel. However, the excessive use of the F word for obvious laughs and the extremely poor script are unforgivable. Maybe a group of 14 year old boys would think it was amazingly funny - but only if they were a bit drunk and/or stupid.At the end of the film and after a fizzled-out disappointing finish, my son turned to me and wrinkled his nose. "What do you think?" I asked. "5 out of 10" he replied "and that's generous!". I agreed. Probably the weakest film I've seen at the cinema for quite some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FIRST of all, when i went to see this there was only FOUR people at the screening, FOUR! including me. and it wasn't long into the movie (the titles actually) that i realised why people decided not to waste their time and money, a choice i should have made. The portrayal of the characters is just horrible. The jokes are even worse, who in the right mind finds molestation from an old man funny? That just sums up the movie. Other than that there were one or two funny jokes in the film and one well choreographed fight. the story just didn't make any sense at all, and there was just un-necessary lines in the movie, which would be a result of the rubbish improvisation and lack of script.

		<shortDescription>Its biggest sins are 1) it is NOT funny. At all. 2) it is dull and just bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is NOT a good movie. It is an awful movie, in fact. I read reviews where the critics tsk-tsked, and clucked over its raunchiness. "Low humour" and the like. Renowned critic Roger Ebert even whined a bit that there were "too many boobies." If only!!! I was looking forward to some good, sharp, raunchy low humour.Gotta say, and I hope you believe me- the critics are all wrong. There was zero humour and zero bawdiness. The movie's expletives were few- but because they DID seem gratuitous, as if the writer (who in this case was also a star of the movie) simply dropped a few f-bombs in to give it some dash, perhaps the critics mistakenly thought there were more. Sorry- not even the puerile humour of a good swearing jag. Overall, no snap. It just all sounded really, really stupid. Its horribleness was actually just very sad to behold.Too raunchy? Too low? If only!This movie's big sins were:1) It was not funny. At all. Not even any smiles.2) It was bad. As in such a clumsy, amateurish and poor effort that it truly and sincerely simply sucked.To help you grasp my context and perspective, let me say I LOVE truly raunchy movies. I LOVE "stupid comedy" and "low humour." Not for every single thing I ever see, of course- but show me a well-timed fart joke, a "dress gets ripped off accidentally and bare breasts are exposed" set- up or other expert slapstick and I am there. I love a good belly laugh. This was so lame that I honestly could not even detect where the producers thought the jokes were.Save yourself some cash, not to mention two hours of your time, and the good spirits of your date, and skip this clunker. There are so many other great flicks out now- see any one of them, then tell yourselves some raunchy jokes on the drive home, to satisfy your quarterly yearning for frat-house humour.Lastly, Natalie Portman's and Zooey Deschanel's puzzling presence in this simply proves that even great actors like them are only human, and they too can misjudge a project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It starts with you searching for comedy. The actors are having fun (some scenes Franco is so stoned he can't help but crack a smile) but nothing really gets you laughing. Suddenly, you start to realize the detail of the sets, the brilliant direction and how classic the cinematography is. By the time Portman appears you're hit full on with decent acting from everyone, reminding you that all of these actors are well accomplished, high talents.By the third act you're amazed at how good this "bad film" has become. Suddenly you're completely engulfed in this story and shocked at how high the production value is. Which if you don't get it by now, IS the entire joke / point of the movie. Just like how Pineapple Express was an awesome action movie, it ends up being hilarious that these academy acclaimed actors came together and made a half decent, over the top, silly epic.Or maybe it was because my weed brownie that I ate had finally begun to kick in about halfway through... Either way, I walked out laughing in tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the trailers, I expected a lighthearted "fairytale" comedy or "spoof" showcasing the talents of actors I like: James Franco, Natalie Portman, Zooey Deschanel. My modest expectations were completely trashed. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The filmmakers have failed to create characters that we can care about. The painfully thin storyline is played out in a series of "road trip" scenes that attempt to pass off disturbing (and what some might consider offensive) material as funny. We left forty minutes into the film -- a total waste of time and the actors' talents. There are so many comedies I love. Some of them are silly, some are spoofs, but they all have characters that we can care about and a story that is at least interesting. "Princess Bride" has an engaging story with fun characters. It is a delightful fairytale/comedy that has elements of broad humor like we expect from a "spoof". But it is actually funny and heartwarming. There are only two redeeming aspects that come to mind: the beautiful scenery and a very enjoyable musical score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should have known better, really. Stoner comedies are hit-or-miss and unfortunately, this one was full of miss. I'm not a prude and I don't mind raunchy jokes (hell, I prefer them actually) -- too many movies today are afraid to offend and be politically correct and family-friendly. This is definitely not one of those movies. Danny McBride wrote the screenplay with his friend Ben Best and for some reason, I got the feeling that each one was trying to outdo the other in the "I can write naughtier dialog than you can" department.The audience was quite packed for a 10:30pm show for a movie that's already been out for almost three weeks and boy, did they laugh...and laugh.... and laugh. I thought maybe I was missing some jokes or an important piece of the puzzle... and I was. I wasn't stoned off my ass or drunk. The man sitting next to me cackled so hard, he had to bend down and grab his ankles to catch his breath. Dude, it wasn't that funny. Yes, I get it -- Thadeous had just made his first kill and he wanted a trophy from the beast that he had just doth slain -- he tried to cut off it's horn and his travel mate (Portman) informed him that it's impossible to cut through the horn of a minotaur -- so, he decided to "Bobbit" the beast, if you will, and then wore this souvenir around his neck proudly.I did laugh out loud once or twice but most of the hi-jinx were often met with me muttering to myself how silly it was. I was hoping that Portman would show up and add just an ounce of class to this mess of a movie but I found myself waiting a bit longer than I thought. She doesn't show up in the movie until about an hour in. By that time, I was thinking, "In order to save this movie...Natalie Portman has to be naked and remain naked throughout until the end credits." Alas, that did not happen. *cry* None of the actors did anything wrong, actually, it was like watching a High School production of "Camelot" because of all the swearing in the dialog -- not that High School productions allow cursing -- it just felt like a bunch of High School antics up on the screen. That's probably who their target audience was (18 to 24-year-old potheads) and sad to say, but they did at least accomplish that. Justin Theroux has the best part in the movie. He plays the evil wizard that kidnaps Fabious's bride and has delicious fun hamming it up. Think Alan Rickman in "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" crossed with Alan Rickman in "Die Hard" divided by Alan Rickman in the "Harry Potter" series. I did laugh at the name of the "event" his character has to achieve with the virgin bride on the eve of the moon's eclipse.The problem lies within the screenplay -- this thing should have been a skit on SNL and nothing more -- the jokes started to wear thin after about the first 20 minutes. Maybe next time I'll sneak some "wacky tabacky" in, laugh till I can't breathe, bend over to grab my ankles and kiss my ass (and common sense) goodbye.More reviews at www.soveryterry.com Final Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the negative feedback?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why critics are hating Your Highness so much. "Eastbound &amp; Down", "Footfist Way," "Pineapple Express", etc. all got good reviews, as far as I understand, and this film is like all of those, except much funnier in some cases! Honestly, the only reason I was worried about seeing Your Highness was b/c I had DISLIKED Pineapple Express and Observe and Report so much. This film is far better and certain David Gordon Green's best comedy to date. Pineapple Express was one long joke about being stoned. The main character in Observe and Report seemed to have been written for McBride but played by the overrated Seth Rogen. I mean if you like Kenny Powers or Fred Simmons, I don't understand why you would dislike McBride's Thadeous. He is just as funny as any character McBride has ever played. He's got the same party mentality as Kenny, the same overblown pride fullness as Fred, just all done up with a British accent. Yet, somehow critics are attacking McBride for his portrayal! People say the opening gag fell flat on its face and that the movie just got worse from there. Honestly, I was rolling during the opening scene. It was completely absurd, reminding me of something out of Monty Python. And from there on I laughed my way until the credits. Yes, there's a lot of potty mouth humor, drug references, etc. But that is McBride's brand of humor. Everyone whose a fan knew that going in. I don't understand why people are acting like that's such a shocker when they've seen all his other work. To me this just really isn't a step down from Eastbound or Footfist, and is certainly a step UP for Green (at least regarding comedies), who is a fine director and who I am not intending to criticize. If you like everything else these guys have done, go see it. Funniest movie you'll see all year. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ezra's Huge Reviews-Your Highness Early Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this film has a lot of aspects as far as creatures and magic that I've never seen before in a film. I can't really go into detail about it, but an example would be the 5 headed snake in the trailer. Sure we've seen snakes with many heads in plenty of films, but how this creature is created and what happens when it gets injured is incredible and completely unheard of. Also the main plot of what the antagonist, Leezar, is trying to accomplish is incredibly creative. I can't go into detail about his plot because it would be a massive spoiler since it's not in any of the trailers, but it is the most creative diabolical plan that I've heard of in quite some time. There are plenty of others that I'd love to talk about, but I don't wanna spoil it for anyone.Secondly, there is a vast variety of different kinds of visual effects in this movie. Granted, most of it is CGI, but there is a Minotaur that's shown in the trailer that's basically a guy in a suit, and even a puppet! I was amazed that we finally get a film in a time when EVERYTHING is CGI that we actually get practical effects, puppetry, and costumes. I would be shocked if this film doesn't get remembered by at least regular movie going audiences for some of the best visual effects of 2011. So far, it definitely has the best by a long shot.Third, this movie is absolutely hilarious! In all honesty, this is the funniest film that I've personally seen since Ben Stiller's amazing Hollywood parody, Tropic Thunder. The thing is that I would not compare this film to Tropic Thunder because it is not a parody. If anything, I'd compare this to Zombieland. It's a hilarious film that is not a parody of a specific genre. Your Highness is not a parody of the epic quest film. Instead, it is an epic quest film with a lot of humor thrown into the mix. In fact, the best thing about this film is how excellent it is as an epic quest film instead of how hilarious it is. Nonetheless, the comedy in this film is genius and the film is gut busting hilarity. Sadly, some of the funniest lines were given away in some of the trailers, but the funniest scenes in the film weren't given away at all. In particular there's one with a Minotaur that had me in stitches.The chemistry between these main characters is definitely intact. Danny McBride and James Franco are completely believable as brothers in the film despite the obvious fact that they don't look alike at all. Natalie Portman and Danny McBride also have very good chemistry as the two lovebirds of the film. James Franco and Zooey Deschanel's chemistry seems very forced but thankfully the film makes it clear that it's supposed to feel that way, so that's not a problem.Danny McBride does a great job in leading this film. He never comes across as annoying like he does in some of his other films. He does a really excellent job in the lead and he also supports the film with some really big laughs.James Franco is also great in the movie. Sure, he doesn't go over the top hilarious like he did in David Gordon Green's previous film, Pineapple Express, but he doesn't need to be. Everyone else supports the film with the hilarity that it needs, so even though he could've been funnier, he didn't need to be much funnier than he already was.Natalie Portman is very funny in the movie surprisingly. I sort of expected her to just be the eye candy of the film. In some moments, she definitely is that, but she also has quite a lot of funny lines. Also, there is one action scene with her that kind of gives Hit Girl a run for her money. She can be pretty epic during the action sequences.Justin Theroux is a hilarious antagonist for the film. He supplies this movie with some very funny lines and some of the most memorable scenes in the movie. I just knew that not a lot of people were gonna talk about him when the film comes out, so I wanna stress this. He's comedy gold in this film. This is sort of expected since he also wrote the screenplay for Tropic Thunder.Zooey Deschanel is very funny in the few scenes that she's in. Some people may say that she was underused in the film, but she has just the right amount of screen time for me. She does exactly what you want out of her character and she does it extremely well.David Gordon Green does an excellent job behind the camera for this film. It's very well shot, directed, and paced. He knows exactly what he's doing especially for an incredibly gory film like this. In all honesty, this is one of the goriest films that I've seen in quite some time. The director also shoves the gore in your face. In fact, one death in the movie actually felt 3D by how the gore just flew right toward the camera. It's kind of shocking that this had more 3D than The Last Airbender when this wasn't even IN 3D.And lastly, the end of this film is very satisfying. It's very funny, it's well shot, it's an ending that left a smile on my face, and it's the perfect conclusion for this epic film. Sure I may have wanted more after the film ended, but that's a sign that the movie was so good that you wanted more. Thankfully, the film sets up for a sequel and I'm more than happy if they decide to make one.I give Your Highness a 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good yet anti-climatic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the film "Your Highness" is a quirky, and frankly, welcomed break from the linear plots of comedy movies, it has does incorporate aspects of other movie genres that were not given appropriate attention. The movie takes a very hybrid standpoint in terms of movie genre, incorporating both humor and a slight take on dramatic, action filled fight scenes, and it is the fight scenes that took away from this movie. I often found the fight scenes to be moving to quickly at to fast of pace. This led to a great amount of confusion on my part as I felt these scenes had major lapses in details that make fight scenes bearable and also extend them to a certain level of realism. Fight scenes in this movie lasted for no more than a few seconds or minutes. They lacked dramatic climaxes that could have given the movie a more suspenseful feel where you think for a minute that the hero might actually lose. Overall, the movie is a great break from commonly used tactics seen in comedy movies in an attempt to draw humor from the audience by incorporating VERY dirty humor. This is a no-holds-barred movie that could have done better had they found a better balance in their fight-scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, after all the fuss the trailer made (they CGI-ed the bathing suit of Natalie Portmans character, because it was showing too much "behind"), I had hopes for the movie. I hoped it would make better money. One would think that after Pineapple Express we would get another great movie. And while I do think that this isn't quite as good as Pineapple, I did like it.Let me make one thing clear though: I only watched the Extended Cut. I can't imagine how the theatrical release works (actually how it doesn't work). I've heard that people didn't like the shorter cut at all. And while I don't think foul language should make any difference, I do think that this movie, while not working always, has some of its best scenes involving cursing and other stuff that weren't in the initial release.</fullReview>

I knew coming in it would be a bit raunchy and I laughed at many of those scenes but that alone doesn't make this a very funny movie especially since many of the action scenes seemed to have been done with some seriousness of purpose. Perhaps it was because of what I said in that last statement that I didn't cringe too much when my mom were watching those same scenes since I didn't think she would pay too much attention to them especially since she was also preparing some meals for the next day as well. Seeing James Franco, Danny McBride, Natalie Portman, and Zooey Deschanel together in this provided some entertaining moments but overall, this wasn't funny enough to me to fully recommended. Still, Your Highness is worth a look for anyone in the mood for a ribald spoof of the Middle Ages as turned to the attitudes of the 21st century...</fullReview>

There are many explicit sex related scenes and language. I believe IMDb should add an extra warning for fantasy movies like this one - which are normally children-friendly - that it's not to be watched with children, even if it's a tale.It was okay for me, but my kids were the fist to mention the bad language and sexual connotations, which made me feel really uncomfortable. The movie would have been a cool one even without those moments, and the audience would have been a lot bigger. I would have given to it a higher vote in that case.</fullReview>

On the way, they are rescued by the skilled fighter Isabel (Natalie Portman) who agrees to travel together.Danny McBride is a little too mean-spirited. It's good that he's pathetic. It's off-putting for him to be so bitter. I feel like there is a missing element in the comedy group. It needs a goofy fun guy that somebody like Seth Rogen could play. There is a lightness that is missing from this comedy. The jokes are adolescent but workable and sometimes even funny. The addition of Natalie Portman is good but she comes in after around half of the movie is over. Her best quality is to be the straight man calling out McBride. She improves the group dynamics markedly. I want her in the movie earlier. I just think that something is missing from the Franco McBride pairing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know I really don't get critics sometimes. They all pretty much crapped all over this movie and I'm not sure why. I mean, yes, it's a stupid stoner comedy set in Medieval Times. What were they expecting? King Arthur? Robin Hood? Game of Thrones? I mean really? The trailer pretty much told you exactly what to expect. And if you're familiar with Danny's Kenny Powers from Eastbound and Down, NOTHING you saw in this film should've surprised you. As far as I'm concerned, this was entertaining and it delivered exactly what was expected: dumb laughs. So it's simple. Turn off your brain. Don't expect Robin Hood. Don't take any of it seriously. And you will be entertained and laugh hysterically. I found this much more enjoyable than A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas (which for some reason got great reviews, it's the exact same dumb humour!). Danny McBride and James Franco are hilarious and they make this a fun experience. Is this a good movie? No. Will it make any "Best of the Year" lists? No. Will you laugh your ass off at the sheer stupidity and ridiculousness of it? Hell's yes. Sometimes you need a dumb laugh and Your Highness is absolutely the ticket. Enjoy!Enjoyed my review?

		<shortDescription>Ending could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the scene when Isabel was taking off after defeating the wizard. I imagined an ending in which Thadeous ran off after her and both of them travel to new lands in search for quests. That would have completed the transformation of Thadeous becoming an independent warrior. His dream was to become respected, and after saving his kingdom, he only needed to return there. But if he left all that fame behind and started a journey of his own with Isabel, that would have meant a lot more.The rest of the movie was okay. It was pretty funny and quiet smart. But it just doesn't make it to the level of comedy that Pineapple Express raised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film has a lot going on: Dancing bears, orientals and all the berries you care to pick, to start.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt like I had to give some sort of written justification in giving this film an 8 since there is so much rage and hatred directed at it for some reason. I loved the style of this film, like some kind of stoner version of Monty Python. The first scene is great, and makes the opening credits very entertaining. Any film that can do that is worth points in my opinion.The cast is great, but not the kind of great that works well together, which really doesn't matter. McBride is one of those actors where he is pretty much always himself in his roles, and he's always funny. Theroux kills as a powerful but totally pathetic and lame Gargamel-like wizard. Franco and Deschanel are just bad actors, but they're nice to look at which is all that is really necessary from them as their personalities are basically caricatures of the dashing knight/damsel in distress that this movie is using as a comedy vehicle. And even that doesn't really matter, because everything is ultimately just washed over with bong water and cum jokes anyway, making this film a giant, hot mess of fun that never takes itself seriously for a second.This film got such a high rating from me because it accomplishes what it sets off to do almost flawlessly. It is meant to be a parody of a Fantasy epic that is done in a way that is more legitimate and faithful to the genre in some ways than many serious attempts are. The addition of crass humor works because it takes an already outrageous, far-fetched setting and just makes it more absurd, but in a way that is ironically more temporal and worldly. Smoking pot from a hand-crafted olde wooden pipe and masturbating with fine oils could actually exist in this world, but dragons and sorcery do not. I forgot what my point is. I think it was to address the notion that a stoner movie set in olden times was a bad idea, but I don't think that was even an issue so this last five or ten minutes have been a total waste of time.I think what puts a lot of people off on this film is the writing style, and the way characters deliver jokes that are meant to be layered with different levels of humor and immaturity. Make no mistake, immaturity runs DEEP in this film, which also might explain the revulsion by some people who take their tastes seriously. If you are someone who absolutely cannot stomach an occasional dick joke or accept that some attempts of humor are going to fail and be periodically flushed out with the rest of the aborted eggs then you probably will not like this film. If you have a broad range of appreciation for popular culture, nerd games, Monty Python, changing your bong water regularly, movies like Half Baked or Grandma's Boy and snorting Pixies, you should probably give this one a shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film mainly due to the fact that Danny McBride is NOT afraid to challenge your sense of humor. He will do ANYTHING for the joke, and his commitment and delivery will often times compensate for the jokes that don't land. From straight up silly, to down right crude and obnoxious, you never know where Danny McBride will take you, but you know it's going to be a hell of a ride.The dude makes me laugh. Period.This was a fun film to watch with tongue firmly planted in cheek.

		<shortDescription>Works as Fantasy, Not As Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your Highness, directed by David Gordon Green, is a solid fantasy flick but not a very good comedy one. I could tell that they were working hard on trying to get laughs but that is just the thing. You should not have to work much at all to get laughs. But as a fantasy flick, this film works very well as it successfully incorporates all the main elements of fantasy.This film is about two brothers who go on a quest to save the future king's fiancé from an evil wizard Lazar who is bent on doing unspeakable things to her when the two moons in the sky collide.I liked Danny McBride's character, Thaddeus. He is an outcast who wants to fit in but is not able to. I am able to relate to this character so that is why I like him. I really did not like James Franco in this movie. All he does is just use the same expression which is quite unlike him. I did like Natalie Portman's spirited warrior, though.Overall, this could have been a better film if the comedy element was taken out. I had a few chuckles but I had a feeling I was supposed to do more than that. I did enjoy the fantasy and the action so that is a plus. I think critics were a little too harsh with this film. I rate this film 7/10.</fullReview>

I liked the role of Danny who stayed true to his nature till the end (well almost!). Very disappointed with the acting of Zooey Deschanel. Why is she always so stiff and emotionless? Your Highness definitely ticks the box of an average adventure movie. Apart from a couple of jokes, I didn't find the movie to justify the genre of comedy though. Overall it was an average time killer for a Sunday afternoon. Don't expect a lot from it. I will never watch it again, even if it is on TV :)</fullReview>

A fantastic satire of medieval sword and sorcery films without copying any of them. Unique ideas and a fairly smooth flow rather than an erratic string of one liners.

		<shortDescription>A Raunchy Princess Bride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To quote Zooey Deschanel of course ;) This film is in some ways amazing and in others utterly childish. Some of the film shots and backdrop scenes are reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, showing surprising production quality, with all the filming in Ireland it had a magical feel to it beyond the ad libbed toilet language spewed by the actors.Meanwhile, the casting is deplorable and rough, and the decision to ad lib most lines turned it into a Saturday Night Live sketch.Danny McBride is no acting tour de force, and his clumsy comedic big screen debut is something of a fizzle here. This would have been a top notch vehicle for Jack Black, for example, easily comparing to and equaling his hilarious performance in Year 1. Instead, we get a McBride 'best buds of the director from film school' last minute stnad in let down. (one wonders if it was Jack Black this film was actually written for and he was the one who turned it down?) He is colossally upstaged (unsurprisingly) by Natalie Portman as the rogue warrior on the revenge trail, and even by the elvish Zooey Deschanel, who plays the damsel in distress to a tee, despite some truly pornographic language she is forced to utter with a straight face.Overall this is worth the rental if you enjoy comedic takes on sword and sorcery films. This is no Princess Bride but it's easy to see the heavy influence of that film here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched this film. To be honest wasn't expecting much from this movie, and it was a refreshing change to find that it exceeded my expectations.The script - well there simply wasn't one, so you cannot say it was a bad one! It was obvious that some of the cast were not used to improvisation (indeed towards the end it was obvious one wasn't even used to a speaking part!) - but in a weird way that adds to the charm! The reason is simple, normally the jokes can be seen an age before they happen, and you can guess what they will say.This freshens up a very tired genre - the scary movie type film. I didn't go to the cinema (based on the scary movie type trailer), but I'm glad I did get to watch it.I don't say this is a classic, but if you take it for what it is meant to be, then this is a good (not great) movie.If you want a non pretentious comedy movie then you could do worse than this.</fullReview>

And then, I started yawning and falling asleep during the first 30 minutes, only to wake up from time to time wondering if I wanted to laugh at the silly jokes or not. Story is boring and pathetic. Acting is bad, blood scenes gross. This is the type of movie that you know is a parody about knights and quests, but the scenario is done in a way that tells the audience: Look, this is a parody about knights and quests. No subtlety whatsoever. I wonder why Natalie Portman signed up for this dull movie! The only thing I appreciated was her sexy body, but that's all.

		<fullReview>Thadeus (Danny McBride) is a simple-minded albeit irresponsible prince, who is always overshadowed by his brother Fabius ( James Franco). When Fabius decides to marry a na?ve Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel) after one of his victories, he decides to have Thadeus as his best man, and this infuriates the former's army comrades. However, the revelry is interrupted by Leezar (Justin Theroux) and his witch-mothers, who kidnap Belladonna so that Leezar can make love to her when the two moons unite, thus begetting a monstrous dragon. Now its upto Thadeus and Fabius to stop Leezar.Oh, this isn't Lord of the Rings- it's a comedy by David Gordon Green. Surprised? What is ever more surprising is that it isn't funny! David Green's Your Highness attempts at being a rib-tickling farce but turns out to be a washout instead. And the main reason for the failure is the abundance of sex jokes and the f-words to make it funny. Its quite surprising that David Green thought that fantasy characters mouthing the f-word would bring the audience to tears. It may tickle your funny bone once or twice, but then who cares? Another thing I observed is that the movie could've been much better had the vulgar humor been toned down and the director aimed to make a serious fantasy film. I disagree with Richard Roeper's review that the action scenes were poor, in fact some of the moments were exciting. But the excessive juvenile humor dampened the mood and gave it a "Disaster/Epic Movie" feel.There was hardly a moment where I laughed. The situations were so poor and childish- the pervert Wise Man, Marteetee's labyrinth being the worst moments. The acting itself was wooden, stilted and affected. The horrid accent by Portman, James Franco's weird talking style and Charles Dance's gimmicky performance were quite annoying, not to forget Portman's ineffectual performance. Everyone else is mediocre.I shall give this film a 4 out of 10. Without the puerile humor, it could've actually been a decent 6/10 fantasy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry folks, but it just doesn't work. Maybe I'm not the target audience, being over forty, but I struggle to understand what that target audience was. The movie was given a 15 rating in the UK. Now, I'd expect a fifteen year old to have enough emotional maturity that they'd find most of the (mainly) sexual jokes on display here to be pitiful and not at all funny. Anyone older than that really should be ashamed of themselves if they find it remotely amusing. It's not offensive, but the puerile humour shouldn't work on anyone with a brain stem. Looking at the movie as a whole, what idiot thought that Danny McBride (a thirty five year old man) would be funny if he acted like a retarded child? And Natalie Portman? What the hell convinced her that this would be a good movie to take? Anyway, it tanked at the box office and for good reason. It's not very good! No amount of titties on display could save this film from its well deserved, early grave.SUMMARY: Childish, puerile humour. A grown man acting like an idiot child. Halfway decent plot and effects ruined by what is considered "funny" these days.Avoid it like the clap!</fullReview>

I'm actually surprised that it reviewed as poorly as it did, and the only explanation I can think of is either that the reviewers had high expectations, or didn't know anything about what they were about to watch.That being said, if you find any entertainment in the stoner or fantasy genres, this movie may actually come as a nice surprise! The characterization is consistent and the actors don't deviate from their roles. The music and special effects are polished, and even impressive. The story is silly and unintelligent, and the script reflects the most random of moments you've had with your friends in someone's parents basement back in the school days, high on mountain dew or otherwise, but to this end it is both charming and familiar, although also audience specific.I went in with low expectations and I was adequately entertained!</fullReview>

The film suffered most from poor direction, lousy editing, mediocre writing and a surprisingly poor performance from Franco. At some point, the director should have stepped in and told him to stop smiling so much and remember to act. It felt like the cast had a really good time making this film, perhaps so much that they forgot about the audience.On the plus side, the opening credits were good.

		<fullReview>I came into this movie with typical expectations considering the many negative reviews I had read about it from so called "Expert" reviewers. I must say I was happily surprised by this movie.While this is a far cry from Oscar material by far, the movie itself had a surprisingly good story, characters that were likable and you actually cared about, and a musical score by Steven Jablonski that fit very well in almost every scene of the movie.Mc Bride and Franco played off of each other very well, and while Franco's performance of the older and narrowly wiser brother was a bit over the top at times, it was played off of very well by Mc Bride repeatedly throughout the movie.Zooey Deschanel was delicious as the ridiculously-naive-yet-sometimes-insightful princess to-be. Despite having not very many lines of dialogue, she lent a charmingly innocent dopiness to her character that not many others could have pulled off.Natalie Portman was a real surprise in this picture, however she lent an incredible amount of flair and dangerous sexiness to the film thru her character. She took this role and made it her own and it can be seen in her subtle charm and dry wit throughout the film.The only downside to this movie for me was the incredibly over the top blood and gore, it just seemed overused to me. And while it was mainly done in a tongue-in-cheek manner, it was there nonetheless and I felt the film suffered a bit for it.And while the toilet bowl humor is a bit overdone at times, it mainly adds instead of detracting from the overall flavor and tone of the movie.All in all I was surprisingly more entertained by this movie than I thought I would be. And it garners a decent rating from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Constantly overshadowed by the chivalrous actions of his brother Prince Fabious (James Franco), disgruntled scoundrel Thadeous (Danny McBride) vents his frustrations by blundering simple assignments, indulging in too many spirits, and berating his aide Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker). But when Fabious' new bride Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel) is kidnapped by the evil sorcerer Leezar (Justin Theroux), Thadeous is forced to tag along on his very first quest. Encountering wise wizards, ruthless jungle savages, and the fiercely driven warrior girl Isabel (Natalie Portman), Thadeous must learn to play the role of a valiant knight - and when Fabious is captured by Leezar, the bumbling prince might just become a hero.I must start off by saying it was the cast that drew me to this movie. Natalie Portman and James Franco both fresh off the Oscars, Danny McBride who is hilarious as well as Zooey Deschanel and Justin Theroux. However if there was ever a movie that could pair these actors with a horrid script - it is this movie!First off, the jokes are not funny! They are rather disturbing and rude making them inappropriate. Most of the jokes in the movie are like this which makes it not funny.The plot was alright, Thadeous falling in love with Belladonna and him having to rescue her however...why was she kidnapped? She is kidnapped because Leezar needs a virgin to have a dragon child with....Come on! That's a bit ridiculous!I wish I could say I loved this movie but I didn't. Despite the good cast and good acting that is pretty much all the movie had going for it. Script was horrid,jokes were not funny and plot was a bit stupid.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really is a poor film any way you look at it.On paper it has a lot going for it if you look at the list of actors involved in it but sadly even they couldn't rescue it. For starters the lead character is weak, if you've seen him before you'll know what to expect.Franco isn't a natural comedian and it shows, the dopey stoner persona is wearing extremely thin. The idea that you can take The Princess Bride, mix in some LOTR elements, a wafer thin plot and flesh the whole lot out with facile, inane fart, cock and sex jokes is not a recipe for success. The overall IMDb rating of 5.5 is probably a shade too high. Don't get me wrong i wanted to like this film but the ass jokes were just too infantile, the acting too hammy and wooden and the overall feeling that it just didn't click which is mainly down to McBrides poor script. Don't watch this unless you're bored,really bored.</fullReview>

The movie tries to mock fairy tales by adding stoners, obscenities and sex to the scene, but fails to be funny. It seems the authors were aiming in the direction of Monty Python, but could not deliver the subtlety and wit of the latter.

I mean who would spend $50 million to make something that looks that stupid w/out having a few tricks up their sleeve? There were positive reviews. In retrospect, I should've remembered that there's a lot of morons out there, and they all have opinions.Secondly, I had nothing else to do that day. Unfortunately, I talked someone into going w/me and have to bear the guilt from that for the rest of my life. There's good people in this movie. Natalie Portman..uh ...lost a bet maybe? I can't comprehend why she's in this. I mean she did Star Wars and that was bad enough. I don't know. Damien Lewis is a fairly respectable actor. I don't get that one either. I bet it was probably a lot of fun to make, but that's it. They should've kept it hidden, like a hit and run or a war crime or something. We walked out w/approximately 10mins left. We would've left sooner but I'd paid for the tickets so I wanted to stick it out a little longer. Soonafter we had a screenful of Minotaur junk and that was the last straw. I laughed twice during the whole movie. I can't remember what the first thing was. Nothing too funny. But the second one, at one point someone catches a little Tinkerbell faerie thing, crushes it up and snorts it. I laughed at that, but then again, I used to do a lot of drugs. That's about it. I wasn't offended by anything in it, aside from the general offense to my sensibilities. It just sucked. Really, really bad. Not in a "so bad it's good" way either. Past that, way past that. Don't do it. Other reviews have covered all the myriad reasons not to go see this. It's not funny. I'm think I'm a reasonably clever sort and enoy smart, dark humor, satires, things like that. I'm also capable of laughing at a retarded kid stepping on a rake if the timing's right. This movie, however....nope.YOU WILL LOSE A PIECE OF YOUR SOUL IF YOU WATCH THIS YOU WILL NEVER GET IT BACK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Dungeons and Dragons with pot thrown in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the watching this movie with a few friends, I did research and found out that David Green Gorden directed it. He was also the director of Pineapple Express, one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. So where did this go wrong? Well, let me start with the story. It stars Danny McBride and James Franco as two knights (one heroic and one fat and a loser, take three guesses on which is which) who go on a quest to kill an evil wizard who captured Franco's fiancée while McBride tries to be just as good as his brother. Now this may be the raunchiest movie I've ever seen. It's 95% toilet and penis jokes and that's WAY overboard for me. I think the scene that made me lose hope in this movie is when Danny McBride kills a monster and wants to claim his kill by cutting off it's head and mount it on a spear, but he can't cut off it's head so guess what? He's cuts off it's penis and wears it as a necklace! When I saw that I rolled my eyes and thought it was a cheap way out of a laugh which it is. And its not just this, so many of the jokes are like this that it gets ridiculous. But it's not ALL bad, they're some good things about it, like Natalie Portman. She is the best performance in the movie and she is what keeps the movie going. And they're were a few moments that were funny. Like the scene where Franco and McBride go to see the wise wizard and it turns out to be a little purple Yoda looking puppet. And it turns out to be a pervert so it won't give them any advice unless they make out with him and jerk him off! And I have to admit watching James Franco and Danny McBride touching that little puppet's crouch was pretty amusing. But still, the movie's a mess. It's not 100% atrociously bad but it's just lazy in the writing. And think I've seen enough penis in one movie! Geez</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of McBride and all of his past films but This one seemed to be lacking a little. Its exactly what you would expect. A stoner movie set in mid-evil times where they smoke reefer and say the f word a lot. But its way over utilized and loses value through the movie. You can actually experience it by hearing the laughter slowly die every time the f word is used and every time they smoke dope. Don't get me wrong it was funny but I felt like it could have been a lot better and a whole lot better jokes. Its a good one to watch once with some friends but if I had a time machine I would want to rewind and wait for a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In defense of Your Highness, (the only one I will offer) I went in knowing it would be a stupid movie. I was expecting a silly stoner movie with some cheap laughs and maybe a fight or two. What I got was a dumb, sexist and homophobic movie without any humor to justify it - unless you were one of the handful in the theatre who gets a laugh out a couple badly timed expletives. I will admit to chuckling at a few jokes, but now I can't even remember what they were. I was excited by the cast, but even Natalie Portman couldn't save the dismal script. The characters were cliché beyond hope, which meant not only was the dialogue predictable, but the plot was as well. All in all, a bore and a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout history, tales of chivalry have burnished the legends of brave, handsome knights who rescue fair damsels, slay dragons and conquer evil. But behind many a hero is a good-for-nothing younger brother trying just to stay out of the way of those dragons, evil and trouble in general. Danny McBride and James Franco team up for an epic comedy adventure set in a fantastical world--Your Highness. As two princes on a daring mission to save their land, they must rescue the heir apparent's fiancée before their kingdom is destroyed. Thadeous (McBride) has spent his life watching his perfect older brother Fabious (Franco) embark upon valiant journeys and win the hearts of his people. Tired of being passed over for adventure, adoration and the throne, he's settled for a life of wizard's weed, hard booze and easy maidens. But when Fabious' bride-to-be, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), gets kidnapped by the evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux), the king gives his deadbeat son an ultimatum: Man up and help rescue her or get cut off. Half- assedly embarking upon his first quest, Thadeous joins Fabious to trek across the perilous outlands and free the princess. Joined by Isabel (Natalie Portman)--an elusive warrior with a dangerous agenda of her own--the brothers must vanquish horrific creatures and traitorous knights before they can reach Belladonna. If Thadeous can find his inner hero, he can help his brother prevent the destruction of his land. Stay a slacker, and not only does he die a coward, he gets front row seats to the dawn of an all-new Dark Ages.i knew exactly how this movie will turn out, Critics gave it very bad reviews. it isn't the best R rated comedy you will ever see honestly but it still has few laughs and some minor entertainment value but unlike me if you are into adult silly comedies with lots and lots of vulgarity and vulgar jokes than this one is for you.this movie has this very fantasy adventure and those prince who saves princess from evil feel to it but they made it R rated loud silly comedy making it a very different movie, i like the idea but still movie is not that good. i was to some extent entertained but not overall. Screenplay of this movie is below average and it has some dull and many empty places and it doesn't maintains the enjoyable adventurous comic feel of it. and as the movie goes on it feels flat. story is okay but not told that well. plot is average. this movie stars James Franco as the masculine brave prince and his brother is a very lazy fat staying inside caring nothing for the battles and all kind of prince played by Danny Mcbride. other actors are Rasmus Hardiker, Natalie Portman, Justin Theroux , Toby Jones , Zooey Deschanel , Charles Dance and others.Natalie is a fearless warrior they meet on their journey but she isn't in the movie that much, which shocked me. she is okay and looks good in her character. comic timings of Danny McBride feels flat in this movie and there isn't a good performance from anyone. characters aren't written or shown well. action is good some pretty average old style special effects.art direction, cinematography and costumes are good. movie has some cool action fighting sequences that you will like but not anything else, i did entertained me a little bit for which i will thanks it but it isn't a good movie. Recommended to the fans but not to others.</fullReview>

YOu know what, the walk to the cinema outside in the blistering windy cold air was more enjoyable.it was like Danny McBride got to live out his 11 years old fantasy of toilet humor. "OH I have a joke poo poos and wee wees hehehehe. Im going to say it again, poo poos &amp; wee weees hehehehe, its going to be funny after the 10th time too, just listen heheheheheheeee" - idiotic scriptThe story line itself had potential, the movie could have been awesome, the effects, sets costumes, everything was great to make an awesome entertaining movie, but Danny's ability to write &amp; deliver jokes so so bad, ill timed and no taste. It was definitely a waste of money for the viewers and for those who invested in such a movie. I would be ashamed if my name was in the credits. At the conclusion of the movie I just felt ripped off and actually had a dislike for movies as it put such a bad taste in my mouth. As a Producer &amp; Director I now know I would never want Danny cast in anything I do, just awful. I never write reviews as my attitude to the critics are " don't like it? you make something better" well for this part the movie was actually inspirational. If Danny can get funding and stars to be in this crappy movie, then anyone with a will can do the same and do better</fullReview>

I am guessing that the people that are giving it good reviews are probably not even old enough to have gotten in to an "R" rated movie legally.This movie is just bad.I do not know what these big name stars were thinking when they accepted their roles for this movie. Maybe it was something like this, "Hey, you want to be in a movie where Natalie Portman strips down to a thong, and there are a couple of dozen topless girls?". Who wouldn't say yes to that? I gave it 5 stars because of Natalie Portman stripping down to a thong and because of a couple of dozen topless girls. If it wasn't for those two reasons, I would probably have given a much lower score, which is a shame because I like all of the actors &amp; actresses in the movie.</fullReview>

Now, I suppose if you enjoy extremely crude things and don't mind there being little wit in a comedy, you'll probably enjoy it. Don't take me wrong, I find some crude things to be funny (Super Bad, Anchorman, and The Pineapple Express are great) but when it's not coupled with any kind of sarcasm or wit, that's when the humor falls flat. Unfortunately, 90% of the movie is filled with witless jokes. I was terribly excited for this film and thought the trailer was absolutely hilarious (yes, even the R-rated one), but the trailers were terribly deceiving. Most of the funny lines in the trailer were the only good parts of the movie, and some of the best lines (including "you will quest the way you like, I will quest the way I like") were not even in the film! I chuckled probably only 7 times throughout the film, and genuinely laughed only once. And, if you know me, it's very hard to keep me from laughing at something. Very disappointing, in my opinion. Please save your cash. I wasted 12 bucks on this film, don't make the same mistake I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mostly a pure "nothing" film that delivers few laughs and really nothing of substance whatsoever. It's not really a comedy and it delivers very low on the adventure front. The lead spends seventy five percent of the film as an unlikable lout that annoys at every turn. While annoyed at that character, the rest of the film is an inoffensive hodge-podge of quirky fluff. This isn't the worst film experience but it certainly delivers no quality either. James Franco was OK to good but his character was written and a straight man or set up man to jokes that were never there or presented at all. Natalie Portman was mostly wasted on this project and that's truly a shame at this point in her career. I didn't hate this movie but I did feel let down because the trailer was funny as could be and, again, this is NOT a comedy.</fullReview>

And Natalie Portman was enjoyable has a tough take no prisoners female warrior. And I liked the way she plays it straight over Mcbrides goofiness.What I didn't like was the raunchy humor, they throw out F bombs and gross out gags at pretty much every corner, to where it leaves you no time to breath, I oftently like raunchy humor, but Your Highness really pushed way too far. And the rest of the cast are not the least bit interesting, Zoey Deschanel has one funny scene through out the whole movie, but other than that she is a boring character. The effects are alright at times. But this movie is a total waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see this with my girlfriend, thinking we'd get a laugh or two (I always enjoy a double entendre and a bit of sexual humour) but after sitting through the first 90 minutes, we both agreed that the film was utter rubbish. Neither of us has ever walked out of a cinema before, but we made an exception for this film.The jokes are the of the calibre that might have made me laugh when I was about 13, but even then I probably would have thought they were overdone. We left the cinema feeling like we'd wasted an hour and a half of our lives. The only consolation is that, thanks to Orange Wednesday, I only paid for one ticket and the other was free.Unlike another reviewer, I didn't even go into this film with high expectations. I knew it would be a load of nonsense and full of crude humour, but it managed to disappoint me nonetheless.I saw a poster for this film that quoted a review: "I didst laugh until I soiled my breeches". I'd like to see them replace that with a quote from my review: "I didst walk out in disgust". Don't bother with Your Highness, you'll be wasting your time and money.</fullReview>

Every joke was predictable and obvious, a high schooler probably could have done this better. And to make it worse, it went on far too long. There's probably about 20 minutes that could have been cut from this and it would have been a merciful bit of slicing had it happened. There might have been a good movie somewhere within the general idea, maybe that should have been the characters quest, finding a worthwhile script. Because they didn't have one to work with here.

However, it misses out by the sheer inanity and hopelessness of it's puerile jokes that relentlessly drag the film down. If you took all the glib swear jokes out it would make a passable, if regular, quest movie? If you leave them all in, you are continually shaken by their sheer lack of humor and revelry in the lowest common denominator type of schoolboy smut. (Sorry schoolboys everywhere)This was a misses chance as some of the hero's/villains/special effects are truly good. Yet the lead comedian is given the opportunity to stick his boot into all of the scenes, which in the end becomes predictable. (Surely, we can all make crap jokes)Someone somewhere has written on IMDb, in a review/critique, that this film might "give you the opportunity to hear Natalie Portman use the f word". If that, is an example of what the merits of this movie are, then where do we go?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness (2011): Dir: David Gordon Green / Cast: Danny McBride, James Franco, Natalie Portman, Zooey Deschanel, Justin Theroux: Stoner comedy set in medieval times. It regards authority and self importance. James Franco plays the successful brother who slays the cyclops. Danny McBride is the other brother and seen as a disappointment. Franco is about to wed the woman whom he saved from an evil wizard until the wizard appears and steals her away. Apparently she is a virgin and he must penetrate her. Central plot has the brothers quest to rescue her as well as the various stupid subplots that they become involved in. Heavy emphasis is given to the fact that director David Gordon Green previously made The Pineapple Express but that comedy did a better job at making fun of its subject matter than this one does. The visual effects and production work but the cast is at odds with the material. McBride can be a funny guy but here he seems only satisfied with profane comebacks and vulgarity. We know that he will prove himself but he never proves himself to the audience. Franco is hot after an Oscar nomination and he couldn't be any worse if he tried. And what is Natalie Portman doing here? She plays a female warrior and she looks incredibly fetching in her outfit but after winning the Oscar for Black Swan, she seems out of place here. Zooey Deschanel spends much of the film chained up, perhaps to keep her from fleeing the set. Justin Theroux also had too much free time and picked doing this film over boredom. It doesn't even succeed in making fun of the genre. Instead it is as embarrassing as the hero. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

One is very brave and successful, the other lazy and useless. But when the bride of the successful prince gets kidnapped they both have to go on a quest to rescue her.I did laugh through this and it was very funny. The main problem I have with it is none of the jokes were original, we have seen all of these jokes and million times before.The trailer for this film makes the movie look very good, the problem is most of the funny bits are in the trailer.I like the fantasy element in this film the magic, the witches, I think they're very good and it makes the film a lot more fun to watch. The effects were also very good during the moments.The acting was pretty bad throughout the entire film. I think it was acted this way on purpose as it is a comedy and the actors are in this film up generally pretty good in their previous movies.The film stars Danny McBride, Natalie Portman &amp; James Franco.This film was not great it was pretty standard and a typical comedy that we have seen 100 times, but it was entertaining and funny in places.I'll give this film 6 out of 10."if your vagina is anything like my hand there will be no problems"For more reviews please like my Facebook page: Ordinarily person movie reviews.</fullReview>

At times it become downright gory and at other times it becomes cheap sex tease. To think that Portman actually became a part of this film is disturbing and to think that Hollywood waste so much money on a trivial film like this is.. well.. they kinda do it all the time. The film's premise is not so bad and it could have been so much better. But most of it is lost in between transitions. Your Highness could have been Robin Hood: Men in Tights, but lacks a lot of the comic premise. There are so many gaps between laughters and at times the film drags at unholy pace. While watching the film, there always is a feeling of dissatisfaction. A feeling of being in the middle of nowhere.</fullReview>

Granted, I love stupid humor, I love Airplane, Kung Pow, Young Frankenstein, Hot Shots, Naked Gun, and even find humor in some Scary Movie scenes. But the humor in this is so deadpan, it deserves to be mentioned. James Franco and Danny McBride are fantastic together, and show the same chemistry like in Pineapple Express. But not only does this movie have humor, but the story and FX are on par with other great comedies. (Which is not saying much, but still gives the actors room for great jokes.) Every joke is played as serious. There's no big set up. Everything is a surprise which makes viewing all the more delightful. Seriously, if you can't find humor in the elegant insect scene, you've lost your funny bone. I get that not all humor is for everyone. I can't stand Adam Sandler movies as they are the lowest of low - and yes, I could write a better Sandler screen play by eating bean burritos, cabbage and crushing a 12 pack of PBR then filming the contents in my private quarters. I love this movie, it's funny, entertaining, crude (without the fart jokes of Sandler) and enough story to carry the movie to the end. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Make sure you watch the ruder one as what makes your highness so amazing is its 1 line sex jokes which I found extremely amusing.Earlier I mentioned how the acting is quite poor, even though this is true I feel it only makes the film that bit more entertaining and enjoyable.I wouldn't recommend this film to just anyone but if you have a stupid sense of humour or are with a bunch of friends who do, then this would be a good film to watch. If you are still unsure about watching this film after reading this and other reviews, then look on YouTube for some scenes. It may make the part you watch less entertaining the second time but I have watched this film 3 times now and enjoyed it just as much each time.I would say this is a film you will either love or hate, I would say 99% of the people I know to have watched it loved it.If you did read this because unsure whether or not to watch it, then I hope I have made your decision that bit easier.(Sorry for any grammar mistakes)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Your Highness" is a sporadically funny stoner comedy by David Gordan Green. Green was once an art house and critical darling, but over the past few years has been gravitating toward juvenile, mainstream material. This shift, he says, is a response to both severe depression and the poor box office returns of his earlier pictures. He wants, he claims, to now relax, goof-off and have some fun.A parody of the sword and sorcery genre, "Your Highness" isn't smart, well written or witty enough to compete with stoner comedies like "The Big Lebowski", "Bad Santa" or the foul mouthed shenanigans of Kevin Smith. Amongst its cast, only James Franco stands out. He plays an overly earnest, kind-hearted "prince charming" character. Whilst the rest of Green's cast act with straightforward, dead-pan irony, Franco seems to go one up and play a sincere man ironically played without irony.The film is shapeless, heavily improvised and full of profanity. Its title, an obvious reference to chemical highs, also seems like a rebuke to those who disparage low-brow art. The film is proud of its genitalia jokes, its vulgarity, its suggestions of ejaculation, and crackles with much adolescent irresponsibility and gleeful mischief making. Like most films in its genre, its hero is a lazy weed smoker who thinks only about getting high and laid.7.5/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can see what they were going for with this film, and had it gone right it would have been a fantastic film, gone down as a classic but it misses the mark. Natalie Portman and James Franco do their best, but with minimal direction and the entirety of the film on the shoulders of Danny McBride it just couldn't hold up. Basically this film failed for a few reasons but really it failed because Danny McBride couldn't piece together an interesting character, like he had material to work with he just didn't make it work. Had this film been a success then McBride would still be making films of this level.I think the main problem is, you don't like the protagonist and the film is a little bit too crude, crude can be funny but its a delicate balancing act it can come off as just obnoxious. I think everyone involved in this film realizes it didn't quite reach the level they wanted it to. When you add it up, its actually amazing that there were no laughs in this film. Oh well, I would say skip this, if its on TV and you are too tired to change the channel then you won't mind watching it, but still its a shame because it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "meh" Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your Highness stars Danny McBride, James Franco, and Natalie Portman who are all wasted in this movie. The hype called it the next Princess Bride, but all it is is another stoner comedy with a mid-evil spin. It is funny once or twice and that is it. Everything else is boring and can somebody tell me what is with all the dick jokes??? Not the worst comedy I have seen, just average. Story is about two brothers, yadayadayada, who try to save the princess from an evil guy who meet a bad ass female warrior along the way. Their journey is actually quite boring. They go to 3 or 4 areas and then they pack their things and go back home. Your Highness is a "meh" comedy that some may enjoy and others will end up despising. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great cast in a raunchy homage that's funny more often than not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"No, no, don't suck that! That's dead!"A crude, silly and occasionally hilarious homage to the sword and sorcery movies of the 80's. You've got your beautiful damsels in distress, hideous monsters, evil wizards, magical swords and dashing princes, all given a vulgar spin courtesy of Danny McBride's sense of humor. How well your own syncs up with his will largely decide whether you like Your Highness.&nbsp;I thought the movie could have been funnier, but it never dragged or became boring, and the missed jokes were usually followed in short order by one that made me laugh-out-loud. There's tons of bare breasts and endless penis jokes (and actual penises), so if that kind of stuff isn't up your alley, don't even bother. But if you like the idea of a great cast including Natalie Portman, James Franco, Zooey Deschanel, and the previously mentioned McBride traipsing about in medieval villages, castles and forests having a foul-mouthed and very bloody adventure, I suggest you give Your Highness a viewing.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a lot of slapstick nonsense it isn't the movie for you. But I laughed through the whole thing. Watch it and see for yourself. You do not need to be high to laugh at this one. You do have to pay attention to the wit or you'll miss the laughs. I thought the cast was excellent. I'm not sure what most people were expecting. It is a comedy. If you have a stick up your..... then watch it another day. Comedy is not the same as Thriller, etc so don't expect to be dazzled with clever twists. It has a very basic story plot; one that has been told thousands of times before. Though similar to other story lines, I felt the humor was fresh and subtle enough to have a good time. Again give this one a real shot before writing it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have to give a spoiler just to tell you how funny and unique this movie is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Combine Errol Flynn technicolor swashbuckling cinematography with Monty Python's Holy Grail and add in a heavy dose of raunchy smart aleck slacker humor from "Knocked Up", "Super Bad" and "The Hangover" and you got "Your Highness".This movie is clearly made by folks who decided to flesh out and make fun of scanky teenage sexual innuendo from pedophilia to homophobia read into every "Knights of the Round Table" movie ever made. It definitely is a unique movie with over the top realistic special effects. One moment you're enamored with the beautiful photography and innocence, charm and natural acting of the characters whimsically speaking with British accents, then you're laughing your butt off by McBride's smart aleck teenage reactions to relatable situations and the next you're amazed and blown away by realistic mythological creatures coming to life (like in "Pan's Labyrinth") and doing strange, unexpected and funny things to the characters.Here's my spoiler to give an indication of what I'm talking about...A squire of McBride's character is being raped by a VERY realistic, scary looking Minotaur (half man/half bull) creature. McBride's character slays the creature with a sword in gory old style technicolor. He decides to cut off the horns with his sword as a trophy souvenir to put on his mantle. As he's sawing back and forth as if doing an episode of "This Old House" and getting no where, he gives up out of frustration only to instead cut off the Minotaur's rather large private part to hang around his neck which he does throughout the rest of the movie insuring more funny situations with other characters reacting to this.I do believe if Monty Python were still around they'ld be taking notes. This movie is smart, silly funny and good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie alone and i had a blast! i didn't expect much from it... at the end i was extremely satisfied by it, i laughed all the way to the end and much like Pineapple Express it is FULL with subtle GENIUS little details of comedy that are only present in fine well written clever comedy (even though people that don't get it might not understand the idea and think this is a dumb movie, it is not) Near the end, when Thadeus is threatening Isabel and he asks her to look over her shoulder and we see Courtney playing with a dwarf completely distracted but sincerely enjoying himself (and there is no sex reference nor scatological humor in that part) that moment... is terribly funny and delightful and could only be present in a carefully well crafted movie by people who care about what they are doing and definitely want us, the viewers, to have fun with it. A couple of days later some friends came over to my place and i was so excited telling them about this movie that i could not pick what part was the best to tell them so i invited them to see it, so we did, and it was a lot of fun again! even more entertaining with some friends to share it with, anyway my point is... this movie delivered greatly and way beyond my expectations and it is marvelously crafted. If you don't like laughing nor swords nor dragons, etc. don't see it! and if see it anyway don't give it a bad review because it is clearly a great movie.Oh BTW one of my friends said, if this movie wasn't a comedy it would be a good movie too (regarding production, acting, art department, etc) and then the other one said, it is a good movie but it is also a hilarious one, and that can NOT be bad.</fullReview>

At first I felt that it was going to be a disappointment because of a few negative reviews that some friends had heard, and because the opening scene wasn't that great, but it seems to be the type of movie that gets funnier as it unfolds, as well as every time you see it. In the fashion of Franco and McBride's previous movie, Pineapple Express, it was a funny action movie that winded up not being quite what I expected, but definitely worth my time and money. The acting was good. The story line wasn't exactly original, but how often is a story line original? Overall a great movie to watch for a lot of laughs and a lot of new catch phrases.</fullReview>

Thad was a lecher who saw the sexual in everything - which was hilarious. The baddies were so delightfully yukky, &amp; still managed to be funny. they even created a new word - the fuckening - like a reckoning (I've just had to enlighten the computer that fuckening is a word), but much funnier.I felt kind of sorry for the minotaur, he only wanted a friend. At one point Courtney tells Thaddeus what is going on for his brother, which works. Sometimes techniques like that spoil things, but it worked here. Everything in this movie worked for me. It was quite seamless, bursting with energy &amp; the right length too. Some movies suddenly stop &amp; I feel cheated - but I felt satisfied with the end of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Your Highness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now let me see if I can think of some appropriate words that would aptly sum up this movie (apart from 'it's a comedy') to those who know nothing about it... lude, rude, a bit of nude and most definitely crude! And yet there is something about it that will keep you watching right until the very end.Brought to us by the guys behind Pineapple Express, Your Highness follows two brothers Thadeous (Danny McBride) and Fabious (James Franco) with their trusty man slave Courtney on a quest to save the recently rescued princess (Zooey Deschanel) who has been re-kidnapped by the evil warlock Leezar (Justin Theroux). Yup there are quite a lot of famous faces in this aren't there but that's not always the sign of a good movie.McBride makes the character his own as a fumbling stoner of a man who would rather be at home in the castle than out questing with his much loved brother- something that makes him rather jealous. It was also good to see Natalie Portman (think I could just stop that sentence now... but I won't) in a different light as a comic actress where she put in an impressive performance as well.I got the feeling that this movie may have been written by some 14 year old boys, not because the script was poor but just that the content was rather vulgar and filled with just a few (hundred) testosterone induced sexual references. Quite ironic really considering its ideal viewer, the 14 year old testosterone induced male teenager cannot even watch it due to the 15 rating. Oops! But it was not all about the ,ahem, clever and subtly worded jokes because the gore and blood also took centre stage during several parts of the movie. Impressive it was too with a good fight scene involving a 5 headed monster.I really must emphasise the 'cringeworthyness' at some of the scenes and things that were being said where a cushion to hide behind to shield you from it may have been warranted. In the same respects though this is more of less what I expected from this movie that also gave me many laughs from beginning to end. It even reminded me in parts of Lord Of The Rings with the panoramic shots over the hills accompanied by dramatic music and similar characters, if you have a bit of an imagination that is.I think you have to be in a certain frame of mind/have a certain kind of mind to fully appreciate this movie and luckily for me I was/do. It gets you laughing, cringing and there is a decent story in there well backed up with good CGI and music. It's better than it's directors predecessor, Pineapple Express but probably not one for those who are easily offended.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</fullReview>

It was full of pedophile humor that I do not find amusing in any way. Please stay away from this movie. It was beyond distasteful. There are way too many derogatory and sexual remarks for me to begin a proper review. I can handle tacky humor as well as campy humor. Such as I thoroughly enjoyed Monty Python movies. But the jokes about child molestation and the extent of the perversions contained in this were beyond limits. I can hardly believe that it actually made it to the big screen. I am further more surprised that any known actor or actress would actually agree to this script. Please save yourself the headache of this movie.</fullReview>

Even during the opening credits I was fully expecting something like "Robin Hood: Men in Tights". This movie is not that. "Your Highness" was awful. I spent most of the time asking myself "What the hell is happening?". Any references to pop culture and other movies (there were few), were not blatant enough to seem intentional and though I usually enjoy crude humour, it was unfunny and did not at all improve the film. The accents (I assume, meant to be funny) came across as forced and not satirical. The only saving grace is that this movie is supposed to take place in another world.

		<fullReview>Yeah, it's as bad as you've heard. I loved Pineapple Express, and I like Danny McBride a lot in general, but nothing in this film works. McBride and James Franco and their humor don't translate well to the setting. That might have worked well if the comedy had come from that clash, but it rarely does (they swear a lot; that's about the only joke we get in that fashion; oh, and McBride smokes some pot, which is so awkwardly inserted into the film that it feels very desperate every time it's mentioned). The thing that McBride does best is his unique style of idiotic banter, but it just doesn't exist here. Even somewhat funny performances like Justin Theroux's evil wizard just hardly ever get laughs. About the only person who gets through the film unscathed is Natalie Portman. Well, yes, she does embarrass herself quite a bit just by being in it (perhaps she too was a fan of Pineapple Express), but, in the straight-man role, she isn't going for laughs, so she doesn't fail as miserably as the others. Plus, whoever designed her costume should be given an Oscar. Natalie Portman in a leather jerkin which pushes up her breasts oh so nicely. Yum. Also the bathing scene, which I'm sure everybody's already seen. This would be an easy choice for the worst film of the year, if I hadn't already seen Sucker Punch a couple of weeks ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie makes fun of all the fantasy movies that take themselves too seriously. Not just medieval ones, but Star Wars and the like, too.But, it's not a spoof, nor is it a classic comedy, nor a time-travel story (someone from today going back to medieval times or vice-versa). It's a combination of elements from all those and deserves credit for trying something different.It's very silly by intent, so there's no sense in thinking about it's realism or the like. But, it has a mostly coherent story, interesting characters and is funny most of the time.Could have been more funny, relied less on foul language and genitalia related jokes and been even more silly. But, nobody's perfect.The greatest impression for me was Natalie Portman's character. It makes fun of all these unbelievable "strong/warrior women" you get a lot in movies lately, but doesn't over-do it. Even some seemingly ridiculous things, like when she grabs the Danny McBride's character, a larger and slightly over-weight guy, by his crotch and then easily throws him over her head without leverage, seem silly in this context, not forced or off-putting (as Uma Thurman's Kill Bill antics feel). Also, Natalie Portman was a great fit to play this character. In general, the casting is very good.It would be nice if more movies tried to do something different, like this one does, it's refreshing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to this film with low expectations and what can I say, I chuckled a few times and rather enjoyed this stoner/slacker modernist take of a medieval adventure.Danny McBride (Thadeous) and James Franco (Fabious) are two princes on a dangerous mission to save their land and rescue Fabious's fiancée Zooey Deschanel (Belladonna.)Older brother Fabious has always been valiant. Thadeous prefers booze, weed and easy maidens. When it comes to combat he tends to stay back. Joined by Natalie Portman (Isabel) a warrior with her own agenda they go on a journey where they meet evil wizards, vanquish terrifying creatures and treacherous knights.This is a silly low brow film with a penchant for a lot of penis jokes and other smutty type of humour. Its not quite Monty Python. Everyone speaks in cod English accents and seem to enjoy themselves including Portman who had recently won a Best Actress Oscar when she made this film. Franco comes across as a bit vacant though.The humour is hit and miss but there is nothing wrong with some hearty, naughty silliness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's true that Natalie has more and more poor choices of movies lately as this crap is maybe the worst heroic fantasy movie ever released (and her worst movie also)! I'm still wondering what was the point (and the fun) for that production: it's not funny and it's rather vulgar! So, the story has nothing for it and as it's about medieval times, you can imagine the huge budget needed for the costumes, the sets, the special effects! It's really strange to find some producers ready to give a blanch check like this?However, the pitch was promising: it's not often that we see heroic fantasy nowadays since the little hobbits raise the standards pretty high! But, they give a try and the beginning shows that the production is indeed classy as it really looks like a tale: the castle, the princess, the wizard. The siblings' competition is always interesting all the more that for royals, this feeling is unmatched as there can be only one king! But, then, the movie goes totally absurd with a stupid prophecy (a dragon can really be born from a woman?), quest (why a special weapon to kill a nobody sorcerer) and characters (what about the molesting wizard? Why a sexless servant?)! It plunges more into the abyss as the fun is just salacious jokes (Minotaure having sex with the servant, giving hand to the wizard, rehearsing the rape, pleasuring the maids). And the coffin is put in earth as there's strictly no character evolution: the brother stays coward and grumpy all along the movie and that's it! I won't extend on the usual way of conduct for American movie that is set up here: you got a problem, you got an enemy, you kill the enemy. In all this mire, Natalie's charm is extinguished, all the more that she appears very late in the movie.Now, you have been warned and maybe you will be lucky to avoid it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness isn't sophisticated, it isn't smart and it's humor on most levels isn't even that witty.Instead, imagine a 6 year old's beloved fairy tales were re-imagined by his older brother after a couple drinks and this is what you get. Nothing in this movie will jump out at you or be necessarily that memorable unless you've got a thing for Natalie Portman but it WILL keep you laughing for the duration. Most of the jokes are predictable but they hit the right notes on the most part. The characters are funny and solid and suit the actors who portray them, but most of all it's the perfect movie for a night in with the lads.This film film has a deadly duo (Franco and McBride) as they are both the strengths and weaknesses of the film. They are the strongest characters and most lovable. But for the whole movie they just reminded me of their hilarious performances with Seth Rogen in Pineapple Express, and how his absence from this film showed what it was lacking in comic effect.That aside, this is a film of it's own, and although not one that shines as brightly as others, it's a little hidden gem. And for that I believe it deserves a solid 8.</fullReview>

When you extend the penis jokes and the not-funny homophobic lines to an almost-2-hour movie, it's kind of painful. BUT. This movie is actually really funny, mainly because everyone else besides McBride is taking his- or herself SO seriously, and it spoofs every convention of the medieval quest genre SO accurately, that it works. Damien Lewis and Natalie Portman seem to think they're in a different movie that isn't a spoof at all. And that's funny in and of itself. In addition, the special effects are surprisingly well done. I can see it getting even better with additional viewings (especially once you know what lines of McBride's you can fast-forward through).</fullReview>

YOUR HIGHNESS pays homage to those old fantasy movies, particularly of the 80s with references to such films as Jim Henson's LABYRINTH and THE DARK CRYSTAL. The story focuses on Prince Thadeous, a stoned-out prince who's unhappy with his life because he lives in the shadow of his successful brother Prince Fabious. Returning from yet another successful quest, Fabious introduces the kingdom to his new bride-to-be, Belladonna. When Belladonna is captured by the evil wizard Leezar, Fabious embarks on yet another quest to rescue her, and Thadeous is ordered by the king to prove his worth and accompany his brother on his journey. Now, take that story and imagine it was written by ten-year-olds: that is YOUR HIGHNESS.Immature is the best description for this movie. It's nearly two hours of stoner jokes set in a sword-and-sorcery environment. A lot of the laughs are expected to arise solely from the fact that we're hearing f-bombs sprinkled amongst the "thee's" and "thou's". Someone should've reminded writers Danny McBride and Ben Best: this is a premise, not a story. I probably sound bitter about the whole movie but I'm really not. I was disappointed though. The trailers made this film look hilarious, I thought the premise was great, and the cast was perfect. It just didn't live up to my expectations. The film isn't horrible, it's just a bit of a letdown. There are some great moments though. The brothers' visit to the Wize Wizard had me dying and the whole Marteetee was hilarious in just how surreal and strange it was. Plus we get the expected mix of bloody violence and random bits of nudity. Come on, how many people you think checked this out at the theater purely for Natalie Portman's butt?What I find funniest about the whole movie is the juvenile subtext. The three main characters (Thadeous, Fabious, and Leezar) each have the mind of a teenager. There's Thadeous/Fabious relationship where Thadeous is jealous of his older brother's success and popularity and Leezar is essentially the unpopular/nerdy kid. He's a virgin who lives with his mothers and embarks on a prophecy that involves getting laid with Fabious's (the popular kid's) woman. Replace each of the actors with a teenager, and suddenly everything...the story, the dialogue...makes perfect sense. The cast really does try their best with what they're given. There's great chemistry with James Franco and Danny McBride as the brothers, but the most laughs come from Rasmus Hardiker as Thadeous's squire Courtney and Justin Theroux as the evil Leezar. The two of them steal every scene they're in and provide most of the best laughs in the film. Also, Zooey Deschanel and Natalie Portman are here, but mostly to look hot (I think).This is not a good film in any sense, really. It's just one of my guilty pleasures. I'm not expecting most people who've long since passed puberty to enjoy this film, but it can still be a fun time as long as you set your expectations low and try not to be sober when you settle in to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a special film because the beauty of images, the emotion of ideas are crushed by the blasphemy accusation. And it is a difficult problem. The fight between fart jokes and artistic value is same important in every movie about former times; who can describe the humors? So, the protests are only Utopian fact.First for the basic fact that the image of Prince Fabious is result of personal faith. He may be a prophet like in Islam, Mesia or Son of God. His importance, his qualities, his sacrifice are not objectives elements of ordinary biography but forms of religious truth.I saw in this film only an artistic product. A hypothesis of a great director about a symbol and a man.The Crist hesitation is our hesitation. His hopes, his delicate love, his enthusiasm or rout are not very different of everybody. And the acting of Danny McBride or music of Peter Gabriel so powerful pledge for this exploration of faith realities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Highness is a goofy movie from the Pineapple Express guys. My wife and I loved this movie, we didn't stop laughing, and neither did anyone else in the theater. Danny McBride is hilarious. James Franco and Zooey Deschanel have an infectious sweetness that makes you want to run home and proclaim your undying love! Natalie Portman gave an amazing performance as always and it was nice to see her in a comedic role. Of course Your Highness is no Black Swan, but if you're looking for a good laid back, feel good movie to keep you rolling, this is the one for you, I have NO idea why this movie is being bashed, it must be from people with no sense of humor or spirit of fun! Go see it today,you won't regret it!!! It was fun ride...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A homage to 80s fantasy that only half works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how as we children of the late 70s and early 80s reach middle age how much those films we loved so much at the time still remain strong and powerful memories and influences on us decades later. It's certainly the case with Green and McBride in this homage to the "golden age" of fantasy cinema that happened post-Star Wars and which saw such classics as "Krull" "Legend" "Willow" "Clash of the Titans" "Hawk the Slayer" "Conan the Barbarian/The Destroyer" "Red Sonya" "The Dark Crystal" "The Princess Bride" and many others. With the notable insertion of "Krull" into that love letter to 80s actioners "PINEAPPLE EXPRESS" it was clear Green and co had love for this genre, and it was tempting to imagine what they might bring to it, but with a brake on expectations remembering the improvised way these movies are made. In fact so it turns out. Much of the comedy element is actual rather weak and struggles for air like a landed fish. A lot of money and effort is made on creating lovely 80s things like the Jim Henson style wizard creature or the animatronic Minatour, but the payoffs comedy wise are often weak. Even the "Bubo" mechanical pigeon never really comes to anything except that "Ha! Ha! There's that silly R2-D2 bird from "Clash".." initial laugh. As others have said though, the action sequences were better planned and executed hence a spike in quality whenever they appear, plus of course Green, McBridge and co indulging their boyhood dreams of re-staging those oh-so-cool fantasy moments for real. The arena fight with the hand monster (a decent idea and an original one too) and the final heavily "willow" inspired battle (complete with multiple inter cut fights were we have fun seeing which heroes and which villains will be paired off in the end level tag fight, just like in the originals) There scenes are not only professionally staged but also played largely straight and all the better for it. As for the cast, McBride is OK, Franco again plays comedy which is were his real forte lies (he has almost cancelled the tight assed embarrassment of Harry Osbourne and "Flyboys"/"Tristran and Isolde") Theroux was almost unrecognisable but having fun as the big bad, Zooey Deschanel played an irritating idiot which is an ideal role for her, while Portman can still call on Amidala for a tough action girl part when necessary.It really is a film that began life as a "Hey! Wouldn't it be cool to mix all our favourite 80s fantasy movies and play them out like a comedy" idea and didn't really get very far beyond that. Still it is still fun and silly, like the originals, and makes for a good night out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could you not like this movie? People are crazy. When I saw this movie I had never heard of it and knew nothing about it. So I was blown-away! I love when that happens. James Franco is hilarious, as well as Danny McBride. This is not the average stupid/funny movie. There is a real story here hidden behind the humor. Yes they go overboard, but that is what makes it great. Natalie Portman shows up half-way through! Didn't see that one coming. She brought a great dynamic to the group. I literally could watch this movie for the rest of my life and laugh every time. I always have to bring up the visual effects. Surprisingly excellent. I'm sad to see that they lost money on this film. Maybe it was the advertising, or maybe it was bad critics who don't enjoy watching movies. They just like writing negative things to get back at celebrities because they are jealous of their success. Whatever it was, it wasn't because the movie was bad. Great movie, original style, hilarious, fun, and includes some heart-warming moments. Overall a success in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A perverted Muppet, pot smoking knights, a sexy sword-wielding feminazi, a fruity psychopathic sorcerer, an overly idealistic good guy, a truly lost-in-space princess and a penis talisman sound like the perfect ingredients for a swords-and-sandals-cum-fantasy flick! "Your Highness" readily and quite effectively possesses and combines all those ingredients in a potent and pungent comedy of great craziness, raunchiness and hilarity! While the movie stumbles and looses its groove at times (hence the lower rating) the cast more than makes up for it. Danny McBride and James Franco are great together and have great chemistry, while Natalie Portman portrays her character with such hyperbolic earnestness, it is pretty clear she had a good time and enjoyed herself on set, a break from her "Black Swann" performance.If you liked "Pinneaple Express" then "Your Highness" will cater to your taste.Mind you, for some reason (and this is just my opinion and I don't recommend ANYONE do this) I get the feeling this movie is best seen when completely high or s*it-faced drunk!

		<shortDescription>BEST, crudest, grossest, silliest, stupidest, foulest movie of the past few years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crudest, grossest, silliest, stupidest, foulest movie of the past few years. This is what a comedy should be: irreverent, insulting, lazy, crass, insulting, rude, nasty, vile, dirty, unsexy. The movie industry produces 100s of unfunny comedies every year, insipid, boring, cheesy, politically correct comedies which the mainstream movie goers gobble up unknowingly. But in the end they are almost all boring. Comedy is the hardest cinema form. Comedy works best in live theatre, but there is something about the glossiness and "perfectionism" of the movie medium that generally kills any comedic sense. Through the years, I've liked very few comedies, Something about Mary, Eddie Murphy's Raw, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mama Mia come to mind, but I'm generally bored to death in comedies, especially crap like Arthur, which had not a funny original line in it. As the years go by, I am more and more disappointed by Oscar tastes, and 2010 was one of the worst Oscars events in history for me. The more I see of Portman and Franco, the more I dislike them, and it's in that vein that they were perfect for this movie. They were delectably horrible, each playing their own very stereotypical one-dimensional characters, Franco with his goofy smile and walk, and Portman with her strained "I am so serious" look from Black Swan.Your Highness is not for anyone who dislikes sex jokes and foul language. Religious folks and puritans keep clear. But I enjoyed myself thoroughly and was not bored for a more than a second here and there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible alternate summary: "Pleasantly surprising" I am a fan of all of these main actors, but somehow just didn't see McBride and Franco pulling off the medieval theme. Sufficed to say, being an avid fan of Monty Python, Mel Brooks, and The princess Bride, I was able to find Your Highness quite entertaining. The film includes so much more story than is let on in the trailers. Yes, there is raunchy humor and the standard bumbling idiot, but I was surprised at how often I was taken in by the actual plot and adventure. During the more serious and even whimsical moments, the stoner humor is at the back of the mind and the viewer feels as if they're watching a legit adventure film full of mythology and magic. Then, just at the right times, we're brought back to smiles with some dumb-witted comment or situation. The balance of the two was great.Think of Your Highness as more serious than Robin Hood: Men In Tights, with more over-the-top comedy than Stardust or Princess Bride.HAZZAH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best modern comedies I have seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My rating is based on how entertaining the film was.I laughed out loud (very hard) very often and whilst some of the jokes (especially at the beginning) were hit and miss, they served to set up the humour / mood of the film.Yes, the jokes are extremely crass and often vulgar but for every one joke that takes things too far or isn't funny, there are another five that will make you choke on whatever you are eating or drinking.The cast was superb and it is nice to see Natalie Portman not descending into tailor-made Oscar film fodder (even though this film may have been completed before she won her Oscar). I think the people who are rating this down may not understand that this film is a blatant p*ss-take of all the old "chivalry" and "save the virgin" cr*p that took itself too seriously and was equally as 'sex-oriented' and sexist in its portrayal of women but just pretended to be noble about it!Also: this film had some shockingly good special effects!This film is funny as hell and I strongly recommend you watch with friends who have a similar sense of humour; especially if you enjoyed American Pie.Very glad I watched this.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably not as bad as you've heard; but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A not-quite disastrously bad comedy flick, Your Highness isn't a good movie; but it has some inspired casting and actual bits of comedic glory (such as the line - "I will never be your friend because I hate mechanical inventions").It's a movie full of crude and vulgar jokes/humor so if you'd rather sip a cup of tea than drink a round of pints ... this movie won't be for you. The movie works (on a base-level) simply because it aims for low-ball. Even though the film is called Your Highness it doesn't reach for any high, lofty heights.James Franco (Milk, 127 Hours, Spiderman) and Danny McBride (Tropic Thunder, Hot Rod, The Pineapple Express) play brother princes. The dumb bo-hunk Fabious (Franco) is the golden-child who is about to marry Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel -- Elf, (500) Days of Summer, Failure to Launch), a lovely young maiden who had been kept in a tower all of her days (!) until Fabious rescued her. Before the wedding can take place, the evil, ugly wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux - Charlie's Angels, Mulholland Drive) re-abducts the girl ... which sets the brothers and their band of men on a quest to save the maiden. Damian Lewis (Band of Brothers) plays an iron-fisted (literally which makes for some uneasy chuckles) co-hort of Fabious and they meet up with the tough Isabel (Natalie Portman - Black Swan, Closer, Heat) who comes along to assist with their quest.Fabious has been on countless quests over his life; but this is the first for McBride's Thadeous (the film's main character) and he is most-definitely a fish-out-of-water. The film is packed with base and bawdy jokes/gags and crude is the name-of-the-game. This is not high-brow at all.That Your Highness is a cheesy film -- there is no question. If one likes it or not depends upon how much one likes cheese ... and while I do appreciate a good cheese plate this should have been a lot better as there are LITERALLY too many gags throughout the film to greatly appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was exactly what I expected, and I was very entertained. There should be more of these types of movies that combine adult humor and the Medieval age together. This will be a cult classic years down the road. McBride and Franco are perfect together. Thadeous and Fabious are sons of the King. Fabious is brave and heroic, while Thadeous is a lazy slacker. On the day of Fabious and Belladonna's Wedding, an evil sorcerer named Leezar kidnaps her. The two brothers go on an epic journey to try and rescue her. Along the way, they'll have to deal with betrayal, nymphs, witches, beasts and more. If you want a silly comedy to watch with your friends, I highly recommend YOUR HIGHNESS!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Your Highness' is directed by David Gordon Green and stars Danny McBride, James Franco, Natalie Portman, Zooey Deschanel and Justin Theroux in a hilarious and quite ridiculous comedy. Danny Mcbride not only stars in the film but also co-wrote it with Ben Best. The film centers on a lazy, incompetent Prince named Thadeous (McBride), who is always pushed out of the limelight because of his beautiful, brave, warrior brother, Fabious (Franco). Fabious is next in line to become King, and is in love with Belladonna (Deschanel) who was a damsel in distress that was locked up in Leezar's (Theroux) castle. After Fabious rescues Belladonna he proposes and demands to marry her as soon as possible. But, evil Leezar will do anything to destroy Prince Fabious's life. He decides to kidnap the virgin Belladonna and sleep with her before Prince Fabious can. Fabious doesn't have much of an army and his father, King Tallious demands Thadeous to join Fabious on this adventurous quest to become more of a man. Can Thadeous and Fabious defeat Leezar before it's too late?? This film was hilarious. It's supposed to take place in medieval times yet every word out of their mouths are curse words and modern phrases. The acting was great; I loved how serious James Franco and Natalie Portman were. Portman portrayed Isabel, a young girl that had all of her brothers murdered and is now seeking vengeance against Leezar. She is a tough, brave fearless fighter. Danny McBride was great as this lazy, modern Prince from another time period.I love the idea of 'Your Highness'. The time period is fascinating and most films that are set in this time are serious, long and complicated. 'Your Highness' was fun, short and sweet. It was comical but still made sense; the storyline wasn't completely dumb as most random comedies are.I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to go to the theaters to escape from reality, not think about anything and just wants to relax and watch something totally ludicrous and funny. Just to warn you it is very crude!!! But, there is nothing like 'Your Highness'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I would not have gone to see this if all the movies I wanted to see had not either been full or meant waiting an hour. I am glad I did, tho' foulmouthed it made me think about how Shakespeare was in the jargon of his times very dirty indeed. Even the US to UK translation is a bit lost. (We don't say beaver in UK/Aus English) It was very funny and I am sure the Great Will would have loved it. Natalie Portman, surely the hardest working actress in Hollywood, manages to be funny by saying the ridiculous with a seriousness that is unbelievable. Danny McBride is of the nudge-nudge school of humour, but surrounded by Franco and Portman who play for straight, this comes off well. Franco did not look well in some scenes.... Good playing by all the Brits involved, made in UK I would think. Toby Jones pops up, has been popping up in movies all my life. Charles Dance played it very straight. And Zooey was perfect, Belladonna and prince Fabious deserve each other. All in all an unexpected belly laugh.</fullReview>

The lead roles played by Danny McBride, James Franco and Natalie Portman are all played hysterically. I especially enjoyed the film's originality. It's seldom that you see studios green light such a film. So when one comes along I appreciate its uniqueness and give it my support.

		<shortDescription>Your Highness - High-larious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I weren't the open-minded, light-hearted individual that I am, Your Highness would have left me offended, unamused, and bored. Thankfully, I find vulgarity hilarious. This movie was jam-packed with it, too. Foul language, blood and guts, and naked women. Lots of them. If this doesn't sound like your idea of a good time then you should probably stop reading here because it is only going to get worse.James Franco plays Fabious, brother of Thadeous played by Danny McBride. Thadeous is the Goofus to Fabious's Gallant. Charles Dance plays their father King Tallious. Tallious wants his slacker son Thadeous to get on the ball and start setting out on quests like his brother. However, Thadeous is perfectly happy to lounge around and hang out with his servant Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker). Upon arriving home from yet another quest, Fabious tells his father of his great news. He has not only come home victorious once again, but this time he has with him his bride-to-be Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel). He rescued her from the tower in which the evil Leezar was keeping her and now they are to wed. But what of his best man? His brother of course. Only, his brother wants nothing to do with the job and bails.There is something about the way Danny McBride delivers expletives that makes him the comedic relief in any film. Up in the Air has got to be the only film in which I've seen him where he doesn't drop a variety of four-letter words on us. Yet, he was still very funny! Some actors just have that. His fondness for the female anatomy is unparalleled. He's really something.At the wedding of Fabious and Belladonna, Leezar (Justin Theroux) crashes the event and claims his prisoner once again. This brings about the first quest that Thadeous will set out on. The laugh out loud moments are plentiful if you're willing to overlook the obvious and abundant vulgarity.Later in the movie we meet Isabel played by Natalie Portman. I am thoroughly convinced that you could put her in a burlap sack, remove every drop of makeup from her face, and she would still be phenomenally gorgeous. She is what I like to call unfairly pretty. It's as though she took the pretty from 100 girls. There are one hundred homely girls out there because Natalie Portman took all of their beauty and kept it for herself. This is me trying to rationalize. Seriously though, she is quite fetching indeed and a fantastic talent. She holds her own on-screen with the guys and exhibits tremendous comedic timing.This movie was directed by David Gordon Green. The same man who directed the boring and mostly pointless Pineapple Express.

		<fullReview>Crassness can have a charm of its own; this movie does not. It is agonizingly, embarrassingly slow and unfocused. It uses foul language, not as the poetry of Deadwood, but as adolescent boys shouting obscenities in the dark, sniggering and daring each other to try and say "doo-doo head" in more graphic terms.The Trivia section says that all lines were extemporaneous; I believe it. besides the dreadful pacing and self-conscious (but not at all funny) vulgarity, the dialog is horrible and the editing, not surprisingly, is full of half-lines and dead-end conversations. If you are Michael McKeen, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, then you can wing it; these guys ain't them.James Franco, for all his James Dean prettiness, is the only one who commits to this disaster. He really tries to fulfill a character which is as poorly defined and unfocused as the rest. At least in the first 40 minutes, after which I walked out. Watching golf would have been a better use of my time. I'm glad that I did not see Ms. Portman's performance as it would have been tragically wasted or equally bad.Don't. See. This.

		<fullReview>'YOUR HIGHNESS': Four Stars (Out of Five) This is one of those movies that's not quite as funny as it thinks it is but when it works it really works. It starts out a little slow with good jokes kind of few and far between but once it gets it's flow going the jokes come more steadily and the movie does get funnier and funnier. David Gordon Green, who also directed the film's stars Danny McBride and James Franco in 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS', directs and McBride also co-wrote the film with buddy and long time collaborator Ben Best (although Green says the dialogue was completely improvised and McBride and Best only provided a written outline, sounds like my old films). The most beautiful and amazing person in the world, Natalie Portman co-stars.McBride plays Thadeous and Franco plays Fabious, the two sons of King Tallious (Charles Dance). Fabious is a noble and well liked warrior who constantly honors his father's kingdom. Fabious is self centered, lazy and not very talented. He's envied his brother since childhood. When Fabious brings home a virgin he's rescued, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), and makes Thadeous his best man his brother is a no-show at the wedding. Then Belladonna is kidnapped again by the wizard who held her captive since childhood, Leezar (Justin Theroux), at the wedding. He plans to rape her in order to fulfill a prophecy and father a dragon that will help him take over the kingdom. The King orders Thadeous to assist his brother on a quest to rescue his future bride , against his wishes, before this happens. They're also joined by Thadeous's favorite servant, Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker), and Fabious's right hand men as well as a female warrior, Isabel (Portman), they meet on their journey, with her own plot against Leezar.The movie has some of the best lines and funniest moments of any film this year. Lines like "If your vagina is anything like my hand there will be no problems" and Natalie Portman saying "That feeling has been burning in my beaver". I'll admit it's not as consistently funny as I was expecting and a little disappointing. It's definitely not as good as 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS'. Green's career has taken an interesting path, criticized by some, going from critically acclaimed dramas (like 'GEORGE WASHINGTON' and 'ALL THE REAL GIRLS') to lowbrow comedies (like this and 'PINEAPPLE') but I think showing diversity like this is very impressive. This movie, like 'PINEAPPLE', has some seriously well shot and impressive action scenes as well as great visuals. It might not be as funny as some are hoping but it's still memorable and amusing all in it's own way. When it's not funny at least the jokes aren't painful to watch like a lot of movies, which it deserves credit for. Overall I'd say it's a mostly highly enjoyable film.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdMAdy47IrI</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is absolutely nothing of redeeming social value in this raunchy 2011 fantasy comedy, but there are some absurdly funny bits here and there to make it mildly infectious at times. Directed by David Gordon Green, who started in indie films (the acclaimed "George Washington") but last helmed the stoner farce "Pineapple Express", the film relies heavily on scatological banter, lowbrow sight gags, and over-the-top CGI effects to punctuate the sophomoric screenplay by star Danny McBride and Ben Best. McBride stars as Prince Thadeous, the cowardly brother of the heroic Prince Fabious, who is about to marry the wide-eyed virgin Belladonna when lo and behold, the villainous wizard Leezar kidnaps her and traps her in a tower like Rapunzel.Of course, that's the cue for Fabious to take Thadeous and his manservant Courtney to search for her with the aid of a band of knights who soon betray him. Although this is a medieval story with the appropriate sets and costumes, not much of the script is played to period. For the most part, the movie feels like a tribute to the likes of Mel Brooks, Cheech &amp; Chong, and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", with the garrulous McBride conveying his character's over-sized bravado with tongue firmly in cheek. Meanwhile, James Franco plays Fabious with his slightly askew, surfer-dude manner intact, while Zooey Deschanel plays Belladonna with only a modicum of her usually ironic delivery. As Leezar, Justin Theroux has a field day with the wizard's grandiose manner and lascivious intensity.Rasmus Hardiker manages to give dimension to the seemingly enfeebled Courtney who inexplicably remains devoted to Thadeous despite the constant humiliation he experiences. Midway through the film enters Natalie Portman as Isabel, a merciless, Xena-like warrior who doesn't suffer fools gladly. Playing the polar opposite of her Oscar-winning role in "Black Swan", she is convincing in her predictably cardboard role as a fiery avenger, whether thwacking the heads of a hydra in a Thunderdome-type arena or beating Thadeous up without breaking a sweat. Even with all the high-octane scares and thrills, the creators never forget to surrender to their more puerile instincts like the minotaur's legacy around Thadeous's neck. And yes, I laughed every time I saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for this movie I knew I had to go see this . I enjoyed the Mony Phyton movies, Men in tights and the Princess Bride so I was looking forward to this. However this movie would not be as good as any of the above. If I had a choice again I would probably save my money and wait till it comes out on DVD. Basically in the story you have two princes, one is a hero and one is useless. The useless one gets his chance to prove he is worthy when is hero brother has his virgin fiancé kidnapped by an evil Wizard. The first 20 Min's are very entertaining because the humour is refreshing. Good to see unexpected modern language in the dialogue and funny references to drugs, perverts and sex. However this theme continues throughout the whole movie and becomes very predictable and the laughs become too obvious. I went from laughter to light giggling to smirking. Has some money has been spent on the movie some of the effects are actually pretty good although they do use crap special effects in some scenes for humour sake. I would say the most amusing part of this movie is that a lot of the dialogue is improvised. Lessar played by Justin Theroux certainly relishes in this role and was the most entertaining character in it. Natalie Portman also looked great and it was nice to see she is not taking life too seriously. If you absolutely love simple humour which requires no brains then you will enjoy the movie, However I would pre warn you that don't set your expectations too high as you will be disappointed. Light entertainment if you want something to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took in this movie and I have to say that while there were some decent laughs here and there, for the most part it was face-palm humor and the "dear lord, thats terrible" sight gags and jokes. The plot was lame, no surprise, this is a "stupid" comedy but it had all the standard knights vs evil wizard plot line with the lesser brother resenting his popular older brother and learning to be a hero along the way (sort of). My biggest complaint wasn't the juvenile humor but the juvenile dialogue. The lines sounded like the script was handed to a half dozen 14 year-old's with instructions to "make it sound cooler" by adding gratuitous profanity, genitalia references and excrement jokes. The whole thing is a mish-mash of toilet humor and Beavis and Butthead grade plot lines. To quote "The Critic" ... "It Stinks!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It maybe too vulgar for some ,but it is the funniest movie I have seen in quite some time. Natalie Portman is very good and gorgeous as usual. James Franco is hilarious and Danny Mcbride is classic. Another classic moment is hearing Natalie Portman talk about her beaver, thats something i'd never thought i would hear from her but it was hilarious. Courtney is a great character and very funny as well. Zooey Deschanel is enchanting as she has been and always will be. This is an instant classic and will be loved for years to come. It goes Straight to the top of my favorite comedy movies of all time. A very good non family movie. Portman + Deschanel + Franco = Excellence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Your Highness' has trouble finding its footing but eventually finds it way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what has been said, this film has very little relation to Pineapple Express other than the fact that it is from the same director and features a few of the same actors. There is also the misconception that it is a "stoner comedy" which is not the case. There may be two or three instances where a "magical herb" is smoked, but that is all. It's not much of a comedy at all, really. There are a few moments where you laugh, but the film is actually an epic. It centers around the life of the lazy and useless Prince Thadeous (Danny McBride) who admires his "perfect" older brother, Fabious (James Franco), but is also jealous of everything that he has accomplished. But when the evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux) kidnaps Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), Fabious' bride-to-be, the two brothers must unite on a quest to rescue her; accompanied by Thadeous' servant, Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker). On their journey, they face much peril: everything from deception to a five-headed beast to a minotaur and even a very strong-willed, ass-kicking heroine.. Isabel (Natalie Portman). Truly, it is the ultimate geek movie. It was shot on the massive scale of a Lord of the Rings film, covering all the basics of any medieval-styled story. It definitely took it a little while to find its footing, but it did shape up. The only real problems with it are the writing, which in areas could be a little rough, and Danny McBride, who seemed to be trying too hard to get the laugh, presenting himself as annoying and unfunny. The rest of the cast, however, was brilliant. It's always fun to see actors such as Franco and Portman step down from their Oscar roles and just have fun. Zooey Deschanel has always been a great actress, who does have a smaller part in this film as she typically does, but she is always one that you don't forget. Rasmus Hardiker is a little-known actor from the UK who I think will get more recognition after this film; he played the role of a servant but really did a great job with his performance and has terrific comedic timing and ability. The special effects were done very well and it was really a fun time experiencing it on the big screen; it just had this booming epicness to it that really sucked you into the action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time actually compelled to write a review, please have a heart.Based on the trailers, advertised storyline and cast I was anticipating a somewhat off-beat funny movie with reservations knowing the director was a part of the awful "Pineapple Express" Thought give it a shot anyway. I really expected to leave this movie feeling good...Disappointed, betrayed, ripped off (keep in mind I just left the theater just hours ago - I actually feel like I lost IQ points) really what else would explain my sitting through such trash...Natalie Portman, that is it... I ended up going to the movie thinking she is going to give it some credibility, something fun from a good actress in an atypical comedy. She pulled out most of the 4 point rating for me, The scenery and overall appearance was good.I saw nothing else in this movie that warranted anything extra.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, let me say I pretty much worship the ground that Danny McBride walks on - he has made some of the best comedy EVER (foot fist way, eastbound and down), and David Gordon Green has some chops as well. I'm not quite as crazy about James Franco, but heck he was awesome in Freaks and Geeks, and he's not too hard on the eyes.So, I was going into this movie expecting a few laughs at least. And that's exactly what I got... a ~few~ laughs, a ~very few~ laughs. I noticed something was off within the first few moments and things never improved.There were a number of jokes that fell totally flat, I'm talking silence in a full house of people who paid nothing to see this. There were some jokes that the teenagers in the audience seemed to appreciate, but overall the audience response was weak, and it felt like the movie had been thrown together without much thought. Or like it had been made about two years ago and sat on a shelf until Natalie Portman won her Oscar and someone decided to release this.I rarely walk out of movies but I was tempted tonight. They took something that was potentially a good idea and made it a total bore. If you're a fan of Danny McBride, I'd actually advise you to avoid this film as it will degrade your opinion of him.On the positive side, I guess you could say that McBride and James Franco had okay chemistry - I would be interested to see these two dudes just hanging out and cracking jokes, and that would be more interesting than "your highness". Oh, and as for the reviewer comparing this to "Princess Bride" ... I don't think so. Not even in the same universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be when I recorded it, that way I could delete it if it was bad. Zooey Deschanel plays the kidnapped princess, this is by the obligatory bad wizard. Thadeous is basically a coward and is second in line for the throne. His brother is a mighty warrior of course. By the end of the movie Thadeus has grown into a semi-brave, almost hero. Natalie Portman plays a rather butch archer on the same quest as Thadeous and Fabiuos, almost. She is out to slay the wizard while the brothers ore out to rescue Zooey and then kill the bad guy. I thought this was pretty good over all and not nearly as bad as I had feared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Vulgar Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailers for this movie, I expected a decently funny movie with not much more than a couple laughs. My prediction was spot on: except instead of just a couple of laughs, I got tons. Your Highness was incredibly funny- though the humor was vulgar. The humor in this movie matched with the likes of Step Brothers, Pineapple Express, Role Models, etc.. This movie is no Godfather but it's not supposed to be, it's supposed to be a comedy jammed with crude sex jokes and absolutely retarded characters. The humor in this movie is extremely spontaneous, I guarantee none of the scenes or jokes are ones that you've seen before. On top of the great comedy, there is a great cast. Natalie Portman portrays a lone warrior very well, while James Franco portrays the honorable, brave, and adored Prince. Then there is Danny McBride who delivers his part extremely well with all sorts of jokes and stupidity. Another actor I would like to mention is a relatively unknown actor, Rasmus Hardiker who plays Courtney, Danny MacBride's servant. He played his part brilliantly and I found myself laughing at most of his scenes. All in all, if you're looking for another movie that will lighten up the mood and produce A LOT of laughs, this is the movie for you. If you want a movie to provoke your thoughts, then this is the dead opposite of what you want to watch. However, I think that this was one of the best comedic movies of the year and therefore I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why some people have written negative reviews about Your Highness, it won't appeal to everyone, but then again I don't think it aims to. Your Highness, isn't trying to win any academy awards, it's a comedy and as comedies go its pretty good. To me there was a good deal of laughs in this film. Franco is the perfect straight man to Mcbride's idiocy. The scene by the campfire had me laughing my head off, just at the sheer awkwardness, coupled with Franco's perfect comic timing. The supporting cast also do a good job, the self-pitying Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker) gets some laughs. Natalie Portman plays a brilliant role as a heroine out for revenge. The evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux) does have some jokes which fall flat, but these are quickly forgotten amongst the other gags in the film. There are some rather crude jokes (the child molestation ones for example), however these actually suit the tone of the movie and are ultimately quite funny. I thoroughly recommend Your Highness to anyone; don't let some of the critics put you off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rude, crude, lewd with cannabis-laced jokes and homophobic humor, this imaginative, often infantile-minded,special effects-laden, medieval tale about knights, sword-wielding warrior maidens, a lecherous sorcerer, a five-headed dragon, and an abducted virgin scheduled to be raped during a lunar eclipse is pretty funny if you don't mind trolling the gutter for laughs. Danny R. McBride, who stars in it and co-scripted it, plays Thadeous,the cowardly, second-born brother of Prince Fabious (Oscar nominated actor James Franco of "Flyboys") who has returned home from a triumphant quest with a virgin bride, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), to the delight of his father, King Tallious (Charles Dance of "Last Action Hero"). Fabious wants Thadeous to serve as his best man. Initially, Thadeous likes this idea because he will get to sleep with all the bride's maids, but he spends more time smoking pot that appearing at the wedding. Disaster strikes when Leezar (Justin Theroux), the man who had keep Belladonna confined to tower, interrupts the wedding and kidnaps her again. Fabious sets out to find his bride and a reluctant Thadeous accompanies him with his man servant Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker) in tow. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful warrior gal, Isabel (Natalie Portman of the second "Star Wars" trilogy) who happens to be a crack shot with a bow and arrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about something so wondrously delivered? Crass but witty, Your Highness is hilarious! From start to finish, it is entertaining, absorbing and refreshing. And further more it doesn't take the weird route most Comedies take now, with some super serious moment or trying to teach a lesson. It's funny from point A, to Point B, period. It is a comedy, it sells as a comedy and doesn't attempt to decipher the world in any way. It's D&amp;D for the big screen. Dragons, wizards, kingdoms and two moons. It's a complete relaxing break from the Real world. I had my skepticism, most movies have been underwhelming as of late, but Your Highness never let's you down. It never disappoints. Finally, a sincerely funny slapstick Film. Ten stars, Danny McBride, Ten stars!</fullReview>

Another great failure was the villain, not only poorly written and poorly acted he never at any point seemed like a real threat to heroes or kingdom. How can protagonists be portrayed as truly great if their antagonists are mediocre? The real disappointment is that you get a sense of where the directors and writers wanted to go (a spoof of heroic fantasy) but because the writers insisted on contriving situations to employ their bad jokes and supposedly "shocking" language everything fell flat.</fullReview>

I was literally waiting to laugh for the whole movie. If you want a chuckle all you need to do is watch the red-band trailer. There is no reason to see this movie. It's not a good comedy and it's not a good fantasy. The lines are hackneyed and inconsistent and the humor is non-existent. Someone compared this to Monthy Python and the Holy Grail.

		<fullReview>"Your Highness" seems to be a love-it or hate-it kind of film. Almost every professional review of the film you come across ranks it as an unmitigated disaster. Yet almost every armchair critic who has seen it seems to reserve a soft spot for the film, hailing it as an entertaining guilty pleasure. In this particular debate, I feel compelled to throw in my opinion (for what it's worth). And, sadly, I think the professionals got it absolutely right on this occasion. Possibly the most misguided movie ever made, a cringe-worthy embarrassment that fails profoundly to recreate the heyday of those wonderful '30s and '40s pirate flicks, "Your Highness" is simply staggering in its awfulness.Roguish buccaneer Fabious (Jimmy Franco) sails the Caribbean seas with his motley crew in search of adventure. Having rescued his friend Danny McBride ( Thadeous ) from the gallows, he next finds his path crossed with wronged lady aristocrat Isabel Barnet (Natalie Portman). Although initially Isabel and Fabious can barely stand each other, they soon find themselves united in their struggle to rid Jamaica of its corrupt governor King Tallious. After various adventures - sword-fights, duels, rescues and romances - they complete their mission and, of course, the bickering hero and heroine finally realise they're in love.Franco is criminally wasted as the roguish Fabious, given nothing to do other than look dashing. Any actor with a touch of charisma could have pulled off the role - it's just a boring part for an actor who looks rightly bored with it. Portman is equally wasted as a thoroughly helpless, irritating and unresourceful leading lady. But by far the worst of the main parts - and one which left me genuinely embarrassed for the actor involved - falls to Charles Dance. Poor Charles Dance is left to deliver some of the worst dialogue imaginable as the villain of the piece, his terrible lines further heightened by the campy approach in which he is asked to indulge himself. While the music and the location photography deserve a better showcase, every other aspect of the film royally stinks! It is scripted with naive ineptitude; plotted without originality; directed without the slightest sense of spirit or period; and presented so unevenly that it is impossible to tell whether we are watching something serious or slapstick. Those who have found things to enjoy in "Your Highness" are welcome to it.... personally, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy unless the alternative was like, one of those terrible Johnny-Depp-as-a-princely-courtier budget features!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adventurous comedy that will leave you with a burning desire deep within your beaver.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pineapple Express was the first film by David Gordon Green that I had the pleasure of sitting through. From what I hear, his earlier films are entirely different and worth looking into. It's something I fully intend on doing, but in the mean time I love Pineapple Express to a ridiculous extent. That's one of the main reasons I was so excited to see Your Highness. With Green involved along with James Franco and Danny McBride, I was expecting something at least of equal greatness. While Your Highness doesn't really come anywhere near being as good as Pineapple Express, it's still entertaining enough to warrant a viewing in theaters. The opening credits to the film may have actually been more enjoyable than the film itself. A giant Grimm's-fairy-tale-like book opens up while a narrator introduces us to the likes of Thadeous (Danny McBride) and Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker). After some shenanigans on their part, we're thrown into the opening credits full of illustrations of Thadeous and Courtney as they try to run back home to safety. The style of the artwork is like a colorized version of artwork you might find in a novelized version of a well known fable. It was really a fantastic way to open the film that fit the overall tone of the film like a glove.The film seemed to move along incredibly well at first. The pacing was swift, but was just the right speed to keep the characters moving toward completing their quest while also being somewhat hilarious along the way. Hearing actors spew rather extravagant lines of profanity in a medieval kind of time period was funny in itself. It was just so out of place that it made simple lines more humorous than they should have been. The pacing begins to crumble around the time Isabel (Natalie Portman) enters the picture. It felt like everything the film had going for it was thrown away for immature pranks and attempts at getting women into bed. It's not like that didn't fit the storyline though as it fits the Thadeous character perfectly and it's definitely more his story than Fabious' (James Franco), but that could be the film's biggest flaw. It probably would have been better to have the stoner brother be a secondary character rather than the primary one.Many of the scenes involving magic and Julie's (Toby Jones) scene in the forest before he gets disrobed were reminiscent of Star Wars while Marteetee's (John Fricker) gauntlet that eventually saw the five headed hydra had a bit of a Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome vibe to it. Then there's the ending that's straight out of Robin Hood: Men in Tights. If you couldn't tell by its influences, Your Highness manages to blend several different genres. The special effects aren't too shabby either, but the film introduces audiences to a few things you've probably never seen before in a film like this. While the minotaur manages to look fantastic, there is an interesting and unexpected story point involving the character that'll either make you laugh or groan in disgust. You probably haven't seen anything like a puppet wanting a tugjob from two grown men since Meet the Feebles either.Despite its obvious similarities to Pineapple Express, Your Highness is an entirely different beast in comparison to David Gordon Green's previous works. The film is laugh out loud funny at times, but seems to jump further and further into the realm of immaturity as the film progresses. With shades of both Star Wars and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Your Highness may be an epic comedy on the surface but it also offers equal parts adventure and fantasy. While Your Highness may be lacking the strong storytelling of Pineapple Express and generally loses its pacing by the time Natalie Portman's character is introduced, it's still a mostly entertaining comedy adventure with its fair share of hilarity and sorcery fueled fantasy sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depends on your humor...a lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailers for this movie I thought that it would be a medieval spoof with some drug and crude humor. However, what I got instead was a large amount of profane jokes, an excessive use of the F word, and a large amount of jokes centered around the penis and vagina. In fact you could say that the whole story centered around these types of humor, which for me was not what I am interested in. Yet this does not mean it is a bad movie for everyone, I'm sure there are plenty of people who will enjoy this humor and think this movie is great. So what was good about this movie? The first thing I'll agree was good was the chemistry and wide personalities the main cast had in this film. James Franko and McBride were believable as brothers, and brought great depth to the rivalry experienced by brothers. Mix this in with a funny and unlikely hero named Courtney and you add another level of character jokes that had a lot of potential. Eventually, Natalie Portman comes in and you have a kick butt heroine who adds more variety for the pool of characters. The main villain played an obnoxious moron pretty well, but he wasn't as devious or evil as wizards can be. In fact he was more perverted than anything and if this is what they wanted for a character, then the actor has succeeded. A second positive is that some of the action scenes were exciting and fast paced, but still lacked the depth that other fighters had. I didn't expect much action though with it being a comedy. Perhaps the biggest things that I liked were the mechanical bird Simond, the pet lizard Steven, and the musical score that goes along well with the movie. The camera work was also done well and did not overshadow the content to be captured. What was bad about the movie for me? The first thing is the constant use of the F word every two or three minutes. Constant use of this word seems to suggest that the only vocabulary word writers know today is F***. It actually gets old after like the fifth or sixth use and becomes distracting from the rest of the dialogs. A second weakness for me the constant, smash it over your head, comedy centering on sex, oral sex, masturbation, and penis humor constantly being thrown in at every possible moment. Again if your a fan of this kind of humor you will probably enjoy this a lot more than I did. However, for me it got annoying and eventually made the dialogs of the film predictable and boring. The third weakness of this movie is its predictability in plot and the direction it takes. It doesn't take long for a major catastrophe or two to occur and this leads to various predictions of what will happen next, which leads to no plot twists or factors that make this movie extra special. Perhaps the fifth weakness is probably the drug humor in this movie, which is a little dry and played out. It seems that one of the brothers merely wants to smoke and have sex and actually reminds of a more upscale Real World or Jersey Shore character. Combine all these factors together for me and you get a movie that has some catchy jokes, some well done scenes, and great brotherhood relationships. Unfortunately all this is overshadowed by the crude humor and language that fills this movie. To finish this review I would like to give my rating for me, and a few other genre fans. For me I'm giving this movie a 3 out of 10 just because I am not the biggest fan of penis jokes and the F word being dropped left and right. For those of you who are impartial to these factors and are looking for a decent comedy, you may find this to be somewhere between a 6 and 7. Finally for fans of the Harold and Kumar series and Pineapple Express series, I'm thinking perhaps a 7-9 range depending on how easily your entertained, what you like about those movies, and how much slapstick predictability you like. Until tomorrow, this is rgkarim signing out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, walking into the theatre to see "Your Highness," I was a bit anxious. I had read tons of reviews surrounding this film and I was curious. The film was WAY better than expected. The dialogue was perfect. Sure, there were some curse words but they never came at a time that it wasn't normal for any person to use them. It was witty, humorous and contained lots of sexual innuendos.In terms of acting, Natalie Portman completely dragged the film. For being someone who just won an Oscar, this was terrible. Luckily she wasn't in the film as much. James Franco was sweet, sensitive and very noble, although his English accent was dry and boring, as was Danny McBride's.One thing that really stood out was the amazing graphics. Most of the film was shot in Ireland which was an added plus, due the fact that Ireland has beautiful countrysides. I really felt as if I was in this kingdom, journeying the quest with Thadius and Fabius.Overall, the movie was fantastic. If you love sexual innuendos done right, witty humor and great battle scenes, then this movie is for you. Definitely a movie that will stay funny after you watch it a few times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many references, Great writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a "parody" movie in any way. It smacks of Chaucer with its tone and premise: a pair of princely brothers (Franco &amp; McBride) going on a quest with a servant (Hardiker, who goes underrated) and a gender-bending amazon hottie (Portman) to save a damsel (Zooey) from a wicked wizard (Theroux). I'm not going to summarize the movie, but to provide an idea of how awesome this movie is, here is a list of films it either makes direct reference to or I at least felt a similar tone to:Princess Bride Robin Hood: Men in Tights Star Wars Kick Ass Lord of the Rings Clash of the Titans Army of Darkness Willow Highlander Eastbound and DownIf you think these cinematic triumphs could be combined into something awesome a) you are correct, and b) you should go check this movie out. The script was inventive, witty, and vulgar; beyond what Kevin Smith would do. Truly brilliant writing and acting. I had high expectations, and Your Highness delivered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is certainly a jack of all trades movie. With the best parts of every genre finding its way in. There was drama, action, comedy, and romance. The writing was raunchy but not stupid, if there is such a thing as intelligently raunchy, this is it. The characters Thadeus and Courtney carry the film. Natalie Portman was beautiful and an awesome heroine, James Franco, well he played the part well and was believable. Seriously, one of the funniest movies I've watched in a really long time. I was laughing for approximately 102 minutes--give or take a minute. Like another review said, this is certainly bound to be a classic. Way better than The Hangover in my opinion and certainly leagues better that Pineapple Express.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent - reminded me of The Princess Bride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a long review, but agree with previous reviewer..this is a future classic comedy film along the lines of Monty Python, Princess Bride or Evil Dead 3. This is just to say I found comedic connections to these classic comedies, I am not comparing movies. I was lucky enough to see a very early screening of this last week and it is so refreshing to see a comedy like this, after so many over-hyped and unfunny comedy movies - no need to mention any names. Superbly funny movie! I normally only smile through so-called comedies....but this a laughing out loud movie..I think it will be so popular when it's released in UK late April.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>all of the posts i have read are talking about the stupid accents and how Danny McBride sucks and is retarded and all that stuff blah blah blah this isn't supposed to be a serious movie. if you've ever seen any of Danny McBrides other movies you'd understand. Movies like Hotrod and tropic thunder and Land of the Lost with Will Farrell. Its the type of movie hes always been in and hes fantastic at it. Plus James Franco and Natalie Portman just came off Oscar winning / nominated performances, i wouldn't be at all surprised if they did this film just for the sake of having a little bit of fun. i mean come on Portman practically killed herself in her last movie and Franco cut his arm off, actors need breaks too :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darn. I was sooooo disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film a few times recently and was quite eager to see it. Besides the pedigree of filmmakers (hilarious Pineapple Express, etc) and a trailer that really made me laugh that seemed to not use only the best material from the movie unlike most trailers these days.So, when i picked to see an advance screening last night I stoked. But, I was sorely disappointed with what I saw. Not that the movie was a total loss and failure, it just was such a let down. Oddly enough, the best part of the movie was the non-comedic elements. It actually plays pretty well as a predictable homage to fantasy films. But other than a few chortles here and there the comedy falls flat. I am no prude, but the chief humorous device used is to have the fantastical character curse. Overused and obvious, just say the word "F**K" repeatedly and having obvious dick jokes was just tiresome and not funny. The slapstick falls flat and even the attempts at gross-out jokes a la Farrelly Brothers and Wayons brothers Scary Movie farces don't even rise ( lower?) to that level. And, Natalie Portman doesn't even show up until the second half of the movie! Sigh. What a let down.</fullReview>
