		<shortDescription>Review: Touching and Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo's directorial debut is a powerhouse of fine acting, writing, and direction, not to mention a showcase for some truly jaw-dropping cinematography. Buffalo 66 is one of the finest independent films that I have ever seen, and perhaps the most fascinating character study I have yet to see on film.Christina Ricci provides one of the year's best performances as Layla, the odd but tenderhearted tap dancer who provides Gallo's Billy Brown with the only true love he has ever received. Ricci's performance is brilliantly understated, and she relays just as much heartfelt meaning in one glance of her beautiful, dark eyes as Gallo does in his barrage of rapid-fire monologues.There are also fine supporting performances from Ben Gazzara and Angjelica Huston, as Billy's utterly dysfunctional parents, Mickey Rourke, as a sleezy bookie, Jan-Michael Vincent, as Billy's touchingly loyal friend and owner of a bowling alley, and Kevin Corrigan, as Billy's slow but well-meaning best friend.Buffalo 66 is an incredibly moving and beautiful film. It provides some of the starkest movie images of blue-collar society to come along since the '70s. The on-location Buffalo, New York sites are haunting in their bleakness, and the filtered photography emphasizes this all the more.On top of all of this, Gallo provides a mesmerizing performance as Billy Brown-a man who has spent so much of his life pining for love and tenderness that he doesn't know how to deal with it once it is staring him in the face.Simply put, Buffalo 66 is a staggering achievement. Vincent Gallo is a fiercely talented filmmaker and a force to be reckoned with in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never even heard of Gallo: just happened onto this film on IFC one night and totally loved it. The acting was superb, the story even more so; and that camera work! Gallo's character, Billy Brown, was a picture of hate and resentment due to his unfeeling, unloving parents who made it clear from day one that he wasn't wanted, much less loved. This pushing away by these heartless, empty people turned young Billy into a introvert who was only able to find love within the confines of his own dreamy mind. Of course, this was insufficient which drove Billy to acting out in some bizarre and dangerous ways. Finally, when love does come it terrifies him and causes him to push away this affection continuing the cycle started by his parents. At times I found myself rocking with laughter at the antics of these hurting and emotionally scarred folks, but the tale was anything but comical. I wish there were more pictures coming out as interesting and dramatic as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buffalo '66 is an amazing and original film: well scripted, scored, cast, directed, and acted by Vincent Gallo.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buffalo '66 was really original in terms of both plot and style. At moments, the story of Billy Brown's life is so terribly tragic and bizarre, you almost have to break the tension by cracking a laugh. In the film, Vincent Gallo's ex-jail bird character, Billy Brown, kidnaps a young tap-dancer named Layla, played by Christina Ricci, to pose as his wife on his visit back home to his dysfunctional family. The colors are beautifully bold and somehow elegant by being so far past tacky. The film is really great.The story is actually based somewhat on Vincent Gallo's own traumatic life. The Sinatra song that the Billy Brown's father sings to Layla in the bedroom is actually a tape of Vincent Gallo's father, Vincent Gallo, Sr. I read in an interview that Vincent Gallo has scripted another movie he hopes to direct and feature in. He is trying to get enough money to do it all himself. I am curious to see how it turns out, since this film was allegedly wound so tightly around scraps of his own life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geez I tell ya, this Gallo's gotta be from Buffalo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And he is. Being from Buffalo myself, this is the best portrayal of Buffalo culture that I have yet to see in a film. Gallo got the accent, the attitudes, the hand gestures, the weather and the local obsession with the Bills down to a science. It's brilliant. I was particularly impressed by his not so subtle satire of the, for lack of a better word, "Bills culture."Angelica Housten's character's obsessive compulsive watching of games onVHS, her listening to a game at her son's funeral, Gallo's character's penchant for blaming all of his problems on the Bill's kicker make perfect sense if you know first hand how the Bills' treks to the superbowl became focal points for hope in an increasingly economically depressed city.Watching the scene where Gallo buys Ricci some hot chocolate and a heartshaped cookie for the guy who's sitting there to give to his girlfriend was like being home.There's alot in this film you might not get if you don't know Buffalo. The way Gallo portrays his beautiful understanding and acceptance of his roots putsjokes-of-films like "Bruce Almighty" to shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>buffalo 66 is a lot like its creator, vincent gallo: harsh, unkempt, dangerous looking,a sure bet to be a miserable loser. at first glance this film seems to have nothing going for it, but give it ten minutes and then see if you can turn away. a dissection of a loose circling collection of emotional misfits, Vincent Gallo's creation (he wrote, directed, starred in the thing and even wrote the original music for the film) of billy brown, his parents and Layla, the girl who comes to love him is an amazing thing. what at first sounds like annoyingly fake bravado soon reveals the tormented souls beneath. again and again the film confounds expectations morphing into one of the most moving and convincing portraits of love and redemption imaginable. a justly deserving winner of its numerous art film awards (especially those earned by former child actress christina ricci in a devastated angel performance)buffalo 66 earns all the risks it takes and reminds us that even the worst first impressions can sometimes be wrong</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning piece by Gallo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film for the first time I absolutely loved it! It was only after I purchased it on DVD that I saw in the credits just how much Gallo had to do with this film. He did just about everything major to complete this movie...from the music to the writing credits. Personally, I think that he did a fabulous job and I compliment him highly on this piece of motion picture art.I tend to take this story on a personal level. I have never been to prison, but I know that I can relate to a lot of what Gallo's character feels about his family. My family life was not too great whilst growing up, but it really put things in perspective for me to see someone who's parents are that oblivious to their son's most basic needs.Some of the scenes may seem absurd and extreme as far as the obliviousness of the parents, but in a sense I think that is what Gallo was trying to get across to the viewing audience. This factor makes it all the more pertinent as to why Gallo's character is the way he is. To me this film is a reflection of an individual's life who has nothing to lose and yet so much to gain. Everything from the cold and gloomy atmosphere during the first half of the film to Gallo's character's pessimistic demeanor and repetitiveness of phrases only emphasize the aura of his life-long frustration and contempt for the world while revealing his desperate and longing need to find something tangible for once in his life...something that he apparently never had and that he thankfully finds in the confidence of Ricci's character.I could go on and on and on about how much this film meant to me and how beautifully directed, written and acted out this piece of work is, especially in the end since I have had thoughts and have considered and contemplated such things in the past. I admit that the height of the film's end freaked me out for a few moments, but left me feeling overwhelmed with relief and joy during the final concluding moments.To sum up: You HAVE TO watch this film. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Echoes of Cassavetes..."Goodwill Hunting" rebuttal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo's has supplied us with more than just a powerful character driven pic with the touching "Buffalo '66". Somehow he has managed to provide a much needed counterpoint to another recent noteworthy effort, "Good Will Hunting".Instead of a pouting GQ-genius we get a main character much more common to everyday life. A simple loser trying to claw his way out of a hole that he never meant to dig for himself. A victim of circumstance who not only dosen't but couldn't know any better. It's a simple tale of desparation and lonliness that never shies away from cutting all the way down to the bone.Billy Brown is revolting. Greasy, unmannered, and fresh from jail, the viewer is given no reason at all to care about him. He kidnaps Layla (Ricci) in an effort to maintain the machinery of lies that he has constructed to keep his nebulus parents unaware of his time in jail.It becomes clear that she falls for him after meeting his parents and other major players in his life. Billy didn't just get the short end of the stick, he never even had a chance. At this point you are forced to ask why, instead of trying to connect with him, she isn't running for her life from this apparent maniac. But on closer examination you realize that you are also sticking around. Not simply to see what happens but to make sure that Billy turns out OK.Gallo want's to make it clear that Billy was warped from the outside in. From the day of his birth he was hated by his psychotic mother, played brilliantly by Anjelica Houston, because her going into labor prevented her from watching the "Big Game" in which her favorite team triumphed in the 1966 Superbowl. And it was another pivotal Bills game that doomed Billy Brown and sent him to jail for 5 years just as he entered adulthood. A stark contrast to the scene in "Good Will Hunting" where Damon and Williams charachters recount the famous Boston Red Sox victory and thereby establish a deeper connection on the road to that protagonist's healing.The road to Billy's wellness will have to be found elsewhere and with little help from anyone at all. He is forced to configure his own compass to guide him to the next step in his life and although it isn't pretty the result is far more belivable than "Good Will".Gallo used his microscopic budget well especially in the flashback and dream sequences. This work resonates with some of John Cassavetes' tradmark overtones without exploiting them. And I'm not just talking about the presence of Ben Gazzara.You can feel the cold of Buffalo seeping through every crack inside a given scene. You can also sense that the actors were given plenty of latitude to construct their charachters but we're directed with a special urgency. The end result enables the viewer to be propelled through the film instead of mearly left to watch it unfold before them.The screenplay delves into territory where Tarantino and his like fear to tread. A style of film making that depends more on raw performance than on well laid plans and clever constructs. Gallo chose his team well and trusted them to win it for him and they came through brilliantly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BUFFALO' 66 is Great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that Vincent Gallo made a film that i pretty much hated, THE BROWN BUNNY, It's reassuring that he still has made this great film. I really had a ball watching this one. From the opening sequence of him leaving jail to the heartwarming, yet chilling ending scene, this is a film with lots of great moments. A man has just gotten out of jail and is to visit his parents, but first he needs a girlfriend and decides to kidnap a ballet dancer and force her to role play as his girlfriend. But when she starts to get too into the idea, the man shows his limits in a series of comic events ranging from darkly funny, to very inspired. And yet in between these events are moments of extremely depressing and moody sort of moments that elevate the film into a truly original masterpiece. A little bit brutal, a little bit surreal, and very depressing, the film manages to strike a perfect balance of comedy and drama and incorporate them into a truly original independent classic. It's definitely not for everyone, as a lot of the films i comment on are, but the audience that it is made for will fall in love with BUFFALO' 66.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Outstanding Story and Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Buffalo '66" is a different kind of low budget film. It is the kind of film that most high budget films should attempt to emulate!Tons of congratulations to Vincent Gallo. He wrote the story and screen play, directed the film, and was the main star. People are always told to write what they know something about. It is true. Vincent wrote about Buffalo, New York, where he was born and raised. He even used the same house he grew up in as well as local places in Buffalo for his scenic backgrounds. I hear that the budget for this film was only $1.5 million dollars. It proves that a good story with good writing and actors who are intensely dedicated to their craft can surpass even the most expensive movie that is lacking in telling a meaningful story.I won't retell the story as enough has already been written about it. Vincent Gallo did a great job in his role as Billy Brown. Christina Ricci plays a wonderful low-keyed costarring role as Layla. I was pleasantly surprised to see Rosanna Arquette appear in a small role as Billy Brown's school heartthrob, Wendy Balsam. Look for her to appear in the scene at Denny's Restaurant. Anjelica Huston was wonderful as the disinterested mother, Jan Brown, who seems to have spent her life adoring the Buffalo Bills football team instead of being a loving mother. Ben Gazzara played his mean and overbearing father, Jimmy Brown. One actor who should have received film credit is Billy's only friend, Rocky the Goon played by Kevin Corrigan. Kevin was excellent in his role. Other notable surprises in this film are appearances by Mickey Rourke, Jan-Michael Vincent, Kevin Pollak, and Alex Karras. A number of small role performers seem to be local Buffalo citizens doing small one-liner parts as the film progresses around the City of Buffalo. A good move on director Vincent Gallo's part because using local citizens in speaking roles assures that the script is believable and natural. Regardless of the comments Vincent Gallo made about himself in his trivia section of his Internet Movie Database I think he deserves credit for bringing this film to the attention of the movie world. I would hope that Roger Ebert selects this film for one of his Overlooked Film Festival viewings. The film is that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Entertaining, and oddly-romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fell in love with this movie. Before I saw it, I didn't know much at all about Vincent Gallo. I saw the trailer that was attached to "Out of Sight" and was like "well, that looks interesting. Maybe I'll check it out sometime." It took me a long time to track it down, but it was so worth the wait. One thing I can honestly say, is that the trailer is NOT deceptive. It pretty much tells you EXACTLY what you're going to get. One thing I wasn't expecting thoug, was the humor. There were times in this movie that I had to rewind and watch over because I was laughing so hard from the previous scene that I missed what was going on. Despite the film's depressing tone and deliberately grainy look, there are a lot of laughs here. Most of them come from the character of Billy Brown.Never in my life, have I seen a more pathetic hero. The guy is almost totally unlikeable without ONE redeeming quality. In the opening frame, he's being released from Prison. He's been there for something like five years and it's obvious that he's coming out of there in the clothes that he was wearing when he went in. His wardrobe is hilarious and his red ankle boots are a laugh riot. As are his pants that appear to be about four inches too short. You can tell when you first see him that this guy is a real piece of work. The first ten minutes or so focus on our new friend trying to find a bathroom, without any luck. When he finally does find a restroom, he is harassed by an obese homosexual. This sets up a scene that is kinda sick but darkly funny.Next thing, we learn the plan (part of it anyway) that Billy has up his sleeve. We meet his lunatic parents through a phone conversation and learn that they are clueless that Billy has been in lockup for the last five years. Apparently, they are stupid enough to believe that their son has been working in a foreign country as a government agent. They also believe that he is married. So he has to find a girl to pose as his wife. This sets up even more hilarious scenes as he kidnaps a young tap-dancer. I'm not going to go much farther. But the movie does get even funnier. Not only is it funny but it covers a lot of emotions. Here's a guy who's clearly been a loser his whole life, trying desperately to impress his parents who could care less about him. It sounds really depressing, but it's actually inspiring and, because it ends on a high note, it's uplifting.While it may not be for everyone, it's still a very entertaining and rewarding film. It's been a few years since Gallo has done anything, but I'm really looking forward to his next project.If anything, I'd say that this is a black-comedy/character study. It's probably the most original film of 1998 and it did take a lot of chances with its unique style. I have no complaints about this movie whatsoever and I'm giving it the highest score possible. It's a 10+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Romance Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know Twilight? Where like, the guy is perfect and dreamy and all the teenage girls want to marry someone as perfect and dreamy as him? Yah, F that.When I showed my friend this movie his first response was "What does she see in him?" I was surprised. I didn't get what he didn't get. Yah, he's flawed. THAT'S THE POINT. It's easy to love someone who's perfect---anyone can do that. But to love someone so terribly insecure, wounded, paranoid, irritable, and a million other things--? That takes real love. Layla isn't weak for loving such a person, she is incredibly strong. Real life romance requires people being able to conquer the bad in order to grow, and that's what the whole entire point of this movie.Layla and Billy face their own, individual challenges.Layla has the emotional and social intelligence that apparently some of the audience lacks. Right from the beginning, right after their rough introduction, she sees through to his vulnerability when he is talking on the phone at the dance studio, telling lies about how he's at an expensive hotel. There is a sudden, short cut to her listening in on the bathroom, with a sad look on her face. She can see by the things that he pretends to be what he really is. Because if someone puts on an act, logic follows that's not what they are really like. So she sees him acting tough and high status, and uses simple powers of deduction to conclude that he is really sensitive and insecure. She doesn't fall in love with what he does but what he hides. What is hidden is his true self, and she lets him show it to her. She begins to see deeper into the reasons for his behavior when she is at his parents house. She is trying to talk to his parents and is being completely ignored. She gives a brief crushed and sympathetic look to the camera (Billy's perspective) before turning her attention to the TV as his mother commands her to "watch this play." She is extremely observant and knows how to give Billy a comfortable distance while simultaneously slowly coaxing him closer e.g. asking for a handshake and giving him a hug. Also when he indirectly confesses that he wasn't actually in a relationship with Wendy like he said he was, instead of calling him out or making him feel bad she asks afterward, "Did you have any other girlfriends?" This isn't the sign of a stupid, weak, one-dimensional character. She has a very contained personality, but she is the one who is more emotionally secure and stable, and acts as the rock that Billy never had. I thought it was all pretty obvious, but I guess if you're one-dimensional yourself, then yes, she's probably going to seem one-dimensional too.But the main focus is the challenge that Billy faces. While Layla is clear and upfront about her feelings, Billy has to struggle with a choice: to act on anger, hate and hurt, and to take his own life, or to take the path of love, get rid of his deep rooted negativity, and embrace life. He is faced with this struggle up until the last 5-10 minutes of the film, when he is face to face with the man who represents all the awful things in his life, and debates whether or not to shoot him and then himself. Throughout the whole movie he periodically tries to make good on his plans, calling the club, checking to see what time Scott Woods comes in, and so on. He has to wait, and spends this time with Layla. After looking Scott Woods in the face, and letting go of everything bad, you see a complete transformation into a sweet and happy man who has let go of his demons and found a reason to live. Love kept him from killing himself. Really, how more romantic can you get? I think another thing people have missed is the fact that it's supposed to be funny. It's a darker sense of humor, which I could see not everyone getting. But you're not supposed to take character flaws so seriously; they're exaggerated for comedic effect. And I want to say that I am from Buffalo, and he is dead on. I know people from Buffalo are mad at him, but come on, it's pretty much true. All the way from the houses covered in Bills merchandise to the annoying flat "a" in our accents which makes everyone else think we're Canadian. The whole movie has a consistent feel to it The bland and muted colors used throughout the film give it an ugly-beauty sort of feel which is very accurate to Buffalo's charm.This movie doesn't spell out for the audience everything they should think and feel. You have to interpret and analyze not the words of the conversations, but what they're trying to convey about the dynamics between people. The characters, motivations, feelings, are not force-fed, and I prefer it that way. If you aren't able to digest deeper meanings in movie, and need direct dialog and formulaic characters, then you have no business snooping around in independent films in the first place. And the whole entire thing was contingent on the last few minutes. If you don't sit down a watch a whole movie, what are you doing rating and reviewing it? Anyway---the reason why this movie is so great is because it doesn't try to push the common delusions that romance is all fairy-tales and bunny tails, but instead examines what love really is. Love isn't being rescued by Edward Cullen, it's being kidnapped by Billy Brown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gallo ditches conventionalism in Buffalo...let's be thankful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** out of **** stars The only sequence of Buffalo '66 that warmed my heart with thankful relief from almost two hours of wondering why the main character - Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo)- would make such unorthodox decisions against the obvious, right decisions, was during the last five minutes (approx.) of the film. What a pay off! What a tension breaking five minutes it was! I felt I could breathe easy after happily discovering that Billy is a man that can make loving, almost predictable and sane decisions after all, and all because of Layla (Christina Ricci), the new angel in his life, who he haphazardly "kidnapped" in a dance studio; who he finally realizes is his savior. We never find out much about Layla, if anything at all. Where does she come from and why is she the way she is? Why does she see a loving light in despicable Billy? Why doesn't she leave him, after so much verbal abuse and selfishness? I believe the reason she doesn't is because director, writer, composer and actor Gallo understands that in most scripts out of cliché Hollywood, she WOULD leave Billy. And then what kind of movie would we have? One that we've seen time and time again. The decisions that the characters make in Buffalo '66's entire time frame are the antithesis of conventionalism.What makes Billy Brown tick is strenuously simple, but only after a fair amount of contemplation after spending time with him: his parents, played by Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston, have systematically not given their son an ounce of validation of pride or yes, love, for his entire life, spent in frigid Buffalo, New York. Billy has spent his whole life excessively fabricating his importance in hope to gain that validation, but never with any success. Whether biological parents can demonstrate such intense apathy and coldness toward their own flesh and blood, as seen in this movie, is up for debate. But if they were able to be so callously and blindly bold, the bitter and sad result of such a man as Billy seems plausible. Gallo's skillful acting ability in his role floors me, because we actually somehow care for Billy. And why should we? Because through his sin we envision humanness that, I believe, we can all relate to: the errors we make; the lack of self-worth we may feel; loneliness; rejection; and the pain that is inflicted upon us from those who are supposed to unconditionally love us the most. Ricci's astounding performance, which I believe carries the most improvisation of any character in the film, brilliantly sheds the most light on the movie's message, which is: when someone cares about you more than themselves, it can truly change you for the better, no matter how much emotional baggage you may have. If we all had a Layla in our lives, psychiatrists would go into extinction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex like the human mind: An Uplifting story about an Upset man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters are so much like real people I have seen so often, all the outrageous behavior and insanity. Finding love in the times of moral depravation is a constant theme and it is fairly established that Billy has had a tormented childhood. He has grown up to become a very sentimental and emotional person in spite of his parents being uninterested and disconnected up to the point that the family seems severely dysfunctional. Contributing much to the introvert and overtly acidic nature of Billy. It is quite understandable. As to why Layla(Ricci) seems so jaded and emotionally unaffected, is not explained but it could be due to her bleak and isolated environment. The way she never tries to run away or raise an alarm when she has a chance, even though she is being abducted makes me feel that she somewhat needed to be rescued herself from the boring life she was in. In a way she wanted it to happen or she just started enjoying it. The Camera work is just brilliant, the perspective angles of view while Billy, his parents and Layla are having lunch is something I would forever remember. The memories and flashback are something that makes this movie go forward but in a very distinctive way. A benevolent but pushed down friend(Goon) and that he is always sleeping in his briefs whenever Billy calls him, Houston's performance of Billy's football fanatic mom and his foolish desperate act that landed him in jail at the first place are all hilarious and seem commonplace enough to be convincing. The heart shaped cookie and hot chocolate scene makes the movie almost cute. Ricci is one of my favourite actresses and she is one of those rare actors who can tell it all through their eyes. The movie never fails to satisfy my imagination. At the end the sudden reversal of Billy is just coming of age. There may be a few proponents of an alternate ending where Billy kills wood and himself out of years old hatred. That would have made the movie shocking but it would have had no hope. So the ending couldn't have been better. Vincent Gallo's performance is amazingly erratic and a good study for theatrical purposes. It's all about a man struggling to stay sane in an insane world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding script, great characters; fine film all around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a non-fan of ex-con movies; I find Dustin Hoffman's critically acclaimed STRAIGHT TIME especially odious, for instance. Accordingly, I was about to stop watching BUFFALO '66 during the first scene. Thankfully, I kept the tape rolling to be ultimately rewarded by one of the best indie films I have ever seen. Vincent Gallo has put together an excellent character study set against the grimy, subfusc background of his home town.Christina Ricci deserves the near-unanimous praise she has received for her eminently appealing, understated portrayal of a cooperative kidnaping victim. The spectrum of expressions that chase across her lovely heart-shaped face in the photo booth is especially memorable. This is not to take anything away from Gallo's acting though. His rhythmic, repetitious remonstrations are quite addictive, and I have since found it difficult to keep from imitating his verbal style while dealing with people at work. Ben Gazzara and Angelica Huston are also outstanding as parents in a family so dysfunctional it makes the subjects of AMERICAN BEAUTY look like something out of the Donna Reid Show. A nearly unrecognizable Mickey Rourke shows up in a great cameo as a bookie.Fans of local color will also like BUFFALO '66. Gallo has a similar eye for his old stomping grounds that the Coen brothers did for theirs in FARGO, but Gallo's execution is more subtle and at least as rewarding.Bottom line: just stick with it through the opening scene, and you'll find gold here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is like one of those nightmares you have as a grownup that is strangely enjoyable and completely involving. Beginning with a guy played by actor/writer/director Vincent Gallo fresh out of a five-year prison stint who really needs to take a leak but can't find a bathroom anywhere.Then he kidnaps a beautiful (and somewhat willing) young tap dancer Christina Ricci (in a building where he almost finds a toilet), brings her to his family and poses her as his wife. We then get a wonderful half-hour of the biggest generation gap in history in which Gallo, Ricci and his parents, Angelica Huston and Ben Gazzara, have the most complicated anti-bonding dinner in history.After which Gallo and Ricci... who's now totally into being abducted by this insult-spouting, tantrum-throwing goblin-chinned freak... go bowling, then go to Denny's, then get a Motel (but not doing anything)... After which Gallo ventures off alone to a strip bar owned by a retired kicker of the Buffalo Bills - to kill the kicker for losing the Superbowl in which Gallo lost money on a bet in which, to make up for the debt he had to serve five years in prison for a crime he didn't commit (remember now, the film begins with him getting out).This indie gem is downright brilliant with wonderful imagery, antique film stock, strategically placed camera-angles and split screens that all work to embody the dreamlike... or rather... nightmarish quality. Vincent Gallo is at his beautifully-ugly best as the troubled, woman-hating ex-con and Christina Ricci is basically a pretty piece of meat, but that's exactly what she's supposed to be.The climax involving Gallo facing off with the Bills kicker at the Strip Joint is one of the best filmed purposely-overly-violent scenes ever, reminiscent of early Scorsese and, a year later, "borrowed" by the directors of "The Matrix".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Gallo at his most Approachable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Skinny, ugly, unkempt and unlikeable Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) is released from prison after 5 years and decides to drop in on his uncaring parents (Angelica Huston and Ben Gazzara) who only truly love the Buffalo football team (carefully not identified as the Bill's). Since he has told his parents that he is successful government employee with a loving wife he kidnaps the remarkably forgiving Layla (Christina Ricci) to pretend to be his wife. Unbeknownst to everyone Billy is out to kill the former field goal kicker for Buffalo whom he sees as being responsible for everything that went wrong in his life.This is a very quirky and compelling film with some good performances and a lot of nuances, this seems to be very much a film about perceptions.For Christina Ricci this one of a string of good performances that saw her breach that gap between child and adult roles apparently without a hitch.The winter scenes of Buffalo are very bleak and really seem to ring true.Despite his profoundly un-enjoyable follow-up effort "Brown Bunny" Vincent Gallo is obviously a talented film maker and it is unfortunate that he has not contributed more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bleack" Comedy in Gloomy Buffalo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, I didn't misspell that. It stands for "black" and "bleak". Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) is released from prison, but hours later has not left the bench outside the prison gate. It seems as though he has no place to go - that is, until he has to pee. He is grubby looking, in tatty clothes and pants that are too short. His look screams, "low budget".He meets Christina Ricci's character, Layla, in town. He is nasty to her, yet she gives him a quarter for the phone when asked. She overhears him talking to his mother. He keeps repeating who he is, and it gives the impression that he's been away for a while, or maybe Mom's feeble-minded. Layla overhears him telling her grandiose lies. His lies include a wife, whom he's goaded to produce. After he hangs up, he grabs Layla in desperation and off they go, in her car. He tells her that she will pose as his "wife", and is to make him "look good", under threats. She has chances to escape but chooses not to. While Billy was in prison, he got his friend "Goon", who is slow but loyal, to visit and agree to send Billy's pre-written letters to his parents on a monthly basis. These included stories of his "successful, jet-setting life" (it's not made clear how the locally-postmarked letters are meant to fool his parents).Billy and Layla arrive at the parents' house and Billy's father is not fooled. The parents are cold and selfish. It becomes clear that Billy's mother remembers little or nothing of his life's details. He is simply not important to her. Only football is, and at one point, she absentmindedly comments that she regretted Billy's birth because it kept her from seeing the Buffalo Bills play in the Championship that year (I assume she named her son after the team). The father is a lecherous slime-bag who looks for any excuse to play "motorboat" with Layla's boobs while telling her, "Daddy loves you".Daddy didn't make it as a singer, and when Layla asks if he has any recordings of himself, he takes her to a bedroom and sings to her over a prerecorded backing record, under a spotlight, while she sits, Baby Doll-like, on the bed. Creepy. Layla later asks to see Billy's childhood pictures, but there is only one! It's of him with his puppy. She asks what became of the pup, and we see a flashback that shows Daddy killing it in front of Billy, because it peed in the house. Daddy tells her, "It ran away".With dinner over, they leave. Layla chooses to remain with Billy after leaving his parents' house. They get a room. She wants him. He recoils. We discover how emotionally isolated he is. We find out that his only relationship with a girl was fantasised. I suppose that brings out that thing that some women seem to enjoy doing, where she makes him her Personal Reclaimation Project. She tries to break down his resistance to human contact and tenderness. She barely breaks through at all. They fall asleep, with him close to her. Billy intends to stay only until 2am, when Scott Woods is due to be at his strip club.Woods, a former Bills player, missed the potential game-winning kick in a game upon which Billy had bet heavily. Billy couldn't cover the bet, and the bookie let him off by having Billy take the 5 year rap for a crime committed by a friend of the bookie. Billy believes Woods took a bribe to lose, and blames Woods for ruining his life. When Billy says he has to go out, she has the feeling that he won't be back, and ends up telling him she loves him. He promises to return, but his real plan is to go to Scott Woods' strip club and kill him, then kill himself.Before entering the club, he calls Goon, makes a bequest, and apologises to Goon for being mean and nasty to him all the time. Goon suspects Billy's going to do "something bad".In the club, Billy comes face-to-face with Scott Woods, a fat, slobbering drunk with naked girls hanging off of him. Woods offers Billy a drink. During this exchange, Billy fantasises pulling out the gun and through some nice f/x, we see frozen shots of the homicide and the suicide, along with a scene of Billy's parents at his grave, listening to football on the radio until the father wants to leave to eat.All of that brings on an epiphany for Billy, and he decides that life is worth living. He leaves, and on the outside payphone, calls Goon back and tells him that he can't have his stuff after all, and that he met a girl who loves him. He goes back to treating Goon like crap (which shows that love hasn't turned Billy into a complete sap). He also says that he couldn't kill Woods because, "he seemed like a nice guy" (how he came to that conclusion, I have no idea. Offering a drink seems a gesture too feeble to resolve years of hatred). In any case, his new plan is to get back to Layla.I thought the "epiphany" came out of the blue. Surely Billy would've realised long before that moment, that his parents wouldn't have missed him. But I suppose he so desperately craved their approval, that he was in complete denial about their utter indifference to him. Who knows? What was really missing was any information about Layla. Who was she? And why did she behave the way she did?I felt that the wrap-up was too quick, and pat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Brown - Superb character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i had never heard of this guy Vincent Gallo before i happened to watch this movie. Later i also learned that he had been in company with likes of Jean Michael Basquiat.Verisimilitude of performances and sequence of events can actually make you feel all of it happening with you. Human being in despair develops dangerous ideas in their mind as a means to show their hatred towards things that disappointed them. And sometimes he is so obsessed with the idea, he becomes oblivion of all the facts.Billy brown was force to get himself convicted as a favor to pay his debt. When he is released from Jail he is filled with rage and his only motive is to kill Scott woods who he believes deliberately lost the game for 'Buffalo'. Billy batted for Buffalo and their loss got him into debt. But before that he once wishes to visit his parents who are least excited to see him after long. His mother is only happy to see his son alive and not eager to know anything except his good looking wife. Billy, to present himself reasonably for couple of hours in front of his parents abducts a young dancer who falls for him at first sight. Though the proposal of pretending herself as his wife and visiting Billy's parents seems an absurd idea she agrees to do so without any resistance. Billy's obsession to kill Scott Woods fails him to realize the true love of that girl until towards the very end of the movie.Billy's disturbed and confused state of mind is well portrayed by Gallo and it will drive you to hysterical laughters. Ricci is so adorable, no one but only Billy can neglect her charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A young guy from Buffalo sets out to get revenge re Bills '90 Superbowl and the end he expereinces a moment of love and freedom from the heartless world he grew up in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unbelievably funny, funny movie about a guy from Buffalo who hasn't had any breaks in his life but eventually experiences that he can have love for someone else."Billy" is pushed to the limit after he gets out of jail (he took the rap for someone else to pay off a bad bet on Buffalo for the '90 Superbowl) and he then takes Christina Ricci hostage from her ballet class in order to present her as his "wife" durring a visit to his utterly impersonal parents. The acting in this film was AWESOME(!!) especially Angelica Houston (she was so convincing as the Buffalo Bills fan/obsessed mom THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS HER for at least 20 minutes. Ditto for Mickey Rourke, though his role was smaller.) Also LOVED the interaction between Ricci and the dad character--again, it was very double-take, "so real you can't believe it's them playing the role" performances.Now this movie may have resonated with me because my husband is from Cheektowaga....I've see SO many of these characters and it had me laughing so damn hard just to see them on sceen. But, wow, my husband and I both think Vincent Gallo is extremely talented. He really captured more than just the landscape and vibe of Buffalo--he told a very sweet and sensitive story of a guy whose never known love.Highly recommend. Hope there's more to come from Vincent Gallo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's it about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is just plain hillarious, it's also a near tradegy, where Christina and Vincent seem to be both victims of circumstance - in the most bizare way possible. You're not given much background on Christina's character, but neither is it necessary. At the end of the day, the film is all about denial. Vincent cannot come to grips with true love, or showing other people respect - he's shallow and he's had a very disturbing past. His family deny him, and he denies Christina's unconditional love. She, on the other hand, cannot see anything wrong with him or what he does - she offers herself to him - and perhaps she's like a complimently angel needed to sort out his fears and disasterous past. All in all the best parts of the film come about when Vincent tries for about 10 minutes at the beginning of the film to goto toilet, and the most ludicrous excuses he comes up with the justify himself - with spans the entire movie. My personal favourite is in the photo booth - where Vincent tells Christina that they have to "Spend time - but not touch or kiss" - it's a purely class movie! Don't miss it at all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really worthwhile movie about human interactions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, my one line summary could have been a bit more descriptive, but at its crux, that's what this movie is about, human interactions. The plot, when summarized sounds forced and trite, but in fact is neither of those. Because of this, and since it's available elsewhere I won't bother with a recapitulation here. In fact, its unnecessary since this movie has more to say than its plot. Billy, the title character played by Vincent Gallo is the product of a family which stretches the meaning of the word "dysfunctional." So it is no surprise that he ends up in jail, although the method by which he becomes incarcerated is. Like much of this movie, it is unpredictable, but believable-much like reality. At any rate, after his release from prison he meets, or rather kidnaps, Layla, played by the ever-talented Christina Ricci, and forces her to play the role of his wife for a visit to his parents' house. Billy's life stands here at the figurative crossroads, his past represented by his parents, a future by Layla. The movie's carefully crafted focus power of human relations to alter one's life and oneself at every turn makes this a fine film worthy of close attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buffalo '66 is classic just for the sequence where Billy goes to his mom's house (and they only have ONE picture of him). Vincent provides the script, the directing, the music, and the acting alongside a young Christina Ricci (has she ever been in a bad movie?) all at which he is quite good at. The music helps create the dark, lonely feel of the film and Billy's personality. Another thing I love about the movie is how you slowly learn more about the Billy's history through the flashbacks and yet Ricci's character (Layla) remains an enigma. Nice ending too....check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best revenge story ever written</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it was released &amp; absolutely loved it. After years, I finally got a copy last week, watched it again and realized my initial reaction was an underreaction. This film is nothing short of phenomenal."Buffalo '66" is a well-crafted story which despite its simplicity packs a whollop. The plot can be summed up in 1 phrase: "a day in the life of a schmuck". But, much like "Catcher in the Rye" (or "3 days in the life of a schmuck"), it takes you on some bizarre twists &amp; very introspective moments. If you've ever felt a disconnection with the world, even for just a moment sitting in a Dennys in the middle of the night having a Holden Caufield moment, then this movie will really hit the mark.You can choose to enjoy this film on 3 levels, each of which will give you more than your money's worth. (1) You can watch it simply as a deadpan comedy--one of the best in its class. (2) You can watch it on a philosophical level--we'll get to that later. Or (3) you can watch it on a purely technical level &amp; enjoy the bold, outrageous &amp; audaciously original camera techniques that only a rookie director could come up with.(1) Deadpan comedy. If you enjoy comedies like Catch-22 or the Christopher Guest films (Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show) then I think this will be right up your alley. Be forewarned it's very subtle, and due to the lead character (played by Gallo) being so thoroughly unlikeable, you have to understand the absurdity of the situation before you realize it's all tongue-in-cheek, but the payoff is LOL all the way.(2) Philosophical level. Ahh, here lies the strength of this film. Without ruining anything, I'll just tell you it's a revenge story, and the outcome is both unexpected and perfect. There have been many stories written about revenge and the strange human obsession over it: Edgar Allen Poe's "Cask of Amontillado", Peter Shaffer's "Amadeus", Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein"... the best stories approach the subject in a very personal &amp; original way, as if the writer himself/herself feels every ounce of fury &amp; pain involved. In the centuries to come, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if "Buffalo 66" is added to the list of great revenge stories. On top of it all, it's a comedy. How cool is that!(3) Technical level. I'm no film expert, but I've seen enough movies to know when a director is doing some amazing things. There are scenes that will bend your perception of reality, scenes that will make you feel cold, scenes that will get your blood racing ...even a scene that'll make you want to run to the bathroom &amp; take a pee. And it's all magnified by a careful &amp; deliberate approach to cinematography. Most of all, there are camera shots that are just plain funny, like the memorable dinner scene where the camera keeps changing point-of-view between the 4 places at the table. Simple, original &amp; outrageous, that's what you'll get. Nothing pretentious like a Godard wannabe trying to impress you with camera techniques, but just good old fashioned, creative thinking. Watch for it. Also watch for the climactic scene which does a Matrix-like "bullet time effect", but realize that Buffalo 66 was released a year before the Matrix and also that Vincent Gallo did it with a single camera (instead of 120 like the Matrix used).Oh, one last thing. I have to mention the excellent soundtrack with music by King Crimson ("Moonchild"), Yes ("Sweetness" &amp; "Heart of the Sunrise" in the greatest climax ever) as well as Vincent Gallo's own contributions. While music is sparse throughout the film, it's extremely effective when used.In all, I give this movie 10 enthusiastic stars which is something I don't often do. Now go watch it, then hop a bus to Buffalo NY and buy a heart cookie for your girlfriend (watch the movie &amp; it'll make sense).</fullReview>

How much of it was because of Gallo's direction, I don't know, but I loved every minute of it.You can imagine the hilarity in an innocent, kind woman falling for a guy who is a miserable jerk. She never gives up, and the audience reaps the rewards of that. He's a jerk to his family, he's a jerk to his friends and he's a jerk to her. And all of it is hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. When first I saw it I couldn't help myself watching it over again for the next four nights. What's great about it is the emotion it puts you through and how it has you changing you mind about the main character Billy Brown as the story progresses. I imagine there are thousands of people who have sat down to watch this picture and not been able to finish because Billy is the most complex, yet overwhelmingly irritating character ever created; constantly repeating himself and whining around in circles, but please perceive with him as I promise you it is worthwhile. It is difficult to write this review as I have to sidestep laying out any spoilers and therefor cannot say to much even though in terms of events, the movie is very lightweight. Again, if you are watching this movie waiting for something to happen, I urge you just to go with it and try to bare the uncomfortable long scene where Billy pays his parents a visit. Also, needing to be mentioned it the soundtrack of this movie which personally I believe to be among the best, featuring original music from writer, director and star Vincent Gallo as well as prog-rock artists like Yes and King Crimson. Finally, I apologise again that I am unable to say to much, I myself am frustrated and perhaps I will write a second review on this picture which does contain spoilers for there really is a lot to say about it. To do so in a closing statement without being specific about the story line, I'd like to say that Buffalo 66 is the single movie which puts me through the widest array of emotions and I desperately want others to have the same experience I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly touching story, beautifully acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films - and not just because it's a wonderful visual experience with great performances by all actors. It's because love in this film feels true, far from the ordinary attraction we've grown accustomed to watch portrayed as love, especially on the screen.I'm reminded of a moving speech in the "Poupées russes" film from one of the female characters, about being in love with a man's imperfections. But here it's more than this: it's a pure, child-like image of love, an ideal they both seem to share. Love is seeing the best in someone and that's exactly what Layla does. In this sense it doesn't matter if Billy is so pathetic that normally no one would pay attention to him. We can watch everything through Layla's eyes and understand her reactions because we too can't help but care.As for the kidnapping, it's obvious the man is a harmless lunatic, not a dangerous criminal. We see plainly on Layla's face (superb mimic by Christina Ricci) that she reads him perfectly and is curious to find out more, dismissing the completely ridiculous threats for what they are: empty words. A bit far-fetched? Perhaps, but not entirely implausible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was just another story about redemption, Of course a different and romantic one. Billy (Vincent Gallo) a new released prisoner after five years is a vengeful who just thinking about revenge. He wants to kill someone who destroyed her life. He meets Layla (Christina Ricci) accidentally and story begun. Billy missed her spirit and hope after five years in jail. He actually is a desperate and hopeless guy and just thinks about killing. Layla also is a lone and sad girl who needs to a man to love I think. After that unusual meeting she gradually fell in love with Billy. Billy almost decided to kill a guy and after that kill himself but love saved him. Love from a stranger in just one day. In a day and of course in minutes he changes her mind and decided to give her back some love and I think it was a nice redemption. I liked this movie. Vincent Gallo was wonderful and so Christina Ricci. At first I didn't think that maybe I would like it but it was great. Thanks Buffalo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard of the controversy surrounding Brown Bunny, and after hearing of its graphic content and mainly negative reviews, intended not to see it. I still haven't. However, when I spotted BUFFALO '66 in the book 1001 MOVIES YOU MUST SEE BEFORE YOU DIE, and read the short plot summary, I thought, "this doesn't sound too bad." Upon hearing that Gallo had directed, written, composed the score and acted in this movie, I realized he must be talented. Christina Ricci had impressed me in Monster, and I'd always loved Angey Huston and Ben Gazzara, so I thought "why not give it a look?"I did not regret it.A tale of violence without the blood and guts, a tale of mental instability without the meltdown, and a tale of sexuality without the sex, I enjoyed watching Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci's unmistakable chemistry and amazingly wordless conversations (well, on Ms. Ricci's part anyway), particularly the scene in the photo booth which will always make me laugh.Overall it is a touching, funny love story that I will not quickly forget, and strongly urge you to see.Note: Gallo's character is an excellent bowler, and this film was released in the same year as the Coen's Big Lebowski.

		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo, gaunt and pop eyed with a gaze of sexy hostile paranoia, has the look of a born sociopath - or a born movie star (or both.) In "Buffalo 66" which he wrote, directed and stars in, Gallo plays a young man named Billy Brown who emerges from a New York state prision looking like the psychotic cousin of Bruce Springsteen. Pale and goateed with greasy swept back hair. "Buffalo 66" is a grunge fable of regeneration that thrives on freedom. Billy, as his name suggest is still a kid, a stunted man-child coiled tight with impacted rage. Wondering into a tap-dance studio, he kidnaps the sweetly voluptuous, teenage Layla, and forces her to pretend to be his wife, all to convince his parents, a pair of hateful suburban louts that he is now a respectable person. The movie however doesn't just tweak these dysfunctional middle class goons. It satrizes the very pain they've caused. Gallo plays Billy as a wounded animal discovering his own soul. Gallo who has been an actor, a Calvin Klein model and a professional career bridge burner, already has the audacity and flair of a major filmmaker. What he does in "Buffalo 66" is turn the tables on punk disaffection. He gets an inspired performance from Christina Ricci who conveys a richer, dreamier insolence in one glance here than she does in all of "The opposite of sex." As Billy takes a plunge into his most self-annihilating fantasies, we have no idea if he'll come out the other side, and neither does he. In its eerie way, that's freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film surprised me a lot because the photography is superb. That's not the only reason, though. The story itself is very good and it leaves us, the audience to think about what we have just seen. I love films which make you think and discuss with friends. I'm still thinking about what I've seen and figuring out the motivations of Christina Ricci in the film.The plot isn't the main point, the characters are, the director does a terrific job but his script is not the best. Ricci's character didn't convince me at the start, in the first 20 minutes I didn't think Ricci's character was real enough. I love the photography, it feels like a documentary at times, this is very Indie. The acting is pretty good throughout, this is Ricci's best role yet, I couldn't believe how good she was and how beautiful she has become. Vincent Gallo is terrific. There are some nice cameos.This is a terrific film, but doesn't reach the top of the tower, it's nearly there but required tweaking at the start. Not for the Matrix loving crowd. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film has moments of poignancy but the low-key indie film pretentiousness hurts them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Buffalo '66" is undeniably an original and uncompromising work. Despite this the film is flawed and most of the negative attributes can be faulted to Vincent Gallo. For a romantic comedy (which this ultimately is, albeit an offbeat one), you have to care about the protagonists. Billy Brown (played by director Gallo) is neurotic and annoying, without any good qualities. There are times when you come close to caring about him, but they're offset by Gallo's tendency to be as intense as possible in every scene. While he is entertaining in supporting roles, a little Gallo goes a long way. As a director, Gallo is too ambitious. The film has moments of poignancy but the low-key indie film pretentiousness hurts them. Namely, his overuse of flashbacks to flesh-out Billy. They beat us over the head with things that could've been explained through good dialog.The supporting cast is much better. Christina Ricci turns in a wonderful performance and creates the only character you end up feeling for. The film never explains why she eventually falls for the reprehensible Billy, but Ricci's character is more developed than the script intended. She is the best thing about the film easily. In supporting roles, Ben Gazzara and Angelica Huston do their best with such one-note characters. "Buffalo '66" is an interesting failure overall. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not extraordinary but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Buffalo 66 is one of a man who is released from prison and the plot of the movie stems from the fact that he lied to his parents about this and created a fiction of his life where he has a wife and is a successful business man. The thing I appreciated the most about this movie was the effort behind it. This is a movie where you can tell that thought actually went into it, as well as passion. There is an endeavor to create something original and artful and for that I commend the writer/director/main actor, Vincent Gallo. Christina Ricci also gives a swell performance, even though she does not have a great deal of dialogue. Our main character is an angry loner, which is something that I took immense pleasure in watching because I could relate to him wholly. I enjoyed that when I watched this movie I never felt as if I was wasting my time, which is the worst feeling for me when I watch something that's not good. 7/10 because it was not extraordinary but it was good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original preview for this film in 1998 and never forgot the strange main character. I finally figured out what film I was looking for and watched it on Amazon. Thanks to Gallo, a great cast, and a good script, it really is a good film. A character study of a marginal personality-a guy who is barely able to hold it together, who meets a young woman who sees through his off-putting facade and really wants to get to know him, in spite of his twisted family history and repulsive mannerisms. The fact that Vincent Gallo was able to corral the excellent cast he did to fill out the story must be a tribute to the quality of his script. There are no clichés in it. It is one of a kind. It's ironic that a script of this quality can attract good actors, but not the money to make a more polished film. On the other hand, the basic, workmanlike production suits the story and the locale-down-and-out Buffalo, populated with characters that work perfectly in this story.</fullReview>

Because, even if youdespise the film, you can't help but feel the effects: the snow, thewhites, the washed out collors. The opening is also magnificent. What a lonely environment.

		<fullReview>Christina Ricci and Vincent Gallo are superb in this movie. Even though the life of "Billy Brown" is really tragic, you can't help but laugh at the situations he creates and his outlook on them. The best scene of this movie has to be when Billy visits his parents and a flashback sequence ensues. It's done in a really clever way and I laughed so hard my stomach hurt, but I just had to rewind the scene again. This movie made me an instant Vincent Gallo fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buffalo '66: Understated and moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The essence of "Buffalo '66" is by no means innovative, yet its presentation is off-beat and unconventional. The zest within the relationships and characters is reminiscent of "Raging Bull." Enjoy this film for its subtle, underplayed performances; the relationship between Billy Brown and Layla is intriguing and grows to be beautiful. The humour within the film circles around Gallo's character's despair with everything; his lack of catharsis and repeated misfortune evoke sympathy as well as laughter. Although Christina Ricci is brilliant, there are times when her voice doesn't appear to suit the character. The sense of mystique and intrigue surrounding her character is built up through her silence but is strangely shattered when she speaks; her tortured and distinct appearance contrasts her plain voice (or is this deliberate?). The story is beautiful and compelling, ALL the performances are subtle and very naturalistic and the means through which the story is told is distinct. This film presents a different way of telling a familiar story. Watch it soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre and original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of the reason I saw this movie was because my girlfriend urged me to watch this movie with her. The other part being because once she mentioned the title, I remembered seeing the trailer for it before and Yes' "Heart of the Sunrise," one of my favorite songs of all time, played on the trailer. I figured any film that uses a Yes song in the trailer has to be good. Sure enough, this was a good film. The visual style of the film is rather original, at least for 1998. The film quality seems to be deliberately lower than modern standards, giving the film an early '80's, late '70's feeling to it. The tacky colors, lighting, and frenetic camera work also echoes '70's. Even Vincent Gallo's wardrobe, which looks just a little bit too tight. Everything about this movie is done so stylistically, the camera angles are original and even add to a sense of humor. The performances are incredible from everybody. Angelica Huston's deadpan portrayal of a dysfunctional mother is just hilarious. Christina Ricci is great as always (though I've never been a fan of her blond hairdo as opposed to her natural dark), and even the appearances by Mickey Rourke and Jan-Michael Vincent are great. The movie seems rather bland and sometimes too bizarre to watch, but in spite of this, there are times when moments of plight seem too funny to not laugh out loud. The soundtrack is great, from Vincent Gallo's score to songs by King Crimson, Yes, and Stan Getz. "Buffalo '66" is a wonderful film, full of originality and soul, and I look forward to Vincent Gallo's next film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a debut film this works quite well.Vincent Gallo's acting, however,is far better than his script or his direction and his character is so pathetically annoying you just want to give him a shake and tell him to pull himself together. Anjelica Huston and Ben Gazzara are fantastic as the parents and the film has a totally realistic atmosphere. And then there was Christina Ricci. She has just turned into an extremely accomplished young actress who also just happens to be drop dead gorgeous. The scene where she tap dances at the bowling alley is one of those rare moments where we can glimpse heaven here on earth. Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best surprises ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one told me anything about this movie before I saw it and so it was one of the best surprises ever.Picture a man, Gallo, just let out of prison after many years, but he is still young. His main problem is he has to pee really bad, but they won't let him back in to do that. Everywhere he goes there is some grand reason why he cannot pee there. So his solution is to kidnap an overweight tap dancer, Ricci.After finding a place to pee he takes her to his parents house and says look if you don't pretend to be my wife and tell my parents that I have not been in prison, but in the FBI, I will be forced to kill you, but if you do this I will be your best friend. At this point the girl falls in love with him.Just to look at his clothes and face is entertainment enough. Obviously this person is a hero only to himself and a very small group at the local bowling alley.The development is slow and grand. The motel scenes are slow but wonderful when he says, "See, see, what did I tell you, I knew you would look" when he is in the bath tub.The ending is quite something. Highly recommended non-Hollywood fare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most human love story ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok first I would like to pre-empt what I want to say with the fact that Vincent Gallo wrote the original screenplay,adapted it,directed starred and was heavily involved in the music and costume for this film. That for me justifies all of the comments I have read from Gallo about this film. Sure he may come across as arrogant in interviews, although I would say most of the time a lot of what he says is firmly tongue in cheek but in any case I think his film speaks for itself.Quite simply it is the most amazing film I have seen. if any film deserves the kind of pretentious plaudits that film critics roll out for many of the foreign art house movies this is it. Go look at the back of the "three colours" series of films by Kieslowski and read the comments made and they will sum up this film better than I can.If you have read some of the other comments people have made about this film then you will already know about the incredible cinematography. It really does stand out from the opening scene when Billy desperately seeks the bathroom. Showing him from multiple camera angles as he first takes the bus then darts around the car park. However what really stands out for me is the characters, especially Billy. As one comment I read mentioned this is a great study in loneliness. You really get to feel Billy's pain. He has developed this outer shell to protect him, make him seem tougher than he really is. At times though we are allowed glimpses as this shell get pierced and he shows little bits of his innerself, which as you would expect is far more fragile. I think this is what layla sees in him. She sees the little boy inside who just wants to be noticed by his family and ultimately loved. SPOILER ALERT I could go on and on about this movie, none of which would probably be very critically well researched or written but would at least show the passion i feel for this film. There are so many classic scenes, the "spend time," "couple that like each other but dont touch each other" photo scene, the "Billy I'm cold" bathroom bit and the way Billy lies on the very edge of the bed until the two slowly and beautifully link hands. These latter scenes really display Billy's vulnerability and are amongst my favourite ever. Equally the bit where he tells Goon he will kill him if he goes near his bowling ball etc and then tells him how hes met this girl and she loves him, that is one of the greatest and most touching ever. We get to see the rough exterior as he rounds on his friend and then his otherside, almost immediately afterwards to compensate. he does that a lot during the film, shouts then apologises. Finally the end when hes in the donut shop is agonizing, if like me you are involved in the two characters and want that happy ending you will see what I mean.I have never seen a movie that displays such a human side to love.Personally I am heavily into romantic films like pretty woman and of course all the john hughes eighties boy gets girl movies like "some kind of wonderful", "pretty in pink" et al. those were fun and always ended happily but they were glossy and unrealistic. The only competition as far as I can see in terms of a human romantic film would be "say anything" which is also awesome but lacks the indepth characters and grittiness. Nothing I have yet seen can compete with Gallo's movie.If you dont believe me then try and get hold of a copy of Neon, the old but classic and best in my humble opinion movie mag. I'm sure they would do a much better job of convincing you than I can but regardless go get this movie, you will be surprised i guarantee it and you are really in for a treat, a true classic.Now if only i hadnt given my copy to a guy who now lives somewhere in Spain!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend recommended I see "Buffalo 66" And what a gem of a film it turned out to be. With so many films these days going straight to video, it's hard to know what to watch, and what to avoid at all costs. "Buffalo 66" is definitely one to see. Often, you can tell if a film is going to be good or bad,from the opening scene or scenes (much like the opening paragraph, or chapter in a book). In the opening scenes in "Buffalo 66", Vincent Gallo (he wrote, directed and wrote the music!), deftly defies the usual jailbird-getting-out-of-jail scenario, and right then and there I knew then that this was going to be a very good film indeed. The story is a simple one. Billy Brown (Gallo), gets out of jail. He wants to go home to see his parents (Huston and Gazzara), even though Billy and his father don't get along, and his mother is more interested in football than her son. It's what happens to Billy on the way home - how he does get home, and what he intends to do once he's there. As Billy's father,Ben Gazzara is excellent, as is Anjelica Huston, as his mother. And Christine Ricci as the make-believe wife, she's outstanding.Even Mickey Roarke is good. The dialogue was just wonderful - very Harold Pinter, the English playwright: "The Servant" "The Homecoming" This is a very good film, and I hope the talented Mr. Gallo is given the opportunity to make more films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply put, Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to comment on this movie as soon as I saw it. I hesitated to see because of the description on the box - it seemed like a lame Charlie Sheen con on the run, kidnaps girl, girl falls in love movie, and that just did not appeal to me. Well, if that's what you think, you definitely have to give this movie a real chance.This is an absolute winner, the only reason I'm not rating it a full 10 is b/c so little background is given on Layla/Wendy's character - what's her motivation, what makes her tick. But maybe the point is that it doesn't matter, the movie is all about Billie. And Vincent Gallo is outstanding as the social freak Billie. I was blown away to learn that he also wrote, directed, and scored the movie, impressive to say the least.I don't want to give away finer points of the plot, but the movie has so many excellent sequences. The dialogue is hilarious. "Can I have a kiss goodbye?" "Look, I said I'd get you a hot chocolate, not a kiss" "Can I have a hug then?" "Let's just shake hands." If Election, Rushmore, or similar movies where the humor is above the heads of your average Britney Spears fan, you have to check this one out.Some great cinematography work as well, though I'm sure the use of passing cars as wipes, as well as the way flashback sequences are framed are not completely original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to say cutting edge, but I won't. But it is. Simply one of the best films in my time (born 1970), this tale uses subtle, but pervasive imagery to portray the feelings of an extremely self-conscious, somewhat paranoid, and certainly depressed fellow as he (eventually) reconciles his bleeek childhood with the even bleeeeker world of today.This is really a love story, all the other plots that are woven into this story ultimately end with Billy finding redemption through love. I wish I could convince everyone to see this, and let them make their own decisions. V. G. is the man to watch, and he should keep us wild-eyed, blistered, and unstrung for a little while longer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buffalo 66 is by far one of the most underrated,brilliant films that i have ever seen..from camera shots, to lighting,to the guy who probably brought them food..they were all great..I am praising this film..(one) cause i think Vincent Gallo deserves credit...He directed, wrote,did the music, clothing,everything in this film....I came across Buffalo 66 one day when I remember a very funny scene I saw on Siskel and Ebert where Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) and Layla (Christina Ricci) or taking photos in a bowling alley..just the way they speak to each other and the way vincent gallo delivers the line ...(SPANNING TIME) makes me laugh..hahahahah..see I just laughed right now!!!....I thought that seen was terrific so off to the video store I went to rent it thinking it would be a pretty good movie...but what happened was that I loved the film I thought it was great..Everyone who sees this Film think it is wonderful. (notice FILM used instead of movie)Buffalo 66' covers everything from being very sad and lonely....bad parents...A wanting of a love one..and an inner change of ones self....There's more to it..but rent the film (no, buy it!)...this film can give you hope...Now I know what your saying is that I'm making a big deal out of this film..but you know what I like it a lot..Its truly one of my favs, up there with Reservoir Dogs,.. Pulp Fiction ..Clerks..but don't get me wrong this isnt like those..its a day in the life of Billy Brown a nice little story..that can gives hope... I can't wait for Vincent Gallo's next film he is a genius...by the way CHRISTINA RICCI looks damn good in this film and gives a good performance...also Anjelica Houston and Ben Gazzara ( thank lord they weren't my parents) and I cant forget Rosanna Arquette, its a very very small role..but I swear to god I've seen girls exactly like that character..its spooky...So basically I'm saying is the film is underrated..vincent gallo is underrated..and christina ricci (what i would do to spend one day with her)..by the way the reason Vince doesn't gets his credit is that he tells it like it is in hollywood..he says what he likes and doesnt, and who he likes and doesnt ...he isn't a fake and he isnt there to impress you if you don't like him...away with you...get lost...he is who he is...and thats what makes him cool..cause he doesnt have to try to be cool.. I'm just blabbing on and on so now I am going..Thank you very much for your time.....bye (P.S.) The music is great ..Thanks to YES!!! And to Vicent Father...Vincent Gallo Sr.</fullReview>

I re-rented it twiceafter than and still rent it once in a while. It could be seen as Vincent Gallo feeling sorry for himself, but it could also be seen from Christina Ricci's point of view.

		<fullReview>A previous reviewer called it "a psychologically boring and depressing movie with nothing to show except for Vincent Gallo's loads of 60s cinema tricks up in his sleeve in an attempt to impress us." Maybe I'm just a simple girl, but I was impressed. You know you've impressed me when I give your movie 1/3 of a videocassette. I was intrigued by the movie's serious comedy. Too bad Billy didn't realize how funny he was...he might have had a better time of things. Billy is desperate to impress his parents, but he is so far removed from them that I just wondered why he was even bothering. He's touchy ("Don't touch me. We're the couple that doesn't touch"). Doesn't ask for much ("Just look like you like me, that's all I want). He tries to be frugal ("I don't want to waste $2). Knows his history ("This is the blue period") And no matter how much he tries to build himself up to killing an important businessman, he constantly throws out hints that he can probably do anything but commit a violent act, despite his experience with criminal punishment. I realize it's tempting to compare one movie with another you've seen, but that's not really appropriate in my opinion. BTW, I've seen Taxi Driver and I didn't think of it once when I saw this movie. They are both about loner types with greasy hair and without much to do but I don't see much more than that. You all should, however, see this movie and judge for yourself...and keep any others out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bleak and offbeat search for redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of Billy, played by the writer/director Vincent Gallo, who having just been released from prison, decides he needs a woman to accompany him to visit his parents. He scrambles around the bleak streets of Buffalo looking for somewhere to take a leak, eventually finding a dance class building where, after avoiding a homosexual guy in the men's room, he meets Layla (competently played by Christina Ricci) and abducts her to take to his parents (Ben Gazzera and Anjelica Huston), who turn out to be a tad eccentric and avid Buffalo Bills fans. Billy is also on a mission to kill Scott Wood, a former kicker for the Bills football team, who missed a game-winning field goal (remember Superbowl XXV, only it was Scott Norwood, nice delicate change there) which cost Billy his freedom in a wager with a shady betting shark (brief cameo from Mickey Rourke). Billy then takes us to his local haunts, in the bowling alley where we meet the seldom seen nowadays Jan Michael Vincent in a small role, and also to a diner where he comes across an old college friend, Rosanna Arquette, who reveals some secrets about Billy. This is a strange, offbeat and funny film, the central theme being the redemption of Billy and the relationship between him and Layla, which at first is spiteful, then develops into respect and love. It is an entertaining independent film.</fullReview>

Ricci's character at once seems out of place when she first appears. One also instantly sees that Gallo's character is even more disturbed. At the end, we see a romance develop with a lot of problems, but its real. Both characters are inherently twisted, but that makes them believable. And the moral is that loves knows no boundaries and can conquer all. Its not a sugary sweet story of predestined love, but there is something greater in it than the other love stories that Hollywood has told with its sickly sweet way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) is bitter and angry after five years in prison. He gets released, looking for a place to pee and kidnaps tap dancing student Layla (Christina Ricci). He had lied to his parents (Ben Gazzara, Anjelica Huston) that he's been married while away with a government job. She has to be his pretend wife Wendy Balsam. He is severely damaged and she's oddly interested in him. Billy had put $10k on Buffalo to win but the kicker Scott Wood misses the game winning field goal. Billy vows to kill him. His friend Goon (Kevin Corrigan) claims that Scott now owns a strip club. Billy and Layla bump into the real Wendy Balsam (Rosanna Arquette) who Billy had a crush on. Billy is a really annoying jerk. A few times, I almost laugh but mostly, he is really really annoying. I like the imaginative visual style in this indie but I really can't stand Billy. It's a good performance from Gallo. His character shows more vulnerability later on but his defensiveness is also very pathetic. The words too-good-for-him keep coming to mind. It's not good chemistry as much as morbid fascination with their relationship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buffalo '66</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many featured in it, I would have never known this film existed if I didn't read the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it is also interesting to be directed by, written by and starring Vincent Gallo, who I had never heard of before. Basically Billy Brown (Gallo) has been released from prison after serving five years for a crime he did not commit, he has a dilemma though as he has told his parents, father Jimmy (Ben Gazzara) and mother Jan (Anjelica Huston), that he is married with a successful career. The first thing he is trying to do is find a place to pee, being very desperate, and he finally finds that running into a dance studio during a tap dancing lesson. With what he has told his parents in mind, he winds up kidnapping young tap dance student Layla (Christina Ricci), forcing her of course to drive him where he wants to go, change her name and of course pretend to be his wife. Billy's only instructions are to make him look in front of the parents, and she allows herself to go with everything he says, and Jimmy and Jan enjoy their dinner with their son and his pretend wife. But is apparent she is not just helping him out however she can, this also includes later having some photos taken together, but Layla may in fact truly find some attraction towards Billy, even with his objections not to touch him intimately. The subplot of the story, seen in some flashbacks, is that Billy went to jail because he lost a large cash bet on the Super Bowl XXV, Buffalo Bills against the New York Giants, in 1991, and he wants revenge on the man indirectly responsible, Scott Woods (Bob Wahl). Billy is struggling against these demons, chronic loneliness and his severe depression, but eventually he does slowly open up and give in to his feelings with Layla, in the end there is some form of resolution. Also starring Mickey Rourke as The Bookie, Rosanna Arquette as Wendy Balsam, Jan-Michael Vincent as Sonny, Kevin Pollak as TV Sportscaster, Alex Karras as TV Sportscaster and Kevin Corrigan as Rocky the Goon. Gallo has created an inventive and intriguing story, and directs the film is very stylistic fashion, but of course it is his on screen presence that is best, being an unlikeable but sympathetic character, as well as the beautiful Ricci being just as compelling as the one who is falling for him, a dark and unusual drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like the British social realism films of the 60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is in black and white intentionally. It represents the dreary environment of a nearly Midwestern city - Buffalo, New York. Vincent Gallo is very good as a jaded male, who drifts his life away. His character is just released from prison, and there is a hysterical scene where he runs all over downtown Buffalo looking for a restroom. Then, he brings a young woman, played by Christine Ricci, to meet his crazy parents. His parents are uncannily like so many blue-collar urban parents. They spend all their time rooting for the Buffalo Bills, and, otherwise, are very conventional. Gallo's character's big success was as a bowler. You see the localism, and that he is still the local boy. He has his own locker and a picture of him at the bowling alley, despite having been in jail for the past five years. He has a crazy plan of knocking off a Buffalo Bills kicker whom he believes ruined his life. Ricci is very good as a sweet girl, who persists. In the end, he sees that there are more important things then revenge. I like this film, because it is very real. It isn't some dolled up Hollywood movie. It is very real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite extraordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In watching any movie, one would expect to go through the process of identification, starting usually with total detachment and winding up with some degree of empathy with the characters. With Buffalo 66, this process of identification is quite extraordinary.We start with seeing Billy (Vincent Gallo) released after a 5-year jail term, a somewhat pathetic figure hanging around on the park bench for maybe a couple of hours and then knocking at the prison gate asking to use the prison facilities for a leak. As told by the prison guard, he takes a bus to town (Buffalo) instead, only to find that toilets he tries are either out-of-service or closed with the restaurant. Still holding on, he calls his mother in a pay phone and ends up hijacking a car and the owner Layla (Christina Ricci). Finally, after relieving himself at a park, he comes back to the car and apologizes to Layla for being so rough as he was under (hydraulic) pressure. All these may come across being comical, but by this point, you might start thinking that maybe Billy is not such a rotten guy after all.The next sequence, which takes up what feels like half of the length of the movie, is in Billy's parents' home in a pretty run down neighbourhood of Buffalo, where Billy, purportedly a successful businessman, comes back for a visit and to introduce his wife. In this long sequence, we understand a lot more about Billy's miserable childhood. Father (Ben Gazzara) almost never speaks directly to Billy but is positively beaming with the sight this wonderful new daughter-in-law. Mother (Angelica Huston) is glued to the TV screen showing a Buffalo Bill's game, and intimates absently her disgust with the untimely birth of Billy, which deprived her of the pleasure of watching the Bills in a Superbowl game.The remainder of the movie traces the strange relationship between Billy and Layla through the evening after they left the parents' place. She develops a genuine affection for him that gradually evolves into total devotion. Trapped in his own prison of rejection and denial, Billy keeps her out. His five years in prison for something he did not do was to pay for a betting debt which he lost when the Bill's field goal kicker missed an easy one. Billy's entire focus is on killing this guy and then ending his own miserable existence.That is basically the premise of the story. The simple, crude story telling is absolutely refreshing compared with the lavish Hollywood productions. Some of the filming techniques are ingenious. The most talked about would be the scenes at the table where Billy and Layla chat and later have dinner with his parents. The scene is shot with continuously switching POV from the four people, as we always see three of them at the table, one facing us and two facing each other.The acting is marvelous. Billy is not an easy character to gain empathy with. Gallo (also writer and director) brings to life Billy in flesh and blood, with minimum sentimentality. Ricci portrays beautifully the vulnerability and strength, both, of Layla, one of the most memorable characters she has ever played. Gazzara and Huston, two of Hollywood's most seasoned actors, bring to the screen their superb interpretation of the parents. Gazzara I remember best in the first rate TV Mini series "QB VII" which also starred Anthony Hopkins. While most people's best remembered Angelica Huston picture would be "Prizzi's honor", mine will always be the wonderful adaptation of James Joyce's timeless classic "The Dead".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's fascinating that this movie has garnered such powerful reactions, both positive and negative ?and I would hope potential viewers take this into consideration? before dismissing a gem.If you haven't seen this movie yet, than you just might be in for a rare treat. However, skip it if you like your movies conventionally 'pretty'. Artists know beauty isn't a standardized trait, as do some of us in the general population.Buffalo 66 became a favorite of mine from the first viewing, but I original hail from WNY, so maybe I'm biased. Regional flavors, however strong ?and be they Texan, Rust-belt, or otherwise? also don't put me off. Angelica Houston absolutely nails a North Tonawanda accent; she must have stood in the aisle at Tops for about an hour to prepare. She captures it as perfectly as ever such a nasal inflection could be rendered, and hats off to her! As to eccentricity, the scene where Billy's father sings to Layla is a near effortlessly example that's likely to linger after the credits roll.Within my adopted town, I recommend this movie to all wondering why I left Buffalo behind (to anyone who dares mention recent Super bowls, I say: "The Bills ?we're number 2!"). The movie is believable, although the thought of this just might be frightening to some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Multilateral filmmaking at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the unique look of this film comes from the rare use of 35 mm reversal film stock that created the colors and look of "the past" for this film. gallos choice to use 16mm reversal for the flashbacks works well because it keeps with the overall feel of the film and provides a different look seperating the flashbacks from the central plot wihtout looking out of place or too different. the split screens and layering is a bit distracting but not to the point that it really bothers. me. the lighting for this film while a bit run of the mill was still probably really hard to do due to the tendencies of reversal stock to pick up and emphasize color. also the production design with the use of red looks really nice on the stock especially the scene when billy is looking for a bathroom and rounds the city block in his red boots next to a red fire hydrant with four red stoplights in the background. whether this shot intentionally included the redlights and fire hydrant i dont know but it works quite well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this film is not for alot of people. I know many of you will think its bland, boring and cheap. I think this film is one of the most beautyful movies i have ever had the pleasure of watching. A hopeless story of utter loneliness. The performances are faultless, Christina Ricci and Vincent Gallo bein one of the most unlikely on-screen couples and pulling it off better then J-Lo and Ben Affleck could ever dream of. The atmosphere of enevitable doom keeps ur fingers crossed for Billy till the end. Pure sympathy for what this man has lived through. Some of the scenes are hard to watch(scenes with Billys parents,and when hes crying in the toilet). After i saw this film i had a new respect for Mr Vincent Gallo and await his next screen venture. This film goes to show true brilliance can be achived on a low budget. When i am unhappy or feeling depressed i put this film on for its vision of hope, the light at the end of the tunnle. i truly rate this film as one of the best i have ever seen and recomend it to anyone who has an open mind when it comes to cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buffalo '66: A Question of Neo-Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers Vincent Gallo's 1998 film Buffalo '66 shares many thematic and visual motifs of classic Films Noirs. Buffalo '66 is in some ways like the first phase of film noir because of `[its] arresting hybrid of kitchen sink realism and fairy-tale romance.' (DVD jacket)Whether this `Sundance Film Fest Favorite' can be considered a true neo-noir is the consideration of this essay.The main character, Billy Brown, is released from jail after five years and immediately seeks his revenge on a man by the name of Scott Wood, a retired Buffalo Bills place-kicker that missed a would be Super Bowl winning field goal. Billy bet $10,000 on the game and was unable to pay the bookie. The bookie then forced Billy to plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit to substitute for the owed money. A blonde named Layla (Christina Ricci) whom he kidnaps in order to deceive his parents into believing that he is a well to do married man sidetracks Billy's mission of revenge. Billy is emotionally torn between his revengeful obsession with the Bills kicker and his uninvited growing affection for Layla.Thematic staples of film noir are used throughout the movie. At the heart of Buffalo '66 is a psychologically confused, insecure male who acts very much like a detective maneuvering through desolate Buffalo and contacting various old `friends' along the way for information as to Scott Wood's whereabouts. Amidst his search, scraps of his former life before his incarceration are unearthed.Layla plays the part of the femme fatale who assists and opposingly distracts Billy from his revenge and propels him into deeper mind torture. In contrast to classic film noir, Layla, the femme fatale, does not represent immediate danger or death but rather Billy's salvation. The contradiction is that Billy doesn't want salvation, in fact he plans to commit suicide after killing Scott Wood. Just before he leaves the hotel room to go kill Mr. Wood, Layla gives him a kiss and he replies, `No, don't do that, don't start evil.' Layla is Billy's obstacle in the way of his path to getting even with not just Scott Wood, but his parents, and himself. She is the evil that won't allow him to destroy himself.Billy Brown, although insecure, enjoys dominating others and fears those who wish to dominate him. His slipping grasp on life is evident in his dialogue. He constantly repeats himself, acting condescending towards others because people are not giving him the attention he desires. This behavior is often accompanied by a neurotic humor that causes the audience to question the stability of this man. Billy's toughness is undermined by specific scenes in the film: his embarrassment to urinate without the proper privacy of a bathroom, and his dependence on his mentally incompetent friend to carryout simple tasks, such as mailing letters to his parents.Buffalo '66 makes good use of theatre-like musical solos as a device to impregnate the film with the nostalgia of golden age films. There are two instances in which two characters break away from the film's continuity for a few minutes of performance. These scenes act like intermissions and help establish the characters.The scenes are reminiscent of film noir scenes in which a main character, usually the femme fatale, sings a song, such as Lauren Bacall in The Big Sleep. The characters take center stage and are dramatically lit with spotlights of rich color. The scenes reflect the characters' lost loves for life, of times when their souls were alive.Visually, Buffalo '66 has a lot in common with classic films noirs. Billy's psychological and physical rough edges are just like that of the hardboiled leading men like Humphrey Bogart and Charles McGraw. In fact the entire movie is rough looking and dirtied up. It was shot in high contrast, low light situations with shadows often filling faces. Many of the outdoor shots are desaturated- almost black and white.Compositionally Vincent Gallo takes chances. If film noir was considered visually experimental for it's time than the same can be said of the artsy Buffalo '66 in a late 1990's context. Abnormal cropping and the odd placement of objects are common practice in Buffalo '66. Though often times Gallo prefers a Mondrian aesthetic as opposed to an expressionistic one. The frame squares off many shots to an odd extreme; Gallo even compartmentalizes multiple frames at a time. On occasion, frames of a new scene will emerge out of Billy's head, used as a flashback device. Except for a few shots, Buffalo '66 lacks the skewed angles and heavily asymmetrical compositions found in film noir.One crucial characteristic of film noir that eludes Buffalo '66 is the unfortunate or existential ending. When Billy Brown finally tracks down Scott Wood at his popular strip club, he shoots the ex-football player and then shoots himself. This would be a classic film noir ending, appropriately desperate, but the film continues and reveals both deaths to be delusions of Billy's mind. He decides not to kill Scott Wood or himself and instead returns to Layla. Billy is redeemed and exits the strip club then buys a pair of heart shaped cookies at the doughnut shop. Gallo could have made the ending more ambiguous in keeping with classic film noir but this film is quite literal and leaves little room for interpretation.Ultimately, Buffalo '66 ends happily. But another interpretation could be made. It could be said that the movie did not end happily because Billy failed to get revenge and destroy himself, and the female that intruded upon his life is a distraction that will soften him and perhaps change him. In this way Billy was fooled by the wolf in sheep's clothing, and though he may seem extremely happy to have a girl friend, he cannot foresee the further complications she may cause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe it or not... the perfect love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buffalo 66 is the sort of film that reaches an audience far too small, which is really not fair when you're talking about one this perfectly put-together. For the most part the film is a relatively cold experience, Billy Brown's relationship with his football crazed mum and emotionally retarded dad only adding to our strange sympathy with th 'hero' of the story. The fact that we can identify with such an unpleasant character (which in all fairness he is, bickering with every one about anything he can) is testament to the film's writing. But through this coldness is a sense of hopefulness I think, Billy wants to overcome his problem's both with his family and the men who landed him in jail, and making a new start.Gallo is great as Billy, his face etched with worry and stress and his mannerisms full of pent up aggression which he takes relieves verbally by way of rants at Ricci's character Layla about touching him, not being able to drive the car etc.The scene in the photo booth is fantastic, as is the feeling of dread at Billy's reaction when Layla tries her hand at bowling. Ricci also gives a good performance as the girl whose life just needed a jump start such as a kidnapping, the small talk between the two is very funny to watch. The final scene when Billy buys the cookies on the way back is just the finest ending of all time. It's not a big twist ending or even one that will stay in the memory long afterwards but it's heartfelt and really shows the change that has come to Billy's life.Please just watch the film and love the ending. That's all I ask.</fullReview>

This is a truly original film, its funny and sad at the same time, its a meaningful love story. Christina Ricci is amazing in this film, I think she's a very smart, sexy and exiting actress, and intelligent for choosing/accepting a clever role, all this for a young girl who looked to be destined for a life of Disney productions. I was surprised by how good this was when I first rented it, it's stuck we me ever since, I hope there is more of the same still to come from vincent Gallo, and I'll look forward to his next production with great excitement!10/10 PERFECT FILM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, bizarre working class gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing about us Buffalonians, we're fiercely protective of our city. So I was reluctant to see "Buffalo 66" when it was first released in 1998, hearing how it showed our beleaguered metropolis in a not so glowing light. Let's face it, though -- Buffalo will never have the urbane sophistication of a San Francisco, Seattle or New York. Best to ignore the jabs thrown our way by those elitist, Perrier-drinking queche eaters. And at least Vince Gallo is one of us -- a working class Buffalo boy. So my wife and I finally decided to give "Buffalo 66" a try on Easter Sunday (after eating a brunch of eggs and Polish sausage from the Broadway Market). We were pleasantly surprised by this unusual picture. Sure, the plot is ridiculous and the characters grossly exaggerated. But the movie is a wickedly satirical romp that never takes itself too seriously and keeps your interest throughout. Buffalo Bills fans will love the references to a fictitious Bills placekicker named "Scott Woods" who misses a potential game-winning field goal in the Super Bowl, a not-so-subtle reference to Scott Norwood of the infamous "Wide Right" in the 1991 Bowl. Better yet, this Scott Woods character runs a strip joint in Buffalo, hilarious when you consider the real Scott Norwood is one of the most upstanding guys you'd ever want to meet. Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston are a scream as Vince's wacky parents and Christina Ricci -- an actress I've never particularly admired -- is sexy and sweet as the young Layla. Mickey Rourke and Jan Michael Vincent are great in cameo appearances. "Buffalo 66" is grimy, hard-edged and lacks polish (sort of like the city it represents) and that helps make it an eminently watchable film.</fullReview>

The air-conditioning was blasting, as it always does in Hong Kong. The cinema was freezing. When Billy was on the park bench outside the prison, I could have been sitting across from him, in my light clothing, watching him sleep.The film is brilliant. I had the added bonus of Climate Control that only added to the whole experience of Buffalo 66. It is truly one of the best films of all time. - The Editing is Superb - The Acting is Spectacular - Gallo's Direction is MagnificentIt is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed story beautifully told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Brown, played by the director of this picture, is fresh out of jail, but there's a problem- he's told his parents that he's married and he's been away working with the government while in reality he's been serving time. So he kidnaps the ever beautiful Christina Ricci, as Layla, a dance student, and forces her to act as his wife. For reasons never explained, she agrees. Turns out that Billy's parents barely remember or care about him, and that their eccentricities are partly to blame for the horrible human being that Billy has begun. However, also for reasons never explained, Layla falls for Billy and attempts to coax him out of killing a football place kicker who's miss in a superbowl cost Billy a $10,000 bet. Unable to pay, he had to confess to a crime of which he was innocent, forced by the guy with whom he'd gambled the money, and that leaves him wanting to kill this kicker. Can the mysterious Layla stop him? The main flaw I have with this superb independent is that the character of Layla never has her motives explained, and just seems to follow this loser around- the guy that kidnapped her- even when he gives her the chance to leave. Still, its a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the plot is unrealistic and occasionally the dialogue is weak. But I love this film, and not just because I spent many of my high school days in that particular Denny's. The movie is not to be taken literally. Many of the people here complain that "no freakin' WAY would that girl ever fall in love with such a nasty guy!" Of course she wouldn't. But this isn't meant to be taken as a literal story. This film is, if anything, a reflection of Billy Brown's own psyche - and perhaps Gallo's. Perhaps you just had to be there - perhaps these characters seem crudely drawn to you, but to him they are entirely real. This is not a careless film, it's a fascinating portrait.The dialogue, often banal, is incidental to the movie's movement. It's a portrayal of a man whose seems ready to implode at any given moment, whose entire life seems to him to be an elaborate, cruel practical joke.(And yes, I also love this movie because some of the shooting was done in my neighborhood. Gallo used his childhood home as a location in the film. The movie feels a lot like the city, with its grittiness and obsolescence. If you're ever there, drive down Main St. in the city and you'll understand.)I find it interesting that the film projects such strong feelings in people. Those who can relate in some way to Billy's inner psyche love it. Everyone else just won't get it. Oh well...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best dark comedies in the last decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with this film is that it is subtle. It was filmed on a very low budget, and it has a simple story. Consequently, the magnitude of its genius will probably fly over the heads of most critics who are used to more conventional films with larger egos (to match their own).The main character is unattractive, very unpleasant and the epitome of a looser, he seemingly has no redeeming qualities. Yet soon we all feel sorry for him and constantly look for the good things in him, just like the girl he kidnaps. We want him to succeed. By the end of the film the entire audience will be rooting for him to do the right thing.There is some incredible acting by the likes of Ben Gazzara and Christina Ricci, as well as Vince Gallo. Gallo has totally captured the crushing disaster that is the life of Billy Brown and done so in an amazing way. The scenes of Billy (Gallo) with his family may be the best portrayals of a dysfunctional family you'll ever see. Billy Brown is doomed, it seems that his life is hopelessly lost. Yet one person suddenly cares for him (divine intervention? karmic balance?). Will he make the right choice or is his life essentially over?In the middle of this dark and often offensive subject matter the movie packs laughs and humor. Gallo attempts to break up some of the crushing depression by inserting little visual effects scenes that offer some insight into the characters' minds (how many films ever even try this stuff?). Some people don't like movies that have unpleasant things to say, or that show us things that we don't like to see, but this movie presents it in such a way that we can laugh at ourselves and at life as we see bits of us and people we know and human nature, and the the way life is sometimes just plain cruel, etc. peppered throughout the film. If Billy can succeed, maybe we can too. Watch this one carefully, and with an open mind, and you will be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judging from previous reviews, it seems that "Buffalo '66" is one of those films that inspire either admiration or disgust in the viewer, with very little middle ground. Count me among its admirers. I have to say that I agree that Layla's nonchalant reaction to being kidnapped by Billy is not realistic, but hey, it's a movie! It works as far as the movie is concerned. This film is about a man who, for his entire life, has never been loved by anyone, particularly his parents. Because of this he has built up a wall around himself, a wall of hatred and anger. Then someone comes along who loves him unconditionally, threatening to penetrate that wall that he has grown so comfortable with. He has never been taught how to love, so is it too late for him to learn now? And is Layla the one to show him? That's the question. Oh, by the way, this movie is funny as hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i liked almost everything about this movie. people have complained about christina ricci's character being not very fleshed-out, but i think that was probably the intention of the film-maker...there is no way she would ever logically like a guy like Billy or act in the way she does, so no attempt is made to explain her character. at first i expected her to try to run away or yell at Billy or something, but that movie has already been made a few times, and it was better this way. buffalo '66 reminded me a lot of taxi driver in its overall structure....crazed loner at the center, idealized woman seen occasionally, and more real girl present more often, along with the loner's obsession with killing a specific famous person. i think the reason for the dual ending was that vincent gallo wanted to do a taxi driver like movie, with death and violence at the end, but he also wanted to make another movie, where the ending is more peaceful. although it's only a few minutes of footage, the substitution of one ending for another changes the whole movie...with the violent ending, the movie's message is one of despair, and the point is that people like Billy can not overcome their demons, even with love. with the alternate ending, the movie becomes more of a romantic happy kind of movie.</fullReview>

Gallo is excellent as the anxious just released from prison "Billy Brown", who we learn has some unresolved issues relating to his incarceration and towards his parents. Ricci also deserves much credit for her understated performance as the understanding observer in what for many actors might have otherwise been a difficult role to play so convincingly. The direction is original and effective, and the screenplay well written (both by Gallo). 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where you really have no idea what way the story is going to turn. In a bad movie, you get the idea that they thought really hard to put you off. In a good movie you don't get that feeling because the story is just natural. Buffalo falls into the last category. IMHO this is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre and yet strangely compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of weird movies, and Buffalo 66 is right up there at the top. Filmed in a gritty and dark style that makes everything it touches look like it's straight out of 1976, Buffalo 76 tells the story of Billy, a man sent to prison to pay off a gambling debt to his bookie. When Billy is released from prison, he decides to visit his parents and to kill the football player who he thinks threw the game that got him into prison. Visiting his parents is not as easy as it seems, though, as Billy didn't tell them he was in prison, and concocted a series of lies through letters his retarded friend Goon sent. The largest of these lies is that he is married. Billy kidnaps Layla from her tapdancing class, and forces her to come home with him and pretend to be his wife. Billy is not satisfied with how she acts, no matter how much she talks him up. And somehow she seems to fall in love with the image of him that she created. She tells him that she loves him and that he's the sweetest guy ever, but we the viewer have watched him treat her like crap for the entire duration of the movie. Maybe he treated her nicely in the outtakes. Buffalo 66 is a strange movie that will suck you in to the life of Billy as he loses his grip on reality, only to regain it in a powerfully filmed scene near the end. If you like movies that make you feel depressed, and make you think about why you feel that way, check out Buffalo 66.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect much from this movie and was pleasantly surprised.One of the best things about it is the desolate resonance of the cold, obscure industrial city of Buffalo, NY, a bleak place with a good football team, where the meaning in people lives comes in the form of the depressing/mundane; sports, strip clubs, bowling. Layla the unpredictable tap dancer, therefore, sticks out in a beautiful way; her manner and actions seem so fantastic, magical, that she could be simply a mirage in the life of the pathetic loser, Billy Brown. I really like the fact that you know virtually nothing about Layla. That throughout the whole sequence, there is no realism with her. You think, "Ok, MAYBE she'd really fall for the guy, stranger things have happened," but then you become very stumped by her lack of practical, everyday concerns. For example, you'd think that maybe she had to work the next day or something and she'd mutter a bit about that but almost from the very moment that Billy violently seizes her, the only thing she really cares about is him. Her lack of explicit characterization creates this enigma that makes the tone very ambiguous. Maybe she is a perfectly healthy person who is able to see the beauty of this wretched man. Or maybe she is also wretched and falls in love in a fickle way but will love someone else the next day. Have the characters found happiness that will truly transcend their bleak surroundings or simply a momentary light in a dark tunnel? This movie's way of making you guess about a character's history reminded me a bit of Mamet plays. Also, in my opinion, Vincent Gallo's movie is far better than any by Jim Jarmusch, who employs a similar sort of minimalism with his characters. The only real flaw I could see with Buffalo 66 is that we learn too much about BILLY. Some history is fine but I didn't want to see him as a child in flashbacks. I wanted him to have some of the same mystery as Layla. It's the mystery I feel when walking lonely through a dirty, soulless city, expecting to encounter only tedium and more loneliness, but hoping to run into a serious, beautiful tapdancer who will love me instantly for no good reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initially, I had reservations about viewing this particular piece due to the arrogance exuded by Vincent Gallo when asked to comment upon it.But I was able to put these feelings aside as the film came highly recommended from a friend. And after viewing it, I believe that his immodesty was not unfounded.Dream-like sequences blend together with sometimes stark realism. The ability to combine these two contrasting elements effectively is a testiment to the rare talent exhibited here. Although there is a feeling of uncertainty in Gallo's realization of the film, there is no doubt that both behind the camera as well as in front of the camera there is a promising artist stirring the waters.To mention the cinematography is to mention the role that the camera plays: not merely as observer but as examiner and inquisitor. The camera, utilizing avant-garde techniques, delves us further into the somewhat tortured psyche of Gallo's all to "anti" anti-hero.In its depiction of existential alienation, this picture is reminiscent of the works of Kafka and Dostoevsky. As such, there are many scenes which remain surprisingly funny despite the melancholic ambiance that seems to strangle the film's entirety; which might, from an enterprising critic, categorize it as a dark comedy.In short, whatever flaws it might contain, this is a wonderful achievement in the art of filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty and stylish feature from actor Gallo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not expect to like Buffalo '66 as much as I did, based on all the negative things I had heard about the film prior to its release. Despite the ego-tripping arrogance that Vincent Gallo loves to flaunt in print, his film is sometimes compelling, occasionally brilliant, and almost always watchable. Following the story of Billy Brown, a small timer who has just been released from prison, Buffalo '66 seems initially burdened by some troublesome cliches, but it nicely evolves into a provocative character study. Gallo's ace is Christina Ricci, who delivers one of the year's finest performances as the tap dancer who agrees to pose as Billy's wife for the sake of impressing his parents (who apparently don't know that their son has been behind bars). The lengthy scene at Billy's house did not entirely work for me -- I just did not care for Anjelica Huston's portrayal as Billy's neglectful mother, although I did like Ben Gazzara as the father. Gallo fortunately sidesteps the expected ending even as the audience is led to believe that is right where he is headed. This aspect of the film, along with the performances of Gallo and Ricci and the overall directorial texture and look of Bufflao '66, allow me to recommend it.</fullReview>

Okay, this could be called "artsy crap" as someone previously commented, but it works and is innovative, and there's not enough of it on our screens! So often I come out of films with very little to say about them (eg LITTLE VOICE, enjoyable film, characters not very sympathetic, brilliant performances from Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine, end of story). But I find myself still feeling inspired by and jibbering on about BUFFALO 66, twenty-four hours later.And, call me a romantic old fool but I'm so glad it had a happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo's first attempt at movie-making deserves a huge amount of respect. This movie has so much that I look for in an independent film. It has inventive story-telling, developed characters, great performances, and so much emotion. And it even has Ben Gazarra. I especially liked the scenes where Ben was singing and sounding like he'd like to sound, not as he really is and Christina Ricci is dancing and fantasizing in the bowling alley. I have a lot of respect for someone like Vincent because he is putting his heart and soul on the screen for you and me to see. Some of the other indie films that came out this year pale in comparison. He is to be loudly applauded. I have rated it as my No. 1 film of 1998!! Way to go Vincent!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Buffalo '66 without knowledge of Vincent Gallo's self-congragulatory personality. Even if I had known about his comments, I would had to agreed with them. Buffalo '66 is the funniest, most honest and touching film I saw in 1998. Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci are heartbreaking in the film. It is one of the few films that makes me feel that I actually know the characters and would like to see more of them. The dialogue is hilarious, the visual style fascinating in the stark and cold lighting and presentation. It's too easy to label the film as "quirky"--it's a truly beautiful film. Vincent Gallo may come off as a jerk and egomaniac in interviews, but I wouldn't argue with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a traditional love story, but much closer to real life than most films that come out of America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen any of the previous work of the writer come director/star and let's even throw in composer, Vincent Gallo. And as a general rule if the same name has four or more credits I do not bother watching assuming it too self-indulgent. However, I watched "Buffalo '66" not knowing the credits and was surprised at the end that this film was driven by one person, Vincent Gallo. The film captured the real America that many discover on a road trip - the America of Dennys, cheap hotels, giant takeaway coffee cups and broken families. The central character of Billy (Vincent Gallo) is not a traditional romantic lead, but he is closer to what most American men are than what Tom Cruise is. The film has that rare honesty, similar to that of "Waiting for Godot", so that the viewer leaves understanding what the film is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I go to put in the DVD Penelope. I turned on the TV and the channel was on IFC - where all the cool movies go. A movie was just starting - John Malkovich Ripley's Game. As I like that actor I thought I'd watch it. I didn't get in on the title, just the other credits, but funny enough, they had the wrong movie listed and I soon realized Malkovich wasn't going to show up. However, I started to like the movie - Buffalo '66. The only actor I recognized was Ben Gazzara so I did a search on the Internet and got the movie title. I didn't recognize Anjelica Huston at all. Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci were great. It was only after the movie was over that I realized that Ricci also stars in Penelope. So what a coincidence. This is a really good different movie. Billy Brown is such a strange character . . . wacky, bad, with lots and lots of problems, but somehow, like Layla, you care about him. You really do! For me that's the problem with movies today. I find that the characters aren't known or vulnerable enough to care about. If they get killed, they get killed. You don't care!! This movie lays bare all of Billy's faults and weaknesses, and yet you, I'll say the word again - care. I think most of the characters today not enough time is given to know who they are, be they good, bad, or just ordinary folk. I would never have watched this movie if the correct title had been on, therefore, I would have missed out on a really great movie. So things happen by chance I guess. It's a movie you think about the next day - and are even inspired to write about. Great acting by Gallo and his directing was unique. I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Bleakness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buffalo '66 is a strange movie that I assume will divide the audience. I can understand why someone would love it as well as I can understand why someone would hate it. Vincent Gallo stars as Billy Brown, a lonesome man recently released from prison. Gallo plays a character that is so depressing, so joyless, that the acting becomes very real. I haven't watched much else of Gallo's acting, but he definitely has a presence. Whether you like or hate Billy, it can't be denied that he transmits real feelings from his persona. The mood of the film is brilliant. The bleak atmosphere is captivating and lets us get inside the dark and depressing world of Billy Brown. Every scene has this emotionally somber tone that makes you uncomfortable in a way, but letting you appreciate the art of it.Christina Ricci co-stars and does a great job of portraying the equally interesting Layla. The rest of the cast is also decent.Maybe not a film for everyone, but if you like art films and character studies, give Buffalo '66 a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An impressive debut for Gallo as director/co-writer. It's a sad but true Hollywood cliché nowadays that every young actor has to direct (and write) his own damn movie (Bacon, Depp, Sutherland, to name a few). It seems to be just a matter of time before even Hollywood's biggest airheads make their own movies: Keanu and Tom Cruise.However, Gallo obviously knew what he was doing; he does experiment a bit with the camera, but it turns out fine, and it's anyway typical of first-time directors to experiment a bit more, in their wide-eyed enthusiasm.The film starts very well, with some funny moments, and it pretty quickly looks as though the movie is heading towards all-out weirdness - and this certainly turns out to be the case for the following segments and scenes, in Gallo's demented parents' house. However, after that, though there are still some lighter moments, the film gradually reveals itself as being more than just another wacky independent film; the film has some well thought-out and intelligent characterizations - this goes particularly for Gallo's character.Gallo has, to me, never been a particularly sympathetic actor, but he is undoubtedly good, and so is Ricci. (It's just a pity that we didn't get to see more of Ricci in the scene when she gets out of the bath-tub.) I didn't immediately recognize the stupendously ugly Anjelica Huston, but quickly came to the conclusion that she was fittingly cast as the mother of the kind of face that Gallo has. The film also features brief appearances by two totally washed-up Hollywood has-beens; Mickey Rourke and Jean-Michel Vincent. (I had heard something about the latter being so down-and-out (due to booze and/or drugs) that his so-called Hollywood "buddies" don't want to have anything to do with him anymore. Now I believe it; Vincent looks totally out of it: his voice sounds like he had been drinking non-stop for the past 300 years - I doubt that he was acting that much.) The funniest moment is when a fat guy stares at Gallo urinating and makes a comment about the hugeness of Gallo's member, upon which Gallo flips his lid. The film has a good visual look, and a nice soundtrack. I also have to give Gallo credit for casting only naturally-breasted women in the strip-bar scenes; no silicon whatsoever. The naked women looked so great that it seemed like a 70s movie for a moment there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True indie masterpiece from one of the futures best filmmakers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buffalo '66 begins with this fascinating montage, the outside of a gritty prison facility in the snow. A striking quality of footage, where the filmmaker, (genius) Vincent Gallo, used specially modified 8mm tape (which he apparently begged Kodak to make) in a 32mm camera. He's also one of the two stars of the show, a phenomenal, weird actor. He looks like a sort of attractive cockroach in human form, with heavyset, darkly incandescent gleaming eyes. He plays Billy Brown. "My name is Billy Brown" as he later tells his co-star.Without any dialogue from the beginning this film manages to be hilarious and is something not melodramatic but a situation we can all relate to. He has to urinate. They can't let him back in to the prison. He can't go in the snow or it'll freeze and after he's left the area the only open restaurant isn't allowing him in. He stoops at the waist, grasping his crouch at times to hold it in, finds a spot then...someone approaches. Finally he goes into a dance hall when the homosexual guy looks at him and "pees" him off. Though he doesn't manage to pee. We see the first line of brilliant acting, where Gallo encumbers in dialogue and action what frustration actually is by practically assaulting the homosexual man (squeezes his, er, cheeks together) just after the man makes a mistake by commenting "but it's so big..."Out next star, easily one of the best contemporary actresses ever, Christina Ricci (who plays Layla), enters and is literally kidnapped by Vincent's character. This happens realistically, with a dark sense of humour. The film is already receiving full marks from me, it's already better than 90% of what's out there in Hollywood-land today (and the rest of the world.) As well as dysfunctional Billy Brown we meet his insane parents (just after he gets to pee on a tree), his semi- retarded supposed best friend, and we see how gangster/betting shop owner played by Mickey Rourke was responsible for putting Billy Brown in prison Billy is a bit of a philistine it seems: He doesn't seem to listen to music, watch films, read etc. He just knows football and goes bowling. Nothing else seems to exist in this reality. But now he has Layla, not just the parents who don't seem to care much about him and who live in their own, grave and depressing little world.If only he hadn't bet on Buffalo to win, the American football player wouldn't have missed the kick. But Billy knows for a "fact" that he missed it on purpose. The build up and the mistreatment of Layla,( who is put in the spotlight for a moment, where she gets to demonstrate her tap-dancing skills, possible her true dream), leads to a single action sequence with a thunderous rock-music build up. This is where Billy meets the guy that he believes inadvertently put him in jail, the Buffalo player who supposedly purposely missed the kick to lose his team the game.The action sequence is highly inventive, using synthetic models for heads, the loud fast music, and slow motion to create a brilliant, adrenaline pumping effect.Billy is saved, however, in the end by his new love who he at first pushes away. It's the one good thing in his life, somebody that's willing to stand up for him, stay with him:Layla. It's a beautiful portrayal of a disturbed man in a backward town with the perfect, but still real, women who saves him in the end. This is truly romantic. Not like those sixties and prior fake melodramatically romanticised films, which the film world had to get out of it's system before moving on to such true masterpieces like Buffalo 66.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gallo may be an Aspie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewers who characterized Gallo's "Billy Brown" as an improbable personality may wish to use their search engine and check out "Asperger's Syndrome". As an Aspie myself, I saw many indicators in this film that Billy has this disorder, which in those times was probably mis-diagnosed as Attention Deficit Disorder. Upon reading IMDb's biog of Gallo, I see even more clues that Gallo (portraying his own life in this film) might be an Aspie.Asperger's is a poorly understood condition, because most people who have it exhibit only some, but not all of its typical characteristics. In Billy's case, repeating the "spanning time" theme over and over again (called "perseveration") is classic. Another common personality trait is to have a strong desire to be involved in a romantic relationship, but nearly always failing because of a poor capacity to understand how to make a relationship work. Aspies very often bond strongly with a few individuals, but otherwise feel very uncomfortable in any social situation. They need everything spelled out in detail, and lack the ability to read body language or catch subtleties or nuances, so attempts to be sociable generally crash.So, before dismissing "Buffalo '66" on the basis that "How could anybody really be like that", Asperger's Syndrome ought to be your bedtime reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Personal and Poignant fable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Buffalo '66' is one of those unusual kind of American movies that could only have been made as the debut feature of an independent filmmaker. The film is oddly proportioned, brimming with the flamboyant ideas of its director, autobiographical and relentlessly self-indulgent; and for exactly these reasons the film has its own kind of unique charm. Vincent Gallo's directorial debut, which he also co-scripted and wrote the soundtrack for, is a quirky, deadpan tragicomedy that departs from traditional modes of filmic communication and indulges his idiosyncrasies. Gallo clearly emphasises performance and characterisation over plot and narrative; a trait that is reminiscent of the film's of actor/director John Cassavetes. The film focuses on the character of Billy Brown and provides an in-depth character study of an emotionally isolated and paradoxical individual, who is struggling to come to terms with events that took place in his childhood. On the one hand, Billy desperately wants to love and be loved but at the same time he is uncomfortable with physical contact and intimacy. Seated on the steps outside his parents house, feeling sick at the thought of seeing them again, he asks Layla, "Would you hold me?". However, when she moves closer, Billy shrieks, "Don't touch me!". During the course of the film, the tough criminal exterior that Billy presents when kidnapping Layla is stripped away to reveal a sensitive innocent who desperately craves the attention he's been deprived of all his life. Only after Billy has overcome his feelings of frustration and resentment towards an uncaring world can he accept the love that is eventually offered to him by Layla. Gallo puts an incredible amount of nervous energy into his performance as Billy Brown and that makes it difficult to take your eyes off him. He delivers Billy's repetitive, quick-fire dialogue with tremendous vigour and a keen sense of comic timing. Gallo re-invigorates the language of contemporary cinema, employing a number of striking cinematic devices that give the film freshness and vitality. The entire film is ingeniously shot on 35mm reversal film stock, a process that produces distinctive contrast and colour saturation. This technique perfectly encapsulates the cold, grey industrial landscapes of Buffalo, bleeding them of their colour and giving the spectator a visceral sense of the raw weather and alienating locations that function in the narrative as a metaphor for Billy's own feelings of loneliness and estrangement. Gallo's cinematography is precise and idiomatic. Certain shots appear meticulously composed like still photographs whilst others, like the shot of Billy's indolent friend's potbelly, have the ability to sum up an entire character in just one single image. The flashbacks to Billy's troubled childhood are cleverly communicated through a series of optically inset frame-within-frames that start off as tiny boxes and gradually grow to fill the entire screen. However, Gallo's greatest and most inventive visual achievement is saved until the final staging of Billy's climatic shooting in the strip club. He presents it as a startling succession of mind's eye tableaux vivants, freeze frames that capture the graphic anatomical detail of the shooting in a darkly comical way. The entire sequence is accompanied with strange perfection by the extravagant 70s prog-rock sounds of 'Yes'.The film is filled with a number of hilariously peculiar comic episodes. Take for example, the scene in which we first realise Billy is an incompetent criminal when he is unable to drive Layla's getaway vehicle because it's a 'shifter' car. Noticing that Layla is clearly amused by this, Billy goes into a childish verbal tirade in a pathetic attempt to try and disguise his shortcomings: "I'm used to luxury cars?I drive cars that shift themselves". Another humorous highlight takes place during an exchange between Billy and Layla in a $2 automated photo booth as they pose for photographs to send to Billy's parents. The comedy in this scene arises from Billy's insistence that the photos of them as a loving couple appear authentic and simulate them 'spanning time' together, whilst at the same time not allowing Layla to actually touch him: "We're the couple that doesn't touch one another. We like each other. We like each other a lot and we span time together. We just don't touch each other, all right?".'Buffalo '66' is a refreshingly honest and personal film that is directed with a confident and singular vision. Vincent Gallo's poignant fable shows rare creative flair whilst providing a perceptive insight into the pathos of failure and the indispensable nature of love.Richard Pickering</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My boyfriend and I don't have "a song" we have this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buffalo 66 is one of those films which on the first encounter you struggle to watch in the opening scenes but after you're glad you did. If you watch carefully in the scene at the bus station you can easily tell the kind of person Billy is, desperately trying to be polite but quick to anger through exasperation at the pressing situation he's in. If you've ever needed to pee in cold weather you'll empathise immediately.I can even understand (although I can't condone) his homophobic comments towards the fascinated dancer he encounters when he finally finds a toilet (in the only scene I consider to be slightly self indulgent). He's just got out of prison, I don't even want to imagine what could have possibly happened to the poor guy whilst he was in there and although somebody watching him go was probably the very least of it I'm sure he doesn't want reminding of it now he's out.I've found comments by men about this film to be (generally speaking and probably because they hate the fact the weird man gets Christina Ricci) the most misguided and it's not that I'm buying into this whole stereotypical idea of what the average woman wants in a member of the opposite sex but I find it totally believable that Layla would fall for Billy. You Get the best/worst of both worlds with him. On one hand he's this volatile bad boy and on the other he's this pathetic love starved child you want to take care of (plus he can bowl like the devil). You never find out any of her background but you kind of get the impression she's a low-wage earner who was too heavily built to dance professionally which complements him perfectly.Unfulfilled dreams are the order of the day for all concerned including Billy's parents who never got the glittering singing career and never got to see Buffalo win respectively. It's only the somewhat Brothers Grimm Fairytale ending (which bizarrely is the most convincing and touching scene I've ever seen in a film) that so many find incredible that ties it all together by realizing the other dream, that someone can love you even if they don't know you that well (just like he did with the dog Bingo) and that a pointless act of anger and resentment shouldn't be allowed to take that away. It says all this without being too hokey and makes me happy. Just because it's a tragically romantic bleak black comedy doesn't mean it takes itself that seriously. Having said that, it does a bit.So look like you like me and let's span' time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loser cool with a heart. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actor/Director/Writer Vincent Gallo's Buffalo 66 is, on a superficial level, almost irritatingly 'indie' (i.e. that which seethes with artistic reaching and uses gritty film stock to prove it). Characters wear clothes best suited to an old Blind Melon video, dialogue is pungent and ironically repetitive, and gloomy weather endlessly hangs over everything, in what at first glance appears to be yet another entry into the 'loser chic' school of cinema.But wait. . .Instead of wearing its disaffected stance as a badge of credibility, Buffalo 66 uses it as a springboard to a far deeper, and very affecting, exploration of the psyche of human failure. Using Buffalo (and its poor, woeful Bills) as a backdrop and rather hilarious metaphor for missed opportunities and blown chances, Gallo picks at the protective, pseudo-celebratory scab that was Beck's 'Loser', and exposes the real pain of the loser.Gallo is terrific as Billy, just released from a five-year prison stint after a 10,000 bet with a loanshark (played by that perennial loser Mickey Rourke, in fine scuzzy form) and a missed fieldgoal kick force him to take the fall for a crime to pay back his debt. Jimmy's first move is to kidnap a cherub named Layla (Christina Ricci, in an inspired performance), only to convince his parents, who've never known he was in jail, that he's married.Angelica Huston and Ben Gazzara play Billy's unbalanced parents in a reunion scene which is at once uproariously funny and horrifyingly telling (they have exactly one childhood picture of Billy). Slowly, Buffalo 66 reveals itself to be a tragi-comic parade through an agonizing childhood and adolescence, one that still vividly and actively haunts Billy's present.As a director, Gallo brilliantly employs his quirky visual playfulness to compliment the plot's unfolding, while never overstating his ideas (Oliver Stone, take heed). There is much that is funny, tragic, and startlingly beautiful in Buffalo 66, and it ranks as one of 1998's finest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply one of the best written screenplays ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dialogue in this film is second to none. Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) as a character is extremly interesting. Showing a range of emotions in different social situations from a bully towards Layla and Goon to showing his true insecurities to his parents and Wendy Balsam - it paints an awesome picture and you really get to feel for the character. There are suggestions that he was physically or sexually attacked in prison. His reaction to the guy in the toilet and the fact he doesn't like being touched - this explains the way he acts towards Layla.The bowling alley is one of my favourite scenes - Billy entering like a returning war hero and we see a side of him we haven't seen before. The fact he can bowl fills him with confidence, it seems that bowling is one of the only things Billy is happy doing. He's acting cool, suggesting that he picked Layla up hitch-hiking as if it happens everyday and he has a lot of dispensible women which of course we know is not the case. Also the guy at the bowling alley is the only person that Billy is actually pleasant to for the best part of the film. The guy seems to be a little slow and believes Billy is someone that he really isn't, of course Billy thrives on this and in return offers kind gestures back. My favourite bits would have to be 'is this a shifter car?', 'that's why they call you goon', 'i'm outside the club now, yeh it's crazy', 'the king is here', the way Billy's Dad says 'Bingo'... Along with Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy, Billy Brown is my favourite film character. Excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest independent movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buffalo '66 was written and directed by Vincent Gallo, who pulls off a magnificent performance as 'Billy Brown', who is released from prison and returns home to Buffalo to reunite with his family. He kidnaps Christina Ricci (lola) with the intention of introducing to his parents as his wife, and to support his lie that he has been working overseas for the last few years.The film is a magical comedy, but is built on the sadness of a man who has had a very troubled and odd life. Striking and original, Buffalo '66 is a prime example of how great a film can be when the director is working from his own script, giving it a very personal feel that is simply impossible to accomplish when a script is passed to another director.Christina Ricci is also magnificent as Gallo's love interest, as she slowly tries to lure Billy out of his shell, and the love story itself, though surreal, is unique and touching.This is really a stand alone film, that blows any Hollywood blockbuster right out of the water, and is a must see for any film fan.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Gallo's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first read about this film in a movie magazine, it was in the recommended section. I had seen Vincent Gallo in Truth and consequences N.M and Palookaville and liked the fact that his style was quite original, so after reading the brief review of the film, I had the desire to take a look. However, I had a strong feeling that it wouldn't be showing in my local cinema, so I had to wait.Months later I had forgotten about this apparent gem of an indie movie, until I came across it while browsing through the video collection of my local Tower records. As soon as it caught my eye, I picked it up and purchased it with little hesitation. I was intrigued to find out why it was so highly acclaimed by the author of the recommended section in the magazine.I put it on late at night and started to watch it with interest. However, I got half way through the film and fell asleep. To my dismay I woke to see the end credits rolling. I turned the light off and went back to sleep realizing that I had missed the end of a very promising film.As early as I could the next day, I rewinded the film to the place when my eyelids grew heavy and watched the remaining part- my conclusion? I loved it.Vincent Gallo shines as his own creation. From the outset, he makes you laugh but also feel sorry for him. His quirky dress sense makes him original, and the dialogue leaves you wondering whether you should be laughing or not. He seems to have a bad attitude, not wanting to let anyone close to him, but when you see his parents you can start to realize why he acts this way. His mother is an obsessed Buffalo's football fan, who seems to care about her team far more then Billy, (Gallo) and his father seems to only care about himself.Christina Ricci plays an interesting part and goes along for the ride. The film does not delve into the background of her character, e.g: where she lives, works, or whether she has family etc, but, although this would be interesting it is not essential to the plot. The story focuses more on Gallo's character Billy. By the end of the film I felt that I'd grown with him.The film does make you laugh, there is no doubt about that. It is obvious that Vincent Gallo's intention was to touch peoples funny bones, but, you can also see that he is trying to do more than that. It is a well rounded film that has elements of comedy and drama, which often seem entwined.This is Vincent Gallo's Masterpiece, he wrote, directed, cast, and did the score for the movie. 'Come on Mr. Gallo where is your next masterpiece? Surely a studio has called you again on the strength of this work?'While watching the film with friends I did fear that it wouldn't be their cup of tea (for some unknown reason) but all, in turn, agreed that it was a great film that they wanted to watch again.I highly recommend this film, so get hold of it if you can and try not to fall asleep half way through- you will regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was blown away by this superb independent movie from Vincent Gallo.Both tragic and hilarious, the film is a magnificent study in human loneliness and man's desire to be accepted and loved by one's peers, in this case Billy's (Vincent Gallo) parents.Frankly, his parents aren't worth the effort and watching his attempts to find favour with them by kidnapping a pretty young woman (Christina Ricci) and making her pose as his wife is both touching and sad.I highly recommend this gem. In my opinion one of the best films from the late 90s.See it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film blew me away. I had extremely high hopes for this movie, and in a rare occurrence, this is a film that delivered. It didn't take me long to get hooked on this film, thanks to some cold and gray visuals and somber music in the opening minutes. The film is further helped by a number of great performances, especially by Gallo and Ricci. Ricci's character was just so unique that it kept things unconventional, and so most of the kidnapping cliches are therefore avoided. But my favourite part of the film really was Gallo. Yes, his character is pretty dim, and really, he's a loser, but once his parents are introduced, I couldn't help but feel some sympathy for him. Quite simply, this movie has a great story, some terrific acting, and it was made in a highly creative way. In other words, this is a must-see motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting yet slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about this one. Self-indulgent tripe or brilliant cinema? A little of both. Billy Brown is a wholly unlikeable character, even at the end when he's all gushy about heart-shaped cookies. Christina Ricci looks drop-dead gorgeous in this film, and I always like what she does with characters, even ones as lame as this. Of course we learn nothing about Layla (I thought her name was Wendy, same as Rosanna Arquette's character? Wha?) so we don't know why she clings to this unmannered, unkempt, oily loser... she must have low self-esteem. In any event, there ARE things I like about this movie; the cinematography, the interesting use of flashbacks-in-a-box, the photo booth scene ("We're the couple that doesn't touch. We're spanning time") and Ricci's very sexy dance at the bowling alley. (sort of an Eraserhead feel to that, although I don't know why exactly) Well, we obviously aren't SUPPOSED to know anything about Layla's life... but why any woman would stay with a greasy jerk who treats her like crap is beyond me. But that's true life, I guess. Some of the scenes went WAY long... like, enough already! All in all an interesting movie, to be sure. Dark, grainy, odd music, Ricci's big blue eyelids... I would recommend giving it a shot.</fullReview>

But whereas others can and do get away with their responses to life, his lands him in prisonHis plan on leaving prison is not that clever and it looks like he'll shortly end up back behind bars but somehow he lands a girlfriend!Spoiler! I read one comment where the happy ending seemed contrived and that in reality he would obviously mess things up and loose the girl... thats too cynical for me, why do low budget indie films have to had a depressing ending? Isn't the whole point of the film about how a seemingly hopeless character can be changed by love. Hollywood may overdo it but it doesn't mean it isn't true, a universal truth perhaps Yes, he is on the edge but I believe that this girl is the first to have ever truly loved him and that he might just be okThe film is very bleak and gritty - almost documentary style in its realism. Its certainly infinitly more real than the rubbishy reality tv junk we are subjected to every dayI think this film is a success and genuinly uplifting if you can put yourself in the place of this misguided uneducated man. I didn't find it difficult to do this, surely everyone responds as he does at some point in their livesI would recommend this film for its realism and ability to move. It really is a very moving and honest film5 out of 5!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just released after a five-year term in prison as a consequence of gambling felonies, the introvert and emotionally frustrated Billy Brown (Gallo) returns to hometown Buffalo to meet up with his parents and to take vengeance on the person that indirectly caused him to do time. This being a former football player who made Billy loses a 10.000 dollar bet. He kidnaps a young girl named Layla (Ricci) and forces her to pretend she's his wife so that he looks good in his parents' eyes. Buffalo '66 would be a standard, unspectacular social portrait of American suburbia if it weren't for the vision of Gallo and the more than respectable cast. Gallo presents his first independent film as a director like a cruel autobiographic comedy, congested with egocentric characters (except for the cherubic Layla) and a hopelessly depressing tone. The casting in this production is downright excellent. Gallo himself is an obvious 'enfant terrible' but, to me, it was Billy's parents who impressed the most. Anjelica Huston is stunning as the indifferent football fan that prefers watching the game over her new daughter-in-law explaining how she and Billy met. And Ben Gazzara is even more impressive as the father who's still frustrated over his missed musical career. There are terrific supportive roles for Rosanna Arquette, Jan-Michael Vincent and Mickey Rourke (as the corrupt bookmaker).Buffalo '66 unquestionably is the best film Vincent Gallo ever was involved in. Normally, he just tries too hard to be controversial but this is real sentiment for a change! This film is simple but honest and it has feeling!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie because of all the glowing reviews of this and was sorely disappointed. It's low budget, low quality filming, with terrible writing. It looked like it was filmed with a home movie camera or something. Logically it makes no sense at all. The dude just treats her really badly and is a jerk yet she wants to be around him. Interjected in the movie are these bizarre flashbacks that are weird. The entire movie is weird with spontaneous dancing out of nowhere or weird singing like it's on a stage but it's really just in a bedroom. Very unrealistic and just plain dumb. It may be the worst movie I've every seen and it's really annoying how the dude just complains and is mean talking and rude to this girl all the time. I wish I had never seen this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed "Buffalo '66" (1998) a great deal, and not only because I live a few minutes away from Buffalo. So many, many movies have lousy music scores that rely on repetitive patterns or bad jazz or, what is worse, bad rock music or some nameless mixture. Good music that fits a movie is in short supply in post-classic-Hollywood, be it rock, jazz, classical, world, or whatever. So when I hear Stan Getz's "I Remember When" in the score here (arranged by Eddie Sauter), it felt very, very good. It meant that Vincent Gallo's taste in music was as sound as his movie-making chops in the rest of this funny movie.I do not know what Gallo intended in his story, but I can say what came across to me beyond the humor of it and beyond the themes of love and coping, of swimming through life's waters to find human connections, of achieving one's dreams and meeting with disappointments, that are prominent in the movie. It is this. We are treated to an array of main characters all of whom speak and often act in ways that one would usually term "abnormal", or on the irrational side, or strange. Gallo's character, his mom and dad, and his "girl friend" (Christina Ricci) all range from off-key to troubled to paranoid to unstable and to obsessed. This rings a bell with me, because in recent years, it has seemed to me that most "normal" people have a few screws loose and that whole societies sometimes lose contact with reality or at least their governments do. The line between normality and abnormality is much fuzzier than I ever realized before, and in this movie we experience that.</fullReview>

The atmosphere represented the damaged and self-conscious person's life. Creative and not filled with clichés.

		<shortDescription>The power of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have wrestled with whether to trash this movie for Gallo's or to recognize that I don't hate it and that it has an odd sweetness in Layla (Ricci)'s and Billy (Gallo)'s relationship. It doesn't make a bit of sense to me. He is abusive to her. She seems like a sweet girl without the sort of emotional hangups to tolerate the abuse of someone like Billy. Billy is a horrible person- egotistical and abusive. The script, to me, doesn't make a plausible case that Layla would stay with Billy. We don't know enough of her background to believe that she would tolerate such abuse and bad treatment. He kidnaps her. He berates her for being TOO good at giving a good impression of him. He is jealous of her involvement with guys before she'd even met him. Why she stays with him is a bit of a mystery. This is one of the major shortcomings of the movie. It's hard to believe that someone would tolerate such unsolicited treatment. If we knew a bit more about her background, we might find her acceptance of him more understandable. All that said however, for whatever reason, she does stay with him and there is the suggestion of love at the end of the movie. This makes the movie magical and really a little sentimental. It's ultimately a love story for hipsters. I can't trash this movie because I'm not cynical enough to do that. It is a sweet movie at heart and it is as though Gallo dares us to not like Billy. Well, I don't like him, but if someone does, then I wish he and the girl all the luck in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo's darkly comic, ultimately touching debut film, 'Buffalo 66', has a stellar cast playing unglamourous roles and a central turn from Gallo himself as insecure loser Billy, fresh out of prison and back in his native Buffalo, but with no real sense of home. The film departs occasionally from literal realism is a mostly effective, entertaining manner, but behind the quirkiness, this is a serious movie about the ability to be love and be loved. It is, however, all about Gallo: Christina Ricci's character presumably has some issues of her own (why else would she be hanging out with a loser like Billy?) but instead of exploring them, the film allows her at least a hint of the role of the forgiving angel, sent (or rather kidnapped) to rescue an otherwise doomed man. But it's still a successful film, one that visits some dark places, but brings the viewer out the other side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We are a couple that doesn't touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Buffalo 66" was the feature length directorial debut of writer-director Vincent Gallo. The film stars Gallo himself as Billy Brown, a young man who has recently been released from prison. In an effort to impress his parents, Brown kidnaps a young woman, played by Christina Ricci, and forces her to pose as his wife.In real life, Gallo has a reputation for being an arrogant, irritating narcissist. Many believe this persona to be a sham, Gallo turning his life into a kind of performance art piece. Whether this is true or not, I don't know. The point, though, is that for much of "Buffalo 66's" running time, Billy is portrayed as a supremely unlikeable jerk. Gradually, though, Gallo begins to reveal where Billy's more abrasive qualities stem from. The film then ends with Billy turning his back on hate, anger, jealousy and blame. Elsewhere it contains brief sequences in which characters dance, sing or watch television, little vignettes which speak to lives of regret. Be they Billy, Billy's parents, or an ageing sportsman called Scott Wood, everyone in the film seems weighed down by past disappointments. Using flashback sequences which frame the past within television boxes (and later, photographs), the film perhaps implicates the Hollywood dream factory itself in setting up and shattering illusions."Buffalo 66" builds to a very touching final act. But it also contains a number of overly quirky moments which clash awkwardly with the film's more realist tone. These include a "bullet time" sequence which pre-date similar sequences in 1999's "The Matrix". The film co-stars Mickey Rourke and Rossana Arquette.8/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clearly made on a budget, there is no fancy CGI, no big car chases and no big fight scenes. It's a piece that relies very much on performance to keep it together and on that front I can't fault it. Both Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci did a fine job, as did Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Houston. I guess it's one of those films that's more about the inner workings of the mind; you find yourself asking what is the motivation behind Billy's actions and what exactly does Layla see in him? I have to admit at first I really didn't like the character of Billy, but he grew on me as I came to understand him more. It's a film that took some time to get going but I found it a worthy watch eventually.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 6.6/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of doubtful taste but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This makes you wonder about the relatively distinguishable thin line between artists and entertainers and what does it mean to be one or another or even a mix of both. What can be said of Vincent Gallo's efforts as a director? "The Brown Bunny" outraged many crowds out there not only because of its infamous real sex scene but because the work itself seemed an egoistical attempt to prove something to someone and that was the director trying to impress himself. It's quite pretentious, very empty but manageable, watchable. Now, the beloved "Buffalo '66" appears to have more logic, more sense and a good structure with its transitions from one scene to the next one, there's an artist moving and creating those moments and sometimes everything flows so easily, so it can't be art, this Jekyll is getting dominated by Mr. Hyde, the mindless entertainment. What's the verdict? But let us go down with the story: Gallo plays Billy, a convict just released from prison who has two plans on his mind: to kill the man responsible for his arrest and to pay a visit to his parents (Anjelica Huston and Ben Gazzara) of whom he doesn't have much of a good relationship, and during those years arrested he sent letters pretending he was working for the government on a secret project and that he also got married. The latter plan is absurd because he doesn't know anyone, he's deeply immersed in himself so what does he do? He kidnaps a girl (Christina Ricci) and forces her to be his wife while he's visiting his folks. All she has to do is to make him look nice before them, show that they are a loving couple. And who could have thought such plan not only worked out but also Billy got himself a bonus: the girl fell for him despite all of his cruelties and commands.What does "Buffalo '66" is trying to impose with its apparently innocuous speech? One direction: it's an unconventional love story with everything to go wrong but in the end it turns out alright. Another deeper perspective, which also includes the fore-mentioned view, merely says to us that misogynists, homophobes and scums of the earth deserve some love and understanding and they'll get it in the most strange of ways. That's what I get from watching this. Billy treats everybody bad, people seem to worth nothing for him (the only guy of whom he doesn't say a word and keeps with his head down through the whole time is the character played by Mickey Rourke) and he keeps going with this trend for on and on. Basically, with this movie Gallo is giving hope to many idiots out there who think acting like his character will give them something truly rewarding, they'll find true love...someday!If that's the way it's not supposed to be read, then why all the gigantic love this movie has? The story isn't appealing (except here and there), takes a whole lot of time to take over and to make us involved. At the top of all: the script is annoying as hell with its characters, specially Billy, repeating their lines and situations over and over. What's up with the bathroom thing? All the time he needed a bathroom. "Just look at me. Just look at me" or "Goon! Goon!" and even "We are a couple that doesn't touch." and always getting something involving chocolate. When Ricci's character was offered to have something brought to her by Billy, before she answered I said to myself "If she says chocolate once again I'll give thumbs down to this movie!". And she said it. But then, the climatic moment unfolded and it was beautiful, seemed to worth all the while and all the craziness. Won't say what happens in it except that it might be the greatest use of a Yes song in a movie with "Heart of the Sunrise" playing for quite a bit. Besides that moment there's some memorable good sequences such as Gazzara's dubbing a music pretending to be a great singer or the girl's story on how she met Billy, inventing their perfect love story. The man has some good imagination, I'll give you that. He can prove to be artistic but gotta work harder to be considered one. And it was an autobiographical story? Well...not much of an interesting one. At the end of the day it's just another purposeless story made to leave you at ease and distracted, enjoying the little entertainment it can offer you. Liked it but not that much and I'm still trying to figure out what's so special about it for people to love it. Almost forgot: and once again the man flattered himself about his member, this time not showing it but with someone saying "But it's SO big!" to him. Ugh... 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many great scenes in this film, it is hard to choose a favorite. The ones that stand out are the opener when Gallo finds it hard to take a p**s, and the other one in the phonebooth that is hilarious in many ways (mainly because of Gallo's lines, glances and values in life). Apart from that Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston deliver great performances as the parents. And let's not forget about Ricci who makes the most (and that's a lot) of her underwritten part. It makes you wonder why this film wasn't able to find a distributor in Holland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever, period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo has made an incredibly good movie featuring himself and the glorious Christina Ricci. Every second of this movie is perfect. It is a work of art, and a priceless one at that. Christina Ricci gives the best performance of her life. The film is transcendental; it transcends reality. It is superb. I've never been so inspired after watching a film before, ever. The movie may be too realistic for some, and too painful for others. But, if you can handle a portrait of a dark reality, you won't go away unsatisfied. God is a woman, and her name is Christina Ricci.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the second movie of Vincent Gallo I see. I don't remember the first one. But from now on, I will look to see his other films. You know why I like Buffalo 66 so much? Because it's dirty! Cheap hotel, cheap striptease joint, chear parents, cheap hero with cheap friend! And miss Ricci tryin' to be a white angel in this messy life. This is an American movie! Not a Hollywood movie : an American movie. When I want to see what's creative in the USA, I had to look at movies of that kind, not to the other kind. I really love the sequence where Billy is at home with his parents. The TV is always on and keeps attractions. This is just like...mmmmm, at my home! (Sorry mom and dad. Anyway they don't have the Internet) So, for something very different, Vincent Gallo did it with a very good way. I also liked the two old progressive rock songs (King Crimson &amp; Yes).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo's mockery of life and relationships is refreshingly original in it's story directing, and style. It is a story that is absurdly dysfunctional in all of it's relationships on many different levels. Athough discomfort is a dominant feeling given off through the characters often unkind interactions and conflicting lifestyles, the twist at the end of the movie brings a sudden almost peaceful calm with the conclusion. All the stories oddities and flashbacks are brought together in the tight and sudden finale that lasts longer than you think. This movie is Vincent Gallo's directorial debut and is remarkable in it's style and vision as seen through the eyes of a desperate and slightly dillusional ex-cons difficult world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) gets out of jail and can't find a place to urinate. Desperate after being turned down at a number of places (He even tries to get back into jail.), Billy goes into a dance studio, finds a bathroom but he can't go because the guy in the neighboring stall is looking at him. So, he kidnaps Layla (Christina Ricci) and talks her into pretending that she's his wife and going to dinner with him at his parents house. His mom and dad (Angelica Houston and Ben Gazzara) are really weird. Mom can't talk about anything but the Buffalo Bills and dad just want to grope Layla. After dinner Billy and Layla go to a motel. Layla wants to consummate the `marriage' but Billy wants to kill Scott Woods, ex-Bills place kicker. Billy is sure Woods missed a field goal on purpose, which ruined his life. Billy had bet $10,000 on the game. I really loved the ending to this movie. There's gotta be hope for the biggest losers in the world, if there's hope for Billy and Layla. Oh yeah, Billy did find a tree before he burst. Worth the price of a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo. It's amazing how notorious some people can get for practically nothing. Buffalo 66, Gallo's directorial debut isn't, however, a complete 'nothing,' for it definitely has its moments. Some of the stylistic elements are interesting, the strip-club scene in particular is very effective, and there are entertaining and memorable moments throughout. The music too is a particular highlight. But this film oozes 'indie.' In fact it reeks of it. Made with all the skill of a film school drop out, the camera-work is uneven, the story is lopsided, and the entire experience is a mixed bag. If you know anything about Gallo, this entire film is one big narcissistic self-blowjob (the bathroom scene about how 'big' he is? Come on!). But let's just forget about that. The biggest problem is Billy himself. It's hard to like him. Despite being called 'sweet/kind' so many times by his 'girlfriend,' he never does a SINGLE thing that is actually 'sweet/kind' throughout the film. He is crass, angry, and bullying to everyone he meets. So this film comes off more of a 'whoa is me. Feel sorry for me' story for a jerk. Not a good base for a story. That very story, too, is weak. The whole kidnapping premise (which is the whole story) makes little sense (there's no motivation for her to do what he wants or to continue on with him). That said, it is a nice treat to see Ricci, Huston and Roorke. And there are a lot of funny scenes here (some intentional, some not). This definitely will not appeal to a large audience, but for those who like 'cinema,' art, or the indie scene, you might get a kick out of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film deserves 10 stars simply because Vincent Gallo's concept of falling in love with a stranger is an incredibly novel one. I really commend him for writing the screen play then going on to direct it and play it's leading role. The man even wrote and performed the greater part of the soundtrack. Gallo's commitment to his film idea is remarkable.I loved how simply written the script was as well as enjoyed the overall depth of the film. The casting choices were outstanding. Christina Ricci had an especially amazing performance during the scene featuring the song "Moonchild." The cinematography was right on for what I felt the film's overall feel was.I'd say definitely worth seeing if you like off-the-wall movies with original plots, scripts, and character ideas. Although he's somewhat under appreciated, I felt Vincent Gallo does an excellent job in every aspect of his work and Buffalo '66 is a prime example of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BUFFALO 66 1998 (VINCENT GALLO, Christina RICCI, ANJELICA HUSTON) DIRECTED BY: VINCENT GALLO ~ THE RUNDOWN: When broken down, 'Buffalo 66' is a model of perfect film-making on every level and scores a ten in every faction necessary; a hidden gem...and effing hilarious. ~ Vincent Gallo is f*cking weird...but genuinely talented and obviously not a sell-out. He's a modern Orson Welles and this is his Citizen Kane. And even if it's not truly a film of such magnitude, it's still the most ingenious comedy in recent memory and I'm honestly surprised the movie hasn't stirred more attention. If you find it anywhere near as funny as I did, you will laugh your as*s off more than a couple times. And it's not because of some weird, idiosyncratic brand of humor I have...no...the comedy here is real and universally brilliant...almost in a kind of Seinfeld meets Taxi Driver type of way. Yet, at the same time, the story is surprisingly and effectively moving. Gallo's performance is so alarmingly vivid and filled with such humanity the viewer can't help but be captivated by his character and grow to like and even relate to someone who initially could be called rat-like to say the least. His performance is especially amazing when you stop to consider he was the director and shot the movie with great skill and innovation, too. I think what impacted me most about the movie though, if not its amazing acting from everyone involved or the immense entertainment/comedy value, was the legitimately inspirational ending. It was powerful...in a subtle and authentic type of way and cleverly written as well. I honestly don't think it could have ended better and it's a fact that, when it comes to the movie-watching experience, nothing makes you happier than a movie that consistently and thoroughly satisfies like this did for me. Oh yeah, the score was great too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you first begin viewing Buffalo 66, you may be struck by the starkness of the set and characters. You may even wonder why you are watching it in the first place, yet you are drawn into the mix. The story is a strange one: a man gets out of prison, and hijacks a young woman, who becomes a willing victim in his plan to demonstrate to his family that he never went to prison at all, but rather, had a wonderful life and a girlfriend. We begin to feel that she has nothing special to do that day, and doesn't mind. What is truly intriguing is the premise, as it unfolds, to reveal why our hero had gone to prison in the first place and how his true character evolves to become what it was destined to be. Anyone who is a fan of Confederacy of Dunces and the justification that someone's love gives to our existence will be a fan of Vincent Gallo and this movie, as well as the many other projects with which this interesting man is engaged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gallo &amp; Ricci In A Love That "Spans Time"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Buffalo 66' is a strange (and sometimes funny) little movie. It's grubby-looking and the plotlessness sometimes feels like aimlessness, but there are some hilarious highlights. Writer/director/composer/star Vincent Gallo proves that repeating a line can make it funnier and funnier. While sitting in one of those two-dollar photo booths with an uncooperative Christina Ricci, Gallo keeps saying that he wants the picture to show a love that "spans time". She's not to touch him, but their love spans time. And it keeps going like that until he's happy. I can't do the scene justice. Trust me, it's really funny.And this all takes place only hours after he's kidnapped her! She doesn't seem to mind being a hostage, though, and he's too depressed to be one of those "you're dead if you scream" kidnappers. Gallo is Billy Brown, a youngish malcontent fresh out of jail after serving time for a crime he had nothing to do with and now wants revenge on the Buffalo Bills' place-kicker he blames for putting him there. He snatches Ricci and wants her to masquerade as his wife, simply to impress his indifferent parents. Anjelica Huston is his football-loving mom and Ben Gazzara is his ravenous old man. They meet their "daughter in law", they like her, they mostly ignore Billy, and then the newlyweds move on to other experiences that are both mundane and fascinating.Reminiscent of a collection of scenes you might see during an Actor's Studio workshop, 'Buffalo 66' is a mannered piece of unpredictability. I kept thinking of 'Stranger Than Paradise'. Neither film makes a compelling argument for a second viewing, but they're both quirky pictures that dare to move at their own pace. Gallo risks being pretentious (or even boring), but 'Buffalo 66' works. There's even a resolution to the place-kicker tangent. And if nothing else, there's that scene in the photo booth. It gets funnier as it plays out and it's a minor miracle that Ricci didn't lose it &amp; start laughing. I know I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buffalo '66 is the kind of film that will separate audiences on many levels. It follows its own rules and stays very true to its own independent goals. Vincent Gallo should be respected for making a movie that features a lead character who isn't as cut and dry as most theater goers would probably prefer. Even though his character is obviously confused, insecure and borderline crazy, you still cant help but feel drawn to him and his demeanor. Somehow you empathize with Billy Brown even though he is quite clearly an a--hole. Everything from the cinematography to the acting to the dialogue really speaks to the gray area that lies somewhere between the black and white backbone of profit-driven film. Gallo's quite obviously got talent and Buffalo '66 puts it on display. Well worth renting.</fullReview>

Most of the intriguing people I meet on a daily basis are bad actors at life.

Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston are phenomenal as Billy's parents. Mickey Rourke and Jan Michael Vincent both contribute delightful cameos. And Kevin Corrigan gives us a marvelous uncredited performance as Billy's dull-witted buddy Goon, who decides he wants to be known as Rocky.Nothing about this movie is pat or predictable, and it just gets better and better with each viewing. It's easily on my top 10 list. Gallo has earned a place in the pantheon of great film makers with this piece.Finally, this movie most definitely has a point: Love can save us from ourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Vincent Gallo is a funny experience. You know what an actor's supposed to do, so you tend to watch for what happens instead. Extraordinarily, Gallo manages to get Christina Ricci to go with him in this... his famously dismissive remarks about her after making the film are strange and misrepresentative. They're both good and the film itself is excellent.A (very) offbeat lovestory, the characters act as one might expect dysfunctional, parochial American social flops to. The film is based around a ball game, watched on TV, whose outcome has set off the tension that drives the story. The media of TV is quietly at the heart of the story; for Gallo, life is suspended in teen-age, confusing and unsusal. Because of the intervention of the National moral leveller, TV, bringing all the news and confessional 'morality' shows his life has continued to be odd but within the confines of a institutions that frown upon him. From this and from his impetuous, desperate immoral act, an attempt to deal with this world at large imposing itself on him, he falls in love.An intellectual teen flick, without that fact beloved of Go or Rules of Engagement. Great film 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really know who Vincent Gallo was before seeing this film, I didn't know about the film at all. It was pure delight from start to finish. My husband and I became huge Gallo fans after seeing this! He did just about everything in it, from composing the music, to writing the screenplay and directing it, and even doing the vocals on some of the tracks!It was hilarious and moving at the same time. I particularly loved the fashion aspect (Gallo has such a confident, hip and unique dress sense). The dialogue was so cleverly written it might have been a transcription of actual conversations - with all the repetition and redundancy that happens in real life and never in movies.The human behaviour too could have been directly transposed from real life, with all the mind-changing and seemingly illogical acts that we do and that frustrate the people around us till they are able to understand what motivates us.Gallo has so much charisma you can't but sympathise, even though his character is obnoxious and deliberately tries to make everyone dislike him. Christina Ricci is excellent, she really won my respect in this film. Buffalo 66 is probably my favourite film of all time, along with Van Trier's Breaking the Waves. A tiny little minus goes to Anjelica Houston who was perhaps a little unconvincing. I can understand that though, she's been in Hollywood too long to be natural any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is amazing, everything about it is perfect. Vincent Gallo is a genius and he is someone to watch out for because he is multi-talented at acting, writing, directing etc. I am a big fan of indie films and this film ranks alongside other brilliant indie films such as Kevin Smith's 'Clerks'. I would recommend this film to anyone, it is an exceptional film. Even though Ricci and Gallo had problems on set, their brilliant chemistry shows up on film. Go see this film, it will blow you away and it shocks me that Gallo didn't win any awards for the screenplay because it is one of the best I have heard. This film is one of my favorites, it is moving,enjoyable and sometimes hilarious. Gallo is a new God of film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been wanting to see this movie for a while, so while my friends and I were at the video store today we decided to check it out. I was expecting it to be completely different than it was, but now I don't even know what I was expecting in the first place. I loved everything about this movie. The acting, directing, storyline, script, cinementography etc. etc. etc. Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci are great together and the role of the Bills-obsessed mother played by Angelica Huston was praiseworthy. Being from Rochester, NY (an hour away from Buffalo) made the movie that much better. It started out for me as being really sad. I wanted to cry for Billy's character. Towards the end I was getting annoyed with his attitude but the ending changed it all for me. It was perfect. I can't wait to purchase this movie and proudly add it to my DVD collection. 10/10.Conor</fullReview>

The film has some pretty far-fetched characters and a ludicrous plot, but everything is held together by Gallo and Ricci's acting abilities. I'd say it's one of the greatest independent films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

I sat down to watch something I thought would be mediocre but would satisfy the need i had for watching it after so long waiting for it. I sat for 113 minutes in awe. The acting seemed ad-libbed which added to the reality and raw emotions that ran throughout the film. It was a brilliant example of an under-rated film that captures so many emotions. The ending is unexpected, and the acting of both Gallo and Ricci deserved recognition. This film will answer questions you hadn't asked and make you feel all the crap will one day work itself out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a sullen indifference about how onlookers might feel about Billy Brown that some people might regard as daring or brave or unflinchingly honest, but I'm sure there are others who feel as I do that Vincent Gallo's creation is unsettling and self-indulgent. Even at the end, when Brown decides not to avenge himself, you get the feeling that after the titles are done rolling, he'll be back in that strip joint, finishing the job he set out to do in the first place. Gallo has a sophisticated visual sense, and he has accomplished something I thought no one could: get Christina Ricci to play someone who believes in someone or something with anything resembling passion. Her character is an enigma; why a woman in her right mind would put up with Billy Brown's craziness requires a lot more explaining than the writer/director furnishes. Yet she does, and the movie should whirl with wonder over Brown's dog luck at having found someone like her. But on that point--love and forbearance changing one's outlook on life--the movie offers leftover baked goods; it remains earthbound.And I'm sorry, but I am personally passed the point of blaming my parents for my own lunacy; I would have thought that Gallo might find a more sophisticated reason for Billy's. Even with a $300,000 budget, you hope, with some of the accolades this movie is drawing, the moment that Ben Gazzara is given to sing would be dazzling instead of pathetic. And a movie couldn't be all that good when it hands an actress with the stature of Anjelica Huston a role in which she gives what is the worst performance of her career.Maybe it's courage that motivates Gallo to play out his story without apology, but it leaves this movie as frozen as that fantastic dream shot he creates. It's for a split second compelling, but hard to cherish. Sometimes showing people you care about what they think gives a movie the resonance they can carry with them always. It provides the necessary heat the screen needs to capture the imagination. Sometimes caring matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true find!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buffalo '66 is one of those rare movies that you're likely to overlook at the art house cinemas or video store shelves, but that once you happen tostumble upon it is a true gem. Vincent Gallo plays the auteur here as writer/director/actor, with stunning results. The film has a look to it that places it aesthetically amongst the great American films of the late sixties and early seventies - using a grainy, primary-colour palette. As well, Gallo pulls out all the stops with various optical effects such as square-iris transitions and frames-within-frames. The acting is subtly brilliant, with Gallo playing a likable low-life and Christina Ricci in a brilliant turn as a teenage moll. Ben Gazarra and Anjelica Huston are hilarious as Gallo's dysfunctional-household parents. Owing a nod to Jim Jarmusch's goofily bland environments, Gallo portrays the backdrop of Buffalo as a realer-than-real world of everyday people who tread the fine line between the mundane and kitschy. It's a rare treat to see scenes set in bus stations, empty bowling alleys and Denny's restaurants. I'm probably not doing the film justice on the page. Ultimately, it's a visual experience. But don't be intimidated by any labels of "Buffalo '66" as an indie-art film. Simply put, it's a lot of fun. It defies and incorporates clichés and presents them in an entertaining mix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The-problems-of-the-guy-that-just-comes-out-of-jail must be one of the most recurrent themes of US film, and it is hard to do something original on it. Yet, this is what Buffalo'66 trying to do, with some success and some failures. The film is indeed tighter that it appears I believe. I think it has an original way of working with close up, multiple frames. And I recommend in this respect the scene, at the very beginning, where Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo), waiting for the bus that will take him from the prison to town remembers his life inside. It is quite suggestive indeed. Too, mostly thanks to short flashbacks, the film give us effective hints as to the psychology of this enervating guy. We slowly start to understand him a bit better, and why not even feel sympathy for him. Personally, the meeting with his parents reminded me of Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without a Cause and even Kenneth Loach's Family Life. Now, the film would not be that interesting if Layla alias Wendy (Chistina Ricci) would not create such a contrapuntal effect, but I do not want to tell more. Christina Ricci IS the reward, and her performance is all the more admirable that her character was dangerously close from the stupid blonde that loves to be badly treated. But she makes something else out of it. So I believe that you should see the film if you liked Cohens' Largo or The Big Lebowski (they play bowling there too), or if you want to see slightly different pictures. On the other hand, I can understand you get tired of Vincent Gallo self complacent character and acting and think that Gallo should have let more people get into the making of the film as it is so difficult to do everything oneself. Well you will either leave after 20 minutes or be fond of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Buffalo 66" is one of the strangest films I have ever seen. It's not only the strange plot (ex-con kidnaps a teenage girl to pose as his wife for his mentally unstable parents) that makes a mark in the "strange" category, but also the style of film-making that Gallo himself has created and used for the movie (the fade-ins and fade-outs in boxes with a creepy soundtrack accompanying them) that succeed as a landmark in originality. The story also works and the actors are magnificent from Gallo himself as paranoid Billy Brown who is permanently disturbed with low self esteem and pointless obsession to Ben Gazzara and Angelica Houston as his insane parents. Every character, major and minor, are wonderful. Buffalo 66 proves that you don't need great special effects and a complicated plotline to have a good movie....just originality and a good cast of characters. CAST! CAST! CAST! The ending is one of the most disturbing ones ever seen in a movie, which is only on a re-edited version and not on the home-video release. The home-video version has somewhat of a vague and shallow ending that really kills the mood of the movie and hurts the film a lot when it comes to brilliance and wit. The home video version I rate * * 1/2 stars (out of 4) and the re-edited version in which Gallo finishes what he initially intended to do for years gets * * * * (out of 4). A great film indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget Ricci, lets talk about Gallo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a big year for Christina Ricci, unfortunately I didn't get to see any of her raved performances until they hit video this January. While I was relatively impressed... what got me more was a performance by a Vincent Gallo in a little film I didn't know anything about, called Buffalo '66. Gallo, wrote, starred in, directed and composed the music for this dysfunctional love story, or lack of love story rather. Gallo's performance is staggeringly good. His direction and pacing is even better. Not many directors can direct themselves this well. It only seems to work when the actor/director is also the writer. Gallo creates a world so realistic, full of pain and uncertainties, we get hooked. At first we laugh at his bickering sick family. We watch as his mother and father ignore his presence at the dinner table, the tension from their scene carries out of the VCR and into your living room. We stop laughing, and we begin to read the hurt on this man. He's got nothing. His entire life is nothing. We want him to put that gun down so badly, to start over with Layla, to try and rebuild his life. And because we get so attached to this character, it's why we love this film so much. I for one will be the first in line to see Gallo's next cinematic opus. I hope to see some of you there as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once you get past the first 20 minutes of this film (which, granted, are not not not good), you'll see a great film that just fell short of brilliance. Granted, some of Gallo's techniques are a bit cliche'd and over-the-top artsy. However, he makes up for it in story and the latter of the film.Definitely worth seeing. Definitely worth remembering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film pushes the limits of filmmaking, and goes one step beyond. Gallo, who has been wrongly accused of "self-indulgence" overkill, can do no wrong. Excellent acting, nicely shot, and a real treat for people that are new to independent film. Definitely not for all tastes, but not for close-minded hypocrites as well. You know who you are. It follows the lowly Billy Brown {played beautifully by Gallo}, and his plights once released from prison. Excellent supporting performances from Christina Ricci, Ben Gazzara and Angelica Huston.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BUFFALO 66, an art house gem, is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and its major downfall is that it was released the same year as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The film is, in every sense of the word, a masterpiece, laden with innovative camera shots, brilliant acting, (esp. Christina Ricci, who turns in the performance of a lifetime), and a great ending, probably one of the best endings since Charlie Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS. This film is worth being seen time and again, and I recommend it to anyone who's looking for something new and brilliant.</fullReview>

I would rather watch Caligula 4 more times (the uncut version)than sit through this movie again. Christina Ricci is a wonderful actress and she deserves better- this was just another case of a man writing a woman's voice and totally missing the mark. Thank goodness I only wasted $3 on this thing, and two hours of my time. (the man sitting next to me had the good sense to leave within twenty minutes.)</fullReview>

After seeing a series of terrible movies (your friends &amp; neighbors..) it was, to say the least, a pleasant surprise. The color was absolutely lush and beautiful and the soundtrack was incredibly appropriate. The acting was so touching - it was both funny and sad at the same time. it was incredibly uplifting - I expected the ending to be sad, but I was pleasantly surprised.

		<fullReview>Yet another entry into the genre of American independent films, this one unlike a lot of others lately has all the makings of a cult classic.With Vincent Gallo as a truly dysfunctional human being, through Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston as his even more dysfunctional parents and Christina Ricci once again proving what a truly remarkable young actress she is this films sparkles with outlandish humour and what must be for Gallo some extremely painful childhood memories.A truly remarkable film in that despite the situation there is not one likeable character on screen, they are all self-absorbed to the nth degree, this is a film worth seeing if for no other reason that to savour the way Gallo skewers his parents in a way we would all like to do but most do not have the courage or chance to do in this format.A wonderful film which shows great potential for Gallo and just confirms Ricci's status as possibly the new indie queen.Parker Posey watch out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buffalo 66 offers a raw, comically surreal, original story that leaves you both disgusted and intrigued with its characters and setting.Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo, also co-wrote, scored and directed) enters the urban winter streets from a five year prison term with three things on his mind. First, and most urgent, he needs a place to pee. Second, he must convince his parents of a lie that he has been on a five-year government mission and happily married. Finally, he must kill the Buffalo Bills placekicker who's missed field goal placed Billy in a heap of trouble with a bookie (Mickey Rourke,White Sands). The bookie made him take a fall for a crime in order to redeem a gambling debt, hence the five year prison term.As we are dashed on the head with all the stupid mistakes Billy has made to bring him to this point in his life, Gallo's skill and inventiveness as a film maker and actor introduces pungent flashbacks of Billy's childhood that were both heartbreaking and horrific. Christina Ricci (Ice Storm) played a very convincing Layla, the kidnapped victim Billy forces to play his wife for his parents (Anjelica Huston, Ben Gazzara). She doesn't seem to mind being a victim as she progressively falls in love with Billy and patiently returns his sanity.There is a strong sense of Gallo's intimacy with Buffalo in the use of real locations throughout the movie. A incredibly convincing sequence was shot in Gallo's childhood home where Billy's highly dysfunctional family dwell. So convincing it leaves the question of how much of this abuse is actually autobiographical. Several superb technical sequences allow the movie,which is slow in spots, to stay alive in weird anticipation to what he will do next.Buffalo 66 is a deep, dark and hip film that promises great things in the future from Vincent Gallo.$7 (out of 8)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo, love him or hate him, you've got to admire him for his refreshing honesty. Early on, this film seems to be going nowhere, as the viewer watches Gallo's character Billy, just released from prison, trying desperately to find a toilet. When he does, in a rather unnecessary scene, he gets to display just how masculine he is (excuse me, "thinks" he is) and just how large his penis is. After that, he meets Christina Ricci's Layla, and the movie really gets rolling. I won't go on much about the plot, as you can easily read about it elsewhere on this page, so I'll praise the performances of Gallo and especially Ricci, who's easily one of the best working today. Great performaces from the supporting cast (yes, I am including Mickey Rourke and Jan Michael Vincent). The movie is bizarre, but mostly in a good way (the only problem being that it is at times arty just for the sake of being arty). I especially love the part when Ben Gazarra, as Billy's dad, sings an old song to Layla, and the part, where for no apparent reason, Layla starts tap dancing in a bowling alley. This film is recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to the theater with a mild disdain for the film's director, Vincent Gallo, whose constant self-aggrandizement and Zeppelin-sized ego are a constant threat to his credibility and a pain to endure, but I was pleasantly surprised. This story of an ex-con who kidnaps a dancer and has her pose as his spouse and then attempts to extract revenge upon a ex -football kicker is for the most part entertaining and a convincing character study. In terms of technique it is clear that Mr. Gallo has been around the loop more than once and makes the story-telling smooth, entertaining, and yet still quirky. Where this movie faltered was the pacing, which was often a little too slow for my taste but had a naturalistic edge that, while not always entertaining, is interesting to watch. Overall, this is a nice directorial debut for Gallo and I look forward to more mature and developed films that will better represent what appears to be more than a smidgen of raw talent. If I had to give it a rating it'd probably be 3.5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved this movie, I really didn't know what to expect from this movie but I really enjoyed it. This is basically a very low budget film that is done very well, it's very engaging and I really liked the direction of it all. Vincent Gallo who directed and played the protagonist in this did a amazing job and although I am not fond of the actress Christina Ricci but she was okay in this and likable. This film didn't even take 2 million dollars to make, but it surpasses a lot of movies out there with way bigger budgets. The film is basically about a lonely guy that has a lot of built up anger and loneliness who kidnaps a girl in order to present her to his semi crazy parents as his loving wife. And the story goes on from there with some humorous manner and amusing at times. Although some of the characters may seem one dimensional, almost every actor and actresses in this done a really good job and actually memorable for the most part. Christina Ricci's character isn't fully explained in this or explored enough for the audience why she didn't just run away during few scenes. Vincent Gallo's character Billy Brown portrays a person that some people can actually relate with, especially some lonely or neglected people out there. Although Gallo and Ricci really hated each other in real life while making this movie, which isn't all that shocking. Because he is very self-centered from what I heard, but he still did a great job of directing it. It's a shame this film is overlooked and not viewed by enough people, cause this really is a engaging and fantastic movie that deserves to be viewed.8.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry Doc. Sean, your line is stolen once again... But this is exactly what I think makes watching Buffalo '66 so nice.Most of the time in the movie things and people are dark and dim, but like all of the other great movies where things and people are dark and dim, there is a purpose to make it dark and dim.Some say there won't be any good if there's no bad, won't be any beauty if there's no ugliness, and the same reasoning applies to won't be any light if there are no darkness and dimness. Buffalo '66 is all about light, more exactly all about Billy's new sweet life with a new sweet girl Layla, rather than the darkness and dimness almost all over the movie. Just because the last odd sweet part is so short(probably from his call to Goon to reclaim everything he gave him to the very end), doesn't mean the movie's most important part isn't it. What a weird guy Vincent Gallo is! He uses 100 minutes of the movie as preparation for the last 10 minutes. And how smart he is! Because this is probably the best way to let you feel how sweet the sweet part is!You are worried about him, you don't want him to do the stupid thing and kill himself, you'd tell him were you him you would instantly know you are going to spend the rest of your life with Layla! You as audience know how good his life could be if only he decides not to do something that he just doesn't have to do! And this is what makes the movie so weirdly romantic: all our hero needs to do to have a sweet life is decide not to do one thing that he doesn't have to do at all! And that one thing is: end your wonderful wonderful life...I was thinking when the movie ends and Vincent sings, that Billy is gonna be like: hey what was I thinking then, I've got such a nice girl I don't even deserve that wants to be my girl, and I was thinking about killing myself for absolutely no reason? F*ck myself...A lot of people tried killing themselves when their lives are actually good, many decided not to finally, and most of them, when they got their lives in front of them again, they are truly happy. We feel the same happiness for Billy at the end of movie, and that testifies that the movie is successful.</fullReview>

The film stock it was shot on gives it a washed out graininess that really suits the story and the environment it is set in. The characters are brilliant. Yes, Billy Brown is an obnoxious bastard, but as the film unfolds it becomes clear this is just a front hiding his true child-like self. Christina Ricci is great, especially as this is in the pre boob-reduction period. And its good to see old classics getting cameos, such as Jan-Michael Vincent and Mickey Rourke (who couldn't get much work at the time). Its also brilliantly written - Billy's angry rants stealing the show, especially where he calls his best frind Goon an 'ugly retard'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superb cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the camera work in this movie. Lance Acord (the cinematographer ...he was also the cinematographer of "Lost In Translation" etc.) did an excellent job. If you watch, Billy Brown is often perfectly framed in a balanced background of color and shape. The dinner table sequence shows him framed between wall lamps. The payphone scene at the dance studio frames him between a black bathroom door, and a black payphone etc. Lance Acord also emphasizes vertical lines (most obviously in the parents home and the hotel sequences). Lance used two extremes of camera angle frequently in this film. He used very objective shots from high angle and side view, which help emphasize the themes of winter, cold and impersonal contact. Examples of these objective shots include the high angles of the opening sequence when Billy is being released from prison, when Billy is trying to pee behind the black car, and Billy taking the kidnapped Layla to her car. Another high angle (although not a long shot like the previously mentioned) is when we get the "ceiling fan" point-of-view as Layla and Billy rest on the hotel bed. One particular tracking objective shot from side view is when Billy is crossing the highway to get to Scott Wood's club. But Lance Acord also used some extremely subjective angles during conversations. The conversation between Billy and Layla in her car before visiting Billy's parents demonstrates the powerful dynamic achieved when the characters look directly into the camera lens. The subjective angles during the dinner table scenes let the viewer switch back-and-forth between each of the characters' points-of-view, and see through their eyes. Lance Acord also utilized long motionless takes to help build the constant tension in this film. Excellent examples of these long frozen takes include the conversation on the edge of the hotel bed, and the photo booth sequence. There is also intentional precision focusing of the camera, which creates haunting images, especially during extreme close-ups on Billy's face. The general lack of zooming and booming is a nice change of pace for the viewer of this film. This movie is a most see for lovers of the camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buffalo '66 is indisputably a genuine display of fraught uncertainty and possibility. The film presents the raw energy of frustrated antagonist Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) as he feebly attempts to mend his troubled past. With the new freedom of his release from a wrongful imprisonment, Billy's plan is simple: Visit his parents (who are ignorant of his prison life, instead blindly believing Billy joined the CIA) and kill the Buffalo Bills kicker whose missed field goal is responsible for his ruined life. In order to pursue his agenda as a free man, he decides a trophy wife to represent his wonderful CIA accomplishments is needed. In order to impress his parents, he kidnaps Layla (Christina Ricci) and teaches her to portray his soul mate in front of his family. An unexpected romance develops between the inexperienced and tormented dreamer Billy and the nonchalant captive Layla. The strange desperate chemistry between Billy and Layla coupled with the exaggerated actions of his nostalgic father (retired lounge singer) and his obsessive mother (extreme Buffalo Bills fan) creates the trip that has become Billy's life.Buffalo '66 is among the most original movies I have ever experienced. The film sets a new standard for expression and diversity in film-making today. I enjoyed the film for the innovative nature of this thoughtful and comedic feature, and found it very refreshing. A dysfunctional romance, prison, and the Buffalo Bills; Buffalo '66 is a triumph.</fullReview>

Great stories i think come from great characters and the character depicted in this film are full and alive in a way that you rarely see in film.I think the most important and greatest achievement of this film is in its writing. There is no line in this film that doesn't feel like the character just came out with it. The amount of play in vincent gallo's dialogue is a joy to see.

		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo is consistent in the lead role as a quirky, newly-released but innocent ex-con. Christina Ricci, as the voluptuous ballet student, is a good foil to Gallo's intensity. Travelling to Vince's parents in the girl's compact car cleverly symbolizes his humble desperate state. The negative qualities of Vince's dysfunctional parents are unfortunately very often present in many middle-class, suburban American homes, which I think is the main point of this movie. The plot is easy to understand. Vince's semi-developmentally disabled buddy is charming--both his and Ricci's characters serve to let Vince know that if something bad happens to Vince, it will greatly affect them, too. Micky Rourke is awesomely fascinating as the mobster. The production is low-budget and a bit long in spots, and the ending too simplistic after a very satisfying climax, but for a "concept film" breaking new ground, these objections seem trivial.</fullReview>

Buffalo 66 is an original film that is defined by the hyperbolic portraiture of its characters. The film operates on the level of character portrayal, both physical and psychological, through a series of close-ups and monologues of each of the individual characters. This is most clearly seen in the character of Billy, a young man whose extreme bitterness emanates from the child-like resentfulness of not being loved, and whose presence is therefore always associated with some kind of pain (such as when he is seen urgently needing to urinate, wearing tight and undersized clothes, suffering from ulcers or allergies, feeling cold, etc.). Good acting, make-up and costumes add to the hyperbole and give the characters a touching, comical twist.</fullReview>

After seeing it I was totally out of my mind and emotionally exploding, even though the quality is pretty bad the movie contains just the most breathtaking scenes. This movie isn't like Hollywood, this movie conveys life. This movie conveys the real and pure human behaviour without any cover up's and I love it! The paleness and the dreary feeling that is in this production makes it just more exciting in a funny kind of way. Without any flashy lights and exaggerated effects everything gets more close, you can really feel the tension all through the story and it's a tripp I have never experienced before. I can't really say anything else, it's just magical!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Gallo!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film numerous times and it gets better after each viewing. I just love the work of Gallo and hope that he keeps on making films. I have not been fortunate enough to see Brown Bunny yet as it has not opened in the UK although I hope it does soon. I think Gallo is unique in his style of film making. I have always wanted to work in the film industry but after having seen this film I was dead set on being a director, which can be put down to Gallos' influence. This film definitely deserves the title of the best independent film of the decade. This is my favourite film of all time and I feel as though it deserves more credit, along side other epics like Ben Hur and Titanic etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS AHEAD***The Good:1) Vincent Gallo's performance as Billy was quite good, even though I couldn't buy the entire storyline.2) Gallo's bowling prowess was also quite commendable. I reran the bowling sequence, as it initially appeared he tried to trick us with strategic scene cutting, allowing for the use of a double during the shots where he's rolling the ball. But then he finally gives us an uncut full shot from the back, showing it was clearly Gallo rolling with a decent curve starting left of the first arrow. Nice form Vince! As The Dude from THE BIG LEBOWSKI would say, "That Creep Can Roll"!3) The climactic scene at the strip club was quite good, with the intense instrumental build of the song "Heart of the Sunrise" leading up nicely to the aborted hit. It moved me so much, I even pulled out my battered cassette copy of "Yessongs" and listened to it again on the way into work this morning. Will "prog-rock" ever make a comeback?The Bad:1) The whole Layla (Christina Ricci) as my wife premise. A young girl is abducted from a dance class, is asked to pose as an ex-con's wife (even though she's approx. 15 years younger than he is), and not only goes along with it, actually relishes the role while embellishing stories to his parents, and ultimately falls in love with her captor?!?! What!?!? How do you possibly make this stuff up and ask a viewer to accept it? It just wouldn't ever happen. Why didn't Gallo just have his character hire a call-girl to play his bride? I certainly might have bought that. But the way it was done in the movie ruined it for me enough to never buy the rest of the story.2) The parents--&amp; what a train wreck they are! I realize Gallo is trying to make a point about the whacked out residents of Buffalo (and quite possibly his own parents), and their obsession with their Bills, but they were also unbelievable to me. I live dangerously close to Wisconsin, and get up close and personal with equally deranged Packer-Backers on a daily basis. Green Bay is probably the closest thing to Buffalo in their hometown devotion to their team, but they're not even this high on the "whack scale". Gallo even threw in a quick scene at the end, imagining just what these nut-jobs might be doing at his funeral, which also wasn't pretty.3) Rosanna Arquette--a wasted opportunity. If you're going to get this beautiful woman to make a cameo in your movie, at least get a close up head shot of her and give her a few more lines.The Ugly-Kevin Corrigan's character "Goon". Jeez Vince, could you make him look any more pathetic? I see why he wasn't listed in the credits.To sum up, if you read this Mr. Gallo and take offense to my criticisms, please don't wish cancer upon me (as you recently did successfully on Roger Ebert after he trashed THE BROWN BUNNY). I do like what you were trying to do in this movie, but the overall execution was wide right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny to see people criticize this movie for being "unrealistic." That this is a common theme among detractors leads me to believe that Gallo is operating on a level that certain people can only find absurd.I'm not sure whether I think people who don't enjoy "Buffalo '66" are stupid, or just emotionally cold, or perhaps, most likely, lacking taste. This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I really feel a little bit sad that not everyone can enjoy it. It just seems painfully obvious to me that, literally, not one second of the film is wasted. The events of the "plot" are totally irrelevant. Gallo has introduced an old dramatic technique to the--let's not kid ourselves-- relatively new medium of cinema: catharsis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I disagree with the other reviews. Like films such as Lost in Translation or The Virgin Suicides (Sofia Coppola) this is a subtle film dealing with difficult subject matter in a perceptive way. I loved it, I hope people will watch it to see how simple, everyday things can be quite difficult for people - meeting the expectations of your parents, being a parent, the relationships you have based on the experience of your childhood. Christina Ricci is perfectly cast and Vincent Gallo has the same watchability as eminem in 8 Mile.If you like dark films, check out Happiness by Todd Shultz or anything pretty much by Lars Von Trier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A day in the life of a schmuck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Buffalo '66," written and directed by Vincent Gallo (whose name means "victorious chicken"), is basically just another life-is-bleak-and-I'm-such-a-loser exercise of the type I generally find so tiresome. Well-made, though at times heavy-handed: one of the very first scenes, with Billy Brown (Gallo again), fresh out of the joint, huddling on a park bench out front and flooded with (very '60s) multi-screen images of prison flashbacks, could've been effectively supplanted with a simple shot of him on the bench with the prison looming in the background. And Billy's parents' crass neglect of him (they're so out of touch with him they don't know he's been in prison!) is driven home with a nine-pound hammer. But Billy himself is such an unpleasant schmuck that one wonders why we should give a rat's a$$ about him. A good cast is generally underused here: Anjelica Huston is Billy's mom, whose rabid Bills fandom was done better (i.e., chillingly) by Frances McDormand as a deranged Dallas Cowboys fan in "Lone Star." Ben Gazzara is Billy's near-catatonic father; Rosanna Arquette has a small role as Billy's unattainable life-long crush. But Christina Ricci, as the sexy baby-doll Billy abducts to take to dinner at his parent's place (he's told them he's married, and he forces the girl to pretend to be his wife), is most criminally wasted.In dire contrast to the razor-sharp Dede Truitt of "The Opposite of Sex," here Ms. Ricci plays Layla, a passive and evidently very stupid little girl who's just along for the ride. That she doesn't take advantage of her many opportunities to escape her abductor tells us that she is, at best, easily dominated, and at worst, very dumb. That she ultimately (and predictably) falls for Billy tells us that she's either attracted to the bad-boy mystique, or that she's got a "nurturing" nature that thrives on taking in wounded (and dangerous) strays like Billy: in either case, again, very dumb. As always--if anything, even more so than usual--Ms. Ricci looks good enough to eat with a spoon; and in a surreal moment almost worth the price of a rental, we learn that she can tapdance. But the part is underwritten, and is as unworthy of Ms. Ricci as Billy is of Layla's affections. The movie's "happy ending" (no spoiler; keep reading) is a grotesque cop-out, obviously not so much an ending as a pause. Billy will still, no doubt, end up losing the girl, some time after the credits roll. He'll lose her not so much because he doesn't deserve her (since she's such a dimbulb, maybe he DOES), but because of his appalling lack of people skills, and because of his poor judgment in general, such as the brilliant idea that got him sent to prison in the first place. Gallo has made a semi-autobiographical self-therapy piece: he's from Buffalo, and his parents' house in the movie is, or used to be, his actual parents' house. Apparently he made "Buffalo '66" for the therapeutic, success-is-the-best-revenge purpose of having somebody with Christina Ricci's face and body (but, significantly, not her brains!) fall for him before the eyes of the entire art-house movie-audience world. Dream on, Vinnie.</fullReview>

Maybe it needed more development. Maybe i can easily believe it because i can relate to the character of billy and have experience with overly compassionate female individuals.

It started off when billy brown (vincent gallo) got out of prison for a crime he did not commit. then billy kidnaps layla (christina ricci) so he can pass her offas his wife. Billy's parents did not know he went to jail so he told his parents he was leaving town to go work for the goverment and that he would not be back for some time.Billy is planing to kill the kicker of the buffalo bills for missing a feild goal kick, because thats why he is in jail for taking the rap for a guys gambling loss. Billy takes layla to meet his parents and after that he lets her .........you will have to watch the rest to find out what happens believe me its worth watching. I give it a +10</fullReview>

Her make-up also flows with her costuming and sheds great light on her character's personality. In addition, Vincent Gallo's performance is deserving of as much praise as possible.

		<shortDescription>Full of talent, lacking in depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first thought when "Buffalo '66's" oversized main titles began popping on and off my screen was, "Okay, so Vincent Gallo digs Jean-Luc Godard. That's good." My heightened interest began to wane though, as Gallo proceeded to "do" Godard throughout the film, biting the master's mid-60s visual style right down to every jump cut; picture-in-picture optical montage; high-angle street shot; and extended improvisation in front of a locked-off camera.It wouldn't all be so disappointing if the story itself weren't yet another modification of Godard's "Breathless," admittedly as durable a cinematic model for emulation as there ever was (basically, it's the old, good-girl-falls-for-bad-boy routine). Still, one can't help but scratch his head about all the fuss made over this film: it could only look like a genuinely original indie picture to someone who's seen maybe half a dozen of those.The story involves all-time loser Billy Brown's first day out of prison after doing five years' time for a crime he didn't commit. Wanting desperately to convince his parents, whom he never told about his incarceration, of his good place in the world, he kidnaps young Layla (played beautifully by Christina Ricci) and convinces her to pose as his wife while they go over to his folks' house for dinner. "Just make me look good," he tells her, a plea that points back to the core of his overwhelming insecurities. Layla performs the task better than even he could have hoped; so well, in fact, that he's incapable of recognizing it. She really acts like she loves him, and quickly begins to actually love him, and he doesn't even know what that looks like.What Gallo does well he does very well. As both a writer and an actor, his puts a great deal of realistic detail into his rendering of Billy, the film's main character and almost exclusive focus. He gets just right all the behavioral tics of a kid whose parents couldn't have cared less if he'd just disappeared: the persistent rage displayed against anything that scares him (affection, for instance); the need to repeat every thing he says three and four times, since he knows that no one gives enough of a damn to listen; the virtually uninterrupted torrent of lies intended (to no avail) to convince others of his important government job, his strangely hidden wealth, and his way with women.On the other hand, Gallo's shortcomings, while they don't ruin the film, do bring it up frustratingly short of its potential. The most persistently maddening thing in the movie is its complete silence on the topic of Layla's interior life. Billy is such an abrasive sociopath, and his manipulations so transparent, it is impossible to see why she would even loan him a quarter for a phone call (her first of many favors), let alone play along so gamely with his schemes.While it's no secret that young women, in the movies as well as in life, are often attracted to "dangerous types" at their own peril, Gallo gives Billy none of the smoldering charm that would seem to be necessary for such an attraction. Nor does he tell us one little thing about Layla's past or her own psychology to help us understand why she might be weak enough to fall for such damaged goods.Worse than that, though, is his tendency as a director to let the film slip from a relatively serious character study into a routinely "quirky" comedy. He pulls out a stock supply of overripe visual gags: mockingly symmetrical compositions and spontaneously appearing spotlights among the worst of them. He falls victim to one of those gratuitous fantasy sequences in which the audience is led to believe that a character has committed a horrible act of violence, only to snap back to reality with a cut that winks at the audience and says, "Just kidding!"His highest crime, though, is the grotesquely ham-fisted depictions of Billy's parents. When his mother, Janet (Anjelica Huston), loses all interest in a conversation and faces an off-screen television set to shake her fist and twist her mouth while silently rooting for her beloved Buffalo Bills, the movie is standing knee-deep in pure hokum. Gallo is so fixated on exploring the effect of parents who don't bother to learn anything about their son, that he failed as a writer to learn anything about them. Instead, he depicts them as caricatures and still expects us to believe Billy's plight.It is this shortchanging of any character other than Billy which is at the core of the film's undoing. In Gallo's world, the complex psychological tragedy which he depicts so realistically in Billy has shallow, cutesy-pie origins in his parents' obsession with football; and a shallow, cutesy-pie resolution in his eventual recognition of Layla's love. The movie seems to want us to believe that no matter how badly you've been screwed up for thirty years, one pretty girl can make you feel all better in half a day's time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky and compelling; it's worth a look.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared with many of today's movies which have production budgets the size of a small Latin America nation's GDP, Buffalo '66 was made on the cheap. That low rent quality, however, is another of the components of this quirky, unconventional, yet inevitably compelling presentation.This story, and the main character of "Billy Brown" reminded me of "The Big Lebowski" in that the central character is a well-intentioned loser, and the story emanates from the interaction of the bizarre characters with whom he interacts; (ironically, bowling figures prominently in both stories and characterizations).Assuming that any reader of these comments will be familiar with the general story, the hours immediately following the release of Mr. Brown from incarceration, and featuring a visit to his parents' house to introduce them to the wife he has written about while maintaining a cover for his five year absence, I will not go into any detail rather than to make the observation that the Christina Ricci character (forced into portraying his adoring wife) might have been developed a bit further to explain why she would be so sympathetic to Billy and his circumstances. (Given several opportunities to escape early on, just why does she stay?)The portrayal of Billy's wretched existence as shown through his psychotic family's life, at the dinner, and through flashbacks, is almost disturbing enough to cause a viewer to flee to more pleasant diversions. For what is is, though, it is quite masterfully put together, and there are moments of genuine humor.This is not a "date movie" or a conventional comedy, and there are some unpleasant scenes in the way of violent behavior, but as an alternative to mass produced and over-marketed general Hollywood fare, Buffalo '66 is worth a look, and might offer a few things to think about.(For those interested in the development of Miss Ricci as an actress and as a young woman, she gives a very good performance as a wayward teen from a tap-dancing class, and has developed considerably physically from her days as Wednesday Adams. She is a bit on the chubby side and is fully clothed throughout the film).</fullReview>

I walked out about 40 minutes in. When Cristina Ricci's character goes to the bathroom unsupervised at the Brown's house, I rooted for her to escape out the window. She didn't.I couldn't stand to be in a room with these characters one minute longer. I had a choice and I took it.BUFFALO 66 includes some breathtaking performances, especially by Angelica Huston and Ben Gazzara. The powerful &amp; realistic portrayal of these toxic personalities is magical; albeit Black Magic. They did their jobs &amp; animated their characters so well that they were unbearable.I can see the comparisons to Yasujiro Ozu's work; most of which I have never been particularly fond of due to the overwrought &amp; melodramatic subject matter (despite his masterful film style).I have been told by friends who watched the film to the end &amp; did like it that there is finally some redemption of the characters.</fullReview>

Bit by bit, we learn more about him and begin to pity his situation despite his crudeness. I love the look of this film and the controlled characterization. Christina Ricci delivers a strong performance but the real star is Gallo's talent for unintentionally hilarious banter in his writing. Billy Brown's incessant whining never ceases to crack me up.

		<fullReview>What is it with some "indie" filmmakers, anyway? I too get terribly bored with mainstream Hollywood fare from time to time, but that doesn't mean I'll happily sit through nearly two hours of crap for something different. Buffalo '66 sounds like it will be an interesting and off-beat film when you read the general plot outline. Unfortunately, the film is very boring and there just isn't much to warrant its lengthy running time.Writer/director Vincent Gallo plays a guy named Billy Brown. Billy is released from prison in the film's opening scene. He had been sent there for confessing to a crime he did not commit in order to pay off a gambling debt from a lost football game. Now that he's out, Billy plans to return to Buffalo and kill the field goal kicker whose missed kick cost him the bet, as well as all that lost time. Billy spends nearly the first fifteen minutes of the film searching for a bathroom. Yes, his need to urinate is a major plot point in the early part of the film! Finally finding one inside a dance studio, Billy ends up kidnapping a young girl from a tap dancing class and getting her to pose as his wife when he goes to meet his parents. After an awkward half hour or so at his old house, we then see Billy take his new "bride" to a bowling alley, and then they rent a motel room together. The final ten minutes or so deal with Billy confronting the ex-kicker inside a strip club he now operates. The conclusion is actually one of the better points of the film.Honestly we had about enough material here for one hour of running time. So little happens in this film, that's it's incredible considering how long it lasts. The acting is okay. Gallo is whiny and creepy-looking, but the man does have a screen presence. Christina Ricci is nice to look at, but she's really just there for scenery purposes. Ben Gazzara and Angelica Houston seem lost within their annoying characters. Gazzara almost looks like he can't believe he's in a film like this. Gallo uses a lot of inserts of other images into the main frame of his shots. This certainly helps capture the time period of the film's title, but since the film does not take place in 1966, one wonders why he did it this way at all.Don't let the high rating this film is getting fool you. This is a boring film. Even die hard film school types will find themselves daydreaming after the first twenty minutes. But they still will give it high ratings to act like they "got it". As for myself, I got it just fine. And it's still only worth about 2 stars to the Hound.2 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if post-adolescent solipsism is your thing, you may love this. I detested it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's films like this one - and the astonishingly mixed reviews it's garnered - that remind me how completely subjective this business is. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a film as little as Buffalo 66; I found it a perpetual struggle to watch, and only stayed to the end out of stubbornness, and a hope that there might be some sort of moment of revelation somewhere along the line. Yet I can't really say that this is a BAD film, much as I loathed it: it's well directed, has a terrific cast, Billy's dialogue has a certain compelling, desperate rhythm to it at times, and its grimy, downtrodden locations are extremely well chosen. My dislike of it was, I think, dislike of Vincent Gallo himself in an oddly personal way: here is a protagonist who is not just without a redeeming feature (that I can cope with) but without a single interesting feature, and Gallo seems convinced that he's a full-blown hero of romantic alienation. Perhaps the film is more ironic than I think - but I don't think so, it seems completely self-absorbed and solipsistic, yet the self into which it's absorbed simply isn't one with whom I want to spent five minutes. It doesn't surprise me that Gallo originally completed a screenplay for this film a full decade before he made it, because this strikes me as fundamentally adolescent posturing, which is going to be appreciated primarily by young men who are in the adolescent-posturing stage themselves - aged eighteen it's possible I'd have found this a thrilling exercise in self-justification. Now I'm a few years past that (reader, condolences are welcome) I simply found myself infuriated by his self-importance. In particular, the way the film exploits its meaningless, nugatory fantasy woman, Layla, is pretty revolting. I can sort of see why Christina Ricci was tempted to play it, because the sheer absence of a character in the character she was playing is both a challenge and a sort of liberation for an actor, but it's still an absolute dog's breakfast of a role. Ricci herself is always worth watching, and there are flashes of brilliance from her and the rest of the cast. But the mind-numbingly unsubtle, egotistical, banal, clichéd, uninvolving and fundamentally stupid nature of Billy's progress puts this film absolutely beyond redemption for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buffalo '66 is a critically acclaimed film, and it gets its point across very clearly, but it is just too slow and obscure at certain points.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything in this film is ugly (except Christina Ricci), but it is meant to be like that, so in that sense, there is something to be said about the skillful writing and directing of the film. The acting is also very impressive, at least the majority of it. Vincent Gallo is sickeningly convincing as the ugly, disgusting man portrayed in the film, who is bent on seeking revenge on the man who he blames for his unjust stint in prison. Oddly enough, even though his performance provides a deep feeling of discomfort at times, it was an incredible performance. It is difficult to imagine Gallo as anything other than the kind of person that he played in this movie.Christina Ricci was just as beautiful as she alway is in her movies, but even though she was a very relieving character to watch while being bombarded with the misanthropic Billy Brown (Gallo), she also played the most unrealistic and unconvincing part in the film. Let's think about the logic here. A dirty and scruffy man is released from prison, he kidnaps this girl who would be attractive even if she wasn't a movie star, his communication with her is limited to impatient demands and insults intended to harm, and she freakin' falls in love with him. He never said a single nice word to her, with the exception of his forced and slight apology after he is finally able to relieve himself at the beginning of the film. Their entire relationship is so ridiculously unrealistic that it almost overshadows every other thing that the film accomplishes.Besides that, some of the scenes were downright boring. A good majority of the scenes that took place when they went to Billy's parents' house comes to mind. The editing was botched with the point of view shots at the dinner table, as well. Buffalo '66 is not a pretty film, but it is meant to be ugly. It would have been a great film had it not been for the unlikely relationship between Layla (Ricci) and Billy Brown, as well as the slightly messed editing and an overly abrupt transformation of Brown's mentality at the end of the film. The message of the film, despite the film's appearance, is actually pretty healthy. It has a lot to say about the pointlessness of revenge, but even that as well as some fascinating camera work in the strip club at the end of the movie are not enough to save this film from cinematic obscurity. This is the type of film that you watch to study different writing and directing styles, you don't watch something like this to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful. Not a shred of sympathy for any character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolute waste of time. No character exhibits anything that caused me to have a shred of sympathy nor interest in them. Characters' motivation nonexistent. Terrible sense of pace. Long boring sequences that are supposed to be offbeat. A complete waste of time. Wish Blockbuster issued refunds. This film is in my top ten most hated movies. I never actively hate a movie, but I actively hate this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathless Football</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Vincent Gallo's acting doesn't impress: he has a herky-jerky intensity and little else. But as a writer-director, he's so full of intelligent ideas we end up with a project that overflows.And that's a good thing in this case. Gallo obviously thinks of himself as beginning a career as one of the greats of film, so has modeled this effort on `Breathless.'The basic idea isn't fresh: exploring the notion of fantasy by folding how an on-screen character bends reality with how we do as viewers, viewing the very same thing.Here, the dialog is monologue. Here, instead of the direct reference to films, it is to football. Because the notion of self-referential films-about-films has been so well trod, this snaps it back to the original crispness. Huston absorbs that kind of football that goes past obsession to form a complete framework for life. As with the film notion dealt within `Breathless,' it penetrates fate, and colors everything we see.Here, the girl is a dancer. Ricci has never exploited her Cupiedoll allure more directly than in this project. I'm thinking of watching `Rollercoaster to Hell' just to get a glimpse of the costume designer. Ricci's makeup and dress is so close to edge it shows real skill.In `Breathless' we were treated to a few cinematic devices that underscored the fact that it was a film we were watching. Those seem tepid now, and have to be pointed out as fresh for the time. Gallo has to work with a newer, bolder vocabulary, one in which it is now nearly impossible to exaggerate. But he does succeed with the table at `dinner.' This must have been numerous physical tables. And the bowling alley tap dance is the center of the fantasy. Couldn't help equating it to a very similar bowling alley dance routine by the Coens in `Lebowski' that was identically intended: Truffault-annotation on the sexuality of the target. In that case it was the ever more nuanced Julianne Moore.But that was outrageous and silly, and this is gentle, poignant. Similar intentions but the sweetness of this pudgy icon obviously moving to a recorded tap is one that stays -- one that sticks in the mind.Another attempt at cinematic self-reference is less successful. At the end Billy `sees' his intended action. Some of this is `bullet-time,' some slow-motion, some freezeframe, some `flashforward' after the manner of previously established flashbacks. Together with Gallo's own music this would have worked better if we hadn't been so coddled in letting us know it was imagined. If `Taxi Driver' could get away with an imagined ending, why not `Buffalo?'If Gallo can escape the Woody syndrome and not insist on putting himself and his life on screen, he might turn out to be one of our talented writer/directors. This takes too many shortcuts for us to be sure there is talent here or whether we are watching a singular, well-formed scream therapy. But its a gem. I compare it to `American History X` and `Slingblade' which were wholly actorvisions. This starts with the eye, and has the actor subservient. As it should be.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Norwood's Kick, It Misses The Mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say Vincent Gallo played one of the sleaziest low-life guys I have ever seen in a film, at least in the first 30-some minutes. He was in every scene and was so scuzzy and so unappealing, it ruined the story for me. I was interested, too, because this is based in Buffalo, New York, and I live not far from the city. The are numerous references about the Buffalo Bills, too, so I wanted to enjoy that....even if it meant suffering again recalling all those Super Bowl losses, mainly Scott Norwood's missed field goal in their first Super Bowl.Listen, I know this is supposed to be a "black comedy," and many times I love that sort of humor, but this was just so sordid it provided more winces and frowns than laughs. I just wanted to take a shower after watching and listening for 45 minutes to Gallo and this sordid story.To have a kidnap victim (Christina Ricci, also seems to play a lot of scummy roles in films) fall in love with this scumbag made the story all the more ludicrous. Only in the wonderful world of films do we constantly see good equals bad and vice/versa. This is a nonsensical, pretentious and gratuitously-profane piece of garbage with, as one fellow reviewer puts it in his headline, "no redeeming values":...and another black eye to the poor folks in Buffalo.Recommended only for severely disturbed people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Aesthetically Accomplished, Deeply Moving, Highly Original Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really isn't another film like Vincent Gallo's darkly comic and moving masterwork 'Buffalo '66'. Simply put, it is one of the most stylistically unconventional, aesthetically accomplished and distinctively singular entries in all of American cinema. Set in the bleak, harsh winter of post-industrial Buffalo, Gallo's debut is a deceptively radical and modern love story. The film tells the story of Billy Brown, a lonely and depressed ex-convict, who had a fragmented childhood that he has clearly never recovered from. His upbringing was plagued by inattention and absence, and the consequences of this are very real; he is devoid of love, happiness and purpose. The film opens with Billy being released from prison and there is only one thing he is set out to do: gain the approval and acceptance of his parents, something he has always so ardently yearned for. To do this, he kidnaps Layla, a wandering, frivolous tap-dancer, and forces her to act as his wife for one evening as Billy visits his parents.This is a fairly repugnant premise for a proclaimed romantic film. By all means, Billy is a hateful, spiteful character. He is resentful, vindictive and unpleasant. Yet, despite all of this, Layla sees something in him. Beyond all the ostensible hostility and anger is a sad, lonely man who has never experienced anything remotely close to real companionship before. So, as Layla begins to slowly uncover the true sorrows of Billy Brown, we do, too, and what ultimately unfolds is a unique, poignant love story that is more honest and endearing than most films could ever dream of reaching.The film is about letting go of one's disconsolate and dejecting past and embracing the happiness they have found. I have pretty much described the thematic foundation of the film in that one sentence. To elucidate, Billy Brown is a man living in the past and not in the present. He is determined to murder Scott Wood, an American football player who missed an important field goal which inadvertently landed him in jail after a bet went sour. Throughout the film, he is holding on only to the feelings he is familiar with; hate, revenge, depression and loneliness. This is all he knows. These are the only feelings he is intimate with. He is highly avoidant of Layla and constantly refuses to be touched or kisses. He is a damaged soul, incapable of forming any kind of intimate human connection. But something changes. Billy breaks down, opens up, and falls in love. To explain why this happens would simply be an injustice to the film. Allow me to instead describe one scene in the film that symbolically epitomises everything Gallo's masterwork is trying to say. Just before Billy leaves the hotel to confront and murder Scott Wood, Layla asks for a hug. Billy, initially, is hesitant but Layla insists. So, they hug. And it is the hug that says it all. Billy hugs Layla but does so in a way that denotes his inner detachment and depression. He is holding onto Layla's hair quite firmly in this almost dominant disposition, signifying a perpetual sadness and isolation of sorts. But then he let's go of her hair, vulnerably falls into her arms and embraces her intimately. It is simply one of the most beautiful, touching and moving scenes I have ever seen.A simple intimate gesture like a hug says something most films would feel the need to explain. Embracing the hug is embracing the love, as corny as that may sound. Billy deciding not to to kill Scott Wood and return back to Layla at the hotel shows that Billy will no longer feel like a victim. He will no longer let his depression and sorrow plague his very existence. He has finally found what he has always so heavily desired; love, companionship, purpose and happiness. And, really, that's absolutely beautiful. The film has, unsurprisingly, been criticised for being misogynistic on a few occasions. These arguments state that Layla is an object who is all too conveniently subservient to Billy considering she was... well, kidnapped. The fact that Layla falls in love with Billy infuriated many viewers, too, so they expectably dismiss it as a hateful film that portrays women as subordinate and clueless. These reviews see the film as a twisted, dark fantasy for Gallo, but they don't really seem to understand that Layla is anything but these things. Quite the contrary, actually. She is someone who sees through Gallo's resentful disposition and discovers what many in the film can not: a damaged man. Enough with that, though. Obviously, the film has a remarkable visual style. The static camera-work, reminiscent of filmmaker Yasjuro Ozu, in addition to its seamlessly transitional editing and fluid long takes are nothing short of impressive. The film captures the dreary and bleak post-industrial atmosphere of Buffalo astonishingly well, too, almost making the city, itself, a character of sorts. Indeed, Buffalo plays out like this omnipresent entity of constant gloom and darkness that overshadows Billy's life. And one can simply not forget the film's extensive use of progressive rock, either. Whether it is Layla tap-dancing to King Crimson's seminal Moonchild or Billy confronting Scott Wood to Yes' Heart of the Sunrise, the film uses prog rock in ways very few other works can. And while we're on the subject of music, is there a more apposite way to end the film with Yes' Sweetness playing into the end credits? I don't think so.Overall, Buffalo '66 is a masterpiece of filmmaking. It is my favourite film of all time, and a work that is very special and important to me. Vincent Gallo's craftsmanship is simply impeccable, and it's a feature that will be looked back at in the decades to come as a truly unique, highly original film from a misunderstood genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite Film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie I could see in a museum. The shots were great, it made me feel like I was there the entire time. The intro I've watched a thousand times, it's the only part of the film that fascinates me the most. Vincent Gallos acting is really great. He's explosive and you never know what he's gonna do. It feel really natural. My favorite thing about the film is how far from a Hollywood movie it is. I was on the edge of my seat all the time to see if he would finally kiss the girl or have any sort of physical connection with her. It was near the end of the film and it still seemed like he wanted to kill himself. The ending was so great, in your typical Hollywood film there would have been a scene were the guy ran back to the apartment and kissed her and they cried together bullshit. but in this one you don't see any of that. When the last scene comes to a black out all you see is a photograph of them holding each other. It was beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Originality makes this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a Vincent Gallo movie, so of course it's going to be something different and original. Not that it's anything too pretentious or overly artistic but it just is different from what you are probably accustomed to seeing. Different can be good at times, when it works, as is luckily the case with this particular movie.Thing is that the movie its different and also unusual approach, makes this movie a very original one. It's not really a movie with a particular good script but the movie still manages to grab you and hold your interest, throughout. A real accomplishment by Vincent Gallo, who directed, wrote and played the main character in this movie.It's a pretty intriguing little movie, that deliberately keeps things small and simple. No overcomplicated plot, no over-the-top characters (well, only for comedy reasons maybe), no sentimental fake drama. It feels like a very honest and straightforward movie, which was really the main reason why I got taken by it and also really liked watching the movie.Vincent Gallo must have some pretty good connection, since he always manages to get some pretty big name actors in his movie, even while his movies are always quite small and low-budget ones. In this movie, people like Christina Ricci, Ben Gazzara, Anjelica Huston and Mickey Rourke make their appearances. A pretty good cast list, which a lot of filmmakers would love to work with.It's not a must-see in any way but it simply is a good movie!7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ever heard of cadillac,,,,,CADILLAC EL DORADO? possible spoilers maybe maybe?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>right off the bat i know that the movies strongest view on billy brown has to be the fact that everyone that he comes in contact with humors him,,layla,,goon,,the guy at the bowling alley,,,that guy does good humoring him with one look and a hand guester on billys shoulder,,very subtle,,i love it,,,with goon its the fact that he wont give into billys (threatening)? pleas for help on doing something so destructive yet so unbelievable to even goon. it seems like even goon plays along like hes trying to stop a tough guy (billy) ready to show his fierce claws ,,,i love it,,,and of course layla,,at the beginning she looks at him like hes a pathetic lozer on acid tryin to be in control of situations,giving away left and right at the fact that he could never go through with any threat that he conjures up. again,,i love it. the fact that some people say its not believable that a girl like that falls for a guy who looks, acts and probably smells the way he does should remember the fact that,,they live in buffalo,,,if it were southern california it would never happen,,we look out for the strangest occurrences,,for 2,,she already heard his speech to his mom on the phone,,with his little boys crackily voice,,,,and for 3,,hes just too damned entertaining to miss all the fun..i mean look how enthused she looked at her dance practice,,she wants excitement in her life and it shows,ultimately that excitement turns into love,and yes he is a constant harassment to her throughout the movie but,once a girl sees a guys pain like she did,,,and was apart of something so helpful to him,,(in a way), plus meeting his parents and basically seeing billys life on there (first date?) it probably shocked her how billy came out so nice and still so understanding of the world and wanting real emotions and dealing tolerably with all the insanity of his family and friends instead of taking on the traits of uneffectualizm like his parents,,,billy has his own soul and it shows,and she sees it,,,,by the way,this movie is deeper than a hole to china. the way billy talks like hes explaining everything 10 times over is because of his parents and goon and probably every other nutcase hes had to deal with his whole life,,hes tolerable,,hes a tolerable soul,,and layla has seen him at his worst and thought it was cute,,,most girls are paranoid at how a guy might change and become violent,,billy has already shown his true colors and its harmless,,,she has unconditional love for him, he is what you would here from most girls mouths as the perfect guy. she pokes at billy towards the end of the movie for affection,,she turns up the heat until billy is backed in a corner and cannot escape it anymore,,by the way the scene where she said i wasnt kidding about wanting to lay down with you and it shows his face about to cry,,that is an exact face that i know of and to me is the best scene in movie history. alot of people think that layla is weak for tolerating all the crap given to her throughout the movie and people say it makes girls look bad,,,i think it makes her look strong,,,strong minded cuz she sees early on whats in billy,,,strong because shes a woman who knows what she wants,,,strong because she gets love from billy on almost his own terms always making sure not to say anything wrong in fear that this shell that she is determinded to crack wont run off with the true love nut inside.this is also sort of a story on how girls are smarter than guys in manipulation and how guys are buffoons at trying to manipulate while girls are calculated and get what they want in the end,,,this movie has it all and it shows it in the most subtlest of ways. the father is a has been lounge singer who probably wanted to live a long frank sinatra rock star life and got a kid instead,,the mom is like a delusioned probably wannabe yuppy gone crazy and went totally the other way and just got drowned in false reality trying to cope with buffalo hell,,,she reminds me of the people in gummo where they live in a tornado torn trash city and the kids have nothing better to do than to whip dead cats tied to trees.. the parents simply made big mistakes in there lives and didnt want the lives or kid they got,,thats my big 2 cents on that history,,,the mom was a little exaggerated but the dad came off pretty much on the money with realism in my book, in fact with the exception of a few of billys annoying antics and the moms ineffectualness i see this movie as total and complete realism,,nothing else is too far fetched,,,,,nothing,,,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Plus and Minus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, medium quality but definitely worth watching once. -On the downside there is a large flight from plausibility (that some might see as a plus). Also the movie moves slowly and can get to be dredging with its dialogue at times. The urge to punch the main character is also relatively strong.+On the Plus Side there is a wonderful late 70's/early 80's "gritty" feel to the movie that is refreshingly different, even if anti-refreshing by nature. There is also a very strange fleet from anything rational in terms of characterization, the positive side of the negative above. All in all the BEST quality is Christina Ricci herself. She portrays the most supportive and wonderful woman a guy could hope for while being beautiful all the while. In fact, tying in with the last plus, her surreal tap dance to King Crimson (kudos to other fans of *good* prog rock) was among the most randomly charming things I have ever seen in my entire life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any odd-couple romance has the potential to be a great movie. And whilst the central romance between Billy (Vincent Gallo, who also directed and wrote the screenplay) and Layla (Christina Ricci) does have its chemistry, the supporting story and characters do not hold up very well.The plot couldn't be simpler. Billy is an agitated ex-con just out of prison, who randomly kidnaps a teenaged dancer, Layla, and takes her home in his car in a bid to impress his parents. Billy is further seeking revenge on the people who sent him to prison, tearing him away from his new-found friend. This sets up an unusual love story....The chemistry between the two principal characters is second to none. Gallo and Ricci make a pleasing and plausible couple and this supports the film throughout. Gallo has the slightly better defined character of the pair. He is a shivering skeleton of nervous energy, ready to snap and lash out at anything or anyone at a moment's notice. Ricci is also good, although she doesn't have to do too much asides from pout and look really sexy in her gymslip.The script offers bizarre but largely forgettable characters (especially Angelica Houston and Michael Jan-Vincent as Billy's parents) and the humour used in many scenes falls a little flat. The film could have been edited a whole lot better. It was brave of Gallo to opt for a slower, more experimental way of telling the story. The problem is the pace tends to drag and some of his other tricks (the dream sequence in the strip joint is an example) tend to befuddle the viewer.The other problem is the film ends far too soon. It feels as though we have barely gotten to know to know these two characters (as they have barely gotten to know each other) before the film comes to a abrupt halt. A little more time, and a few more challenges for these characters would not have gone wrong.A slight disappointment, but Gallo does show potential as both an actor and a film-maker and here's hoping we see more of him in the future.</fullReview>

It's a shame Gallo doesn't do more films, "Get Well Soon" is decent but not nearly as good as this. Christina Ricci plays her role perfectly, and Kevin Corrigan as "Goon" was hilarious.

Maybe one has a long desired goal in mind, but if you can't find a place to pee everything goes out the window.Then you kidnap a woman who you find yourself promising to be her best friend in the world if she will just do you one simple favor. Be an actress for a few hours. Play my wife. I only drive luxury cars. Don't touch me. Tap dancing at the bowling alley. Span some time.I can revisit these rich scenes over and over because I can see deep into them. Most movies are so shallow as to not allow this.I only wish Gallo would do more work.Rest yourself up for this one and get ready for a ride. Some people think this movie is boring.

This is important cinema.His performance is one of the more curious I've ever seen. With an intensity that rivals DeNiro on his best days, Vincent creates a man who you can't help loving to hate. By the end of the film you've forgiven all his agressive behavior and uncouth/unkempt persona, and, if you're like me, said: "There is hope in the world". Christina Ricci (my art-house sweetie- will you marry me?) is an angel in this. Ms. Huston lends great support as Billy's mother. Time will prove Buffalo 66 too be a landmark.

		<fullReview>If you're the kind of personality that liked Boys Don't Cry, you most likely will enjoy this film. It has the same style--normal people with weirder, more tragic lives than you would possibly imagine. The plot is: Billy (Vincent Gallo) has recently been released from prison and finds himself in the incredibly awkward situation of having to back up the string of lies he had fed his parents while in jail- such as he was not in prison. In desperation he seizes on a young tap dancer named Layla (Christina Ricci) as the solution to his problems.Final Words: Worth watching at least once, but I warn you, like Boys Don't Cry, My Name Is Joe, and Felicia's Journey, this is not a "pretty" film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Gallo's personal and sensitive drama/comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Buffalo '66 (1998)" is an excellent idnie, made for $1.5m. Vincent Gallo not only stars in it, but he also directed it, wrote the script and the music, and sings 8 of the background songs. Gallo is a very talented artist, and this is obviously one of his most personal projects. Very quiet and sensitive drama/comedy, with excellent cast: The highly talented and sexy Christina Ricci stars alongside Gallo; Anjelica Huston and Ben Gazzara are amazing and hilarious as his indifferent parents; Kevin Corrigan as the stupid best-friend; And guest appearances by Rosanna Arquette, Mickey Rourke, Kevin Pollak and the voice of Gallo's father (singing Fools Rush in). Rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>buffalo '66 is a wonderful piece. All characters are well played. All very obnoxious apart from Layla (C Ricci) that for some odd reason falls for the introvert main character.The changeovers for the flashbacks etc are well made.A wonderful mix of editing styles. Cute little tap dance by C.I also loved to see Jan-Michael Vincent (remember Stringfellow Hawke from "Airwolf"?) as Sonny, the Bowling Manager, with a lot less self-confidence than "string".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cassavetes in miniature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo's third effort recalls John Cassavetes ' work.One of the late director's favorite actors is here :Ben Gazzara.Besides,Gallo's character's purpose,out of jail,is to kill a footballer who was paid for failing to score .( recalling Gazzara in "the killing of a chinese bookmaker",1976).This is a very austere work,almost completely unspectacular-except maybe for Ricci's kidnapping-,which boasts a surprising cast:there's also Anjelica Huston,IMHO,the stand-out,Mickey Rourke,Rosanna Arquette and Jan-Mickael Vincent.This is nothing but a long roaming,without any dramatization,featuring long scenes ,sometimes about trivial things:the search for a bathroom lasts at least five minutes.And Gallo is not relieved for all that!The flashbacks are oddly displayed:at the beginning of the movie,the screen is divided into small parts,? la "Thomas Crown affair" (1968) showing jail (or else) memories.Then the flashbacks often comes from the center of the screen,as a small picture widens and takes up the whole picture,before disappearing the same way.The best part happens when Gallo visits his parents Gazzara and Huston-one must notice that the latter is too young to be cast as Gallo's mother;she's from 1952,and he was born 10 years later,and she does not look that much old!-Gallo had asked Ricci to play his wife's role and she carries out the job conscientiously,lauding her "husband"'s brilliant qualities:but it seems it's too late.Both parents are living in the past,the woman stuck in her photo album "when he was the most wonderful child in the whole world",or in front of her TV ,passionately watching matches.When Ricci tells her how handsome her husband is,she does not seem to bother a little bit.A -imaginary,because of the final twist- terrifying sequence shows her in a graveyard,listening to a match on the radio.It's strange how Huston plays the part generally allotted to a man,when Gazzara is almost female,playing a failed crooner who tries to exhume some of his former "glory" in front of his "daughter-in -law".The rest of the movie is less successful,and it's mainly because Ricci's part is not clearly precise.The actress looks like a Barbie doll,and it's really hard to believe she's seduced by Gallo.However,when directors gamble on sex and violence,it's comforting to think that there are people who try something different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really have to see this film more than once to really appreciate it. The first time you see it, you are shocked and can't get it out of your head, some turn that into a negative response, but my advice is to really just rent it and watch it again. It has that same affect as other films such as 'Gummo'. What can I say about Gallo other than he is brilliant. Everything from the writing to the superb acting as well as the great score and original directing, this guy amazes me. But I'm sure I don't need to say any of that since he probably already knows it. The guy has an overwhelming ego and a selfish wit. Although it annoys me, I think he has good reason. He is a very, very accomplished person and grew up with absolutely no encouragement or support so I think he compliments himself to try to boost his own self-esteem. He is talented, but despite what he may say he's not a God and %80 of the films he condemns are actually really good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having seen the Christina Ricci picture on IMDB, the one with tight dress on her breast, I decided to review all the films that I have seen with her, this is the first one. Buffalo' 66 is not a mediocre film, it is simply a average movie with not enough t&amp;a and violence, if Ricci was nude in some scenes, it would have been very good. Here is the story thanks to Alan Jacobs.Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) has been in jail, but his parents think that he's married and successful. When he can't find anywhere in Buffalo where he can pee, he runs desperately into a dance studio to use the washroom. He winds up kidnapping a dance student, Layla (Christina Ricci) to bring home and show off to his parents (Angelica Huston &amp; Ben Gazzara). The parents just barely remember their son or care about him, but Layla falls for him.Just rent it for Christina Ricci, she have great potential, and her breast is great for her age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gallo's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of this film is in two things. The more obvious is the art direction/cinematography. From the slow, mood setting opening of the film to the surreal stop-animation sequence in the strip club the movie emanated artistic originality. The other great feat that Buffalo 66 accomplishes is the character development of the main character. Never have I known so little about the background of a character and cared so much about him(or her). On top of that, Billy Brown is a complete jerk. But the viewer can't help feel either a connection to him or at least sorry for him. And, in the end, you find your self really concerned about the decisions he makes . I hope that Gallo's got another Buffalo '66 in him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Vincent Gallo Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A quick blurb about a project that I thought was successful for the most part. The two reviewers below, captured the main faults with Mr. Gallo's effort. I would only add that I didn't get the impression from either of their comments that they felt they were viewing a comedy. Perhaps reliance on the satirical nature of things is my own form of denial when it comes to salvaging enjoyment from so many modern films. After all, I found "Fight Club" extremely enjoyable purely because it was an obvious satire, whose punch line alluded a surprising amount of critics. Similarly here, it is a valid criticism to find this film painfully solipsist. It is also a cogent criticism to find the other characters particularly Ricci's, to be underdeveloped to the point of being lifeless. However, in my viewing this WAS the point. This is an extremely dark comedy about a dysfunctional man, from a dysfunctional family, living in a dysfunctional world. My main complaint was Gallo didn't have the good sense to end the movie after the shootout montage. This is where the film was headed and was its logical end point. Where the film ultimately ends up was either satire ad absurdom or some sick effort to get this movie out off the art house circuit. Besides, anyone who mocks a retard should die in the end...Jeremy Dimmick: http://us.imdb.com/CommentsAuthor?3497801.85: http://us.imdb.com/CommentsAuthor?127673</fullReview>

In "Ace Ventura", a comedy, the villain feels that Dan Marino is to blame for his failure in life. In "Buffalo", a drama, Gallo's character feels that a football player who lost the Super Bowl he betted on is to blame for his failures in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie opens as Billy is released from prison (he was innocent). He has to go to the bathroom really bad so he kidnaps Christina Ricci. Yea! Billy!Billy is a friggin moron who should have stayed in prison to protect him from the fact that he has no brain. This could however be acting so who am I to judge. Billy was an abused child yada yada yada. Billy will do anything to get even a sliver of love from his parents. His parents when they notice he's alive can't stand him. Their revulsion is justified. He must be adopted although the film never deals with this subject. Actually they do. Billy was born in 1966 causing his mom, Jan to miss the last time the Buffalo Bills football team won a championship. Ergo the title. Woo Hoo!Billys' parents are played by Angelica Houston and Ben Gazarra. Picture Al and Peg Bundy with a mean streak. I love how real actors who have already made more money than they'll ever spend want to be in crappy films.The real reason for this movie to be made and for you to watch it is a wonderful actress Christina Ricci. Ricci is at a point in her career where it is impossible for her to make a bad movie simply due to the fact that if she's in it it can't be bad. De Niro had that going on for a while.The plot: Billy kidnaps Ricci and takes her to his parents house where she is told to pretend to be his wife to impress his parents. they like her, still can't stand him. Christina really digs Billy and by extension wants to spent the rest of her life with him and have his babies. You have to suspend reality a little here.That's about it except for you pervs out there it would be remiss of me not to mention That Riccis' incredible monster cleavage is in almost every scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first the good news: The flashback scenes starting as tiny dots that grow into little movies in front of flashbacking character was a good idea. The switching of the cameraman's seat at the dinner table was also, uh, ... neat. And the kinda/sorta 3D freeze-frames in the strip bar were also a good touch. Plus it has Yes in the soundtrack.So, the photography was good and I'm partial to one of the bands in the soundtrack. Other than that, all we have is nothing more than just another artsy f**tsy movie that just plain stinks.Holes in the script make swiss cheese look as solid and sturdy as one of the gurders holding up the Sears Tower. I.E. How did the guy know that the random girl he picked up even had a car, let alone that it was parked nearby, let alone nearby as in just outside in the parking lot?I seriously wondered why Christina Ricci's character wasn't taking every chance she had to get away. Two of these chances were the guy's "bathroom break" ACROSS THE STREET and her own "break" at the house, where she could have climbed out the window.What was the purpose of the tap-dancing scene? It had nothing to do with anything.And, let me see if I got this right, a girl who is kidnapped by a complete stranger falls in love with him AT ALL, let alone in less than 12 hours?GIVE ME A BREAK.There are plenty of films that are worse than this, of course, but I still say it's a loser. See it for the sake of having one of the "Name" actors on your screen, but other than that, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more I think about it, the more I think it's odd that I enjoyed this movie. It is amazingly well-acted and is convincing throughout. Christina Ricci was amazing in her performance as Layla, the tap dancer that Billy kidnaps. I never once doubted that she really cared about Billy. When I thought about it, Billy and Layla's relationship vaguely resembled the relationship of Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue in that God-awful excuse for a movie called "Leaving Las Vegas", which is why I'm surprised that I enjoyed "Buffalo '66". The difference, I've decided, is that, because of the wonderful performances, you actually cared for Billy and Layla, where in "Leaving Las Vegas" you couldn't care less about Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue (How exactly COULD you feel for an alcoholic whose only goal was to die and the street whore who fell in love with him?) "Buffalo '66" is not without flaws, as certain scenes get boring after a while, but it was good nonetheless and interesting for the most part. Good ending, too. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this film for a long time, but was ultimately disappointed. The plot was thoroughly original - the idea of Scott Norwood's botched field goal in the Superbowl having such an effect on someone's life was brilliant. The cast was also quite good. My biggest complaint was the dialogue - it was rarely interesting and often way too repetitive. The scene in the photo booth merely covered the same territory over and over for what seemed like an eternity. The same problem existed when he was going on about how he didn't drive 'shifter cars'. A good job of editing could have turned this into a tight, strong film. The final scene in the strip joint was pretty cool, though. One final observation - it was amazing how many quarters Billy always seemed to have on hand for the dozens of calls he made from public phone booths!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely not the cinematic masterpiece that many make it out to be, but it's not a total waste either. Excellent performance by Angelica Houston. She's truly convincing as the mother who doesn't give a damn, and in my opinion is the highlight of the film.There are some clever and funny moments, such as Gallo's character Billy Brown needed to urinate for hours, and being somehow interrupted every time he tries. Equally humorous was the fact that Billy's mother is more faithful to the Bills then she is to her own family.But, the movie moves along so slow, and never really climaxes much. Much of the dialogue is pointless dribble. Ricci and Gallo's conversations seemed to last hours.Unbelievable to me that people would consider this a realistic movie. Ricci's (whom I like, but found incredibly bland in this film) situation with the kidnapper. This is realistic? The guy shows few lovable qualities, but...? It's not realistic, it's a horrible bit of screenwriting.I guess it's worth renting, but just barely...I give it 4 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A So-So Film (2-1/2 stars out of 4)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Buffalo '66": Vincent Gallo's painfully comic deadpan love story about an angry ex-con (Gallo) who kidnaps a young girl (Christina Ricci) from her dance class because he needs someone to pose as his wife when he goes to visit his parents, who couldn't care less about their son. This does have its moments. The whole sequence with his parents is terrific. Ben Gazzara as Gallo's sullen father comes alive for a few minutes during a scene in which he lipsincs to a beautiful Nelson Riddle arrangement of "Fools Rush In," and Angelica Huston is amusing as his easily distracted mother, cursing the day she had to go to the hospital to have her son because it caused her to miss the one Buffalo Bills game they won. But too much of this is just hard to swallow. We learn virtually nothing about the background of the Ricci character; we haven't a clue as to why she would not only go along so readily with this pathetic creep's plan, but actually fall in love with him (low self-esteem?). Consequently, the relationship that develops between them seems contrived (she has several opportunities to escape from this lunatic, but if she did there would be no movie). Ricci plays this cipher of a character as well as anyone could and in fact is often quite charming, as in a surreal moment when she does a tap dance at the bowling alley (complete with her own spotlight). An amazingly dissipated looking Jan Michael Vincent shows up for a few minutes as the manager of the alley. Incredibly, they've kept a locker reserved for Gallo, even though he has been in jail for five years!</fullReview>

At times it can get quite experimental, which of course is the nice thing about independent movies, you can try some different things. You don't have any money for any of them, but you can still try them. Gallo himself gives a beautiful performance of the introvert man with the suppressed rage. The casting of Christina Ricci is perfect. Lots of stuff in this movie is perfect. There's a plot, but it's really not that important. There's this guy who bet on Buffalo, lost and now wants revenge on the guy that screwed up years ago, who has developed a taste for strippers. On the standard road trip, he meets up with all kinds of weird people, period. Buy it, rent it, steal it, I don't care, just watch it. I did the best I could.</fullReview>

The fact he kidnapped Ms. Ricci and she fell for him immediately made "Mars Attacks" look like a documentary, and made me mock the rest of the film. Otherwise, it's a mediocre small movie - a nice try, but very flawed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie with a big reputation and critical acclaim (mostly). Ho hum. Just a barely average movie.The positives first. Um, lets see here... 1. The music was pretty decent (Yes, King Crimson) 2. Christina looks nice, but only has two looks in this movie - "pout" and "gaze". 3. A few funny moments. 4. Somewhat interesting camerawork. Except for the boring parts.Negatives... 1. Hopelessly unbelievable story. Christina's character "Leyla" (but going by Billy's imaginary only-previous-girlfriend's name "Wendy") had many chances early on to escape her loony kidnapper, but chose not to. We have no character development for her, so we don't know if she is emotionally unstable, rebellious against her family, etc. Actually, the fact that she ends up liking the unlikable grimy ex-con loser points to fact that she has no taste, or sense.2. I can not emphasis enough how much of a loser the character of Billy is. He would not have survived 5 years in prison without getting his teeth knocked out and his nose broken because he was such a messed up ass. He needs some serious psychoanalysis ("Hold me a minute" - she does - "Don't touch me!" Give me a break. His fashion sense has to be seen to unbelieved. Although Billy seems to see the light at the end, I doubt he will make any lasting recovery. Bottom line - "Does not play well with others."These 2 large negatives pretty much balance out the 4 positives. It is a professionally-made movie, and the participants seem to be trying, however.Supporting cast of Mickey Roarke as a bookie, Jan-Michael Vincent as a washed-up alcoholic bowling-alley owner, and Ben Gazzara and Angelica Huston as his parents are decent.Recommended for fans of Christina Ricci, or maybe residents of Buffalo. DVD has no extras. Scores generous 5 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Returning home to Buffalo, NY after being released from prison, an excon (Gallo) kidnaps a girl (Ricci) to show off as a trophy girl friend to his parents only to find his young charge is more interested in him than are his parents. "Buffalo 66", Gallo's directorial breakthrough, won some fringe awards and critical nods for its honest, gritty compassion. A bare bones production with a solid cast, "Buffalo 66" is too bleak for everyone as it presents its working class story with such realism as to make working class people shrug and ask "Yeah? So?". However, indie lovers into visceral realism won't want to miss what has been Gallo's best effort so far.(B)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gallo Tries Too Hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Buffalo '66", Vincent Gallo's freshman outing as director, is a close miss. It has a lot going for it. The film has a decent, quirky, albeit depressing, story to tell about a recently released young convict returning to hearth and home in working class Buffalo. There he is reunited with an extremely dysfunctional family and set of friends. To impress his family, he kidnaps a young woman to stand in as his wife. It seems he has told them that he has not been in prison for five years, but has been away on a secret government assignment. I digress. To act in this offbeat story Gallo has a commendable ensemble cast. They do very well, especially Christina Ricci. He also gets points for filming on location in wintertime Buffalo. Bravo! What knocks down "Buffalo '66" is the direction. Gallo tries to hard, employing an overabundance of New Wave, artsy-fartsy stuff. It distracts from the film and gets in the way of the storytelling. This movie's not bad, just not that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo has created an autobiographical movie here, I assume, and I hope he feels better. I certainly don't. Are we supposed to feel sympathy for this character? If that was Mr. Gallo's intent, he has failed. I suppose he intended to show us how bad the main character could get and then show us why he was so bad via the portrayal of his parents. I know many people's parents who were worse than these who turned out just fine. So what is the reason the main character is so rotten? Oh, maybe it was because the girl in the third grade didn't return his affections. This again gives us no reason for the main character, Billy Brown, to be such a jerk. The only saving grace of this movie is the characterizations offered by Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Houston. They play the non caring, unaffectionate parents with dry abandon. Supposedly Billy has finally met his soulmate in Layla played by Christina Ricci. Here again there is no explanation or reason for her to embrace this criminal who has just kidnapped her. Unbelievable ending to an unbelievable movie. There are a few poignant moments when Billy and Layla finally lay together and embrace but by this point the movie has unravelled so that it just doesn't matter anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't too sure about this film at first. I had heard the brown bunny sucked, so I was unsure of Vincent Gallo's talents. Turns out, it was one of the many times I have realized I am an idiot. This is one of the best films I have ever seen. It may have been the best film I have ever seen, had I not seen way too many movies to pick out a favorite. This film is about Billy Brown, an ex-con who was sent to jail on account of the buffalo bills football team. Turns out, he isn't real good at gambling. Anyway, he gets out of jail- but immediately feels the need to go to the bathroom. Desperately searching places to go, he comes across a dance studio of some sort. Long story short, he calls his parents- kidnaps a girl to pose as his wife- and leaves to have dinner. The girl falls in love with him, unaware of his plans to kill the person responsible for his time in prison. Very emotional film, and very well acted/directed/written by Vincent Gallo. I would give this movie 10/10 stars. It was also very inspiring- makes, me at least, feel the need to stop wasting my life and write something. Goddammit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gallo, whoever HE thinks he is, is lost in this film. He wrote, directed and acted in the film and has no one to blame for it's failure. I say failure having only made it through the first 25 minutes before I bailed out. The film has a feel to it until the tenth minute of character Billy's search for a place to urinate. A possible upturn when he meets up with Layla (Ricci) in the dance studio. Then off the edge, straight to the bottom; Billy to Layla, sitting on the front stoop of Billy's parent's house, "Hold me, don't touch me"... Click, I'm off IFC and over to TCM. Maybe the film improves beyond a young, nubile Christina Ricci in powder blue leotards and tap shoes. Maybe it doesn't.

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS* Gallo-you either like him or you don't. His Billy Brown is a patronizing and narcissistic mess of a protagonist. Had I not seen Buffalo '66 on hired DVD in the comfort of my own home, I probably would've walked out of the theater somewhere round the twenty minute mark. And, I never walk out of films. Gallo's Brown is quite simply repugnant, and impossible to tolerate over the film's 105 minute running time. I was distraught when I found that Billy's suicide was only imagined and not real. Truly and utterly betrayed! Ricci is OK, but you can tell she's disinterested. Her Layla is nothing more than a metaphor for Billy's emotional baggage. Weak, very weak. Although the film was moderately well written, and the score complimented the skewed tone of the film, this was a disappointment. Rourke is brilliant and underused as usual. Gazzara and Huston are also excellent. It's as if Gallo needed to liberate himself with this, his most personal film. I imagine him watching it over and over again in a quiet little room, trying to understand and interpret his idiosyncrasies on screen; to fathom who and what he is. Make no mistake, Gallo did this for himself and not for you and I. This is selfish film-making at it's best.</fullReview>

In fact, in typical Hollywood man-centric story-telling, the movie tells us nothing about her character at all!I suppose everybody like this movie because of the wierd camera angles and the fact that they somehow managed to get the rock group "Yes" to part with the rights to one of their songs. OK, I can give them some points for that.

On top of that, I really like Christina Ricci as an actress, but I really question what was going through her mind when she read this script and decided to take this part. She must have really fallen on hard times at that point. The title of this movie should have been "Two Whack Jobs in Love."

		<shortDescription>Good acting and direction can't hide what is ultimately a hollow film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm totally shocked that at the time of writing this review that this film has an average IMDb user rating of 7.3. Huh?? I really can't understand what the majority of people see in this film. Basically, Billy Brown (Gallo) is released from jail for a crime he didn't commit and is intent on getting revenge on the person responsible for putting him in jail. Before he sets out on getting his vengeance, he kidnaps Layla (Ricci) after telling his parents that she is his wife - this is something that he had been lying to them about whilst he was inside. He persuades Layla to go along with his lie and tell them how brilliant he is and how much she loves him etc. After this unnecessary filler, we get a little plot development as Billy makes a call to his prison friend called Goon to try and track down the whereabouts of the person he holds responsible for him being sent to prison. The rest of the film is basically Billy trying to track down the person he holds responsible for him being sent to prison.The main problems with Buffalo 66 (and believe me there are many) is that there are too many things that didn't make any sense or that weren't believable, Like what was the purpose of taking Layla back to his parents house? They didn't stay there, they didn't go there for money. Billy seemed to want them to think he had a wife for some reason. Also Layla had many opportunities to escape from Billy, but chose not to - this is a man that threatened her and was generally nasty to her, but yet she didn't want to leave him. Perhaps this is because she was a bit naive and perhaps she felt she could change him etc, but to me it all seemed a bit phony.The main plot itself was also quite absurd. In a nutshell, Billy bet $10,000 on the Buffalos winning a Superbowl game, but the game is lost due to a missed kick by Scott Woods. Therefore Billy loses the bet, but doesn't have the $10,000 dollars to pay the bookie. So the bookie (played with icy coolness by Mickey Rourke in the 5 minutes or so that he was on screen) tells Billy that the only way he can settle his debt is to testify to a crime that he didn't commit and let the guilty party go free - which he does and gets sentenced to 5 years. He then seeks revenge on Woods for missing the kick and making him lose the bet and for losing 5 years of his life in jail - he also believes that Woods was paid to throw the game. OK - a couple of things; 1) Billy shouldn't have bet $10,000 dollars if he didn't have the money to lose. 2) Why would he only target Woods when Rourke's character was ultimately responsible for sending him to jail? The above reasons make the whole revenge element seem rather flawed.Aside from script issues, the film was also boring and just seemed to drag on and there were many instances where there was just dialogue (most of which was uninteresting) with little to no plot development. The film also lacked any kind of suspense or tension. Also what was the need in Gallo repeating nearly every sentence twice? I realise that this can make characters seem menacing (which it does to an extent), but not in every single sentence - that to me was just overkill.The only positives I can really draw from Buffalo 66 was Gallo's performance (apart from when he was saying his sentences twice). He has a naturally menacing look about him and that helped in making him come across as 'convincing' in his role. Ricci was also good as his 'naive' pretend wife - she was really good at portraying a 'naive' innocent woman who wanted to do all she could to try and appease Billy. The direction and camera work were also pretty good (particularly towards the start of the film).I may have slightly forgiven the dodgy script and mind numbingly boring majority of the film if it would have at least had a good ending, but Gallo doesn't even manage to get that right. I understand the point that Gallo was trying to make about 'choices' but to me Billy's U-turn came out of nowhere and seemingly without any reason - considering how obnoxious he was throughout the entirety of the film.This was an astoundingly bad film which was only saved slightly by the 2 lead performances and fairly good direction, but I still wouldn't waste your time watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Naturally quirky, coming from Gallo, but it held my interest all the way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had recently seen Ricci in "Black Snake Moan", where she is fit and muscular, and wanted to see her in something earlier. Here she is still a teenager, sort of pudgy with no leg and arm definition, interestingly like two different persons. But she is a fine actress in both.Vincent Gallo is Billy Brown, just released from 5 years in prison ("I was innocent") and on his way to see his mom and dad. He had told them he had a job that required his travel, that is why he has been away for so long, and also that he is married. Since none of that was true, he had to do some quick thinking to save face and visit them in Buffalo.The story is set with a backdrop of fans of the Buffalo Bills in 1966, when they appeared to be the powerhouse of the league. Billy had made a losing $10,000 wager on a Bills victory, money he didn't have, and set up the rest of his troubles.If you read a bit about Vincent Gallo's life, things his parents did, his views on women and other people in general, this fictitious story in "Buffalo 66" comes pretty close to a snapshot of Gallo's life. In fact, his 'acting' might just have been being himself, within the confines of the story.Story SPOILERS follow: Billy went to prison by pleading guilty to a crime he didn't commit, as forgiveness of the $10,000 gambling debt. So he spent 5 years in prison intending to get even with the Bills field goal kicker that he believed missed the field goal on purpose, to lose the game, and of course which resulted in Billy going to prison. His plan was to look him up and shoot him dead, then kill himself to avoid having to go back to prison. Can you say "cutting off your nose to spite your face"? Anyway he had to tell his parents goodbye so kidnaps Christina Ricci as Layla from a dance class, and gets her to drive him and pretend she is his wife. The fallout of all of this is Layla begins to actually like Bily, something he never experienced before. And, when it was all said and done, when Billy came upon the old kicker in his stripper club, surrounded by half-naked girls, he couldn't do it. He went back to Layla waiting for him in the cheap motel room. He had found love, and a reason to live.</fullReview>

Why the Christina Ricci character feels any compassion for him is unexplainable and unexplained. This is film-making made on a whim and a wing. There are some well done special effects during flashbacks and a flash forward but they should have been saved for a more compelling storyline. The film feels like a vanity project on Vincent Gallo's part as a tribute to his friends and family stuck in Buffalo. Gallo has a gaunt feral look about him that I imagine goes down well for those who champion outsiders, losers and ne'er-do-wells.

You might think that someone who has just got out of jail might wander aimlessly for a while. Not our Billy. He knows exactly what he needs to find. A toilet! Or a bathroom as Americans like to say. So he searches early and he searches often. Eventually he gets lucky and finds a room with a toilet and a bath. So he has a bath -- in his underpants! Really, Billy, I've heard of a shower in a raincoat, but not a bath in your underpants, please. Billy struts the stage looking like some latter day Charles Manson and every bit the loser. I am no expert on American football, but I think the Buffalo Bills have a similar pedigree. Was it three Super Bowls in a row lost? At half time the film had a lot of potential, but like the hapless Bills themselves, the end game, the big play, just was not there. Billy should try looking on the bright side. If his mother had been an Anaheim fan he might have been called "Ducky". I was waiting for something to happen, which never did, then when it finally did, it didn't. If you know what I mean. An all-star cast does not quite lift this one out of the primeval slime. Although the music, especially "Heart of the Sunrise" in the strip club scene, if not the gratuitous crooning of the director's father, helps.</fullReview>

Huston and Gazzara came across as real Western New Yorkers but Gallo didn't seem to belong to them. Dysfunctional as this family was, Gallo's Billy Brown didn't seem to be their son. That might have been the intent of the casting, but for me it didn't work. I found this to be a putrid production that does a disservice to the City of Buffalo.</fullReview>

The plot might appear slow moving, but underneath this slow motion there is a wave of emotional undercurrent. Bobby is unloved throughout his life, which is so well portrayed by the shocking interaction of Bobby and his parents. The relationship between Bobby and Layla is strange and yet captivating. The motive of Bobby for finding someone to love is clear, but unfortunately we do not know why Layla cooperates with Bobby. She could easily have walked away, but she chose to stay. "Buffalo '66" would have been even better if Layla's backgrounds and state of mind were told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like round characters and the idea of twisted people battling their inner demons. So I admire the effort the main character puts to find himself and come to terms with his failures. This guy has problems like the characters James Dean was famous for. Problem is if a guy treats a girl so bad constantly yelling and ordering her around like a creep, then %9999999 of the times it doesn't end in her falling for him, she would only regard him as a crazy jerk and run away at the first chance. But how convenient that she gets to know the real him, always finding out about his life without him telling her, like the listening to his conversation with his mom on the phone and the object of his infatuation suddenly appearing sitting next to them. These things only happen in movies. Let me tell you folks, try to kidnap a girl and see what happens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumbest Kidnap Victim Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually enjoying the movie until the part where and incredibly stupid ex-con, Billy, kidnaps Layla. It's completely implausible unless you believe that she is just plain stupid. Sure you'd be scared for the first few seconds but then in 99% our survival instinct takes over and you look for a way out...and she had a bunch of em. So her character is either a few cards short of a full deck herself or she likes greasy, visibly unstable, ugly guys.In either case, I was turned off by the rest of the movie. If the screenwriter can't take few minutes to work up a believable kidnap sub-plot then it's not much of an art film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst film I have ever seen in my life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to put this in perspective. I enjoy artistic films. I enjoy slowly paced films. I have enjoyed films across the spectrum. Buffalo '66 is, without a doubt, the second worst movie I have seen in my life. I watched this movie in the same night as I watched the Troma flick Redneck Zombies, and it came as a relief.To sum up. The main character was an idiot, who uses violence to force a young woman to go along with him. The pacing was horrible. The young woman he kidnaps is stupid enough to fall for him. The story is just plain stupid. Overall, this is the second worst movie I think has ever been put to celluloid.The first, of course, is Dungeons and Dragons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really have to marvel at the chutzpa of a writer/director/actor who has another character glance over from an adjoining urinal and then comment admiringly on the size of his penis. Take that as a metaphor for "Buffalo 66". (Ms. Ricci looked wonderfully slutty, and is the only attraction -- even though her role is degrading and stupid.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Ben Gazarra in this and in Happiness, I'm pretty much sold on him being an early warning system for movies I won't like. I found the characters annoying, the plotline as riveting as velcro, and Christina Ricci unbelievable. Vincent Gallo's character reminds me of the type of guy in real life who constantly gets under your hair or in your face or lives in the same state as you, which is far too close.The only scene deserving any credit whatsoever is the shooting near the end. An excellent cinematic trick, but not enough of a trick to make the film worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's worse than ex-model turned actor?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course ex-model turned auteur!This is simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. I almost left after 20 minutes because I could not stand it any more. But I stayed because I could not believe I had payed for this "experience". (Up to now this has only happened to me 3 or 4 times, which puts Buffalo 66 in line with Rambo 3 and Deep Impact) It would be easiest to say what was good about it because then this review would be quite short. OK, for those who don't like reading: Only Christina Ricci was superb. Actually, it really amazed me how anyone could play a character so convincingly in such a sh**e movie. But then, on the other hand, Ricci's scenes were mostly showcasing her talent and - luckily - the other actors chose to step back when she entered.Unfortunately, she could not save this trashy thing which dares calling itself a movie. It is really hard to relate to any character in Buffalo 66. They are doing things they obviously don't have any motivation to do. To all you girls out there - honestly, would anyone of you do what Ricci did for this scumbag Gallo? What's the point of it? Maybe Vincent Gallo just wants to prove that he is so good looking girls do everything for him despite him being the biggest a**hole in the world? With its trashy, no-budget cinematography this film has an almost documentary look. But what is the point in making a completely out-of-this world story look like real life?Add the worst acting one could possibly imagine (even Rourke, Huston and Gazzara are completely wasted), nerve-racking, monotonous, repetitive dialogue, a man wearing the same expression in his face for 110 minutes, the ugliest clothes ever to appear on screen, camerawork a first-grade film student couldn't do worse, and you get something that should not be in this database.Oh, before I forget... I liked the scene in the donut shop. It was almost....poetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good except for one aspect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw "Buffalo '66" around the time that it came out, I thought that it was fairly interesting, with Vincent Gallo as a pathetic man who gets released from prison in Buffalo, New York, and kidnaps Christina Ricci to pose as his wife so that he can face his parents (Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston). If absolutely nothing else, it was one of the two movies - along with "The Opposite of Sex" - that affirmed Ricci as America's indie queen.If I'd known then what I know now, I might have not even gone to see the movie. It now turns out that Gallo is a Bush supporter, and that seems to totally weaken the movie. How ironic that he co-stars with Anjelica Huston, one of the staunchest opponents of the Iraq invasion.So, it may be an interesting story, but the whole movie just seems a lot weaker nowadays. Also starring Mickey Rourke, Rosanna Arquette, Jan-Michael Vincent and Kevin Pollak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having borrowed the film from my flatmates video library and been recommended this by the New Producers Alliance, I discovered that this film could teach me nothing about writing a script for the independent sector, or what it means to have entertainment value. It was purely a mechanical chore spending 90 minutes of my life watching this film thinking that I could do better myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the time I spent checking the shelf at my local video store waiting for this mess of a movie to be in so I could finally rent it, I'm flabbergasted to discover how bad it is. Who has been renting it and why? It starts promisingly, but as soon as the characters begin to talk, the whole thing falls apart. There's not a recognizable emotion or believable moment in it. The acting is uniformly awful. I'm not able to really explain how bad it is, but I liked Jonathan Rosenbaum's review, which can be reached by going to the external reviews link. If you are, like me, someone who heard for years how visionary and unusual this film was, don't waste your time on it. Yes it's unusual, but that's not always a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Huston and Gazzara agreed to this is a mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe they were paying back a friend who recommended Gallo, I don't know, but it was embarrassing to see them in this. They do, I admit, provide the best moments in the film, but that's not saying much. First of all, the premise is extremely unappealing: get a girlfriend by way of kidnapping, hope Stockholm Syndrome kicks in, then stir. I know, fans of this film will try and tell me there's more to it than that, and there is, but the what's "more to it" is equally unappealing, or just plain boring. I kept hoping for it to get better (as I watched a few people walk out). I have also had people argue with me that the strip club scenes were not gratuitous. Well, after reviewing this film in print I watched it again to appease those comments, and I still found nothing redeeming in the scenes. Gallo wanted to film breasts, period. I should also point out that I knew nothing about the filmmaker and had no previous bias against him before seeing this, and actually liked Christina Ricci up to that point. I gave it a chance. Later I found out I was FAR from alone in my opinion of his work, so let that be a warning. 1/2* or D- (Actually lowered after the 2nd viewing.)</fullReview>

The lead character changed his mind, attitude and affections toward Ricci's character mid sentence. I reccomend this movie only if you want to induce depression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've been good w/out the Stockholm Syndome subplot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If they had left out the 1 dimensional Stockholm Syndrome Layla character, I think I could've liked this film. The camera work was interesting. And other than the vapid Layla, the characters were interesting. This guy is so messed up, such a loser it's almost funny. The scenes at his parents house where they so obviously don't care about him and the flashbacks that show how his character have been formed are the highlight.But the fact that this pathetic creature lets him drag her around, belittle, abuse and mistreat her is so utterly DISTURBING it ruined the entire film for me. I kept waiting for her to run away, fight back or even maybe kill him/get him back to jail. Instead she falls for him? Why? Is she just as pathetic and starved for love? Has he done ANYTHING remotely to endear himself to her other than show how deeply pathetic he is (in between bouts of abuse). If he had been less of an asshole or if they had tried to show anything to justify her loving acceptance of victimhood, I might've forgiven the film and enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Reason For the Good Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason this movie has received so many good reviews and such a relatively high score is because this is one of those Internet pranks people play (like The Wrong Pants). Sometimes, a movie is so incredibly bad, a person cannot believe he/she has watched it. So what that person does, for sick humor or revenge, is to recommend it to anyone else so they can share his/her misery. This is one such film. The plot is beyond unbelievable. The characters are so painful to watch, it makes you cringe. There is no logic nor rhyme nor reason to anything shown in this film.This is 2 hours in your life you will be in shock that you have lost. As another reader said, avoid this movie at any and all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is awful. I can't believe I wasted almost 2 hours watching it. Nothing redeeming about it at all. The characters are completely unbelievable. I can't identify with a single character in this film. The plot is unbelievable. I can't imagine anyone behaving like any of these characters in real life. It's completely unbelievable that Layla would allow Billy to treat her in the manner that he does. That she could then find anything to love in him, after he really abuses her is also completely unbelievable. Billy's parents are ridiculous. I simply cannot imagine any parent acting the way that they do. Billy certainly has a pathetic life!</fullReview>
