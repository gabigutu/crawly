		<shortDescription>"The Straight Story" Latino-style...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Historias Minimas" is a simple yet delightful tale, which follows three different people at different stages of their life (young mother Maria, middle-aged salesman Roberto and elderly shopowner Justo) who each doggedly pursue a dream, in a journey that will take them all to the same place.The film, comparable to David Lynch's "The Straight Story", is a joy from start to finish. The cinematography is astounding, perfectly illustrating the barren beauty of the Patagonian plains, whereas the lead actors (particularly Roberto and Justo) give phenomenally realistic and warm performances. Most of the actors are non-professionals, and the discomfort of some of the actors in smaller roles is obvious, but this just adds to the film's overall charm.Most importantly, however, I loved this film as it is a completely uncynical testament to the warmth of the human spirit. In it, our trio are helped along the way by complete strangers who ask for nothing in return. If only it were like that all the time...A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the weirdest and most heart-warming road movie since the Straight Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three people set off on different journeys through Patagonia to the distant town of San Julian. There's an old man with failing eyesight hitchhiking to find his lost dog Badface, an obsessive traveling salesman trying to win a young widow with a birthday cake for his son which he keeps changing to make more perfect, and a simple impoverished woman traveling to find out if she can bring home a prize from a television game show. The minutely observed characters, mostly non-professional actors, are endearing, honest and fascinating with their Argentinean reserve and kindness that bridge the vast Patagonian landscape. Probably the weirdest road movie since the Straight Story and with a feelgood factor that is genuine and unpretentious. It tells of the importance of small events in lives very removed from our own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The trip to San Julian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Argentine director Carlos Sorin scores a triumph with this wonderful movie in which he, working with the brilliant script of Pablo Solarz, take us for a ride into that lonely area of the Argentina's Southern region of Patagonia.If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you should stop reading.The story brings together three lives into play. First there is the old Don Justo Benedictis, who we see at the beginning of the film being tested for glasses. He is at the end of his life, at the edge of senility, but still with a zest of life. He wants to make peace, perhaps before dying with his old dog that disappeared and according to a passerby, it's been seen at the entrance of San Julian, a town 200 miles away.Then, there is Maria, the young woman employed in the local gas station, who evidently is from a neighboring country, perhaps Bolivia. Her best friend comes to tell her she has been named one of the finalists for the grand prize of a local television program. She has an infant and she objects to the trip because she can't leave the station unattended, but her friend insists she should go.The third brief story is about Roberto. He is a traveling salesman on his way to San Julian to see the young widow he has been courting. It's going to be one of her young children's birthdays and he has ordered a cake in the shape of a football. Along the way to San Julian, doubt assaults Roberto. Suddenly he thinks that Rene, the name of the birthday child might not be a boy. What if it's a girl? Since he has the cake in the car, he wants to change it into something unisex. He is directed to the home of a kind woman who helps him change the football into a cute turtle.This is basically the premise of this road movie. The emphasis is on Don Justo, who shows an uncanny sense of intelligence. He has seen a lot during his life. His story is the most tender of the three because we realize he will not be among us for a long time. Thus, his reunion with his dear lost dog becomes so poignant. Don Justo receives kindness from everyone he meets, including Roberto, who happens to take Don Justo in his car during the last part of the journey.Roberto, also arrives at San Julian and finds the widow's house locked. All that traveling, just for nothing! Also, when he sees her return with the children, he sees a younger man with them and thinks all is lost for him. Maria, is seen at the television studio participating in the game in which she will win the top prize, but another contestant will get her to change her mind and give it to her in exchange of a more eye catching gift and money. At the end we see Don Justo at the rear of the bus that is bringing him home with his dog by his feet. We also see Maria with her baby opening the prize she won in the contest. Roberto too, will find out how wrong he was thinking the young widow has a new interest. Yes, at the end is a happy one for all the three people we meet on the road.This is, without a doubt, one of the best films to come out of Argentina in years. We watch people without complications take care of their problems in a positive way. The film is uplifting in that it shows us human situations about people we can relate to. They could have been our neighbors, or friends.Mr. Sorin has extracted wonderful performances from all the people one sees in the film. The best being that of Antonio Benedicto, who steals one's heart with his portrayal of the older man, at the end of life, trying to make amends and be at peace with the world. Javier Lombardo, who plays Roberto, makes a tremendous impression with his effortless take on the salesman. Finally, Javiera Bravo, brings a certain naivete to her role as the unsophisticated woman who is now the center of attention.Watch this excellent film with an open mind, as it will stay with the viewer for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intimate Histories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Historias mínimas (2002), directed by Carlos Sorin, was shown at Rochester's Dryden Theatre as "Intimate Histories." This film is a small, excellent road movie. The road is a well-paved but barren stretch of highway between a small village in Patagonia and a larger city. Four people are traveling this road--a young mother with her infant son, an older man, and a traveling salesman. The young mother is going to appear on a televised quiz show. The older man is searching for his dog, and the salesman hopes to impress an attractive widow with his thoughtful gift of a birthday cake for her son.The stories--and travels--of these people intertwine as they get closer to their destination. Nothing goes exactly as planned, but each character deals with her or his situation in a reasonably successful way.I was struck by the caring and concern that strangers show for the travelers. I wonder if this is a realistic portrayal of life in Patagonia. If so, it may represent the good side of a frontier mentality--nature isn't going to help us, and the government isn't going to help us, so we have to help each other. (In fact, the only non-helpful people the travelers encounter are the television quiz show staff. The implication could be that once you step away from reality and into show business, kindness disappears.)All the acting was excellent. The actors appeared to be amateurs, and it takes a skilled director to bring forth great performances from non- professionals. I want to single out the performance of Antonio Benedicti as Don Justo Benedictis, the older man. Don Justo is determined to find his dog, and the sheer power of this determination (along with a supply of yerba mate) carries him forward.Another reviewer has called this film a small gem, and I agree. It's worth seeking out if you'd enjoy following four people in their difficult Patagonian odysseys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent movie from the most spectacular end of the world, Patagonia, which tells in a slow pace short, unspectacular but very humane stories of every day life: the ways of four protagonists - Don Justo is the most touching old man seen on the screen in a long time - cross in Puerto San Julian, the province capital, which is still just a handful of wind-shaken houses on the scenic coast. Poetic landscape, impressing actors, human touch - a must-see, not only for Patagonia fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a small jewel, that although (Japón by Reygadas) falls in the tendency to focus in the apparently simple thing, routine, non important; it does in such a way that his director Carlos Sorin manages to communicate that what sublimes in our lives is in order counts that, with which we fought every day: remorse's, yearnings, illusions. Acclimated in one of the loneliest places of the world, the Patagonia, it films interlaces three histories, that pass slowly as walking of a turtle (in fact is reference to that animal), but which they show after all the essence of the human beings. Splendid performances of non famous Argentine actors which also is very refreshing. You do not let see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice picture of loneliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In few films the title fits the content so well: Minimal Stories is exactly about that, small stories in which practically nothing that happens takes place outside the people who live them, tiny pieces of their lives where everything that occurs could be told in two or three lines. This movie is not about important events, nothing that could be called big. It is precisely that: a story of the small. The people that appear in it live in a village in South Patagonia surrounded by impressive extensions of flat land, of dust and nothing, as if to sharpen the feeling that nothing being told can be shot by the camera. To me, this is a merit of the film: to make me feel the camera is placed inside the people I see instead of outside. What it comes to show is the wonderful picture of the loneliness of the landscape impressed on them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a puzzle of fascinating characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many commentators before me use the word 'charming'. That's just it. A warm human film, rather focused on the people in it than on the story. I kept being reminded of Kaurismäki. Not only the slow pace, but the poverty, the loneliness, the stubbornness and the engaging warmth and love of the persons are similar. Each character has its 'style' or 'attribute'. Almost as in an 'étude de style', but still the film never ends up schematic. Roberto keeps perfectionizing everything and everyone. Don Justo insists on his independence while being pressed into the 'old-aged senile father-in-law' role, even really secondary personages as, for instance, the concurring player in the TV show or the woman giving the old man a ride, have their really own life. I have seen many films with amateur actors, I adore the way Sorin leads them, not making them play but letting them show us their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, great cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three simple stories, a simple film, and it's wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Apart from the scenery, so reminiscent of the flat boglands of Mayo, the three lightly-connected stories are just perfect. The scene (Cuentame. Cuentame, abuelo) between Don Justo and Fermin is a delicate and touching depiction of confession, understanding and absolution. It is truly sacramental. Roberto's constant anxiety about his gift has the quality of a dream. Each of his clever solutions produces a new problem, and he is doomed always to be frustrated. I could go on and on. This is what cinema was invented for, it's a work of art; and one viewing will not be enough. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I respect films that are not intended to be masterpieces. I consider pretentiousness to be the worst sin of all; but this is not the case. We face a small, charming film in which tiny stories are told about small town heroes. These stories are told in such a crafty, elaborate and detailed way that the audience gives in to emotion at once. The old man (Don Justo) giving a praise- worthy performance, the beautiful landscapes of the Patagonia, the slow paced life of people in these arid regions: they all sum up to render a lovely film concerning lovely people. There´s laughter and tears involved. Wim Wenders loved it, I loved it, maybe you should give it a chance. It will not change your life, but it will certainly make you feel warm,least for an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Historias Minimas' is a tribute to the small stories of everyday life. This movie is about the beauty of simplicity. It shows the spontaneous interactions of ordinary characters trying to achieve small goals that could seem insignificant to everybody else.Some could argue that there is not much of a plot and that the end doesn't offer any sense of closure, but I think that this film was made to give us the opportunity to share with common people with earthly worries and aspirations, to relate with them and realize that small stories are also worthy of our attention .This is a charming, funny, and at times sad film that proves that sometimes less is more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the small letters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the opening scene in the oculist states, 'Historias Minimias' is a film about 'the small letters'. Director Carlos Sorin goes back to Patagonia and with the excuse of a road-movie he articulates a character study of three different types whose stories coexist and affect one another. The cast is almost entirely non-professional and the big close ups that the director devote to his characters are pretty hard to sustain in such circumstances. In addition the film has an overpopulation of landscape shots that seem to be put more for aesthetic purposes rather than to point out the minimalism of the universe of the characters in relation with the physical universe in which their actions take place. The film is relatively well orchestrated and is never pretentious as other contemporary Argentinean films. Of the three stories the one of Don Justo is the most compelling (and gets more screen time too). Still, approaching the climax one cannot help reminding that the whole tension of the film is holding on an old man looking for his dog! No doubt Europeans will love it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wry and affirmative ethnographic essay of Patagonia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INTIMATE STORIES heralds an auspicious comeback for Argentinian director Carlos Sorin after his decade-long absence, it is his third feature film overall where his previous work is a UK-Argentina co-production, Daniel Day-Lewis vehicle EVERSMILE, NEW JERSEY, way back in 1989.The multi-threads story unwinds from a provincial area near the Puerto San Julian in the sparsely populated area of Patagonia, Argentina. Adhering to the road-movie formula and committing faithfully under the cinéma-vérité guidance, Sorin's movie is a quest for love, money and forgiveness, allotted to three major story lines which share the same destination, San Julian.Don Justo (Benedicti), an old man looking for his dog, Roberto (Lombardo, the only professional actor here), a loquacious salesman, brings a birthday cake to a child he has never met, only to surprise the woman he tries to court, and Maria (Bravo), a young married woman, who is lucky enough to be chosen by a TV show to participate in a competition for prizes, hopefully, an all- inclusive one-week trip to Brazil or a food processor. There will be little twists in all these three vignettes: Maria's prize-swapping decision; the reason why Justo lost his dog or in his perspective - the dog left him three years ago; the whimsical attempt of Roberto to make the cake unisex, when he realises he doesn't know the sex of the the birthday child, but there will be another surprise for him. Nothing groundbreaking but thanks to Sorin's unpretentious, beguilingly spontaneous approach, and writer Solarz's keen observation and rumination of common people in their daily hustle-bustle, the philosophy of life is being unhurriedly injected into this lyrical travelogue, which evolves into a wry and affirmative ethnographic essay of the area, plus, the arid landscape of Patagonia itself is presented as a striking character.Meantime, Justo, Roberto and Maria, their life orbits also have their respective convergence, sometimes, they just pass by without noticing each other's presences, sometimes they share a short stint of journey, the connection is always there, regardless of our subjective perception. Performance-wise, Lombardo feels over-stretching among amateurs basically play themselves, and surprisingly Antonio Benedicti, a sympathetic grandfather figure, brings astonishing gravitas in his film debut, his search for the dog "ugly face" is where lies the strength of this humble but scintillating film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Argentine Road Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minimal Stories is a thoroughly engrossing and enjoyable simple road movie where the emphasis is on the characters, rather than the story.Argentina seems to excel in this genre. Three people set off on a journey - each looking to fulfil an expectation - and all end up satisfied. The feel good factor is in abundance. It compares well to similar road movies such as Bombon and Las Acacias, where the directors uses a largely non-professional cast, who in turn give that honest portrayal of simple folk in a landscape. In each case the main character tends to be an old man on a journey looking back in time and observing the younger generation. When watching these movies I am always looking for a political or religious undertone and in every case it does not exist. These are simply great feel good movies and very well made. Well recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small stories that become more than what was anticipated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film about the "little" lives of "little" people, whose stories (briefly) interwind.Now, it may be about "little" people, but they all HAVE a life and things for us to see and even relate to (unlike many other similar movies). Furthermore, most of the actors are amateur locals and they all shine.Mr. Justo is a retired man who suddenly decides to "escape" from home in search of a long-lost dog.María is a very simple and shy housewife who has won a spot on a TV games show. It's very interesting to see how she reacts to being in a (quite small!) TV program, and how the other participants and staff behave in contrast to her.Roberto is a traveling salesman, a somewhat obsessive character who wants to make (and actually goes to great lengths in order to produce) the perfect gift for the son of a widow (one of his clients) he has become love-struck with. This is by far the most lovable character, he's charming, funny, somewhat clumsy and superbly acted by Javier Lombardo (the only professional actor featured.) We will also meet several minor characters (most prominently a molecular biologist who has hit the road in search for her future) who are not developed but deliciously fill their small places.This all happens in the routes and small towns throughout the Patagonia region, against the backdrop of its deserts.All in all, an amazing film, with some great stories that slowly unwind but quickly become more than was anticipated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The world in a grain of sand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A low-key art-house film from Argentina where everything takes place in the context of emptiness - the emptiness seeps into everything and everyone's lives - and small things take on poignant significance. The film follows three loosely connected people who, for different reasons, make a trip from a remote village to a distant town - one of them, for instance, is an old man looking for his long-lost dog. The journey is an opportunity for revealing their little preoccupations, foibles, and dreams. They all verge on hopelessness tinged with a modest kind of optimism and vague search for redemption. The outcome for all three is touching. The film is loaded with good, well-meaning people - that doesn't accord with my own experience of life or of humanity - but I'm a great believer in the richness provided by small things, limited possibilities, circumscribed lives, and that subject matter alone makes this film rare and wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice, but very low-key (Very mild spoiler here)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An appealing movie with a likable cast, "Intimate Stories" could use a bit more plot. The scenery is fascinating (though the cinematographer is too in love with the long shot of endless horizontal landscape), and there are several touching scenes, but there are long periods where nothing of much interest happens. I love quirky foreign movies and I love Latin America (and I loved being able to understand much of the Argentinian Spanish accent, as opposed to Spanish in movies set in Spain), but even I got restless at times as the script simply seemed to be vamping. On the positive side, the movie nicely illustrates the theme that "you can't always get what you want"--- but sometimes what you get may be what you need. Three people travel independently across a bleak terrain to the same town with their own goals in mind. They return home without having achieved (exactly, anyway) what they intended, but with each having found something that might turn out to be better in the long run. Though I gave this movie a 7, I did so only to try to counter those who gave it a 10, which it does not deserve. I'd really give it an 8 for effort and the characters' faces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i must confess i felt a little disappointed when leaving the cinema. i've seen a few brilliant movies from argentina this last two, three years (nueve reinas, moebius, hombre mirando al sudeste) and so, my expectations on this one were pretty high. but, however, thinking the movie later on, i really come to like it more and more. this movie is about the simple stories of three characters intersecting in simple ways, on a very simple landscape. it's very well directed, the colors very well captured with some moments of delightful photography. i feel like this simplified environment is set to bring forth that which is most purely human. the importance of human relationships in life. the need to evolve, create, aspire. the goal not being important, but the process itself being the key as a means to feel truly alive. not sentencing at any moment, it's all put before your eyes for you not only to see it, but to see through it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 Charming and Quixotic Road Trips</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Intimate Stories (Historias mínimas)" has superficial similarities to "Straight Story," as one of the characters is also an obsessed, guilt-ridden, crotchety old man.It similarly shares with "Schultze Gets the Blues" how a casually imparted piece of information can cause a propulsive epiphany that sets the old man off on an improbable quest, as well being part of a tradition of road movies from "Five Easy Pieces" to "Smoke Signals," "The Motorcycle Diaries (Diarios de motocicleta)" etc..But director Carlos Sorin has more social commentary in mind than personal transformations, more like Balzac's "La Comedy Humaine" at the intersections where the "Scenes of Country Life" meet the "Scenes of Provincial Life," at a comparable historical moment where technology, communication and transportation are bringing these isolated environments into contact.Sorin leisurely with subtlety visually and thematically intertwines debut screenwriter Pablo Solarz's stories of three very diverse characters in a tiny, dusty, rural community in Patagonia as they coincidentally decide to follow their dreams to the regional capital of San Julian.In addition to the almost blind old man is a naive young mother and a charming middle-aged salesman. While each one's quest is literally quixotic, they manage to affect everyone they meet, as the foibles and ironies of human nature are delightfully and poignantly portrayed.While the salesman's story is the most predictable, the film is amusing and heartwarming, as well as a beautiful travelogue through unusual terrain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple story, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I felt warm with the taste oh the story, the likeness of the characters and the landscapes of the Patagonia. But, I´m really concerned with the simplicity of the performances, is very difficult to get a good characters, without characters. Everyone in our times wants to make something like this, simple, nice, a rural experience, but also is too dangerous, you should make something very mediocre, so, I don´t know, YES I LIKED but, Hey! It´s a movie, we need a something more limpid. I really enjoy the movie, and i want to discover some of the thematic background, about the story, specially the dog meaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different road movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>three people must, due to different reasons travel from their little town in the poorest region of Patagonia to the near city. In their travel we will watch their life, their expectedness and their hopes. An old man has been told that his dog is there. A tailor travels to flirt with a young widow and takes a cake for her child and a young housewife travel to win a prize in a TV program. All them will see that, usually, things never happen as are expected. this a different movie, with amateur actors, a directing very close, almost all only in close cuts, describing very well the characters and the places they go. They are not heroes nor losers, only, common people who have a little thing different in their routine. The movie is good at this, the characters building, how they are, what they want; However, the story is a little weak, it is only an excuse to show how are they; which makes the film a little boring, as in most of the film anything happens, just they are traveling. I had been told that it war great so I was a little disappointed, it is not a bad film but it is not as good as I expected (maybe I expected too much), it is depth and demands some quietness to take all the profit of it, it's good, but, in my opinion not as good as it is said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long on atmosphere and patient observation but low on energy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Not exactly the most earth-shattering entry from the Argentinean new wave," the "Voice's" David Ng politely commented when the film debuted recently in New York, three years after release, also noting its "abundant wisdom and patient humanism." True: humanism and patience do go together, and this film is notable for its attentive but unsentimental focus. But since the pace is truly glacial and the conclusions are flat you may want to avoid "Intimate Stories" -- unless the mere thought of Patagonia raises your blood pressure. You do get by some kind of osmosis a sense of what it's like to be in this remote part of the settled world, with its bare landscapes and long stretches of nothingness reaching up to the sky along a flat horizon. God was in a minimalist period when He created Patagonia.The distributors sexed up Argentinian Carlos Sorin's modest title "Minimal Stories" by calling them "Intimate," but they're really tiny and evoke film's affinity for the short story. Not a lot really happens here, though we're made to appreciate that in the wastes of Patagonia where the events transpire a little bit goes a long way.The people in "Intimate Stories," only one of whom is a professional actor, seem wonderfully authentic and so do the sometimes seedy, sometimes gemütlich local backgrounds. These include pastry shops, restaurants, a remote compound -- if in Patagonia the word "remote" isn't already redundant -- where men eat drink and play guitars, and the tackiest TV game show you've ever seen (in such a studiously neutral movie the latter sequence seems a tad overdrawn).There are three threads (? la "Amores Perros") involving three people on separate treks from the town of Fitz Roy to the town of San Julián some 200 miles away: an old gent called Justo (Antonio Benedicti) goes hitchhiking to retrieve his lost dog, a young mother (María Javiera Bravo), has won a sweep stake and must be there to appear on a quiz show where she wins something she can't use, and a lonely traveling salesman (Roberto, Javier Lombardo, the pro) drives there delivering a cake to a lady customer whose son or daughter is having a birthday. I hope it's not revealing too much to tell you that when Roberto realizes the child's name, Rene, could be either a girl's or a boy's he has to stop midway to have the cake done over in more gender-neutral style. The luckiest chap is the oldster, who does come home with his pet. And we get to find out why the dog may have run off in the first place. We also learn the salesman's really rather shy and the housewife is, well, perhaps not too smart. There is sadness here, but it is viewed unsentimentally.The filmmaker's previous work made thirteen years ago, "Eversmile, New Jersey" starred Daniel Day-Lewis as an itinerant dentist, also in Patagonia, and is said to have vanished almost as soon as it appeared.(Seen at Cinema Village, New York City, March 24, 2005.) __________________</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly engaging and charming but ultimately too slow and lacking a real conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three people set out on the long journey to San Julian. Don Benedictis is an old man who has spent 50 years at a roadside café. When he is told that his long lost dog has been spotted in San Julian, he sets out to travel the 300km to find him. Roberto is a salesman who is travelling to try and win over a widow with a birthday cake for her son. Finally, Maria is a young mother living in poor conditions. When her name is called out on a television game show she must make the journey to the city in order to try and claim her prize.I taped this film out of interest as I so rarely get the chance to see foreign films (as opposed to American films) that I will generally watch anything when I get the chance. However that is not to say that I do not expect them to match the usual standards I would from other films ? too often reviews are too generous to foreign films simply because they are foreign films. Often the public will also be more forgiving because they have gone out of their way to see the film and don't want it to be bad or even average. Anyway, I came to this film as an open book, with no idea of what it was about. It opened as it was to continue ? slowly, without urgency and with not so much a plot as just a few characters within their own little stories. In this regard it is a road movie but it is one that lacks the necessary qualities to really involve or engage me. The stories themselves are not very well written and are too much about nothing than anything meaningful ? the only story that really gets close is Roberto's, at least that one has emotional involvement as well as an ending. Don Justo's is interesting but quite light while Maria's is just pointless and is to blame for an ending that sees the film just stop rather than end.The cast of amateurs are all very good. Benedicti is sweet and does well while Lombardo is able to convey the emotions and frustrations of his character really well. Bravo is OK but is given little to do in comparison to the others. Outside of these three the support cast are all OK but the flaws in this film are not with the cast ? they are with the script. Direction is good even if it uses close-ups too often: I found myself wondering if they struggled to get more than a minute of footage without a mistake ? hence the close cuts and short edits. In contrast the landscape shots are good even if they have no part to play and only make the film feel like a travel film.Overall this is an OK film that is slightly engaging and charming if you can cope with the lack of real substance and a very slow pace. Of the three stories being told here, only one is actually involving emotionally while the other two are 'nice' (Badface) or pointless (Maria). This is maybe worth a watch once but I have the feeling that the praise lavished on it is more due to the fact that many viewers will not be able to see a film's flaws past it's subtitles.</fullReview>
